<p>The MSM is there for the majority of the public that enjoy conformity of thought.</p>

<p>But you always have a few dissenters and skeptics. So to keep them happy, we have alt news.</p>

<p>Alt news is for those people like things to make sense and would rather know something closer to the truth, even when the truth is unpleasant.  </p>

<p>The deal here is that it&#39;s ok to know a bit more and even to be outraged. TPTB don&#39;t mind if you know a bit more (or even a lot more) just as long as you never actually do anything about it.</p>

<p>tldr; alt news could be seen as a blend of controlled opposition and limited hangout.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all. They want you to think that, but Independents make up 43 percent of the population, the largest group out there. Democrats hold 30 percent and Republicans 26.</p>

<p>Over the weekend wasn&#39;t there something like 15,000 viewers on this sub? If that many stumbled on the truth and got loud about it, we could do something. But between lack of time and fact based resources, we all fall prey to divide and conquer tactics. Even some alt media is using this to divide people. So just like mainstream news consumers, we do nothing. </p>

<p>Read, investigate, verify, compare, contrast, and always be flexible enough to change your mind in light of new facts. That&#39;s the only way to find the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alt news sites are going to have less access to information, less time to dig deep, less interviews with concerned parties, and less cross checking from other agencies.</p>

<p>The big guys like Reuters and AP have far more parties interested in debunking them, and their profitability is tied to a global network of journalists and media agencies respecting their reporting. Lies get called out and corrected more often.</p>

<p>The problems really arise when you can&#39;t specifically locate their lies and thats where alt news comes in. News sources that can risk credibility running stories that may or may not be true, but this grants huge power to ask different questions and explore different stories. AP won&#39;t spend time on HAARP, for example, because the topic has been ostracized. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll never silence alt news because there&#39;s barely any threads between them. When you run any story you want you become a wild beast. The best you can do to control the narratives is run parallel agencies polluting the water with as many preposterous claims as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All this hoopla about Sinclair making its anchors deliver a company-written editorial! But have you listened to the actual content of the editorial? Synopsis: fake and biased news is getting into the MSM but we pledge not to do that. That&#39;s pretty benign. Just worthless TV company claptrap that nobody pays any attention to.</p>

<p>For your consideration: 1. Many local news feature stories are sourced nationally and run with the same or only slightly different wording on many stations. So, this is not something really new, except perhaps for Sinclair specifying exactly how it was to be done. 2. The content of the message is pretty much correct. Watch NBC Nightly News for an example of liberal-establishment bias in story after story. They don&#39;t exactly make things up, they just choose their wording carefully and assume &quot;facts&quot; that are not really in evidence. 3. If Sinclair was known to be a liberal corporation and did the same thing, the message would be seen as calling out Fox News and little or nothing would have been said about it.</p>

Then beginning, I think, in the late &#39;80s or early 1990&#39;s, David Corn began working for <em>The Nation</em>, and Corn also began appearing on TV news shows.  I was completely surprised when I first saw a writer for <em>The Nation</em> actually invited onto mainstream TV.</p>

<p>Corn&#39;s latest book, by the way, is called &quot;Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin&#39;s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>Putin&#39;s war on America??  More like America&#39;s war on Russia.... </p>

<p>Not sure, but I think the great Victor Navasky was no longer the publisher of <em>The Nation</em> when Corn began working there.  By the way, I think Katrina vanden Heuvel is an excellent publisher too -- I always enjoy hearing what she has to say when vanden Heuvel appears on TV.  Not sure how Corn got into <em>The Nation</em> in the late &#39;80s or early &#39;90s.  Would be interesting to find out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s 100% correct that the cabal utilizes alternative media sources to help control the narrative.</p>

<p>That said.  I don&#39;t think they are anywhere close to controlling independent media and are rapidly losing ground in both the MSM and the independent arena.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t stop the truth from getting out right now.  They are just chumming the waters with disinformation so that people don&#39;t know who or what to trust.</p>

Also, with that said, I&#39;m going to point out that the PTB suck bad at making their shills look legit, and the vast majority of us are always on the lookout for shills and reports that don&#39;t quite feel right, so they&#39;d have a hell of time producing a believable alt news shill.</p>
