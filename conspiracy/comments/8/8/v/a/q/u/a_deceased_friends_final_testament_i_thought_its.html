        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;d always dreamt of doing something that would change the world. I despise how humanity is at times, we fight, lie, steal and are greedy and selfish and we are led by maniacs. Maniacs, who&#39;s Decisions and actions baffle me. Yet we, the people, have elected these maniacs to lead our civilisation.</p>

<p>People forget that they are not in charge, we are. We have the power to make the world a fair place, one without wars, one without ludicrous monetary systems and one without exploitation. I believe it&#39;s possible that everyone on this planet can live as equals with a plenty full life, and work together to answer the important questions.</p>

<p>We live in our wilfully ignorant lifestyles. The Influential powers in our world condition us with media, propaganda and distraction so we become timid work horses, too afraid to ask questions. that keeps the elite few pockets lined. It amazes me how people get caught up on pretentious garbage like reality tv. What&#39;s our existence? our purpose? and the true meaning of us being conscious? </p>

<p>Our minds have been led to brand people who ask these questions as crazy. But take a step back for a minute and open your eyes. Even if it&#39;s just for a second, forget about the issues that your led to worry about.</p>

<p>Have your moment of clarity.</p>

<p>See things for what they really are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We the people have <em>not</em> elected these maniacs. Our democracy has been manipulated and subverted for decades.  Yes, we are controlled by propaganda and have been attacked continuously in quiet wars with silent weapons that disarm and numb us. We have been harassed and overwhelmed with busyness and poverty, with materialism and idealizing selfishness, with divisions and suspicions of each other.  The evil in this world collude to undermine decency and peace. We see the growing horrors of evil and are helpless as it is supported by the law and authority of the land.  We are completely disenfranchised of all our country guarantees â€”in name only. No one in power speaks or acts for the ppl, but our God. He is our hope. We are imperfect and prone to sin and blindness. There will always be those corrupted by power. Only a benevolent God can give justice and peace. Let His will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good comment. I didn&#39;t elect any of these people. I bet you didn&#39;t either. In fact, those people who voted the criminals into office, didn&#39;t even elect them. As you said, evil people, organizations, doctrines, have infiltrated and subverted our representative republic into a socialist authoritarian tyranny. The human blame lies on us all for being so fallable and misled, and the human blame lies on those initiated into the mystery schools. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, did you forget the \s? 
Where does the blame lie?  I guess I would have to say it lies with satan. We have been seduced to some degree, but the level of sophistication and insidiously genius ways to trick us into choosing trash are beyond human capacity trickery.  To lie so systematically while portraying complete benevolence is amazing.  We were conditioned to trust institutions and rule of law, while they were completely neutered, and then weaponized against us.  How could we have known?  </p>
