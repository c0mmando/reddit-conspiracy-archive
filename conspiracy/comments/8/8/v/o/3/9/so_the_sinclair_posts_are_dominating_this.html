        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Obviously, I think we should oppose the Sinclair manipulation of the news. But it seems that the normally posted anti-Trump posts have just disappeared. I&#39;m not complaining about it as it is getting old, but it seems really fishy to just die. And then our front page is dominated by the Sinclair story. </p>

<p>So my question is whether the Sinclair story hurts Trump in some way. Does anyone know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Sinclair story hurts the Corporate Propaganda Media more than anyone else. Just highlights the fact that the Free Press in this country is, by and large, dead. All of the mainstream outlets- CNN, MSNBC, Fox, LAT, CBS, ABC, NYT, WaPo...they&#39;re all Corporate Propaganda. And none of them should be trusted at all.</p>

<p>In fact, it&#39;s better to see all of their &quot;journalists&quot; as nothing but talking heads, patronized with jobs by the Corporate masters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious, what sources should be trusted? </p>

<p>Obviously, you have to be careful of bias and look around, but are you saying that all news and investigative reporting from those sources is entirely unreliable and should be completely ignored in favor of blog, youtube and forum sources? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the Truth, or rather a fraction of it, can be arrived at by sifting through all the propaganda. Obviously one shouldn&#39;t completely ignore the Corporate Media, but what they are saying is seldom the unadulterated Truth. See what they have to say to get their spin and talking points. Then see what the other side is saying. Then go to youtube, blogs, and forums. And with all of this information, use your own personal lens of experience to filter it all through. No single source is usually going to tell the Truth- at best they might be trying to tell the Truth with incomplete information.</p>

<p>Most people take everything the MSM has to say as gospel. They don&#39;t question it because CNN, or Fox, or NYT wrote an article and so it has to be true because these journalists must have integrity. But there is no journalistic integrity- definitely not at the Corporate Media level. And sure, they&#39;ll speak Truth sometimes. Just so they can shove a lie down your throat in the very next sentence.</p>

<p>The smaller the media platform, and the more horizontally and less vertically it is organized, the better the platform it can be for the Truth. I&#39;m personally a fan of the Free Press (not just the concept but it&#39;s an actual name for locally run activist newspapers in certain cities) that keep people up to date on activist meetings and local issues. But I wouldn&#39;t trust anything the national media has to say, anything they say needs further filtering through the additional sources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the flip side, it seems too many people put way too much trust in what some random, unqualified people on the internet say just because it confirms their biases. They can rant about anything without hard evidence to back it up. Especially when they have no one to answer to and have an audience that wants 1 perspective.</p>

<p>I can easily trust a solid investigative piece from NYT or WaPo much more than something from youtube or some obscure website. </p>

<p>We had an entire media establishment shaming anyone who questioned Hillary&#39;s health while she was collapsing and being thrown into a van. Obviously relevant to conspiracy theories. Again, not surprising.  </p>

<p>Podesta fantasies. Right. That&#39;s why Tony Podesta resigned from the Podesta Group after it was implicated in Mueller&#39;s inquiry. Fuck it, their God damned artwork. Horrifying shit displayed proudly in their homes. All just a fantasy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will obviously be a lot of people who have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, so I&#39;ll explain. </p>

<p>In this sub and many others, there is a false talking point that has several variations, such as &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is completely controlled by T_D,&quot; &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is T_D 2.0,&quot; anything anti-Trump is always buried in downvotes,&quot; etc. There comments typically come with huge numbers of upvotes, and people rarely point that out.</p>

<p>This sub has always had posts negative of Trump, negative of the intelligence agencies, and negative of the media. There are a lot of people on this sub who want you to think that it&#39;s completely one-sided, and that&#39;s absolute horseshit. </p>

<p>The top post on this sub is anti-Sinclair Media.</p>

<p>The second top post of all time on this sub is anti-Fox News. </p>

<p>In most threads, the people getting upvoted in the comments are the ones speaking out against trump. They usually respond by claiming it&#39;s because the thread made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but we see anti Trump comments at the top of threads that aren&#39;t even the top post in this sub. Notice you never see anyone claim &quot;this sub is a T_D circlejerk&quot; in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don&#39;t exist and continue with the anti-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub.  </p>

<p>Here are a few examples of anti-Trump submissions, of which there are many more if anyone decides to take a look: </p>

<p>Pay close attention to the upvote percentages. </p>

<p><strong>Response to &quot;But this is just <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> doing it, not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Many of them didn&#39;t get to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. I checked a while back using an archive. How did the ones that got to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> get there in the first place? This sub&#39;s core userbase upvoted them. Like I already mentioned, anti-Trump comments do really well in here, and you would know this if you spent any decent amount of time in this sub. Even just looking at this thread would show you that. There are many more posts just like the ones I cited above. If you search, some that you will find are at 5 upvotes, 25, 100, etc. Those are just a few of the biggest examples spanning over a year that I decided to use for my comment. </p>

<p>Plain and simple, Redditors were fooled by others who claimed this sub is &quot;The_Donald 2.0&quot; or whatever. </p>

<p>Here are a few smaller threads that obviously didn&#39;t get to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tribune Media = Obama-affiliated corrupt propaganda factory with ties to the Chicago criminal underworld. If Tribune gets taken over by Sinclair, a company that has some affiliation with Trump, it&#39;s a big loss for the Neolib echo chamber. I&#39;d wager this is probably being promoted by a Dem-allied 527 as a preemptive attempt to poison the well. Not saying that Sinclair isn&#39;t terrible, but by painting the issue initially as non-partisan media corruption, they simultaneously are able to bait the Pro-Trump who&#39;ve been shouting about fake news since 2016, as well as their own base, who are already conditioned towards an adversarial relationship with Sinclair. It&#39;s politics and power in motion. </p>

Somebody or some company wanted the word out to tarnish Sinclair. I asked myself why and after a quick internet search I too saw that they were looking to merge/acquire Tribune Media.
