       If we're talking about Egyptian gods...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the most fascinating, and one of those most closely tied to the Occult, is Thoth, god of writing and magick. I also find the link between writing and magick to be incredibly interesting.

       Amen, or Amun, or Amun was more fully called Amen-Ra.  Israel, Isis, Ra, Elohim.  There's pretty clear lines of belief from Babylon to Egypt to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, relative to your point about Thoth, why do you think they call it "spelling" a word?  Most spiritual traditions speak of the power of the word, especially the spoken word.

       Just think. These are all relatively new Gods in the grand scheme of things. Humans have been around for 150k to 180k years. Modern humans just like us.

       Magna Mater is a very ancient one...or at least the concept. We have venus statuettes going back 40k years. Clearly our earliest cognitive ancestors were obsessed with fertility and childbirth.

       Quality comment.

       But Reddit tells me that millennials cant relate to boomers because the gap is just too wide. And we should all be on the lookout for Russian Trolls because if someone from Moscow comments on a post it is pire evil. They must be a different race of human.

       As Chomsky rightly pointed out, the spectrum of discussion has been limited and nearly all of us follow that like good little soldiers. Keep up the comments that delete deeper, if you're not careful you might just wake up a few folks.

       The blunt truth of history is that all civilizations ultimately fail due to some unforeseen problems that only arose too late in their development to possibly fix and that would ultimately force them to be abandoned in order to form another that would try to correct those and other difficult oversights only to succumb to some other unforeseen shortcomings in that particular approach to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are a still a long way from perfection or creating a civilization that is flexible and adaptable enough to recognise and overcome it's own mistakes when they turn up. If anything, they are ignored and avoided until it really is too late to rectify them and they've spawned a whole host of other problems just as bad or even worse.

       This is important to understand. We
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       created societies that, at their outset, could be able to adapt, change, and predict the coming problems and circumstance. But over time, these very societal mechanism are allowed to lapse or are destroyed from within, and human nature, in its natural tendency to think only of the now, neglects the future and sets up the failure of their own civilization. The problem isn't the form of civilization- it's human nature. And that is something much harder to overcome.

       These are phonetic similarities, not etymological, so there is no connection. It's like saying Jesus is a solar diety simply because he is the son of God and "sun" and "son" happen to rhyme.

       That is the big secret. These are the same gods over, and over throughout history masked. Man was mixed up by language , and religion. That way we could not realize our true history until the time was right.

       Samaritan pronunciation Jabe probably approaches the real sound of the Divine name closest; the other early writers transmit only abbreviations or corruptions of the sacred name. Inserting the vowels of Jabe into the original Hebrew consonant text, we obtain the form Jahveh (Yahweh), which has been generally accepted by modern scholars as the true pronunciation of the Divine name. It is not merely closely connected with the pronunciation of the ancient synagogue by means of the Samaritan tradition, but it also allows the legitimate derivation of all the abbreviations of the sacred name in the Old Testament.
      </p>
      <p>
       The name Jahveh is of Indo-European origin. But the transition of the Sanscrit root, div—the Latin Jupiter-Jovis (Diovis), the Greek Zeus-Dios, the Indo-European Dyaus into the Hebrew form Jahveh has never been satisfactorily explained. Hitzig's contention (Vorlesungen über bibl. Theol., p. 38) that the Indo-Europeans furnished at least the idea contained in the name Jahveh, even if they did not originate the name itself. Dyēus (also *Dyḗus Ph2tḗr , alternatively spelled dyēws) is believed to have been the chief deity in the religious traditions of the prehistoric Proto-Indo-European societies. Part of a larger pantheon, he was the god of the daylit sky, and his position may have mirrored the position of the patriarch or monarch in society.
This deity is not directly attested; rather, scholars have reconstructed this deity from the languages and cultures of later Indo-European peoples such as the Greeks, Latins, and Indo-Aryans.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this scholarly reconstruction, Dyeus was addressed as Dyeu Ph2ter, literally "sky father" or "shining father", as reflected in Latin Iūpiter, Diēspiter, possibly Dis Pater and deus pater, Greek Zeu pater, Sanskrit Dyàuṣpítaḥ. As the pantheons of the individual mythologies related to the Proto-Indo-European religion evolved, attributes of Dyeus seem to have been redistributed to other deities. In Greek and Roman mythology, Dyeus remained the chief god; however, in Vedic mythology, the etymological continuant of Dyeus became a very abstract god, and his original attributes and dominance over other gods appear to have been transferred to gods such as Agni or Indra.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, both gods trace their name back to the same title: *Dyēus ph2ter. With Jupiter, it is more obvious. We have some very old inscriptions where Jupiter gets a &lt; d &gt; in front of his name, Diespiter, for example, which alerts us that the Romans began dropping the /d/ sound. (It may help to mention that &lt; j &gt; in Latin has a sound like English &lt; y &gt; in "yes", not like the &lt; j &gt; in "judge"). You can already see the merger of two older words, "dies-" and "-piter." More interestingly, the "dies-" part is identical to Latin dies "day." Could the two be related? Hint: Yes. Both words come from an older Indo-European word *dyēus meaning "sky" or "heaven."
      </p>
      <p>
       With Zeus (Zεύς) it's a bit less apparent. While nearly all ancient Greek sources write Zeus with a &lt; z &gt;, the oldest of all written Greek is Mycenaean Greek, and they wrote the name with a &lt; d &gt;: Di-we. While the Mycenaeans used a very clunky and imprecise writing system, Linear B, the system is accurate enough to tell us that the "Di" is no accident. Adding to this, Zeus was frequently called Zeus Pater, "father Zeus." So we can see that while the Latins began to use the words father and "dies" together so much that their identities became indistinguishable, the Greeks continued to treat the two words as distinct. Thus we discover that Zeus is cognate to the "Ju-" in Jupiter!
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Greek and Roman examples are the most fun to look at, we can highlight a "Ju-/Zeus Father" in the other Indo-European tribes, and by extending our research, we know that the deity was literally "Sky Father." We can make this extension by comparing all the Indo-European languages and finding a remarkable unity - a remarkable unity that tells us that the religious concept and name stretch back to a very ancient time.
      </p>
      <p>
       English: Tiw (which is the first part of the word tuesday, lit. "Tiw's Day") &lt; Proto-Germanic *Tē₂waz Sanskrit: Dyaus Pita (recorded in the Rigveda around 1700 BCE). In fact, when Dyaus is used apart from Pita, the word means "sky" or "heaven," while Pita means "father." So this is a big clue: ancient Hindu religion and language preserved the original name and definition) Lithuanian: Dievas &lt; Proto-Baltic *Deivas
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are just some examples; a full list would be enormous. By comparing all the different sounds in each version, and by taking time and natural language change into account, we can reconstruct a 'proto' form with relative accuracy. If you learn other Indo-European languages, you may had noticed sound correspondences with the word 'father.' English father sounds a lot like Spanish padre which is a lot like Sanskrit pita and even a bit like Irish athair (note the dropped &lt; p &gt;). Now you know that the similarities are not by chance but by the slow, unstoppable evolution of language

      <p>
       The father of Zeus was Cronus/Saturn . Prometheus the creator of mankind , and his confrontations with Zeus explain most.
      </p>
      <p>
       The age of Saturn/Cronus was the golden age of man. Man lived side by side with cronus-saturn, and the earth gave forth fruit everywhere. It was an age of Bliss. In the beginning was the Golden Age, when men of their own accord, without threat of punishment, without laws, maintained good faith and did what was right. . . . The earth itself, without compulsion, untouched by the hoe, unfurrowed by any share, produced all things spontaneously. . . . It was a season of everlasting spring.
By extension "Golden Age" denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as "guardians".
      </p>
      <p>
       Plato in Cratylus (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble. In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading Titan Cronus.[3] In some version of the myth Astraea also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation Virgo, holding the scales of Justice, or Libra.

       You guys ever consider that polytheistic religions and the pagan Father-Mother-Son gods style was a plot to preemptively distort the truth before it was revealed?  According to the Bible, Satan had all the info he needed to pull off such a deception.  God prophesied his, Satan’s, defeat by “the seed of the woman” (Jesus through Mary) in Gen. 3, directly after “The Fall.”  After the flood, then Tower of Babel, people were ripe for deception.  Limited communication between peoples for a time.  Thus, each group takes what it knew from Babylon, the God-hating (butt-hurt from flood, thus the Tower)/eventually pagan (worship of fallen angels/Nephilim, ultimately, Nimrod and Tammuz) civilization, and adds their own twist to it.  Explains same basic god-hierarchy concept being nearly ubiquitous.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible itself doesn’t support this.  It’s Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  All of which are facets of God.  No feminine aspect.  Well, unless you’re a Catholic (or Kabbalist...), but they’re clearly heretics, a puppet of Satan to make actual Christians look hypocritical, somehow engaging in the same pagan system from which they claim to be separate.  However, God clearly speaks against the pagans, their gods and their practices.
