        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Uber and Lyft in 2016 had 370 active lobbyists in 44 states, “dwarfing some of the largest business and technology companies,” according to the National Employment Law Project. “Together, Uber and Lyft lobbyists outnumbered Amazon, Microsoft, and Walmart combined.” The two companies, like many lobbying firms, also hire former government regulators. The former head of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, for example, is now on the board of Uber. The companies have used their money and their lobbyists, most of whom are members of the Democratic Party, to free themselves from the regulations and oversight imposed on the taxi industry. The companies using ride-hail apps have flooded New York City with about 100,000 unregulated cars in the past two years.&quot;</p>

<p>By Chris Hedges, March 26, 2018 - </p>

<p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/49082.htm">&quot;A 65-year-old New York City cab driver from Queens, Nicanor Ochisor, hanged himself in his garage March 16, saying in a note he left behind that the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft had made it impossible for him to make a living. It was the fourth suicide by a cab driver in New York in the last four months, including one Feb. 5 in which livery driver Douglas Schifter, 61, killed himself with a shotgun outside City Hall.&quot;</a></p>

They do not let you order ahead. Therefore you cannot call at 4pm for one at 9pm. You have to call at 8pm and it could come at 8:30pm or 10pm. With stick no drinking and driving laws we basically have no other choice to go out but to use Uber or lyft. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uber&#39;s company is built upon theft, lies, and malpractice. I have not and will never use their service. I agree that companies like these take advantage of citizens hoping to generate easy, desperately needed income. I&#39;m not convinced that it is the companies&#39; fault for taking advantage of this, though. I&#39;m more apt to blame our failing schools for not teaching citizens to know better/read the fine print, and the corporatism that&#39;s taken hold of our entire government. I&#39;d wager that they&#39;ll be filing for bankruptcy some day soon due to the amount of settlements they&#39;ve had to pay or are currently pending in court. The people are fighting back.

<p>Uber and Lyft are succeeding for the same reason tens of thousands of Americans joined something called The Gold Rush. See  Native Americans  about that, and the additional land they lost by greed. It&#39;s human nature to want to do well and to provide for yourself or your family. And unless the government says no, they say yes. And the government has more often than not,  always greenlighted greed.  See the Glass-Stegal Act about that. And all of this hundreds of years has nothing to do with schools not teaching. </p>

<p>Cab Companies and their employees are being crushed by the perfect storm of opportunism by drivers and customers alike. We live in a &quot;What&#39;s in it for me society,&quot; from the top on down, and nothing will change completely this country, and save it from the destroying and deadly grip of the Pentagon and Wall Street, save  for economic collapse to revolution or nuclear war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The second half of your sentence is bullshit, as is the first half.  You provided some really interesting links, but blaming the schools for failing to teach the citizens or for  the economy, or for any decisions people make as a result of living in a fucked up economy, which includes trying to make a living, makes no sense. This fucked up society and economy is WAY bigger than our schools. We could have the best schools in the world and the smartest people, but as long as we continue living in a fucked up country and society, we&#39;re screwed. Take care.</p>

<p>To compare any other society or economy in the world  with the society and economy of the United States, which is controlled by Wall Street and rapacious capitalism, is absurd. Schools cannot and never will be able to alter the decisions and or direction,  made and taken by multinational companies, Washington D.C. and the Pentagon, which is removing 60% or the nations wealth every year.

    <div class="md"><p>The sentence below was also part of your first comment to me on this thread, but I didn&#39;t respond to it and tell you that you&#39;re full of shit, and that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re fucking talking about, because in my first response to you I was trying to be nice. You have  made being nice  to you an impossibility, and something now that you just don&#39;t deserve, because you&#39;re arrogant, patronizing, poorly educated, and busy yourself repeating  your interminable bullshit that fails to understand the gravity and danger that is our economy and society, by clinging to wishful thinking: That education can change the direction of an Evil Empire that goes by the name of the United States of America, that is destroying everything in its path, including its own people.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;d wager that they&#39;ll be filing for bankruptcy some day soon due to the amount of settlements they&#39;ve had to pay or are currently pending in court.&quot;</p>

<p>This naive and ignorant comment fails to acknowledge the fact  that there are companies in this world that have put hundreds of millions of dollars into  Uber and Lyft, and the very companies themselves have made hundreds of millions and billions of dollars. They are financially sound and will remain so for a very long time. The companies will weather the present storm, chalk it up to growing pains, and your  ridiculous wager will be remembered for the sophomoric and pathetic little thing that it was and always shall be. Ha. </p>

<p>I summary and in leaving, the best sentence in this comment:  You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re fucking talking about. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced that it is the companies&#39; fault for taking advantage of this, though.</p>

<p>If you have failed to understand that it IS in fact the companies &quot;fault&quot;  for what is going on, then you have failed to educate yourself, and you failed to appreciate what  the tens of millions of dollars that the companies have spent in order to pave their way to success in this country has accomplished, and you have failed to understand the very nature of capitalism itself, and it all has NOTHING to do with your sentence about the schools or any of the other shitty reasons that you came up with.</p>

<p>Have a great day.</p>
