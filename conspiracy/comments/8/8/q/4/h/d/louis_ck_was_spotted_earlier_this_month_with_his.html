<p>Note the emphasis on the badge - this is clearly a PR piece masked as chastising Louis, part of his redemption arc.</p>

<p>Calls are already being made to give him a second chance:

<p>Refer back to this post when he claims to have &#39;seen the light&#39; thanks to his daughter. Thanks.</p>

<p>Are you serious? Cause of you are then you are focusing on the wrong powerful people. because there are plenty of actual powerful people who abuse children, women and men, and use their position of power and stature in the public eye to get away with it.  </p>
