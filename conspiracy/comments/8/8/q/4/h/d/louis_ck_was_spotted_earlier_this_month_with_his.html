       Note the emphasis on the badge - this is clearly a PR piece masked as chastising Louis, part of his redemption arc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calls are already being made to give him a second chance:

       There's bigger fish to fry. If it's a systematic issue, go after the power that he to allow "perverts" to flourish. Dude asked if he could jerk off in front of them, they said yes, but later said they felt pressured do to his clout. He sincerely reflected on his action and apologized.

       Louis CK did some bad things that's true. He asked women if they'd watch him jerk off and the people felt inclined to agree because of his status. This is different though than say a boy waking up from being drugged with Kevin Spacey's mouth around his penis.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone is going to forgiven in the public eye it's definitely going to be Louis CK based on his sins.  You're kinda beating a dead horse.

       You're assuming a lot though. The daughter could be wearing it in a public setting to chastise her father.  In any event of why the badge exists, I think that the public eye will probably forgive a Louis CK like all NFL fans that love their family dogs forgave Michael Vick.

       Are you serious? Cause of you are then you are focusing on the wrong powerful people. because there are plenty of actual powerful people who abuse children, women and men, and use their position of power and stature in the public eye to get away with it.

       Pretty sure he actually changed his ways years ago, when he stopped jerkin it in front of women like this, apologized to them, and even went into a self loathing phase of his comedy where it was obvious he was kind of disgusted with himself. Weird you’re acting like he was just non stop jerking it in front of women up until it came to light, and acting like he hasn’t already changed and tried to make amends.

       You don't care about powerful people violating women and getting away with it by cynically using their own daughters?

       That's okay, I'm sure normal, healthy humans do care.
