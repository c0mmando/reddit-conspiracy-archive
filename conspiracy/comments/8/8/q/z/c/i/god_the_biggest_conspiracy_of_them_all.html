       You appear to conflate the original definition, or idea of God with the teachings of religious organisations. The Vedic definition of God is one example, the examples you give are another, others believe God is what makes up the rules of the universe. The issue you have is clearly not one regarding God, but one regarding the people who claim to represent a particular definition of God.

       Not only does the "idea" of anything have to carry with it its implicit cultural baggage (or at least that's what we're taught these days), one idea (like God) must be at the same time just a floating vapor that points to the universe, and an implicit aspect of every believer's daily humdrum life. And that God-Human(s) aspect maps to everybody and everything, including atheists and all other strains of unbelief, if you believe most philosophers I have brushed by. So you are religious, no doubt, just jealous of the certainties of other cults.

       Absolutely. But keep in mind, they're critiquing the globally dominant (and clearly fraudulent if you study history) notion of an abrahamic god.

       I think OP is talking about the fake demigod/Demiurge of the Jews who gets angry, jealous, calls for genocide of the Canaanites, and requires innocent animals to be killed for blood sacrifice cravings. Make sense that followers of this fakester are all fighting each other and the rabbi's and priests are pedos

       Why? We already live in a drugged up, phony disneyland of a world, what's so unbelievable about traditional entheogens possibly giving insight we're usually cut off from? It doesn't take a lot of research to find examples of drugs leading to artistic or scientific breakthroughs, so why can't they be a tool in understanding the spiritual nature of the world?

       Conspiracy? It's just an invention, pain and simple. Made up by countless different cultures looong ago, in an age long before education and critical thinking. When religion was useful as a symbol for people to have something to hold on to. As mankind can be very creative, each culture developed their story of god more and more over time and as a side effect it became obvious that this product could be used as a powerful control tool. And in some places it's still like that today.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all of this is common knowledge by now, there's no secret and no conspiracy. It's an invention. Big difference there.

       The Definition of God
      </p>
      <p>
       To speak of “God” properly, then—to use the word in a sense consonant with the teachings of orthodox Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism, Bahá’í, a great deal of antique paganism, and so forth—is to speak of the one infinite source of all that is: eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, uncreated, uncaused, perfectly transcendent of all things and for that very reason absolutely immanent to all things. God so understood is not something posed over against the universe, in addition to it, nor is he the universe itself. He is not a “being,” at least not in the way that a tree, a shoemaker, or a god is a being; he is not one more object in the inventory of things that are, or any sort of discrete object at all. Rather, all things that exist receive their being continuously from him, who is the infinite wellspring of all that is, in whom (to use the language of the Christian scriptures) all things live and move and have their being. In one sense he is “beyond being,” if by “being” one means the totality of discrete, finite things. In another sense he is “being itself,” in that he is the inexhaustible source of all reality, the absolute upon which the contingent is always utterly dependent, the unity and simplicity that underlies and sustains the diversity of finite and composite things. Infinite being, infinite consciousness, infinite bliss, from whom we are, by whom we know and are known, and in whom we find our only true consummation. All the great theistic traditions agree that God, understood in this proper sense, is essentially beyond finite comprehension; hence, much of the language used of him is negative in form and has been reached only by a logical process of abstraction from those qualities of finite reality that make it insufficient to account for its own existence. All agree as well, however, that he can genuinely be known: that is, reasoned toward, intimately encountered, directly experienced with a fullness surpassing mere conceptual comprehension.

       Religion works, it unifies people under a common group of symbols, then people start interpreting the symbols in a particular way. Inevitably, infighting happens because the symbols are not interpreted "correctly" which causes a schism. So a breakaway cult happens where the symbols are interpreted "correctly" which then grows in number until another breakaway cult happens where the symbols are interpreted "correctly".

       That’s why I have no strong feelings about religion, one way or the other. Reading philosophers’ solutions and discussions about it (existence or lack of God’s goodness, infallibility, perfection, etc.) only makes it worse.

       I understand why people like to believe in a God. What's the point of being good, doing the right thing if there's no God. Self gratification? So without God life is just some pointless waste of time that takes up a huge amount of energy and in the end won't make an ounce of difference. Even if you're Einstein and you split the atom. Once the earth is uninhabitable even Einstein's accomplishments will mean nothing. I pray that God exists and sees my pain and sacrifices but I doubt it. I just finished watching a documentary about the rise of Isis and God didnt help many people there. Civilians getting slaughtered everywhere and their future looks bleak to say the least. Have faith? God works in mysterious ways? Sounds like a lot of bs really. I hope im wrong.

       I was a devout atheist for a long time. I've seen the damage religion can do when wielded as a weapon by the craven and disingenuous. Seen the slaves it can make of the decent and kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now though I have a bit of a different take. Religion can bring together a community like nothing else can. A built in shared reality, something that has been deliberately shattered to weaken us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you live in the states they didn't let you pray to your gods in school but every morning you put your hand over your heart and prayed to a flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I rolled my own religion as a defense against Empire. You see, empires are not real things. Without the state we are just people, communities, families. The Empire is imposed. It's a collection of symbols and it only exists in our heads. It's a false idol we've been taught to worship our whole lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are susceptible to stories. We're religious by nature, we can't help it. We've been turned into and audience instead of participants in telling the story of the celebration of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most devout atheists believe all kinds of things that are religious in nature. They believe it's all just science and hard facts but much of it isn't. It's a world view installed into their minds by our masters. Much harder to reject when you think it's just logic and science.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in some benevolent entity in the sky guiding us. But I firmly believe we don't have a vague handle on the true nature of reality and to rule things out is a very unscientific position to take.

       As several of the comments point out, OP is kinda conflating Yahweh and Lucifer and Catholic Pagan deity with "God."  All those get call God by some big group of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       OPs conflation does underline his main point tho, the conspiracy to hide God(head?) and deny divinity behind institutions and corrupted teachings, knowing man would eventually stray off the path from lack of knowledge/connection to divinity.

       You're assuming that life here is reality. When an eternal being chooses to incarnate, we incarnate into what is best described as a hologram. No one actually gets hurt here. Think of it like this. A mother has a bunch of children, and the kids are outside playing cops and robbers. Why would she care who gets shot and killed in the game? It's all pretend. No one actually gets hurt, they're just playing.

And that off stage (between lives), we are the very best of friends, and that no one really dies and no one really suffers, except in the game. The game is not reality. Reality is reality. And you have the power to express your reality within the game, once you have learnt how to do so."

       God intervenes when a spirit is actually in jeopardy of being destroyed. For example, in a nuclear blast.

        Ra: I am Ra. Those who were destroyed, not by radiation, but by the trauma of the energy release, found not only the body/mind/spirit complex made unviable, but also a disarrangement of that unique vibratory complex you have called the spirit complex, which we understand as a mind/body/spirit complex, to be completely disarranged without possibility of re-integration. This would be the loss to the Creator of part of the Creator and thus we were given permission, not to stop the events, but to ensure the survival of the, shall we say, disembodied mind/body/spirit complex. This we did in those events which you mention, losing no spirit or portion or holograph or microcosm of the macrocosmic Infinite One.

       Remember, there is a reason that ALL conspiracy roads lead to spirituality. And there is a reason that all the major religions demonstrate corruption and refuse to acknowledge reincarnation. The elite use esoteric principles of the

       Where is the conspiracy? If you expanded on the sex trafficking with some little known facts that’d be great, but this reads like some moral commentary you came up with on the ride to work.

       The word "God" has too much incorrect bias attached to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       God is All That Is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Projecting human perspective onto All That Is never results in a realistic understanding of it because Humans comprise an infinitesimal percentage of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jane Roberts' "Seth series" of books, while dry and textbook-like, do an excellent job of explaining what,  exactly,  "God" is.

       I can't see whats going on, but let me explain, god is a phenomenon called
       <a href="https://youtu.be/16W7c0mb-rE">
        Emergence
       </a>
       , is a expression that when one of two things go wrong, it appears. It can be nature that goes disarray, and we can't explain, or it is society that fails. It can be the self, but I would put it in the society basket. When these two things exibt proprieties we can't explain (earthquakes, riots), we express 'the workings of god'. but its not god, it appears as a result. When this two are just fine, but we can't explain, we call it god too.
We must see above the the teachings of any religion, any faith and start to realy see what is going on.
