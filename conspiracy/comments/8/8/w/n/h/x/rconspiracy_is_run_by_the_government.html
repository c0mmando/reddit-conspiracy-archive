</blockquote>

<p>That’s false. The truth can be known long before all of the information is in. For instance, you know the truth that you will die, long before you will in fact die. You don’t have to be dead to know that it’s true that you will die. I could come up with 250 more examples but I am so tired and must sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things were all planned well in advance and we&#39;re being carefully spoon-fed technologies that have been under wraps for many decades until the government was sure they had all their own ducks in a row and could take full advantage of us getting psychologically caught-up with all these so-called indispensable modern conveniences being gradually released that as far as I can see may have made life interesting in a different way than it was say, 40 or 50 years ago but certainly not better in any real way. </p>

<p>The almost complete disconnect with the world just outside anyone&#39;s door is palpable with people walking around glued to and totally focused on their phones and scared shitless about ever leaving home without it or not making sure it&#39;s always charged up before they do and every day there&#39;s more and more &quot;zombies&quot; like that who are physically functioning on auto-pilot while their minds are somewhere else altogether. </p>

<p>In the swamp of information people know more and more about less and less and there&#39;s no sense of priority or importance about what they find or in their own minds about that, for that matter.</p>

<p>Others driving their cars are being told by their GPS systems when to stop, go, and turn to get somewhere across town that no matter how many times they&#39;ve done it they still can&#39;t remember the route because they don&#39;t have to pay that much attention to it and so they never do.</p>

<p>The punishment for getting into any trouble when I was young was to be confined to your bedroom or the house until further notice and all any of us could think about was getting back out into the freedom of the &quot;real world&quot; and extending the borders and boundaries of places that we knew and were familiar with and getting more of it under our belt and knowing &quot;what&quot; was going on &quot;where&quot; to either go and check it out or else to be sure to avoid it on the other hand.</p>

<p>Nowadays you need a crowbar to pry the kids out of their rooms and they spend more time in them than anywhere else in the house when they&#39;re awake... like birds in a gilded cage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just this place that&#39;s curated and censored it&#39;s all over the  the internet in the very same way and for the very same reasons and there&#39;s a lot of shit that gets slipped into reports about one thing along the way to reinforce some other line that you&#39;re expected to swallow whole hog about something else. </p>

<p>TV dramas in particular are positively full of surreptitious asides and references that take the side that they want the viewer to take and have on contentious events in the real world as if that position is a foregone conclusion that absolutely everyone agrees with. </p>

<p>The attempts to manipulate and direct opinions in more suggestive, subtle, and round about ways are literally everywhere and some admirable character in a TV drama whose always right in the end isn&#39;t a reliable source for forming one but that isn&#39;t argued with at the time nor remembered in that way.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not too hard just using reddit&#39;s API to suck every submission and comment in like pushshift or Bigquery does. Then you run your big data algorithms and start sorting folks into profiles from there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just guessing...of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things were all planned well in advance and we&#39;re being carefully spoon-fed technologies that have been under wraps for many decades until the government was sure they had all their own ducks in a row and could take full advantage of us getting psychologically caught-up with all these so-called indispensable modern conveniences being gradually released that as far as I can see may have made life interesting in a different way than it was say, 40 or 50 years ago but certainly not better in any real way. </p>

<p>The almost complete disconnect with the world just outside anyone&#39;s door is palpable with people walking around glued to and totally focused on their phones and scared shitless about ever leaving home without it or not making sure it&#39;s always charged up before they do and every day there&#39;s more and more &quot;zombies&quot; like that who are physically functioning on auto-pilot while their minds are somewhere else altogether. </p>

<p>In the swamp of information people know more and more about less and less and there&#39;s no sense of priority or importance about what they find or in their own minds about that, for that matter.</p>

<p>Others driving their cars are being told by their GPS systems when to stop, go, and turn to get somewhere across town that no matter how many times they&#39;ve done it they still can&#39;t remember the route because they don&#39;t have to pay that much attention to it and so they never do.</p>

<p>The punishment for getting into any trouble when I was young was to be confined to your bedroom or the house until further notice and all any of us could think about was getting back out into the freedom of the &quot;real world&quot; and extending the borders and boundaries of places that we knew and were familiar with and getting more of it under our belt and knowing &quot;what&quot; was going on &quot;where&quot; to either go and check it out or else to be sure to avoid it on the other hand.</p>

<p>Nowadays you need a crowbar to pry the kids out of their rooms and they spend more time in them than anywhere else in the house when they&#39;re awake... like birds in a gilded cage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just this place that&#39;s curated and censored it&#39;s all over the  the internet in the very same way and for the very same reasons and there&#39;s a lot of shit that gets slipped into reports about one thing along the way to reinforce some other line that you&#39;re expected to swallow whole hog about something else. </p>

<p>TV dramas in particular are positively full of surreptitious asides and references that take the side that they want the viewer to take and have on contentious events in the real world as if that position is a foregone conclusion that absolutely everyone agrees with. </p>

<p>The attempts to manipulate and direct opinions in more suggestive, subtle, and round about ways are literally everywhere and some admirable character in a TV drama whose always right in the end isn&#39;t a reliable source for forming one but that isn&#39;t argued with at the time nor remembered in that way.</p>
