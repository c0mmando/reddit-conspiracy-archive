       ss: I think its dumb to see these wealthy people attacking their political Opponents when they themselves are just as guilty. The owner of sinclaire is a dick but he is doing exactly what Bloomberg is doing. Bloomberg has spent 40 million since the florida school shooting to push his agenda. Bloomberg is behind this attack as Sinclair is their rival. Lets call them both out and make changes.

       People are worried about Sinclair taking over the majority of local news organizations in the States and forcing them to run partisan must read scripts, which would basically make most local news organizations propaganda mouth pieces from just one mouth.

       Do you not see the difference between a few major propaganda news sources coming from just a few mouth pieces, and that the majority of people see it either as propaganda or at least partisan, and one propaganda news organization owning a a large majority of local news organizations and forcing them to push out propaganda pieces? Especially when traditionally local news organizations are non partisan and just focus on local news issues?

       No one talks about how all MSM outlets get their 'news' from two sources which are Associated Press and Reuters. This whole Sinclair stuff reminds me of the stink that is #metoo and Weinstein. A bait and switch smoke screen of some sorts. We all know what the true problem in Hollywood is and we all know what the true problem in MSM is.

       I'm not sure how this got turned into a partisan issue in the first place...it's just further evidence that the Corporate Propaganda networks are utterly fucking corrupt. No one should trust a word that CNN, ABC, MSNBC, Fox, WaPo, NYT, LAT or anyone else has to say. They're all Corporate Propaganda mouthpieces, manned by talking heads patronized with their jobs.

       I honestly think uranium 1 was a part of obamas reset with Russia. The reset allowed America to do business and now that the reset was trashed, they are attacking tgose who took part that weren't covered by national security is being an insider. Thats all bull shit. Obama cut Israel off and 4 mobths later all democrats info was leaked and swayed that it was bad. Its all manipulation my friend

       Sinclair owns a bunch of ABC and FOX affiliates. Disney owns ABC and is trying to buy FOX. Disney also panders heavily to the left and has a large stake in Vice media but they're about as liberal as Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a couple different scenarios. One is that the video came out organically after someone saw the repetition in the clips and just made a video of it. The second is that the video was released intentionally to mess with Sinclair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disney could have done it to drop the share price on the stations Sinclair owns, so that Disney could incorporate them but that'd be risky because it could make the public aware that they do the same thing.

       Disney is purely capitalist, same as the other networks. They aren't left or right, that's just a front image.

       All media conglomerates are conservative. One of the biggest lies of our time is that there is a "liberal" media. On social issues, yes, they will keep us arguing, but when it comes to economics, they are all conservative and very much so.

       You want to see "liberal" media? Watch some Thom Hartmann.

       what utter garbage, and I bet I can prove it by your own words (assuming you don't go back on them in 5 minutes): are these media conglomerates capitalistic?

       Just give me us counterpoint, smarty, instead of your "utter garbage" and your preemptive attack upon consistency.

       Here's some help: capitalism is capitalism. Liberalism is liberalism. There is some overlap.

       Bloomberg doesnt reach over 50% of local broadcasters in its network like Sinclair.  Bloomberg also primarily covers financial news.  Sinclair also benefited from the FCC removing rules that limited local media ownership since Ajit Pai was put in charge under Trump.   So not only do they own a majority of local media markets, but regulations have been pulled back allowing them to do things like coordinate messaging across all of their local outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are allowed to buy Tribune, they will own 70% of local media markets.  The FCC doesnt appear to have any concerns.
