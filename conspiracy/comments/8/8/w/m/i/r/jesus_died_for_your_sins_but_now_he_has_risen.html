<p>And lest any true Bible-thumpers amongst ye take this post too seriously, remember, any man born to a virgin mother who then chose to spend a good portion of his life with whoores like Mary Magdalene, any man crazy enough to scrub the feat of lepars, any man who liked booze so much he used his magic to turn water into wine so he could get so drunk he thought he could walk on water while chatting with ghosts and claiming to be the Son of God 
must have had a good sense of humor. So on this day of all days, fellow citizens, it&#39;s ok to crack a joke or two on behalf of your saviour. As long as you&#39;re Jewish, Catholic or especially Morman. (<em>I&#39;m not even gonna go there with the boys that wear dresses and worship a dude who is the namesake of one of the 3 stooges. It just ain&#39;t even worth getting my head chopped off over a stupid joke.</em>) </p>

<p>&quot;This website is designed to spread the vicious truth about the Bible.  For far too long priests and preachers have completely ignored the vicious criminal acts that the Bible promotes.  The so called God of the Bible makes Osama Bin Laden look like a Boy Scout. This  God, according to the Bible, is directly responsible for many mass-murders, rapes, pillage, plunder, slavery, child abuse and killing, not to mention the killing of unborn children.  I have included references to the Biblical passages, so grab your Bible and follow along.”</p>

<p>“God orders another attack and the killing of all the living creatures of the city: men and women, young, and old, as well as oxen sheep, and asses (Joshua 6).  In Judges 21 He orders the murder of all the people of Jabesh-gilead, except for the virgin girls who were taken to be forcibly raped and married. “</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well , if you see that tptb have been pushing for this literal translations since king James you&#39;ll at least be open to analyzing the claim than just residing in prejudice I would assume.  Why do you think the artist forced to depict Jesus etc by Rome occulted so much within.  They used to force this literal translation onto us all.  The. Bible contains recycle myths and attached them to yahesua all the while allegorically teaching you about the mind and our universe . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no such person named Jesus. Nobody wrote of such a man during the time that he supposedly lived.</p>

<p>[“In an earlier article, Did Jesus Exist or Is It All a Myth, I wrote about how it is very odd that we have no eyewitness accounts of Jesus, his life, and his teachings. No one wrote a thing about him during his supposed lifetime. We don’t even have any accounts of Jesus from someone who knew someone who knew Jesus. A Jew, Saul of Tarsus, later known as St. Paul, is considered the founder of Christianity. He changed it from a Jewish sect to a separate religion. He took on the mission of converting Gentiles to Christianity. The only history we have for Jesus Christ comes from the Bible, especially the Gospels. However, the Gospels are not eyewitness accounts and were not written by the disciples whose names they bear.]<a href="https://owlcation.com/humanities/Jesus-Who-The-Historical-Record-Gives-No-Clue">https://owlcation.com/humanities/Jesus-Who-The-Historical-Record-Gives-No-Clue</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think someone with the greek name of Jesus would have lived in Palestine then ?  Have you heard of yahesua ? He did exist. Was followed by many and killed by  Pontus Pilate and there&#39;s record of that. No record of a resurrection but even in the Bible &quot;Jesus&quot; said things like &quot; i of myself can do nothing&quot; or &quot;the things I can do you can do only greater &quot; Did you know the Roman Catholic Church  were anti semites?

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;There was no such person named Jesus.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes there was. Apparently he was capable of some real miracles too. You see Jesus managed to confront the most deadly mass shooter of all time and live to tell about it. Despite the fact that this mass shooter was armed with enough high powered weaponry to equip a platoon of Marines and despite the fact that Jesus was ambushed in a narrow hallway and despite the fact that the mass shooter unloaded something on the order of 200 hundred rounds at Jesus and despite the fact Jesus was unnarmed (he was a man of peace after all) Jesus turned the other cheek and still managed to call the cops. The only injury Jesus suffered was a minor little flesh wound. He talked all about it on the Ellen show. He has since disappeared, but not before suffering for all our sins. Truly miraculous indeed. Here have a look:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Submission Statement: I lied to my kid all day about a big giant bunny hopping into town last night and leaving colorful, hard-boiled eggs hidden around the house so we could all play a game of hide and seek or some shit. Hope we didn&#39;t miss any of those gems cause that shit is gonna stink in a couple days. Anyway, using bad humor to bury the guilt I feel at giving her a basket filled with slow poison in the form of high-fructose corn syrup death treats and blaming it on the aforementioned magic bunny while knowing damn well this day was supposed to be about something spiritual yet, like every other religious holiday, it has somehow managed to morph into another paycheck draining blood suck for the common man and a celebration of profits for corporate America.

I was baptized against my will right around the same time my ever loving parental units allowed a complete stranger dressed like Obi Wan Kenobi to use the forced to cut on my wee wee. Several years later while attending Catholic school, they dressed me up like a ninny and forced me to go through the whole first communion ceremony against my will where apparently some wizard looking dude used his magic to turn perfectly good pita bread into the remnants of a corpse while letting me have my first sip of booze, bloody booze at that. I never did receive my final confirmation ceremony at the age 18, fuck that bullshit, yet somehow, even without going through final confirmation, they have managed to excommunicated me, for making a little joke. Who needs them creepy ass bastards anyway? Not this guy, good riddance. Anyway, guess you and I kinda have something in common. You listening Zuckerberg?!? </p>

<p>I also learned that christening a ship involves a bottle of champagne but christening a baby does not. I promised not to interrupt any more ceremonies.</p>

<p>Not being Catholic, there were many things to learn. Mass cards are NOT Jesus and Mary trading cards. My poor ex catholic wife got so tired of being embarrassed that i stopped getting invited to events. Winning!</p>

<p>On the radio I&#39;d hear about massive Christian burials and wonder why anyone would do this. Finally someone wrote out mass of Christian burial. Oh.</p>

<p>I also missed catholic aerobics. Sit, stand, kneel, repeat.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me started on the Jews. There&#39;s more than enough blasphemy to go around. Although it&#39;s advantageous to write Arab or Hebrew if you&#39;re left handed because they write from right to left, so your hands won&#39;t get dirty.</p>

The one I have now is a beautiful piece and a near perfect incarnation of that model of electric guitar as far as I&#39;m concerned. It&#39;s probably my all time favorite. I hope this one stays with me long enough to pass on to my daughter if she goes that way.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to go ahead and leave that link alone. Agree to disagree, but anger does not only come from self-centeredness. I often find myself self angry at the injustices of the world that have no affect on me at all. Are you saying that I get angry at the suffering and dying of people a world away form me that I will never meet or have any physical connection to purely out of self-centeredness? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m guessing your backtracking a bit on what you said earlier when you stated:</p>

<p>&quot;If you give yourself compassion you start to feel it for others and it&#39;s great.&quot;</p>

<p>Or do you feel it&#39;s possible to have compassion without also having some empathy to go along with it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All due respect, but you seem to be projecting a bit. You know nothing of me other than what I have written from this one little April fool&#39;s joke. I actually like stress, I feed on it. I grew up a skater kid and skiing and riding motorcycles and playing rugby and regularly exercising my physical and mental self to the point of exhaustion. I like feeling worked out and tired at the end of the day. I don&#39;t want to meditate away my stress. I want to embrace it and let it propel me forward. Meditation doesn&#39;t cause my stress and the subsequent cortisol release to subside enough for me. I need to work stress out of my system one way or the other, mentally or physically. My heart is strong from a lifetime of running and lifting weights and exercising and engaging in all kinds of physical and mental activities, but not nearly strong enough. I Wish I could keep up the physical pace into my old age. I sleep best and thus heal fastest when I am properly tired in my mind and in my body, not just dampened down and in denial of my emotions. </p>

<p>I am not one of those people who believes compassion can exist without a little empathy. It&#39;s that little bit of empathy that makes me angry at the injustices of the world. I wish I hadn&#39;t had some unavoidable circumstances in life which kept me from doing more good in my lifetime. Circumstances that given your apparent demeanor I suspect you know nothing about and that&#39;s fine with me. I wouldn&#39;t wish someone such as yourself, who obviously has at least a somewhat peaceful outlook on life and is obviously motivated to try and help others to understand to find peace to understand those circumstances.</p>

<p>Whatever frustration and lack of satisfaction I have with myself in life now motivates me to do whatever I can to give my child a good life.</p>

<p>I think anyone who doesn&#39;t feel anger at the injustices of life on this planet is either not feeling enough compassion or denying the empathy that goes with it. Ymmv.</p>

<p>April fool&#39;s is over with now and so is Easter, so I&#39;ll just wish you well and bid you good night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think mental stress and anger has the same benefits as physical exercise you are wrongly mistaken.   The words and paragraphs you type reveal your mind set and I assure you no matter how you reason or who you blame that you are the cause of your own mental suffering.  Feeling anger is not feeling compassion.  If you want to spread light love and compassion to the world that in your view needs it so, than anger , resentment,and focusing on the failings of the world is not going to be very productive as Im sure you see for yourself already.   </p>

<p>Theres a story of 2 cats that walk into a hole in the wall of the side of a building.
One cat walks out purring and happy as can be
The other walked out terrified upset and angry.
a man sees both these cats walk out the same hole and out of curiousity peeps to see what is on the other side only to find an empty room with a mirror.     </p>

<p>I know you are aware of projection, now focus on how you can be projecting your view of your self onto this world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is saying you can’t say what you want or what you believe. By all means, have at it. But you come off as trying too hard to be edgy and offend those who do believe, like me. </p>

<p>But you see I’m not like most believers in Jesus or the Gospel. Most “Bible thumpers” as you call them would sit here and argue with you and say “you’re going to hell” blah blah blah and try to convince you of your ways and want to “save” you. </p>

<p>Nah I don’t do that. Here’s why. You’ve apparently know about Jesus and the Bible and the Gospels. You are aware of Jesus’ saving grace. It is open to you as it is everyone else. Everyone can make that decision to follow Jesus or reject him. You as it seems have chosen to reject Him. Fine. Maybe one day you’ll change your mind, maybe you won’t. I’m not the kind of Christian Who says “you’ll go to hell...” in you don’t believe. I believe saying that is me judging someone and only God can judge each individual. </p>

<p>So I do what Jesus told His disciples to do in Luke 9:5
“And if a town refuses to welcome you, shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate.&quot;</p>

<p>Jesus didn’t chase those who rejected Him or walked away from following Him. Jesus knew some people who would never believe. Even those who witnessed His miracles. </p>

<p>So I don’t chase or condemn people who openly mock me or Christianity in general. I hope sincerely one day you do change your mind, but I’m not wasting time on you when there are those in the world who do want to hear the good news of Jesus Christ. That’s my focus. </p>

<p>I wish more Christians understood that way of thinking. </p>

<p>Nah I don’t do that.&quot;</p>

<p>Well you did kinda sit here and argue a little bit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing though, you&#39;re not a &quot;Bible thumper&quot; and I would never refer to someone like you as a &quot;Bible thumper.&quot; There is no Webster&#39;s dictionary definition of a &quot;Bible thumper&quot; so I suspect you are using past experiences with people referring to you or people like you as a &quot;Bible thumper&quot; derogatorily and now you are projecting those experiences onto me. I mean, c&#39;mon, besides the fact that it is Easter Sunday and April Fool&#39;s, how much more obvious do I need to make it that I&#39;m joking and making fun of &quot;Bible thumpers&quot; that preach fire and brimstone and use religion to prop themselves up and hold everyone else down. Maybe reread what I actually wrote with a more open mind this time and without fixating on that one little term of which the definition is nebulous. Look at the rest of the words I put down and the fact it should be pretty obvious I&#39;m making fun of all of the major religions at the same time while adding an extra little fuck you to Catholicism (the religion I was born to) for their own history of hypocrisy. Check my submission statement but maybe skip the attached link.</p>

<p>Yes, I gave a jab to Bible-thumpers, not all Christians and not all religious people. Religion can do a lot of great things for society and so can the Bible, the Torah and the Quoran as well as a host of other religious texts. But all these things can also do great harm when people take it too seriously in the wring direction as is evidenced throughout history. Don&#39;t take it too seriously, especially on April fool&#39;s day. You are in the conspiracy sub for goodness sake. A good portion of the people here want nothing to do at all with religion and it&#39;s history of using people&#39;s good intentions and playing on people&#39;s fear of going to hell and using those things to subjegate people, enslave them or even worse.</p>

<p>Have a good one.</p>
