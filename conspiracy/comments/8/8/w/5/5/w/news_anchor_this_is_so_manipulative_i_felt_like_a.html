<p>Then the anchors are supposed to strike a more positive tone and say that their local station pursues the truth.</p>

<p>&quot;Talent should dress in jewel tones&quot; one of the documents says. </p>

<p>&quot;Avoid total red, blue and purples dresses and suits. Avoid totally red, blue and purple ties, the goal is to look apolitical, neutral, nonpartisan yet professional. Black or charcoal suits for men...females should wear yellow, gold, magenta, cyan, but avoid red, blue or purple.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, the reason it&#39;s getting blown up is because this kind of consolidation of local news media, which is then being used to disseminate propaganda, has not happened before.  A lot of people are saying it has, and that all media does this, but have only pointed to cable news, which is one single station, not 80+.  <em>ONE</em> local news station will receive more views than Fox News or CNN, now multiply that by the number that Sinclair owns and maybe you can start to see why this is a big fucking deal.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is &quot;widely known&quot;.  The average person has no idea that one company owns 80+ local news stations around the entire country, and even if they <em>did</em> know, they wouldn&#39;t immediately make the assumption that the parent company forces their stations to push a certain narrative.

If this was an actual 20-30 minute investigative piece on corporate messaging in the media that Sinclair forced it&#39;s stations to run and they ended with this promo, you&#39;d have a leg to stand on. However, it wasn&#39;t and as it is it just comes across as painfully ironic. Even if this was Sinclair&#39;s intention, they just cut their nose off to spite their face. </p>

<p>It’s worse than the Sinclair thing, that’s one company. Journalism as a practice is almost entirely dominated by leftists, many of them fairly radical, and they have this “by any means necessary” attitude.

<p>Brown recently did a study showing in 1960 their journalism program was 4-1 liberal to conservatives. Today it’s 60-1. How the fuck do you think this plays out in the workplace?

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve been seeing this odd narrative that I never even imagined - That just because Sinclair is a pro-Trump organization that somehow conspiracy theorists are hypocritical for being outraged (because you know all CTs are right-wing /s), when the reality is that we&#39;ve seen this exact type of manipulation throughout the <em>entire</em> spectrum of mass conglomerated mainstream media for decades. This is nothiing new, and it&#39;s not just a right-wing media problem, and everyone has the right to be outraged at the entire system for this.</p>

<p>However, if I take off my partisan hat for a moment (I&#39;m a big old lefty) there is quite a bit of truth to what you&#39;re saying.  This isn&#39;t anything new.  It&#39;s actually just an evolution of the &#39;talking point&#39; which is now become so commonplace in all media -- left, right, and corporate, that they&#39;ve nearly become accepted; scripted soundbites leading to scripted segments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post! I think we all got to keep the partisan hats off for this one. This is an extremely well edited video of this type that has penitrated the internet and went viral. But if you search YouTube and other media sites people have edited videos like this for years. It&#39;s been out their forever. </p>

<p>Any and every mainstream media that is reporting on this has been complicit of the same exact thing all along. They should come out with an exposea on why they have gone along with the same thing and tell us real journalism will return, while outting the puppet masters sending the orders in the morning. We know that won&#39;t happen though. But, if the population keeps this in the forefront for more then a minute and holds their feet to the fire then maybe some transparency can reach the surface. I couldn&#39;t imagine the spin control they are pushing right now. I&#39;d love to be a fly on the wall at that meeting.</p>

<p>I just hope for all of our sakes some real change comes soon. Being partisan in politics is supposed to spur debate, not make you hate good people with different opinions over politics. It&#39;s all about division and making 2 good hard working people turn against themselves instead of coming together, understanding we are being played and casting our gaze towards the seldom few that have way too much influence on the majority. All the best buddy.</p>

<p>As a big ole&#39; lefty, I have some extreme solutions for what I personally think is done, and though I&#39;d absolutely be willing to compromise some of those ideas, it&#39;s hard to reach a consensus with the right on the issue who won&#39;t accept any solution that isn&#39;t purely a free market one -- meaning we don&#39;t really do anything about it and hope that people will recognize they&#39;re being propagandized and then turn to good news media sources on their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fairness doctrine like the person that replyed to you would be a great idea. Issues instead of politics 24/7 what a breath of fresh air that would be.</p>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re saying that the GOP doesn&#39;t seem to budge on shit. But the reality is the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are posing as divided but I think behind the scenes they are planning the next peice of theater for the public to eat up cause in reality they never want to pass shit. There is few that truely is trying to call this shit out but they get outcasted like some outspoken asshole. No term limits... I mean think about it. They have a system in place to basically be untouchable when they are in positions that should be the most scutinized in the country. A 5 year old would even say &#39;hold up, this is the way things are run for the most important decisions for day to day life in the country?&#39; </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know where the fuck I am with politics. The words left and right have absolutely no meaning to me when I&#39;m lied to over and over and over again. If someone in my personal life keeps lying about huge things, I&#39;d tell them to I feel completely disrespected and not see that person again. And the Domino&#39;s would fall for everyone else in their life. So why don&#39;t we hold these literal idiots that wield way to much power to the same standard? When the media creates group think 24/7 and cycles news so fast, people that don&#39;t use their critical thinking skills and does a little research cause they know something seems off (extreme political stances constantly being pounded in your head subconsciously) just starts repeating the talking points in that video.</p>

<p>Videos like this and sharing them with people that never sit and think for a second. The ones that hop on Facebook and Instagram while watching garbage and retweeting political shit they really don&#39;t give a fuck about, they just want everyone to know <em>they</em> arnt one of those people against what&#39;s popular. They somehow to be shaken back to reality and fed common sense again. The people have the power in all reality. If we could all stop FIGHTING EACH OTHER and understand this is what they want to assert control it would be a big start. Imagine a world where we cut the left and right bullshit for a bit and just came together cause we all are understanding how shitty Washington has been treating everyone for so long.</p>

<p>Congress and no term limits = complacent, corrupt, lying, lazy, dumb as shit, above the law, arrogent, 25 vacations a year shit bags. When the system uses their energy to persuade the public instead of moving towards common sense and the betterment of life you have the worst imaginable situation that&#39;s so deeply rooted it needs so badly to be exposed completely and held accountable to the highest degree. It needs to happen for our children. Anyone that thinks this won&#39;t affect them or hasn&#39;t already unconsciously is dangerously pushing propaganda they actually would be against if they thought for 1 fucking second. </p>

<p>Sorry I rambled. This is really important is my point. Thier is a valid soultion somewhere cause the people in power trying to decimate free will figured it out. Now cause of how fast we can communicate across the country/world can find the soultion by somehow shaking the shit out of all the ignorance and tell everything tied into fucking is (msm/term limits/lack of transparency/habitual lying) bullshit.</p>

<p>TL;DR .... WAKE UP TO WHAT IS GOING ON IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR LIFE OR CHILDREN&#39;S LIVES. It&#39;s fucking serious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure the fairness doctrine alone or Congressional term limits at all would solve the problem.  Congressional term limits, imo, would make Congressmen even <em>more</em> susceptible to the whims of lobbyists.  <a href="https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2016/10/18/13323842/trump-term-limits">Here&#39;s a good article on the reasons why</a>.  That being said, I&#39;d absolutely be willing to accept your ideas in exchange for a few of mine, for example, returning the regulations on media ownership that existed before the 1996 Telecommunications Act (Fuck Bill Clinton) and some serious campaign finance reform including public campaign financing.</p>

<p>Mainstream Dems aren&#39;t willing to make those kind of compromises though, Progressive Dems aren&#39;t numerous enough within Congress to legislate anything.  Republicans aren&#39;t willing to make those types of compromises either, and they have a base who punishes its members who do try to compromise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I have a problem with and feel free to call it partisanship if that&#39;s what eases your cognitive dissidence: They openly invited the audience to criticize their reporting. They said &quot;And if you don&#39;t like our reporting, please contact us at <em>blahblah.com</em> and let us know how you feel. We value your feedback and we will respond.&quot;</p>

<p>Whenever you&#39;re trying to &quot;brainwash&quot; someone or &quot;drill-in&quot; a narrative, you don&#39;t encourage criticism. Criticism requires critical thought which is the antithesis of brainwashing. Ask yourself this question - Why is this mainly passive message being pounced on by the media?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Televised news was always trying to snow you over with good looks and propaganda.  Even when I was a child I realized how such a medium was inherently dishonest.  If it were honest, it would show raw footage and a text crawl, or footage and a monotone voice.</p>

<p>The bad news is that the internet isn&#39;t much better, and has its&#39; own asinine thought manipulation techniques at work.  People are trained from an early age to lie and cheat even over trivial things, and part of the news is to reinforce that culture of lying.  I don&#39;t think most people can truly hold a conversation that isn&#39;t deceptive, even those that should be innocuous.  I try to catch myself doing it, even though I&#39;m a terrible liar, but usually I, like most people, resign to silence.  This, again, is part of the plan, honesty gets shouted down, the best liars become famous, and communication is reduced to easily digestible snippets that rely on feels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the controversy, but news anchors don’t just go out there and improv. They have producers and directors and teleprompters so of course they have a script. It’s a show like anything else on TV. Now maybe the script is biased, but just having a set of rules on what to wear and being directed on how to present the material doesn’t really scream “conspiracy” or coverup. Every news outlet does this and most YouTubers do the same. It’s called production. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I have a problem with and feel free to call it partisanship if that&#39;s what eases your cognitive dissidence: They openly invited the audience to criticize their reporting. They said &quot;And if you don&#39;t like our reporting, please contact us at <em>blahblah.com</em> and let us know how you feel. We value your feedback and we will respond.&quot;</p>

<p>Whenever you&#39;re trying to &quot;brainwash&quot; someone or &quot;drill-in&quot; a narrative, you don&#39;t encourage criticism. Criticism requires critical thought which is the antithesis of brainwashing. Ask yourself this question - Why is this mainly passive message being pounced on by the media?</p>
