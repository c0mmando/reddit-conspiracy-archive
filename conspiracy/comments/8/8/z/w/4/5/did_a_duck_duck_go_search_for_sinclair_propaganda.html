        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The first time I saw the Sinclair news video, I showed it to a left-leaning friend, trying to show her that both ends of the political spectrum are easily forced to push the same agendas. </p>

<p>She later returned with a NY mag article,  which stated in very unobjective terms that Sinclair is very right wing, in line with Trump. That Sinclair is owned by someone associated with Russia Today,  the Kremlin propaganda machine. </p>

<p>I was immediately struck by several feelings. I didn&#39;t like the matter-of- fact wording.  The article clearly lacked journalistic neutrality. I personally voted for Trump,  though mostly out of hope that juuuust maybe he might at least slow the ushering in of the NWO, through either buffoonery or a genuine love for America. Yet, what if this article is true? That his programs are more of the same? I already knew they probably were,  but still hold out hope. </p>

<p>What I found were about 20 links,  all using the same wording.  &#39;Sinclair is a right- leaning group,  known for this style of heavy handed propaganda, made easier by Trump tax breaks and furthering his agenda. Sinclair is known to be associated with RT, the Russian propaganda machine.  Many of the stations affected,  such as CNN,  despise being forced to recite their biased material. No liberal news outlets face this level of corporate concentration at the same scale. Yet trump complains of fake news,  when he clearly has interest in pushing his own, to an even greater extent.&#39;</p>

<p>Over and over,  every article,  from CNN to Washington post, used the exact same language,  in the same order, almost verbatim. Just what they were berating Sinclair for doing. </p>

<p>It makes for a very confusing news environment. Its all polarizing garbage. Thought I&#39;d share. Be wary of your own biases, especially if you are very sure of your political opinion- they are likely, these days, to have been guided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue in general is absolutely more of an &quot;establishment&quot; problem with the way our system of government is setup and the direction it&#39;s been headed for decades now with the effects of unfettered capitalism spiralling out of control. Both Trump and Clinton were two sides of the same coin...that coin being plutocracy rather than genuine democracy. This isn&#39;t a government for the people by the people. It&#39;s a government for the corporations by the corporations...and the media manipulation is the vessel by which they are able to mostly still keep the illusion of democracy/&quot;choice&quot; in the process.</p>

<p>The fact that you voted for Trump and actually felt he might be some kind of solution to the problem just shows how effective this system can work on the masses. And I mean no offense to you whatsoever by saying that, as I&#39;m sure all of us at one time have been under the spell. It takes a lot of independent research and the ability to genuinely put your own biases aside before you can really start to peel back how these systems function behind the scenes. The recent Sinclair viral video is incredibly helpful for opening more minds, but it&#39;s only effective on individuals who have at least reached a level of intelligence to understand their own biases and have an ability to see beyond the red team/blue team propaganda. Don&#39;t just jump from one team back to the other when you learn about the corruption of one...understand why BOTH parties (the establishment in general) would like to keep you trapped within the two party system regardless of what team you&#39;re on. It keeps the corrupt system rolling.</p>

<p>Having said all of that...to address what you&#39;re saying in regards to the similar language of the articles from different publications. I think this can mostly be attributed to the fact that a lot of these article writers simply use the same sources for information when quickly putting something together for publication. Especially in regards to writing a quick piece related to a viral video for a website. Many of them probably didn&#39;t have/take the time to do a more thorough job researching, and in today&#39;s world of journalism timing is everything. They&#39;re probably being pressed to get that piece out asap or otherwise miss out on a lot of &quot;clicks&quot;/views/web traffic. So it&#39;s understandable you&#39;d see a lot of similar language being used. To me, that&#39;s completely different than what&#39;s being presented in the Sinclair video itself. This video is demonstrating the power of one centralized force/ideology who controls many different channels FORCING all of them to spread a very specific message in a very specific way...no room for independent thought/journalism whatsoever.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a pretty big difference between people of similar ideologies using similar language on their own accord, and what you&#39;re seeing in this video. Though I also think it&#39;s safe to say that what you&#39;re seeing in this video will naturally have that effect on a society of people who are unable to put their own biases aside and think for themselves. More and more people will naturally have the same exact opinions on a number of different topics because they are unaware of their own programming at the hands of a central force. This is why it&#39;s important for our educational systems to adapt to the information/technology age we&#39;re living in today and teach kids about confirmation bias, media manipulation, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if every news outlet gets info from a similar source, like AP or whatever,  and the language is slanted at the source, then even if it isn&#39;t a forceful top-down message push there&#39;s still truly nowhere to turn. </p>

<p>I totally expected Trump to turn out the same as Hillary, as far as what agenda was being pushed behind the scenes.  It was more of an ever so slight hope that he would make it just an ounce harder for them through pure  idiocy, if not true 4D chess genius,   rather than the smooth road to hell that Bush, Obama,  and Hillary were all in on.  But looks like Trump was either in from the get-go, or very easily nudged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all depends on what kind of information we&#39;re talking about here, and what the &quot;slant&quot; is. If the AP article is simply presenting the facts about the Sinclair group itself and their reach/policies, then that&#39;s information that can be verified through other channels of research...it&#39;s not a matter of opinion. If you&#39;re reading from a source that&#39;s putting its own spin/interpretation of those facts, then it&#39;s easy to discern that based on the language used and then you can come to your own conclusions by doing your own research if you feel their conclusions may be misguided.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really not rocket science, learning to think for yourself and understand not only the biases/motivations of sources but also your own biases. Always challenge your own perspective and never allow yourself to become dogmatic in your views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i guess i don&#39;t know if the source was AP or not. But the slanted, &quot;labeling&quot; terminology was essentially word for word in many key sections. Only the filler words that tied those points together into a coherent sentence were altered slightly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well biases/opinions/slants should be expected from most any publications. Presenting your own opinions as a journalist isn&#39;t wrong...it only becomes an issue when you are genuinely trying to deceive the reader in some way through cherry-picking facts or straight up lying. The difference here is that the Sinclair organization is forcing these TV personalities to present their carefully worded propaganda as if it were their own opinions. It&#39;s incredibly disingenuous and deceptive. It would be very different if all these independent news outlets simply shared similar opinions on their own. They aren&#39;t being forced to spew someone else&#39;s propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree.  This is clearly a disturbing video. But I think the end result on the viewer is the same. Saying &quot;Sinclair is affiliated with Russian propaganda machine RT&quot; has a similar effect as &quot;there is a problem with fake news being shared on social networking sites that is dangerous to our democracy&quot;. They are opinions stated matter-of-factly, and an undescerning viewer, which multitudes are,  would not think twice whether or not the statement was fact,  because it was stated as such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the first statement isn&#39;t really a matter of opinion. Are they affiliated with RT? In which way? And is RT influenced/controlled in some way by the Russian government? In which ways? This is all stuff that can be researched independently.</p>

<p>The second statement is a matter of opinion, not fact. And it&#39;s an opinion I would certainly agree with. But the issue isn&#39;t the statement itself, it&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s embedded within arguably an even more dangerous threat to our democracy...the system of propaganda by which the Sinclair group operates. It&#39;s not the statement itself that&#39;s the issue, it&#39;s the extreme hypocrisy by which they make that statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are complaining, &quot;All the media is controlled and scripted&quot; like they&#39;re shocked. The real issue here is not that the media is scripted (that should come as no surprise), but that the &quot;land of the free&quot; moniker Americans live under is complete bullshit.</p>

<p>The media in China is controlled. The media in Russia is controlled. Both of those countries would be considered authoritarian by many. Guess what, the media in America is also controlled. </p>

<p>America imprisons a greater percentage of our population than any other country on earth. One in five persons in prison at a federal level here are there for non-violent drug offenses (including marijuana). </p>

<p>Our country is no different than the other global superpowers, we are all being manipulated by corrupt oligarchs and power families for their own personal financial and political gain. We live under this guise of freedom, yet it is an <strong>illusion</strong>. It is the wool pulled over our eyes, as we march single file to our own demise. We are all but sheep to the slaughter. Most live in blissful ignorance, working for the system (providing wool and milk) until they no longer serve an economic purpose (are too old), at which point they are bled, skinned, and fed to the next generation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are complaining, &quot;All the media is controlled and scripted&quot; like they&#39;re shocked. The real issue here is not that the media is scripted (that should come as no surprise), but that the &quot;land of the free&quot; moniker Americans live under is complete bullshit.</p>

<p>The media in China is controlled. The media in Russia is controlled. Both of those countries would be considered authoritarian by many. Guess what, the media in America is also controlled. </p>

<p>America imprisons a greater percentage of our population than any other country on earth. One in five persons in prison at a federal level here are there for non-violent drug offenses (including marijuana). </p>

<p>Our country is no different than the other global superpowers, we are all being manipulated by corrupt oligarchs and power families for their own personal financial and political gain. We live under this guise of freedom, yet it is an <strong>illusion</strong>. It is the wool pulled over our eyes, as we march single file to our own demise. We are all but sheep to the slaughter. Most live in blissful ignorance, working for the system (providing wool and milk) until they no longer serve an economic purpose (are too old), at which point they are bled, skinned, and fed to the next generation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh. I don&#39;t see my post when I search,  but what comes up is different than it was last night. The Newsweek article is the only one using the exact same wording as all the ones I read yesterday. But several are re-reporting Newsweek&#39;s story.  Many are still using very similar terminology. &quot;Pro-Trump propaganda&quot; is a phrase I keep seeing. Which is possibly an accurate assessment,  yet A) nowhere did the Sinclair spot say anything about Trump,  that I heard,  and B) the way they use it,  it&#39;s clear that they want you to decipher &quot;pro-Trump&quot;= BAD. Yet they were all pro-Hillary, and that was supposedly GOOD.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned,  news is what&#39;s left when the opinions are eliminated and simply facts are reported. ANYTHING else is propaganda. </p>

<p>I personally voted for Trump, though mostly out of hope that juuuust maybe he might at least slow the ushering in of the NWO, through either buffoonery or a genuine love for America</p>

<p>&quot;Whoops.  I accidentally fixed america&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;d be upset that people like you are permitted to vote if I believed that it mattered at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well,  don&#39;t really care of your upset or not.  We all have a right you vote, and vote with our own strength of conviction or lack thereof. I mean,  I actually got up and drove to vote, which is more effort than many people make. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not saying it shouldn&#39;t get people worked up. Just saying the same stuff is going on in every news organization. Almost no news source today can be trusted to be even attempting objectivity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree.  This is clearly a disturbing video. But I think the end result on the viewer is the same. Saying &quot;Sinclair is affiliated with Russian propaganda machine RT&quot; has a similar effect as &quot;there is a problem with fake news being shared on social networking sites that is dangerous to our democracy&quot;. They are opinions stated matter-of-factly, and an undescerning viewer, which multitudes are,  would not think twice whether or not the statement was fact,  because it was stated as such. </p>
