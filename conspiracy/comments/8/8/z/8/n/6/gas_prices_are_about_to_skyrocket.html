    <div class="md"><p>Still no funding approved for the wall, or for any major or minor infrastructure project. </p>

<p>The omnibus budget has some &#39;wall funding&#39; but it was pre-approved improvements on existing fencing in CA i believe and they are just rebuilding a fence. Ain&#39;t no wall. </p>

<p>But clearly, a wall is WAY more important, then something like the Gateway Tunnel which services: </p>

<p>&quot;The NEC is the most heavily used passenger rail line in the U.S., with more than 2,000 trains per day carrying approximately 800,000 daily riders across eight states and Washington D.C. It serves a region that is home to 17 percent of the U.S. population and 97 Fortune 500 company headquarters, and an area that contributes 20 percent of the national GDP.&quot;</p>

<p>Seems like it&#39;s something quite significant, and in no way a &#39;local&#39; issue. </p>

The inflation is simply a means to continue to separate the classes slowly it has nothing to do with repaying any debt.

    <div class="md"><p>the bankers and the fed have made my life easy SO FAR. im 29 ive enjoyed iinternet and TV my entire life. I dont own a cellphone, but i can have everything imaginable at my fingertips....</p>

<p>If you look at it like this it paints the bankers in a positive light, but when you recognize that the financial collapse will be at the banker&#39;s collapse, the realization that the bankers ARE evil becomes evident. Education the sheeple (i like to refer to them as artificial intelligence) on the imminent bank collapse is another story. its easier to kill people than to educate them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cali is digging their own hole for sure.  I&#39;m in construction and had to deal with clean air board and switching our equipment over for the upcoming regulations.  But that isn&#39;t even the craziest regulation we have in the pipeline.  The clean water board has fines coming into effect in either 2020 or 2022, where if you have a commercial property and a blade of grass is watched off it into the gutter, It&#39;s a 20k fine.  A lot of businesses (like in &amp; out) have been retro fitting their parking lots with bio swells.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit of a loaded question, but it&#39;s the regulations being put into place and the engines they are putting into the machines now (Tier 4 Final) that have the issues.  If your a construction firm and now have to use machine that is breaking down all the time, even if It&#39;s a new machine, you can start losing production and money on each job.  Suppose the Government required every own a electric car and the system they use was just made in the past couple years, that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking at.  Even with Trucks, our broker had 3 out of 4 of his trucks catch fire because of the new tier 4 motors they are required to have in their fleet.  </p>

<p>Now even with the water situation, suppose you&#39;re a small mom and pop store, make a descent amount of money to live comfortably, but now you&#39;re going to be required to retro fit your entire parking lot which can cost 100&#39;s of thousands of dollars to keep even a blade of grass from bring washed off your property.  </p>

<p>This is in light of the US Government being the largest polluter world wide.  </p>

It was the same thing with Obama and all his regulations, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard a lot about how awful Trump is for cutting back all these environmental regulations, but if you actually go over the regs that have been cut and the numbers they dealt with it turns out cutting them is absolutely, undeniably the right move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not. No credible non-anonymous analyst is saying anything of the sort. I&#39;m sorry your &quot;source&quot; is the sort of person who offers gossipy faux-insider bullshit to feel important?</p>

<p>Additionally, there&#39;s hardly ever any &quot;mystery&quot; to cyclical gas prices. It doesn&#39;t require a crystal ball. It is based on oil price per barrel, which is somewhat higher this year than last.</p>

<p>Barring a war with Iran -- which WOULD increase prices WHENEVER it would happen, but some dude in the trucking industry wouldn&#39;t know anything more about that than anyone else -- gas prices have no reason whatsoever to do anything other than what they&#39;ve done in past years when oil/barrel prices have been similar: go up by about .25 to .40 cents per gallon over what they were on April 1st.</p>

<p>Perhaps in high-tax places like California, that could get over $4 this summer? In most places, no way.</p>

<p>Anyway:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re pretty used to brutal gas prices in the Chicago area, and thankfully they&#39;re still under $3/gallon generally. It&#39;s been nice to be closer to $2/gallon for a while tho. </p>

<p>But yeah in general it&#39;s tough to have anything but a fuel efficient car in this area, especially since daily commutes are usually pretty high around here. </p>
