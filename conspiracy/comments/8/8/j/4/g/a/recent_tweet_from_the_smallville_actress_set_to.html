    <div class="md"><p>SS who is this lady that keeps popping up relation to recent cult conspiracies.  Before it was considered too extreme or offensive to discuss PG, wasn’t she tied into it somehow?  I remember this face popping up a lot last year. Is this just a simple coincidence in that this lady just has many ties to folks on a spiritual level, but because it seems ‘odd’ to people, is always dragged into the darker meaning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you just made a logical fallacy AGAIN. My point was to prove that a guilty person MIGHT act in the way Trump did. So him firing Epstein is evidence of nothing. Guilty Trump would revoke his membership and so might innocent Trump. </p>

<p>Trump did hang out on his island though and admitted on Howard Stern that he peeped tom on teenagers getting dressed for his teenage beauty pageant. What percentage of teenage beauty pageant show runners are pedophiles? 100 percent?? 99 percent??</p>

<p>And several of the girls said in an interview that he barged into the dressing room to look at them without cloths on and pretended to check on them to see if everything was alright. </p>

<p>His wife also wrote in her book that he raped her even after he paid her a large settlement and had her sign an NDA. Why would someone who is making a false allegation put their settlement funds in jeopardy by writing them again in a book??!?! </p>

<p>And then we are all familiar with the groping allegations which he so infamously bragged about. You have to concede at least SOME of those women did not appreciate the way Trump touched them. There are like 30 women that said he groped them. Maybe some of them really threw themselves at him but Trump is someone who thinks everyone really loves him despite obvious signs of the opposite and he probably misjudged at least several of those women&#39;s sentiment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does the Trump media machine keep dangling a carrot in front his base??? Literally Alex Jones got on air and said Trump was getting ready to indite Hillary LOL. And the FBI is part of the executive branch so Presidents can and have influenced high level investigations.. usually in bad ways. Why didn&#39;t the FBI do very thorough investigations of the John F. Kennedy assanination or 9/11???  </p>

<p>Remember when he got crowds to chant &quot;lock her up?&quot; There is ZERO effort on his part now even though it was implied through his campaign that there would be some high level corruption that was going to get busted. </p>

<p>And btw I am more compassionate than just wanting to see heads roll. But if you are going to believe in this grand pedophile narrative then you have to also concede that it seems like Trump is protecting them now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This person is obviously SMALL TIME. They never go after the ring masters. This is like arresting a 15 year old selling weed to his neighbor instead of the focusing on the actual supplies.. not that the drug war is ethical but it&#39;s an analogy that should be familiar. They are letting these lowlings take the fall.. maybe it even has something to do with Trump because Alex Jones will probably be shouting about it for months. Yet Trump is probably implicated in the black mail practices and was friends with Epstein and has multiple rape allegations and groping allegations as well as peeping tom on underage beauty pageant contestants which he bragged about on Stern. </p>

<p>She&#39;s probably mentally ill so if she has gotten the word she is about to be arrested she decided to tweet a picture of Maria just to cause controversy. Whether there is any actual ties is unknown. </p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t sound like she actually abused anyone at all? What is she ACTUALLY guilty of??!?!? Persuasion??? If you used words to entice someone into sexual activity how the fuck is that human trafficking or sexual abuse?!?!??! That&#39;s some #metoo level with hunt shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but my point was that Maria A. is already infamous and the smallville actress might have just tweeted her picture out as obfuscation to try and get the rumor mill started on the internet. Look at the stir it created in this thread.. that could be intentional and Maria might not even have anything to do with the Smallville actress.. There are many sects and factions. It&#39;s like some small time drug dealer posting a picture of El Chapo because he got busted and is having a panic attack on twitter and trying to spark controversy or rumors.

    <div class="md"><p>Red Herring set up. I used to be very convinced the other way but when i heard someone else read some of the stuff in their tone of voice instead of the guilty sounding one in my head it changed my mind:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OrX0U4qwTM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OrX0U4qwTM</a></p>

<p>The fucking guy was David Brock&#39;s boyfriend. Brock is an infamous psychological warfare schemer. Honestly I wouldn&#39;t doubt his &quot;creative genius&quot; in this way and this might even have been a contingency plan for years or they just decided to take advantage of a group of people&#39;s odd humor. I mean seriously what kinds of monsters could they paint the average 4chan poster as, if they took their shitposting out of context??? </p>

<p>And the fucking guy who went in there and shot the fucking computer??!?!?! I even think he shot the hardrive which would just further ignite rumor. But the real smoking gun, pardon the pun, was that he was an actor at one point and even played a fucking pizzas guy or something. Wayy too much coincidental weirdness and considering it was Brock just makes it more likely that all the worlds a stage and they were setting shit up to discredit some of the real shit in wikileaks and to set precedent for &quot;fake news&quot; censorship. </p>

<p>I mean at the very least there was objectively some level of obfuscation going on and false rumors added to the narrative as a kind of positive feedback loop. I mean there might be some part of it where there is truth but there is sooooooo much manufactured bullshit that it&#39;s impossible to say, and especially when it comes to some of the other lower tier people like hot tub lady and Haitian amber alert woman, I would hate to condemn a fucking innocent person although the fucking amber alert thing is insane. But I think the main people are guilty of SOMETHING it&#39;s just hard to tell what because they are fucking insane genius level masters of disinformation. </p>

<p>I really wish we lived in a more reasonable culture where people could admit they don&#39;t know and at least assign levels of probability like saying yeah there is an 80 percent chance they are guilty but we have to also give them the benefit of the doubt because assuming guilt is not ethical. This case though opened the doors to some of their tactics and hopefully someday in the future more will be revealed.. at the very least the main culprits are scum bags whether they are into fucking and torturing kids or not. And they tried to use this as a power grab like they try to use everything so they are guilty of trying to erode freedom and of authoritarian violence as well. </p>

<p>And the symbols to... i mean it could even be a fucking obfuscation tool that pedophile networks used??? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s rational to doubt the many possible layers of complexity and sophistication. Part of the end goal was discrediting the conspiracy culture and setting the legal precedent for censorship of &quot;fake news,&quot; though.. we know that much. We also know that at one point &quot;they&quot; actively promoted some parts of pizzagate while trying hard to get people to not pay attention to wikileaks, even going so far as to tell people it&#39;s illegal to look at or read. It makes me think that the actual pizza parlor was <em>probably</em> clean and the Instagram account could have been a contingency or just opportunistic resource gathering of a group close to them with very dark humor, which is not uncommon btw. But then again there is just so much spookiness to it... </p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard to assign guilt values over 50 percent. It was a very good primer on some of their nebulous disnfo tactics though and the wikileaks are still a treasure trove. They might just be larping though with the satanic shit but it could even be a layer to their disinformation.. Like we know P**esta even contacted a member of a prominent pop punk band about aliens and there are pictures of him at some kind of occult ceremony.. which makes me think he might be related to someone high up and could be spreading disinfo in order to cover for advanced military craft... OR it really is some real evidence of UFOs but also used for another kind of disinfo?? I mean whatever the motivation of the pop punk band member is.. it&#39;s not being 100 percent upfront and honest with the public. </p>

<p>Ehh it&#39;s like a puzzle.. we are getting more border pieces but they raise just as many questions as they provide answers and the permutations of what really could be happening are gigantic so at the end of the day we have a pretty fuzzy picture but like I&#39;ve already said we have gotten a pretty wide eyed glimpse of tactics and operating procedures. Extremely sophisticated.. truth is stranger than fiction.. and i believe the real truth would probably surprise us so trying to anticipate that is difficult. </p>

<p>And I did answer your question in my &quot;bible.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fucking guy was David Brock&#39;s boyfriend. Brock is an infamous psychological warfare schemer. Honestly I wouldn&#39;t doubt his &quot;creative genius&quot; in this way and this might even have been a contingency plan for years or they just decided to take advantage of a group of people&#39;s odd humor. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;group&quot; and the &quot;this&quot; I was referring to included the Instagram account, but it&#39;s also necessary to include the strange performances and strange artwork. This could be a friend group&#39;s dark humor that David Brock took advantage of. Or it could be a contingency plan that he had been working on for years!!! Or it could be that it&#39;s indicative of people who harbor pedophilia and torture fetishes. Or, IT COULD BE A COMBINATION, because life is hardly simple like that and usually <strong>truth is stranger than fiction.</strong> That &quot;strangeness&quot; is the complex web like relationships that all these things have together. <strong>There are usually no smoking guns.</strong></p>

<p>And if you doubt the dark humor explanation just go to fucking 4chan or 8chan and take note of all the shitposting. Pro tip, 90 percent of it is done in jest. And I am pretty sure that if the NSA wanted to, it could take anyone&#39;s text conversation jokes out of context and frame them as a monster. The instagram account was pictures and tied to a business but it still could be similar dark humor and they might serve mostly hipsters as their patrons.  </p>

<p>Excuse me if this sounds creepy but i had a tiny gander at your post history and it&#39;s easy to see how someone could frame you as something awful if they took some choice words out of context. This could be part of what happened in PG. The point though is that it&#39;s irrational to underestimate David Brock&#39;s complexity and &quot;genius.&quot; The man was the head of one of the most professional trolling companies in the world... he is what we call a master troll and his boyfriend was at the center of PG which is no fucking coincidence. </p>

<p>That is you buddy. If you actually fucking read what I wrote it&#39;s obvious that I am keeping an open mind, but I also highly value presumption of innocence. </p>

<p>Those pics really could be just a dark sense of humor.. or even a setup Brock had been working on for years as he was dating him. If I had to pick one pic that was the most coincidental it would be the &quot;chickenfucker&quot; one or whatever the pedo code word was. Tbqh though, singling out any of those pieces of circumstantial evidence is irrational  because it&#39;s only when they are put together that they become suspect at all.. like with the creepy artwork on the walls and stuff like that. But even then it could be a really dark quirky inside joke between him and his gay buddies. I mean honestly there are jokes a lot more &quot;disturbing&quot; on 4chan right now, although yes there have been actually truly fucked up people there to, but my point is most people who post dark humor are not actually committing some violent unspeakable act. </p>

<p>Also did you catch the Instragram pic where he called that Satanic performance artist a faggot?? I think that sums up his humor best. Although like i said, we don&#39;t really know 100 percent and obviously the most important contextual clue is that he dated the leader of CRT who is a real troll mastermind. And we can learn a lot from the whole thing even if none of the people who were implicated are guilty of what people think they are guilty of. </p>

<p>Why are you so obsessed with me giving you an opinion about the instragram pictures though??? </p>

<p><strong>And can you admit that it would be very hard to admit you got fooled something that was just an elaborate troll and that could be influencing your bias??</strong></p>

<p>And you really should watch that &quot;PG debunked&quot; video because hearing someone read that stuff in a different tone of voice is really eye opening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NO you are wrong. I have combed through those pictures MANY times. I was obsessed with this when it first came out and for a few months after. Initially I was so convinced they were guilty but then as I looked into it more and had the rationality to challenge my biases, my view changed. There are other &quot;disturbing&quot; pictures but go on fucking 4chan right now.. they have been joking about the youtube shooters, calling her their &quot;waifu&quot; for the last 12 hours or so. Is that not disturbing also?? We can&#39;t start burning people at the stake for having a dark sense of humor!! You want to live in a world like that?!!??! And I believe the most likely scenario with the shooter was that he was an actor and the shot in the hard drive was wayyyyyyyy to obvious and meant to stir up controversy. In fact the shot placement was right at the hard drive.. totally unlikely for that to be an organic shooting. The fucking guy had an IMDB page which was SCRUBBED and he had a fucking previous roll as a pizza guy. All characteristic of CRT. </p>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s absolutely reasonable. I have basically the same opinion. The reason I feel so strongly about this is that I believe Presumption of Innocence is such an important virtue and something that is becoming rarer and rarer in our culture. Btw in practice (not in a legal conviction context) &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; means &quot;suspicious until proven guilty&quot; but the emphasis needs to be put on giving people <em>some</em> benefit of the doubt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the dems are probably the biggest scumbags in their personal lives and how the peddle authoritarianism to vulnerable people like welfare recipients. I&#39;m most interested in protecting random individuals, like perhaps the shop employees, or relatives of those people who got swept up in this and have had personal distress from people <strong>assuming</strong> they are guilty. Remember the idiom about &quot;assume,&quot; it makes an &quot;ass&quot; out of &quot;u&quot; and &quot;me?&quot; And even scummy authoritarian politicians deserve to not be condemned of horrific crimes when there is not direct proof of it. I&#39;m okay with people being suspicious but you have to acknowledge the doubt <strong>admit</strong> that you really do not know. Otherwise you are contributing to this violent with hunt culture with false rape allegations and doxxing and what not. </p>

<p>Notice how the opposite poles of the political spectrum treat pedophile allegations and rape accusations?? Alt-righters usually defend random white guys accused of rape yet will condemn people for pedophilia suspicion while neoliberals will condemn anyone who has been accused of rape and defend pedophilia itself even or at least completely reject pedophilia allegations in politics. Of course the real truth is that no one really knows unless presented with direct evidence or a true preponderance of circumstantial evidence like in the Cosby Case, but saying &quot;where there is smoke there is fire&quot; is a slippery slope and if you condemn people based on that you will inevitably condemn some innocent people because of the inherent errors in that logic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An investigation itself is a punishment. Look at the guy who taught his dog a nazi solute. The fear of being <em>accused</em> is enough to suppress expression and create paranoia. If you start some hardcore investigations, especially with public access, about people making dirty jokes on instagram that would cause a major reduction in the freedom of speech and artistic expression! Anyway, I am sure <em>somebody</em> has glanced  at their internet history in the NSA but even that is unethical in many ways, and people shouldn&#39;t even be opening themselves up to that kind of vulnerability. </p>
