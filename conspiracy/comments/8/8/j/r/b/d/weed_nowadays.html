       So I've been smoking weed regularly (almost everyday) for about 3-4 years now and I've never had issues with paranoia or anxiety, however a few months ago I noticed an increased heartrate and a weird feeling in my stomach. This only happens when I'm smoking. I am wondering if its the weed I'm smoking (which is very potent and kushy, would put a lightweight on their ass) or something else. I'm wondering if it's the new GMO weed that I'm smoking or something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there any articles or studies about marijuana recently?
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed just isn't the same anymore I guess.

       Different types have different effects with higher and lower concentrations of THC and CBD.

       There may be mold or lingering pesticides on the bud.  Is it dispensary or street weed?  I assume GMO weed would only be through a dispensary and would be advertised as such...?

       Sativa strains will lend more to an anxious experience, more so than indica. If your purchasing sealed products from a legitimate vendor, you'll be able to pinpoint the appropriate blend for a favorable smoke session.

       it's actually exactly the opposite.  sativa usually has a lower percentage of thc and is marketed as having more of a "body-high" than indica.

       That is not correct.  Indica is the "body high", Sativa is usually more cerebral, increased heart rate and for many people can be what causes paranoia.  I personally prefer a sativa strain or a sativa dominate hybrid, especially during the daytime.  Indica is defiantly body high "couch lock" strain and probably better for people with anxiety issues.

       +1 Yep, coincidentally I also use 'couch' as I remembered early on that when I feel 'locked in' the couch, its 'in'dica. Always thought it was just something I said but I must of picked up.  Some Indica can put you out, make you non-talkative and super sleepy.

       Make sure you take note of the strains that cause this for you and don't use those.  Stick with indicas which will make you less wired.

       You need to look into the various strains and the distribution of active compounds. We got legal weed in vegas now, and everything is assayed for active compounds so you know what you are getting into. I dont think I could buy weed from a dealer on the street anymore.
      </p>

       Research the compounds. I will look around for a good resource.

       Most people only know THC, more people are familiarizing themselves with CBD, but there's also CBA, CBN, and a handful of other canabanoids in weed. With all the variety nowadays, and advances in growing methods, messing with these ratios could mean different people react differently.

       Have you heard of cannabis hypermesis syndrome? I saw a PA-C who said she worked with a doctor who was studying it. They believe it is caused by a buildup of azadirachtin in your body, which is a pesticide sprayed on the plant, and not exactly caused by the cannabis itself. Itâs best to grow your own batch, or find a responsible grower. Stay safe.

       I do not have any information linking the two right now. I was diagnosed with CHS and Cyclic vomiting after I switched growers. I threw up so hard I tore my esophagus. The PA at the ER gave me the info, and told me to grow my own weed or stop altogether. I couldnât find shit online either, but I took her word for it. I have since switched to my original grower and havenât had an episode since. I have smoked everyday for fourteen years and the first time I got sick was immediately after I switched growers the first time. Sorry for more anecdotal evidence. I will try to contact the PA and get the doctors name, but Iâm not promising anything

       I appreciate it :-) I've been growing my own cannabis for 7 years using azadirachtin so I'm very curious. I was also "diagnosed" with CHS by a gastroenterologist without any tests being run; she also told me to eliminate dairy from my diet even though I had said that it never caused me major problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years later I still smoke daily and eat dairy and I don't have the stomach problems I used to. Cutting back on coffee and sugar and getting laid off by my stressful job were the only changes during that time.

       I have grown 100% organically and grown with nutrients. I don't buy weed. I know everything that happens to my weed from start to finish. I have dealt with CHS. As far as I can tell it has nothing to with pesticides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists and doctors do not full understand our endocannabinoid system. They admit it is not the same for everyone. We also know that cannabinoids remain in our body longer than other things. CHS is most commonly associated with long-term and frequent use.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most straight forward explanation is that people are genetically predisposed to handle cannabinoids differently. For a comparison look out how people of different genetic backgrounds handle alcohol.

       It could very well be the stuff already in the weed. I switched from grand master og (extremely potent weed) for platinum because it was half the price for the same quantity, and the grower was local. I got sick after three days of smoking the platinum. Idk if it was contaminated or what. Iâd rather pay for super expensive og than deal with chs.
 If OP has been smoking for 3-4 years, everyday as he puts it, I doubt his genetics would be the issue.

       Neem oil is labeled âorganicâ and âbiodegradableâ but itâs shown to be toxic at HIGH levels. It was explained to me at the ER that normally, fruits and food sprayed with azadirachtin or any form of pesticide, they are usually rinsed off before consumption. That is something people cannot do with cannabis.

       The problem isn't with cannabis. The problem is with our genetics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anthropologists have found evidence that humans have been cultivating cannabis since at least 10,000 BC. Our relationship with cannabis predates recorded history. That doesn't mean everyone has a long lost relative who interacted with cannabis. It does mean there are people who have passed along a genetic mutation that serves to process cannabis differently. As we already know, not everyone processes cannabinoids the same way (endocannabinoid system),

       The cannabinoid profile of a single plant varies(never mind different phenotypes of the "same strain").
      </p>
      <p>
       ex. Flowers harvested from the top of a naturally growing plant will not have the exact cannabinoid/terpene profile as flowers harvested from the bottom. Cannabis has evolved to fight off pests and attract helpful seed spreaders at different levels of the plant's height.
      </p>
      <p>
       There  are many variables to consider. It is possible your cannabis was not cultivated in a legitimate manner. However; Consuming only premium cannnabis does not prevent CHS. I am familiar with neem oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neem oil is organic. Much of what people get from grocery stores has been treated with neem oil. It is also in a bunch of cosmetics, toothpaste etc. As far as the EPA is concerned it gets a pass. Someone would have to go out of their way to poison themselves with neem oil. I say this because
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The half-life of azadirachtin in soil ranges from 3 - 44 days. In water, the half-life ranges from 48 minutes to 4 days. It also rapidly breaks down on plant leaves; the half-life if 1 - 2.5 days. The remaining components of neem oil are broken down by microbes in most soil and water environments.

       This is what the PA thinks. She thinks the problems I had, or chs, were a result of too much azadirachtin on the plant. These were her words almost exactly. So, as I said in the other post I took her word for it. Iâm not a doctor, after all.

       I can't wait for more information to come out on this. I do think pesticides or other stuff sprayed on the cannabis can be harmful to the body as its smoked and inhaled, thus more accessible to the body then simply ingesting. We should honestly be smoking organic buds but a lot of legal states have growers that spray the shit out of their product

       Letâs also remember methods and variety of ingestion has broadened. Smoking is the most unhealthy common method. You remove the burning, you remove (most of) the carcinogens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be interested to know if the carcinogens from the burnt pesticide chemical cause any more additional adverse effects than if say, the plant material were being consumed raw.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, pesticides are used industrially, all throughout our agriculture. So, maybe pot smokers need to stop being smokers.

       It's not just pesticides...there's a ton of sketchy things growers can do to 'assist' their plants. Eagle 20 if some plants get powdery mildew, Advent if the clones have mites, and blasting plants with a phosphorous load before they harvest to beef up the nugs. Even in legal states, testing for abnormally high phosphorous levels isn't really done. It's my pet theory these stomach conditions have to do with that...another reason they may be more prevalent now is because of the rise in popularity of hash oil concentrates. When you do a wax extraction, EVERYTHING gets potentiated, including whatever chemical residue may have been on the plants.
If you live in a legal state, there's usually testing required and most dispensaries will reject weed that fails microb and pesticide tests. What that means is that the growers who use that shit will probably ship it out of state. If you live in a non-legal state, I'd be super wary of wax, and it's possible you're smoking some straight chem-buds.

       The smell of a freshly round peppercorn can take the edge off mild weed-induced anxiety like you've described. Something to do with terpenes iirc... just give a pepper grinder a couple of twists and then smell it (don't inhale the actual pepper flakes, that's not comfortable).

       I grew up on very weak weed.  When I started smoking the best we could get was Maui Wowee, once a year or so someone would be able to get a couple ounces smuggled in via an empty can of Primo Beer.  The shit I come across today is so much stronger I can see where you might not be able to tell if it is too strong or something is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought I came across a strain that was way too strong for me and instead of the issue being potency it was toxicity.  I couldn't smell it, couldn't see it, but there was just enough of a dusting of some sort of mold or pesticide that on day one made me feel like I was having a panic attack.  Fortunately my doctor is an ent and had also seen this before.  Turns out it was due to lack of oxygen, I scorched my lungs with a dusting of an awful mold or toxin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought legalization would make it safer.  I think in some ways it made it riskier, people with no love for the plant but a strong lust for money don't care what about how they grow, they care about how much and how fast they grow. I am now a firm believer in grow your own.

       The ancient vedas describe cannabis as slightly poisonous when taken habitually. It is a substance as dramtically increases "tejas" or "mental fire", which can be beneficial in short term but harmful if abused. When taken long term, the qualities of cannabis "dry out" the nervous system due to its penetrating, drying, and heating qualities. These qualities are responsible for the munchies and, when taken long term, the lack of motivation.

       Good points. I have found that I think about God and scripture more so while partaking. Then again I grew up believing in God, so kind of figured it was a way to spiritualy connect. Interesting to find others who find their thoughts turning spiritual during the moment.

       Having similar issues lately (last month or so.)  Same stuff as always, close friends with the grower, so no worries about the quality/content.  However, lately i've been going into DEEP "tearing the fabric of reality" shit very often.  not sure what is going on...  maybe reality is really slipping away.

       Been smoking regularly for ten years all over the country. Yeah sometimes you're gonna hit a curve where it doesn't feel the same. Sometimes it's the strain, sometimes it's that you just gotta lay off for a few days. Lots of people get sick from spice and synthetic cannabinoids so just make sure you're buying actual weed. Nothing is more important than a reliable dealer. Unless of course you use a dispensary in which case I recommend you discuss it with them.
