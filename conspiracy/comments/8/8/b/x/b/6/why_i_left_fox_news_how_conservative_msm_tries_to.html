        By: Ralph Peters
       </a>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You could measure the decline of Fox News by the drop in the quality of guests waiting in the green room. A year and a half ago, you might have heard George Will discussing policy with a senator while a former Cabinet member listened in. Today, you would meet a Republican commissar with a steakhouse waistline and an eager young woman wearing too little fabric and too much makeup, immersed in memorizing her talking points.
       </p>
       <p>
        This wasn’t a case of the rats leaving a sinking ship. The best sailors were driven overboard by the rodents.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I wrote in an internal Fox memo, leaked and widely disseminated, I declined to renew my contract as Fox News’s strategic analyst because of the network’s propagandizing for the Trump administration. Today’s Fox prime-time lineup preaches paranoia, attacking processes and institutions vital to our republic and challenging the rule of law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Four decades ago, as a U.S. Army second lieutenant, I took an oath to “support and defend the Constitution.” In moral and ethical terms, that oath never expires. As Fox’s assault on our constitutional order intensified, spearheaded by its after-dinner demagogues, I had no choice but to leave.
       </p>
       <p>
        My error was waiting so long to walk away. The chance to speak to millions of Americans is seductive, and, with the infinite human capacity for self-delusion, I rationalized that I could make a difference by remaining at Fox and speaking honestly.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        As early as the fall of 2016, and especially as doubts mounted about the new Trump administration’s national security vulnerabilities, I increasingly was blocked from speaking on the issues about which I could offer real expertise: Russian affairs and our intelligence community. I did not hide my views at Fox and, as word spread that I would not unswervingly support President Trump and, worse, that I believed an investigation into Russian interference was essential to our national security, I was excluded from segments that touched on Vladimir Putin’s possible influence on an American president, his campaign or his administration.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was the one person on the Fox payroll who, trained in Russian studies and the Russian language, had been face to face with Russian intelligence officers in the Kremlin and in far-flung provinces. I have traveled widely in and written extensively about the region. Yet I could only rarely and briefly comment on the paramount security question of our time: whether Putin and his security services ensnared the man who would become our president. Trump’s behavior patterns and evident weaknesses (financial entanglements, lack of self-control and sense of sexual entitlement) would have made him an ideal blackmail target — and the Russian security apparatus plays a long game.
       </p>
       <p>
        As indictments piled up, though, I could not even discuss the mechanics of how the Russians work on either Fox News or Fox Business. (Asked by a Washington Post editor for a comment, Fox’s public relations department sent this statement: “There is no truth to the notion that Ralph Peters was ‘blocked’ from appearing on the network to talk about the major headlines, including discussing Russia, North Korea and even gun control recently. In fact, he appeared across both networks multiple times in just the past three weeks.”)
       </p>
       <p>
        All Americans, whatever their politics, should want to know, with certainty, whether a hostile power has our president and those close to him in thrall. This isn’t about party but about our security at the most profound level. Every so often, I could work in a comment on the air, but even the best-disposed hosts were wary of transgressing the party line.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fox never tried to put words in my mouth, nor was I told explicitly that I was taboo on Trump-Putin matters. I simply was no longer called on for topics central to my expertise. I was relegated to Groundhog Day analysis of North Korea and the Middle East, or to Russia-related news that didn’t touch the administration. Listening to political hacks with no knowledge of things Russian tell the vast Fox audience that the special counsel’s investigation was a “witch hunt,” while I could not respond, became too much to bear. There is indeed a witch hunt, and it’s led by Fox against Robert Mueller.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cascade of revelations about the Russia-related crimes of Trump associates was dismissed, adamantly, as “fake news” by prime-time hosts who themselves generate fake news blithely.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there was Fox’s assault on our intelligence community — in which I had served, from the dirty-boots tactical level to strategic work in the Pentagon (with forays that stretched from Russia through Pakistan to Burma and Bolivia and elsewhere). Opportunities to explain how the system actually works, how stringent the safeguards are and that intelligence personnel are responsible public servants — sometimes heroes — dried up after an on-air confrontation shortly before Trump’s inauguration with a popular (and populist) host, Lou Dobbs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dobbs has no experience with the intelligence system. Yet he ranted about its reputed assaults on our privacy and other alleged misdeeds (if you want to know who spies on you, it’s the FGA — Facebook, Google and Amazon — not the NSA). When I insisted that the men and women who work in our intelligence agencies are patriots who keep us safe, the host reddened and demanded, “Patriotism is the last refuge of the — you fill in the blank.” As I sought to explain that, no, the NSA isn’t listening to our pillow talk, Dobbs kept repeating, “Patriotism is the last refuge of the — fill in the blank.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Because I’d had a long, positive history with Dobbs, I refrained from replying: “Patriotism is the last refuge of the talk-show host.”
       </p>
       <p>
        I became a disgruntled employee, limited to topics on which I agreed with the Trump administration, such as loosened targeting restrictions on terrorists and a tough line with North Korea. Over the past few months, it reached the point where I hated walking into the Fox studio. Friends and family encouraged me to leave, convinced that I embarrassed myself by remaining with the network (to be fair, I’m perfectly capable of embarrassing myself without assistance from Fox).
       </p>
       <p>
        During my 10 years at Fox News and Fox Business, I did my best to be a forthright voice. I angered left and right. I criticized President Barack Obama fiercely (one infelicity resulted in a two-week suspension), but I also argued for sensible gun-control measures and environmental protections. I made mistakes, but they were honest mistakes. I took the opportunity to speak to millions of Americans seriously and — still that earnest young second lieutenant to some degree — could not imagine lying to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        With my Soviet-studies background, the cult of Trump unnerves me. For our society’s health, no one, not even a president, can be above criticism — or the law.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must stress that there are many honorable and talented professionals at the Fox channels, superb reporters, some gutsy hosts, and adept technicians and staff. But Trump idolaters and the merrily hypocritical prime-time hosts are destroying the network — no matter how profitable it may remain.
       </p>
       <p>
        The day my memo leaked, a journalist asked me how I felt. Usually quick with a reply, I struggled, amid a cyclone of emotions, to think of the right words. After perhaps 30 seconds of silence, I said, “Free.”

       SS: I acknowledge liberal propaganda and MSM propaganda. There have been plenty of posts giving credible evidence for it. This post is about the conservative propaganda machine known as Fox News and how it's purposely trying to manipulate the mass public.

       Fox News is still better than MSNBC or CNN by far if you're a real progressive anyway (Fox News is indeed terrible... I'm not arguing that... but it's better). I noticed this during the primaries where CNN &amp; MSNBC did jack shit for Bernie and completely shilled for Clinton. I also noticed a lot of "Russia" in your post, even though there isn't proof of Russian collusion. All we have proof of is a few Russians doing a bad job at trying to spread ideas. Luckily for Americans, we're free to think whatever we want. If we hear a good idea from a Russian we can choose to like it. If we hear a bad idea from a Russian we're free to say "wtf no way".
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem in our country isn't "scary ideas" or more specifically "scary Russian ideas" it's a lack of options. Why were Clinton &amp; Trump our only two options? Because TPBP supports FPTP instead of score or approval voting (RCV is
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       worse than these 2 and only slightly better than FPTP). In 2016 we saw the

       I didn't defend or deflect, so I hope you aren't suggesting that I might be doing so. I simply stated that it was still better than MSNBC or CNN. That's not defending them. It's not deflecting. It's just a simple fact. Just like I said Fox News is still shit. That's also a fact.

       Let other people sidetrack you? That's pretty harsh. I am trying to have a conversation because I think you might be open minded enough to look at something that apparently you are not familiar with.

       I am merely pointing out how the propagandists delivered to you the term "liberal propaganda" to "believe." While you talk about propaganda, you have been infected by it.

        The problem in our country isn't "scary ideas" or more specifically "scary Russian ideas" it's a lack of options. Why were Clinton &amp; Trump our only two options? Because TPBP supports FPTP instead of score or approval voting (RCV is
        <em>
         much
        </em>
        worse than these 2 and only slightly better than FPTP). In 2016 we saw the

       More Americans wanted Bernie than Trump or Clinton. On top of that, democracy is the only tool progressives have to move forward with a progressive agenda. Clinton &amp; Democrats stole our democracy so anything that hurts those who hurt our democracy helps our movement. In that way Fox News was certainly better for progressives.

       In 2000, local Florida Fox News affiliates gave Ralph Nadar more time than other Fox stations. So you and I know exactly what happened here. Fox was shilling for Bernie the same way Cambridge Analytica was and the same way Fox did with Nadar in 2000 -- to get fewer people to vote for the candidate who would actually have a win so they could get their reactionary Donald Trump and George W. Bush in.

       But wait...  how does that make sense you might be asking. Well...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be the first to admit that they did NOT do this the right way. If they wanted to pick a candidate they could/should have done that but
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       they do that then it has to be transparent. In 2015 &amp; 2016 Democrats collected money under false pretenses. We thought we were donating to a candidate who had a fair shot. Some of us even donated to the DNC directly. Collecting that money under false pretenses is fraud.

       Saying Bernie supporters are only white liberals isn't fraud. There is no universe where saying something like that is fraud. It doesn't hurt Bernie nor show bias. He may be incorrect but that isn't fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are attempting to cherry pick random quotes and say that bias. Fine there was bias from individuals even high up individuals. You have to show some behavior from the organization that shows they tried to favor Clinton. Which is why the Donna Brazile debate question is the first example you use that actually may have helped Clinton over Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing else shows actual action. Even the email saying the story should be spread; was it spread? Did the DNC spread it? I don't recall seeing it.

       Thanks for agreeing that there was bias (and actions) against Bernie. The DNC rules are that they must remain neutral. They told donors they were neutral. That is wrongful deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I have to do is show that they weren't neutral. Actions to hurt Bernie's campaign are not, especially when the same is not done to Clinton's campaign for actions they did. Plus, Bernie was her only opponent so also by definition any actions taken against Bernie would be helping Clinton.

        Lying isn't stealing a vote it is lying. Redoing an election after it was done would be highly irregular; the rules of the primary were set before it started. You can't claim fraud for following the rules.

       They punished Bernie for a guy the DNC recommended yet won't punish Clinton for deceiving voters, which is a direct threat to our democracy? That's not neutral.

       I understand your point, but you missed mine. Social conservatives and religious conservatives are very clearly wrong most if not all of the time. But when we boil down both ideologies to their founding debate big vs small government, I would side with conservatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes conservatives today are largely wrong and on the wrong side of history, but that is due to America’s focus on social issues. If we ever get to a point where identity politics, religion, and money are taken out of the equation, the Conservatives might seem a lot more rational to people.

       If liberal and conservative are both ideologies, where does reality fall?

      <p>
       Are science and religion both ideologies?
      </p>
      <p>
       On the issue of big versus small government, what are we really being told?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatives say they prefer small government and they say so based upon an ideology that would eliminate all government except police and military. Liberals simply do not have an ideological view of government. They believe that the size of government is due to the substance of its role and not some arbitrary number. To liberals, government may need to be larger or smaller depending on its function. For example, a liberal would tell a communist that government is too big because it does not give them the freedom of earning more money for their work or living in an area they like, etc., AND a liberal would tell a conservative that government is too small because it does not provide for universal retirement, safety and fraud regulations, or healthcare. Conservatives are always ideological, liberals are not always ideological. Conservatives lack nuance and situation appropriate views, liberals are all about nuance and situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we look at economic policy of Republicans, who play the role of conservatives, we see an agenda that is designed entirely for the purpose of maintaining an oligarchy or expanding it -- both on paper and with historical examples. If you currently believe that the conservative economic agenda of Republicans is a good thing, we can look at both the theory of "supply side," and the demonstrated history of deregulation and tax cuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will find that Republican economic policy is "disposed to preserve existing conditions" like making sure that the top one percent absorb some 15 percent of the income, and they want to "restore traditional" economic theory so that America is more like it was before the Great Depression -- or worse yet, like the late 1800's when three oligarchs had more control over American than any three people ever did before or since.

         While there were many bad aspects of Obamacare, one part of it that was progress was its ability to increase health coverage to tens of millions of people who were not previously insured. (Unfortunately, based upon political conditions at the time, we could not get universal coverage nor 'free' coverage for all, and it had that awful mandate attached -- so Obamacare was a mix of conservative and liberal change).

       It doesn't say anything about improvement as you implied. Progress is relative.

       To me, it sounds like you're saying that all change, reform and progress is inherently good.

       No, it sounds like he's a neocon, who's embittered that other neocons (like George Will) fucked themselves out of a job, as the nation's mood soured on globalism and endless interventionist wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny that his "perfect version of Fox News" was evidently during the propaganda that led up to the Iraq War. (Remember those weapons of mass destruction?) And all the pro-torture shit that Fox spewed back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not upset that Fox is propaganda now. He's upset that the kind of propaganda
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       was putting out for years became toxic as even the President did not support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New Right and the Left might not agree on many things, but they both express disgust at the Fox News War Machine of the neocon years.

       Trump has openly and repeatedly called for torture and other war crimes. During the campaign, he called himself "the most militaristic person there is". He heaps praises on murderous dictators while insulting all of our allies. He supported the Iraq War (despite lying about it), and just hired one of the chief architects of that war, who also wants preemptive wars in Iran and North Korea, to be his National Security Advisor.

       Trump's honesty can be disarming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like when he admitted he was greedy. He was at some rally and he said that he'd led a shallow life of conspicuous consumption. "I've always been greedy," he said, with candor. Then he added (with slick political unctuousness): "But now I want to be greedy for America. I want to be greedy for
       <em>
        you!
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       While I doubt the second part of the statement, I do appreciate that he was man enough to concede the first part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like when he was at an evangelical event and said openly, "I don't deserve to be on the stage with the rest of you. I'm a horrible human being."
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump gets away with so many human failings (that would kill any other politician) because he never pretends to be Holier-Than-Thou. It insulates him vulnerabilities that Christian-Conservatives have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ted Cruz cheating on his wife hurt him with his base. Trump sleeping with porn stars and strippers ten years ago? People yawn.

       He used to be a great spokesperson for the right, especially during the Reagan era.  Recently (over the last 10 years) he's changed his tune, and is now one of the most anti-Trump columnists for WashPo.

       Corporations/Corporate media is not left wing, they just push SJW stuff to look different
to far right Fox News. (Plus basic shit like LGBT rights/pro choice is nothing revolutionary and totally ignores economics)

       Neither tell you the whole truth. Both agree pretty tightly that rich people are good and capitalism should have few regulations (Cnn/msnbc) or virtually no regulations (Fox).

       I did not like the fact that the comments were so heavily attacked for NOT BEING ONE SIDED! So I stepped out of the whole thing. There isn't much room in this sub (and too many others) to actually share different ideas.

       In one of the comments I deleted, I conceded a point to someone and asked a question. If stuff like that is worth 10 down votes, count me out.

       I'm sorry you feel that way. But I'd encourage you not to put so much value in reddit karma. It's literally meaningless bullshit. Even if people disagree with you it's still worth it to express yourself in civil, productive ways.

       I appreciate it. It's not my Reddit karma, which as you can see is pretty low. It's the immediate impression of readers who might come across the particular comment. I like exchanges like this where people look at different perspectives. I've had a few good ones today where people learned from each other, even though we did not agree. I did not think that was the case on this one -- notwithstanding your comments, which were just fine. They just happened to be in the middle of it all.

       There's an actual documentary I believe called fox news brainwashed my dad. A woman noticed how bitter,angry and confrontational her otherwise normal father had become after years of fox news and right wing radio. She was surprised during the making of the documentary of how many people wrote to her with the exact same problem. Right wing media turning their parents into these super argumentative people and amping up how scared they were of Muslim people. Even at the end they got her father off all the right wing media and he slowly started turning back into the father she had known for years. It was pretty eye opening stuff

       That's basically what opened my eyes. The whole movie I thought well maybe he's just turning into a grumpy old man like alot of old guys do. Then once he got his personality back I was like wtf kind of psychological effect does foxes bullshit have on people to make their personality change that drastically

       Oddly enough its the liberals that are currently full of hate &amp; rage.  Wonder if someone will create a documentary about how when they stop watching liberal propaganda they become more tolerant of others.  We all know we wont see this on Netflix or Amazon Prime anytime soon.  Amazon is controlled by the CIA by the way so there is your first clue.

       I'll have to check that out. My parents (former hippies who protested Vietnam War back in the day and generally laid back people) watch Fox all the time, and it has really hurt our relationship. They are immune to logic. Some days, there are glimpses of hope, like my dad will say he thinks Trump is crazy or the Republican party doesn't care about him. Then, he will spend 2 days watching nothing but Fox and the irrationality will come back. The biggest issue we have now is that they don't understand that I can criticize the Republican party and telling me the Democrats did the same thing doesn't refute the Republican party doing something wrong (Cambridge Analytica)

       I was thinking about that yesterday actually, that you can't find any truly unbiased news. Do I like Trump? No, but I don't think every single thing he has done is evil. Do I like Hillary Clinton? No, and I think she and her family have done a lot of shady stuff that people don't even know about. I hate Paul Ryan and I hate Chuck Schumer. It's very scary the news we are not given as media has become completely politicized and spun

       Right.  We're in the same boat.  Nowadays I get my news from all over place.  I listen to a lot of NPR, get a lot of news on twitter, podcasts, etc.  I've just gotten a lot better at recognizing what's political theater/propaganda/noise.

       I think you mean the Harvard shorenstein center study.  It's the study that's referenced in nearly every article appearing on the first page of a google search for "media bias in 2016 election".  Has to be one of the strongest gaslights I've ever seen.  I remember a pole that came out leading up to the election where 75% of respondents agreed that the media favored Hillary Clinton.  I mean, you have to be pretty disingenuous to convince yourself otherwise.

       Have you ever read the sidebar?  They are very clear about being a pro trump place.  If you noticed my post history you will see i was there to discuss the Wikileaks podesta emails.  T_D allowed direct posts to wikileaks &amp;
       <a href="/r/politics">

       did not.  I got banned from T_D &amp; I was recently unbanned from t_d in like the last 2-3 weeks.

 Trump is terrible! But what about Obama.

       I 100% believe it. My dad, who is a libertarian, used to watch Al Jazeera because he hated how biased all of the channels were one way or another. Well, once he realized his vote was extremely meaningful last year, he started watching Lou Dobbs and liking Trump. Even after completely trashing Trump for 6 months. Mainly bc how horrified he was of him with the Nuke button. Anyway, he voted for Trump and when he came to visit me in January, he was trolling people talking shit about Trump on FB. I mean, he never even went on FB, much less talk shit to women or strangers on there. It is the craziest thing I have ever seen and so sad

       Obama is a pussy &amp; the appropriate response would have been to give him a promotion.  Fox is still not as bad as CNN, msnbc, abc, cbs, vice(partly owned by fox), bill maher, john oliver, so much propagada.  Daytime fox is garbage.

       Do people honestly not see that it's both? CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and most of MSM is the dems propaganda, FOX news is the republican propaganda.
      </p>

       They are controlled opposition. Two sides to the same coin. The illusion of choice, so one doesn't question the news that happens to be absent from BOTH sides of the mainstream media.

       Ralph wants to pull Megyn Kelly and get paid the big bux but he can't because of his previous statements about Obama. Thus, he has to virtue signal and pay penance by saying the three magic words: trump russia collusion.

       Fuck this guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look I’m no trump support, in fact fuck him too. He’s a disgusting, pompous, braggart but compared to the neoliberal/neocon order that has ruled since the early 90’s he’s nothing. The political status quo of this country continued to sell out the working class and middle class in favor of corporations, Wall Street, the oligarchs, and war. After decades of that, this gave rise to Trump because for a lot of Americans nobody was looking out for them (Bush Sr, Jr., Clinton, and Obama were nothing but yes men for Wall Street) not that trump is any better (look up his connection to Robert Mercer) but his rise is an indictment of the current state of desperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this guy is only bitching and moaning that the status quo might be in jeopardy. Although he had no problem with Bush and neocon’s bullshit Wars (I can almost guarantee he’s in favor of John Bolton’s appointment)
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side, who the fuck does this guy thinks he’s fooling saying the NSA isn’t monitoring us. Of course we know Google, Facebook and other tech companies are invading our privacy but they all do it in conjunction with the NSA that was literally what the 2013 leaks were about. Once again fuck this guy, he gets everything he deserves.

       Well maybe if obama ended the wars he promised to or didn’t fuck up my taxes or double the national debt or increase the power of the nsa through keeping the “patriot act” alive people wouldn’t have been so pissed off. Not to mention the only other option was globalist Hilary. I think it’s all a divide and conquer tactic from the people who actually hold power but hey let’s just shit all over one another.

       Well someone is pushing for war with Russia.  The latest claim regarding the poisoning along with diplomats being kicked out of various countries is playing to a war with Russia scenario.  There was not solid evidence that Russia was actually behind the poisoning, yet the Western countries seem determined to go after Russia regardless.  No one is trying to calm the waters.  Now as for involvement of the MSM -- they seem to be onside with the claims being made by the UK, EU and other Western entities, and they are making no effort to investigate the claims.  The MSM seems to take direction from the political class.  They are not operating independently. The political class is pushing for war and the MSM is doing nothing to challenge this.  It is a matter of their abdicating responsiblity by simply believing and printing what the politicos tell them to say without challenging the dangerous situation that is unfolding.

       I don't know of any media outlet pushing war. The only mention I hear of war is from conservative outlets insisting that liberals want war, and there's always a lot of hyperbole using words like"hysteria."  They've been complaining liberals want war since Trump refused to enforce the sanctions that were passed into law by an overwhelming margin.

       When they cross the line they add more sanctions...that impacts their economy and that country has no choice but to go to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember US has allies that support the sanctions and EU most certainly would support ours with Russia.  That alone would choke Russia since their economy hasn't fully recovered. Russia would attack small European countries and then we would  be dragged in.

       I find it weird how ever since the Bush administration there has been very little debate, even on the right, that Fox is there to spread right wing talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a few years and the rise of Keith Olberman (followed by Rachel Maddow) a lot of folks considered MSNBC to be the left wing equivalent of FOX.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scary part to me is how now all the sudden CNN, ABC, NBC, WaPo, NYT...basically anybody who isn't FOX is considered to be liberal propaganda by large chunks of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of times these organizations have people on site at the White House, reporting first hand from war zones and disasters, and people are more inclined to trust some dude blogging from their parents basement because they aren't a part of the dreaded MSM

       As someone who was there when Fox News was created, I remember the other stations
       <em>
        immediately

       treating it like an equal quality news source. It's only been since Donald Trump that the other stations have gone after Fox. What does that say about them all?

       I feel like that's way to subjective for me to give you and objective answer, but that OP's post could be very relevant:

        A year and a half ago, you might have heard George Will discussing policy with a senator while a former Cabinet member listened in.

       Well, Fox has a particular view of the Russia collusion issue and your points likely would have called that into question.  Speaking out would not have done that much good because the issue still would be mired in speculation and rumor. 
"All Americans, whatever their politics, should want to know, with certainty, whether a hostile power has our president and those close to him in thrall"  Perhaps, but your comments were not going to provide any additional certainty -- just more speculation.  I do not think that any media should be focusing on this until we have concrete information.  So far very little solid information has come out, and those who have been charged have been charged with stuff that has nothing to do with the central issue of Russian collusion.  The whole thing is quite exasperating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I have decided that the Russians did not collude with Trump.  The reason is that if the Russians wanted some sort of leverage with the US government, they surely would have chosen to "collude" with a more likely candidate than Trump.  NO ONE even expected him to win.  An additional point is that even if there was interference in the election by some Russians it was too minor to have any sort of impact, and apart from a few social media postings no one has indicated what they might have done that could have had a significant impact.  The answer is nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have something useful to say regarding a viable "collusion" scenario -- tell it to Mueller.  He seems willing to listen to all sorts of rumors and speculation.  That seems to be what he is getting paid for.

       It's still propaganda. The conspiracy is the propaganda that Fox news is pushing out in order to manipulate others for their agenda. And it doesn't matter if it's new info or not, and has never been a criteria for a topic to be discussed here.

       All MSM is propaganda regardless. Left and right have their own stop with the nonsense one is greatrer than the other.

      <p>
       Russian collusion was built off nothing in order to be a divisive tactic between conflicting opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we live in an environment where no one wants to talk to one another and speak each others thoughts. I have friends both liberal and conservative and both are at each others heads. I am here trying to be a middle man trying to expose both sides are full of crap but neither side wants to listen.
      </p>

       Anyone who believe there is Russian collusion or the divisive tactics played by MSM on BOTH SIDES then you are already being deluded by the system.

       I'm curious as to why you kept this comment, but deleted all of your [comments from our conversation, even though I thought it was pretty civil and productive](why_i_left_fox_news_how_conservative_msm_tries_to/dwjvrr9/)

       I thought I deleted all my comments here. I missed that one. That's all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not like the fact that the comments were so heavily attacked for NOT BEING ONE SIDED! So I stepped out of the whole thing. There isn't much room in this sub (and too many others) to actually share different ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one of the comments I deleted, I conceded a point to someone and asked a question. If stuff like that is worth 10 down votes, count me out.

       No it isn't. You've been fed false information.
