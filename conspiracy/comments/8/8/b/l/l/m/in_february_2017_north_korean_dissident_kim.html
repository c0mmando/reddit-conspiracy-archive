    <div class="md"><p>Satire aside, the UK&#39;s argument - that Russia must be responsible for the Salisbury Novichok poisoning because the Soviets are known to have researched Novichoks - has been shown to be utterly specious.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/18/questions-and-theories-on-the-salisbury-nerve-agent-attack">The Guardian</a></p>

<p>In contradiction to the official position that only one Russian laboratory ever produced them, it now appears that within the general scientific community these novichok agents have been quite extensively studied. In order to do this, of course they have also been synthesised by these researchers.</p>

<p>It became clear that this must be the case when Porton Down managed to identify the obscure and (supposedly) previously unused agent relatively quickly. This indicated that they must have had detailed spectrographic “fingerprints” available to them. While of course this might have been available to them via top-secret defence research, it turns out that they could simply have reached out to the internet.</p>

<p>As it happens, <a href="http://www.spectroscopynow.com/details/ezine/1591ca249b2/Iranian-chemists-identify-Russian-chemical-warfare-agents.html?tzcheck=1,1,1,1,1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;tzcheck=1&amp;amp;tzcheck=1&amp;amp;tzcheck=1">two Iranian scientists helpfully provided this exact information to the scientific community last year.</a> Their motives of course were entirely benign. They wanted to assist in the detection of the use of WMD and novichok agents that had not previously been fingerprinted for this purpose. We therefore have clear evidence that these agents were already known to the wider scientific community and had been synthesised. Indeed, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309093991_Fragmentation_pathways_and_structural_characterization_of_organophosphorus_compounds_related_to_CWC_by_electron_ionization_and_electrospray_ionization_tandem_mass_spectrometry_Mass_spectral_studies_of">the scientists concerned have published a detailed research paper in which they helpfully show exactly how they did it.</a> If two researchers in a standard laboratory can do this, it’s hard to believe the government assertions that only a nation state could have produced these agents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s silly to blame Russia for that, because any good scientist can make that agent if he has a decent lab. It could be rouge Russians, like the Mafia or some oligarchs. Or of course someone else all together.</p>

<p>Still, your NK/Theresa May example doesn&#39;t fit and is tok random. If it wasn&#39;t Russia, the someone probably wanted people to believe that it was.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t work with your NK example. Theresa May would not have a motive or intent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beyond the blame game that these political actors are involved, the poisoning of Kim Jong-nam was extremely rapid in comparison to the Skripal poisoning. That is, the two women came into contact with Nam, he alerted authorities as the airport immediately, was treated thereafter then died en route to the hospital. It was less than 20 minutes from contact to his death. VX is deadly to be sure, but these Novichok agents are just as deadly and in some cases even moreso. But from the time of the poisoning (at his house) they went out, grabbed a drink, had dinner, then went to a park before collapsing? It must have been hours before they fell ill but for a similar poison, or even a less potent poison, Nam was dead in 15 minutes. Am I missing something here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The VX was administered directly to Nams face. In Skripal case they probably got a lower dose, because they didn&#39;t even think to call for help.</p>

<p>As for OPs point, the british government probably has no beef with Nam. Just like they don&#39;t have beef with Skripal. NK and Russia respectively did have a motive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably got a lower dose? So a Russian agent or agent got their hands on some of the deadliest nerve agent on our planet, waited until the dead of night to go to Skripal&#39;s door and decided it best to not leave too much of the Novichok behind? Waste not want not? Also, they both experienced symptoms at the same time in the park, hours after exposure? Both of them? What kind of nerve gas does this low dose or not? I have stomach pains immediately if I eat too many beans for goodness sake! As to motive, Russia is certainly the number one suspect - but why stop at one? This guy was a spy who sold out his country and who knows what else. There might be scores of people who would want him to suffer, Russian or otherwise. And most importantly, considering there are hundreds of billions worth of weapons contracts that could come from Russian animosity from NATO countries I would say some large companies with money, contracts and jobs on the line would fit the bill. The military industrial complex is always hungry and who is one elderly spy and  his daughter in comparison to a trillion dollars? Or maybe oil and gas companies that are competing against Russia for the European market. Finally, Skripal was in prison in Russia for years, but they let him live just to track him down in a foreign country and use a low dose of a super weapon to kill him at the time when anti Russian hysteria is at an all time high? Seems suspect.</p>

If you actually research the russian assassination you will see that only a couple turned up any evidence at all, and all the rest remain “suspected”.
