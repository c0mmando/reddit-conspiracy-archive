       He didn't just admit that. He admitted Trump fired Comey because Comey wouldn't say Trump wasn't under investigation. Nice hire Trump.

       Rod rosenstein wrote a letter to Trump recommending he fire Comey. Doesnt matter what giuliani said, this fact alone makes it a completely acceptable use of his presidential powers.

       Don't forget that Rosenstein's letter faults Comey for treating Clinton unfairly. Does anyone honestly believe that is the real reason he was fired?

       I'm not a fan but I'm certain it was intentional. Look up Giuliani's history in law and especially that dealing with the FBI. I encourage everyone to ignore headlines and read a transcript of what he says, they will be very carefully and specifically worded. Giuliani will be Trump's 'answer' to Muller.

       C'mon man, at least try to read the words. I just said this.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “He fired Comey because Comey would not,
        <strong>
         among other things
        </strong>
        , say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation,” Giuliani, who recently joined Trump’s legal team, told Fox News’s Sean Hannity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you read the Comey memos that were recently declassified you would know that Comey told Trump multiple times in private that he was not personally under investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Guiliani said is, Trump fired Comey becuase he wouldn't say in public what he did in private.

       The "among other things" there means that Trump fired Comey for a number of reasons, one of which was that Comey didn't say that Trump wasn't under investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're looking for what you want to believe if you're reading anything else. And we all know this is politician speak to leave tons of outs. No statement can ever be definite, which should also set off a siren to tell you that you're reading the sentence wrong.

       No it is legalese, and whoever thinks Guiliani just admitted obstruction
       <em>

       based on those words is a weapons grade retard.

       IF there are records of reimbursement payments in the records seized from the lawyer Cohen's office, apartment or safety deposit box then Guliani may be trying to get ahead of that news.

       Worked with Jr's "treasonous" meeting. Trump's supporters think Jr must be innocent since he released the emails himself, despite the fact that he lied about it at first, and only did it to get ahead of the NYT releasing it. Even Assange thinks its a good idea.

       To parrot Avenatti, I sure hope structuring wasn’t the intent. Realistically, that seems to be the only reason a billionaire would pay back a $130K “over the course of several months”.

       There are tons of sources that point to the fact that it is very unlikely that Trump is actually a billionaire. The amount of debt that he took on to open the Taj Mahal was astronomical and at very interest rates. People, at the time, advised him that it was very unlikely he would be able to pay it back.

       How much net worth do you realistically need to have skyscrapers all over the world with your name on them tho? And some of the best golf courses, top tv show for a decade, multiple businesses, etc. I mean shit, before he ran for president his name alone was probly worth half a billion itself. He may not be worth as much as he says he is, but chances are he’s worth at least 1 billion. Possibly a couple

       Idk tho bc he doesn’t spend on really stupid things. Like his biggest purchase is his plane which is run through his businesses as well as all his travel etc.  when he vacations he goes to his own properties. His apartment is crazy expensive but not a depreciating asset. I’m not going against your point completely as I’m pretty sure he has comped to be worth like 7+ billion.  If he’s worth half that he’s still way over exaggerated. Were both probly like half right here

       But it’s still worth what he paid for it if not more. Unlike alcohol and drugs and vacations, ridiculous clothes, gambling, etc. So while that may be considered lavish, it’s not contributing to him losing his net worth.

       Oh I guarantee it he could. He’s nowhere near like Bezos or gates or those guys but he could probly get up to 100+ liquid by tomorrow. I think he paid something like 76 mil of his own money for the campaign. And btw, if your a billionaire on paper, then your a billionaire lol

        Over all, Mr. Trump raised far less money than Mrs. Clinton did, though the disparity — like the race itself — closed at the end of the campaign. The Clinton campaign brought in $70 million from Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, compared with $86 million for the Trump campaign, of which $10 million came from Mr. Trump’s own pocket.

       but ya, i mean, i guess youre right, but there is difference between "having" a billion dollars tied up in properties or assets (and all the inherent risk involved) and have 1 billion in cash -- and i think that's a distinction worth noting.

       Well yea idk I mean if your talking about like having a billion just chillin in a checking account or something then I’d say very few ppl other than maybe bezos even have that. Almost all billionaires keep their wealth in some sort of investment that would require selling off to get the cash. But yea some things are obviously more liquid then buildings and properties that trump has, if that’s what you mean.

       I think there is a weirdness with the whole situation. We have Trump getting in trouble for trying to keep an affair a secret. He may even face consequences for it. We have a previous President who raped women. He only got in trouble for doing things with an intern. But what Trump did is wrong, but we have more of a Trump hunt going on than we do a push for justice.

       A Republican President got away with manipulating intelligence to start a war and for murdering 4000+ Americans on 9/11.

       I think the right have used up all their "Clinton was bad too" credits.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, Clinton was investigated for crimes related to covering up an affair, namely perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering, and they nearly ended his Presidency.  The whole Stormy Daniels thing isn't any different, looking at possible crimes related to the coverup of an affair.

       The Stormy Daniels case is a fairly easy comparison to what went on in the Clinton years without needing to call it a "Trump hunt."  There's nothing unprecedented about it, at all.

       It's not even close. Clinton raped ladies if the nearly confirmed accusations are to be believed. Did Trump rape Stormy Daniels? Did I miss that part of the story? Did Clinton face any justice for those incidents?

       Half of is was taken care of by an insurance policy, and the other half by liquidating assets put into a blind trust.  According to reporting Hillary had about a million in assets (really not that much for a Yale-educated attorney working as a partner...) at the time.

       First, the Clinton rape accusations are not "nearly confirmed."  Second, Trump has over a dozen sexual assault and at least one rape accusation himself.  While the rape accusation, from Ivanna Trump, has been rescinded and re-affirmed enough times to question it's credibility, so too was Juanita Broaddrick's rape accusation against Bill Clinton.
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-full-list">
        Here's a brief, but sourced, run down of quite a few of them
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also Jessica Leeds who accused Trump of groping her breasts and trying to put his hand up her skirt on a plane in 1980.  There's Jill Harth who accused Trump of an attempted rape.  There's Kirsten Anderson who accused Trump of groping her vagina through her underwear.  There's Summer Zervos who accused Trump of forcibly kissing her and groping her.  There's plenty more and that's not even including the Miss USA contestants, or the Miss Teen USA contestants who accuse Trump of barging into dressing areas while they were naked.  Trump even bragged about that one (at least doing it in the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that I’ll go backstage before a show, and everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. You know, I'm inspecting, I want to make sure that everything is good.
       </p>
       <p>
        You know, the dresses. ‘Is everyone okay?’ You know, they're standing there with no clothes. ‘Is everybody okay?’ And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. But no, I've been very good.
       </p>

       A crime is a crime.  You don't get your slate wiped clean by being elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, like Clinton, the Stormy Daniels case isn't about the sex.  It's about crimes that may have been committed in covering up the sex.  The possible crimes that were committed in relation to Stormy Daniels, wire fraud, bank fraud, campaign violations, are alleged to have occurred during the Presidential campaign, so not 10 years before becoming President.  The alleged crimes were committed in October, 2016.

       Now back to topic, the amount of mental gymnastics that people go to justify DJT fuckup with respect to Stormy, election laws is amazing. Dude broke the law and has being trying to cover up mistake. Fucking Stormy is not the issue. The issue is paying her right before the election and consequently getting afoul of election laws. If he did nothing wrong release Stormy from her NDA and let's move on; Cause seriously the amount of gas lighting he has done I highly doubt anyone will bat an eyelid otherwise live up to his mantra of Law &amp; Order. Face the consequences of his actions not unless he is above the law.

       Tangible proof of our president being compromised, and caught lying and covering it up is just a distraction?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are loads more women with similar stories about hush payments and threats on their lives.

       You think they're all lying?

       He either lied about using campaign funds to pay off a porn actress for an affair or lied on his disclosure regarding loans. Either of which are violations. Either of which further show the leader of our nation. The responsibily for addressing those larger issues you stated, is a liar and is more interested in his own self interest and preservation than serving as a representative of the United States.

       no, I get your point. You're claiming this is an unimportant story that is being used as a distraction. I disagree with that statement per the reasons listed in my original comment to you. It's incredibly difficult to fix those bigger picture problems when you have shitty leaders in this form for of governmental system.

I'm a landlord.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have had probably close to 10 different workers related to it and have had 1-2 lawyers throughout this whole thing. Managing one small place is at times a part-time job
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes people need more money. They undershoot the price, we need something else done, something is way worse than we think it is, amongst other issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't usually question it. I usually want the job done ASAP so I can move on and the quicker I pay up, the quicker it moves on. To be honest, I don't know what exactly they are talking about most of the time anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now just imagine I'm Donald Trump. I own hundreds of businesses, thousands of properties, shit breaks every single day, I'm probably in a hundred lawsuits at any given time, am busy 24/7, I'm sometimes in other countries/timezones and have a million commitments and things going on at all times. Even if I wanted to, I don't have the time to keep up with everything, so I hire secretaries and lawyers to take care of business. Since I only deal with people I trust and since money is about as plentiful as dirt to me, it's something I'm even less concerned about.

       Law is an extremely complicated process, usually half written in almost another language. I do my best to read up on things when there's a situation, but I'd have to go to go to school for it to know all the ins and outs.

       Golly gee, I imagine he'd have to, I dunno, hire a STAFF or something. Maybe with managers or something to run the place and it's day to day operations and repairs, huh?

      <p>
       This is kind of a tangent since the operations carried out by normal staff has nothing to do with your lawyer paying a hooker hush money. That's not the kind of thing you just throw 130k at without knowing wtf is going on, especially when you don't have much cash actually available.

       You actually don't know that. You don't know how much debt he has and you don't know what his cash flow really looks like. You just assume that the poor man's idea of a rich man has hundreds of thousands of bucks to just throw around. If he did, why would he do shit like buy paintings and pay lawyers with foundation money instead of his pockets?

       Yes, he has people to run the businesses he does actually own (which isn't that much). That has nothing to do with his own personal lawyer/fixer - a person he had regular contact with, not average joe managers of a hotel.

       I believe he's worth at minimum $3 billion and at maximum, $10 billion or more. If there even is a real number, considering a lot of depends on real-time worth of various things.

      <p>
       $100k is nothing for him. Am I saying he goes around spending it everyday on various things? No. But what I'm saying is if he loses $100k, I doubt he thinks about it for more than a second before moving on, while people like you and me would have to deal with that for a decade.

       The whole reason for whatever this is supposed to be is a sham, at best. We went from Russian collusion to a pornstar. The only thing really learned is that the government is more corrupt than we thought and this is a problem that's going to have to be solved with blood than through legal terms.

       I mean that’s just a terrible suggestion that I’m not sure proves your point....TD hates literally everyone until the second they say something positive about trump, then they love that person for a bit. Then they go back to hating them the next time they do something against trump. TD has been singing the praise of Kanye for a bit now, you really think they loved Kanye before recently? TD is a terrible example to prove any point. That place is the definition of a closed bubble circle jerk....

       if that's what smart people do, this further proves trump is fucking moron, because he can't hire a competent lawyer to save his life.

       no, I get your point. You're claiming this is an unimportant story that is being used as a distraction. I disagree with that statement per the reasons listed in my original comment to you. It's incredibly difficult to fix those bigger picture problems when you have shitty leaders in this form for of governmental system.

       It sounds like you could easily get untroubled if you're allowing your lawyers to do things you don't understand,  in your name.

       so, you're defense of trump is:
      </p>
      <p>
       "well, who could possibly keep track of all that money and where it's going"
      </p>
      <p>
       are you serious? this was his job! and we're supposed to let a dude, who can't keep track of his own businesses run the richest, most powerful country in the world? yikes

       No it is legalese, and whoever thinks Guiliani just admitted obstruction
       <em>
        legally
       </em>
       based on those words is a weapons grade retard.

       That doesn't mean I don't think obstruction happened. It probably fucking did.
