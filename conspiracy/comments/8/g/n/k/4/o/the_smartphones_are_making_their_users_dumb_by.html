        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For years I carried a smartphone in my pocket all day, I felt this constant &quot;buzz&quot; sensation, frequent urges to pull it out and see what&#39;s going on &quot;out there&quot;, a constant draw on my attention as I was anxious to notice if it was vibrating, and a fast-forward kind of impatience. And I was trying to conduct everyday life activities with this stuff constantly present.</p>

<p>I notice these behaviors in other people. It seems like this is not being discussed much anymore, it used to be.</p>

<p>I traded down to a flip phone a week ago and I am already noticing dramatic improvements in my state of mind. I bought the flip phone a year ago but it took me this long to finally do it. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to live with that buzz, you can downgrade, and it&#39;s cheaper. I really hope this becomes the cool new thing to do.</p>

<p>Both with and without the smartphone, I&#39;ve found it difficult to deal with the fast-forward interruptor people. You can&#39;t convey complex thought or have a serious conversation unless each person gives each other the chance to speak complete sentences, and then listens and thinks before responding. This issue is hard in the workplace and in relationships. My strategy has been to try to be patient, repeat when interrupted, and not get angry or cranky. To  keep my cool I think about how people don&#39;t realize what the smartphones are doing to them, I remember how powerful my own addiction has been, and I am motivated by knowing that each time I try harder to be a quality communicator I am helping to set the tone and teach by showing.</p>

<p>There are lots of conspiracies about this being an intentional plot to make a profit  - software designed to make you addicted, hardware that does physical damage like cancer, even plasma-based parasitic lifeforms that spread through electromagnetic radiation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a disaster. Surely time will bring an end to end this madness and society will progress to something better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically they are called smart phones but they are making everyone dumber. It’s hard to think of something similar that took over previous generations minds, but I think the television is possibly close. The problem is, the smart phone can be a television plus a million other things. So it’s magnitude is much greater than many other similar objects. I think you can notice a stark difference when observing the generation who never existed without things like smart phones, fast internet and computers as well. The best thing we can do is learn how to become closer with nature and abandon all forms of immediate communication or media for extended periods. It’s during these times that I’ve felt most at peace, achieved mental clarity , and felt powerful as a living being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya I definitely feel that.</p>

<p>My co worker actually still prints out maps from the internet and uses the directions and mapping instead. I thought it was crazy because (at least for me ha) looking at a map and trying to read it let alone figure out where I am is too much.</p>

<p>For OPs Topic: I definitely feel the push back on the flip phone though. People looked at me crazy when I had when(I had to switch because I needed constant email, camera and internet unfortunately for work) but people would be like &quot;Why do you have that&quot; and &quot;Oh it makes no sense to have that and then list features of their phone&quot;. All I say is for privacy reasons and its indestructible basically plus it is cheaper phone and cell phone plane wise.</p>

<p>But I notice the smartphone addiction like today when I picked my brother up from school and a van right next to me at the left turn light and the very first car almost missed the light because everyone and the driver was too busy on their phones. Someone had to honk at them to go. Even at the grocery store some parents rather be on their phone then watch their kids running up and down the isle and basically out of their sight. I mean the area I live in isnt really bad but still anything can happen in the blink of the eye sometimes. </p>

<p>Also I think that it is because of possible 3g or cell phone frequencies, as well as blue light distorting and controlling where we look.</p>

<p>Tumors are showing at an increase rate on regular lab rats and theyre small. 5G networks are also can react more with human skin which is technically our biggest organ so could you imagine 5g antennas everywhere and constantly on and hitting every living thing. </p>

<p>Yes, it can be advantageous to have a device that tells you more of what is going on in the world and what your friends are doing. However, ALL of the best days of my life have had moments in them where nothing fun was happening. I was allowed to let life happen and end up in a great experience that day.
People who are too connected spend the &quot;boring&quot; times looking for something better, and probably bail on a lot of things before the spontaneous, great things can happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; I&#39;ve found it difficult to deal with the fast-forward interruptor people.&quot;</p>

<p>This line right here really made me think.  Is it smart phones doing this to me?  Not that I am an interruptor but I do feel my line of thought is fleeting so it is hard to deal with people that want to take a LONG time to draw out their thoughts.  And also, I had this problem from before smart phones.  I had this problem way back in the late 90&#39;s, maybe because I was a heavy video game and TV/movie guy?  I don&#39;t know....</p>

<p>I do know one thing though:  It is not that we can&#39;t draw out full and intelligent thoughts and conversations because I can.  I do it all day.  It is just that, speaking for myself, it is hard for me to wait around for people to draw out their complete thought in SLOW MOTION.</p>

<p>Maybe today&#39;s youth is in fast forward and anyone who has to deal with them on a regular basis needs to learn to speed up.  I don&#39;t know...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between needing to speed it up and taking the time it takes to convey a complex message. You can&#39;t remove the &quot;if/then&quot; from a conditional statement and wind up with the same meaning. Yeah, sometimes people take too long to convey a simple thought, but sometimes things aren&#39;t simple and they require more time.  The internet, ipads, and smart phones limit peoples tolerance for accomadating (in Piaget&#39;s defintion) and incorporating complex ideas, (at least in my opinion, there is contradictory evidence on this topic). If something can&#39;t be reduced to a simple statement then they simply can&#39;t tolerate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people think you need a smartphone to survive in the modern world. I switched to a flip phone for 3 years and it gave me some perspective on that.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8d4o3k/pink_floyds_roger_waters_stops_live_concert_to/dxkss4e/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8d4o3k/pink_floyds_roger_waters_stops_live_concert_to/dxkss4e/</a></p>

<p>Being in a social environment with this flip phone was startling. I would notice one person gets &quot;micro bored&quot; and yanks out their smartphone to reconnect to whatever it is they think is important. And then another person does it. And then another. Meanwhile I&#39;m sitting there with my flip phone in my pocket, absorbing the life around me, watching these morons try to pull some tidbit of something worth talking about from the internet thru their smartphone.</p>

<p>By becoming so connected to the internet, we&#39;ve become disconnected with everything around us.</p>

<p>There should be a holiday or something, no smartphones for a day/year. It would improve so many people&#39;s lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Concur.  The screen is smaller, the content is less robust, and the urge to scrollscrollscroll is high.</p>

<p>I encourage my girl to do research on things affecting her, but she finds it fruitless cuz... she uses her smartphone.  Hard to research and learn from a 3 inch screen.</p>

<p>Not only are these things changing our behavior, they are limiting the scope of what we can access.  The whole entirety of the internet... reduced to a 3 inch screen.</p>

<p>It would be like studying Gnosticism using only twitter-sized packets of info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never had a smart phone. Most people accept it. Some make a funny face when I explain that I don&#39;t need one because I know where I&#39;m going before I leave (when I plan the event), I sit with my thoughts while I&#39;m waiting and that I watch the world around me instead of watching a screen.  It sounds really pretentious here but I don&#39;t think it sounds like that when I say it (I hope! People don&#39;t react that way at least).  But I have noticed that sharing a complex thought that requires a premise as a foundation for the rest of the thought is increasingly harder to do. Most people don&#39;t have the attention span to listen to two whole sentences back to back and then combine the two in order to create a bigger meaning. It&#39;s funny how often you end up interrupted after the first sentence.</p>

<p>The software part is without a doubt designed to be addictive.  Facebook execs have admitted as much.  I don&#39;t think they are deliberately giving people ADHD, but since they are aware of it now perhaps they make use of it and its after effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a few years I&#39;ve been convinced that  modern people are being mass-addicted to the internet and media. I&#39;ve seen young adults panic and cry without access to the web. Video game addictions that affect people so much they become temporarily violently aggressive. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Steam ect... all part of the problem. Every single time I&#39;ve expressed this idea people get defensive. The grips of the golden age of entertainment and advertisement is getting tighter on our youth everyday. It&#39;s funny how we call our time the information ag</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think how dependent on a smartphone a person is depends on their personalty mainly. It may also be a generational thing. I grew up in a time without cell phones and I find it really easy to just put the smartphone down and exist. I think not being able to disconnect from tech may be a bigger problem for younger people who have grown up with it. </p>

<p>For example I had a really hard time understanding the concept of &quot;cyber-bulling&quot; for a long time. I always thought that unless it was like a doxxing situation then who cares? It wasn&#39;t until someone explained to me that their online life was the &quot;most important thing to them&quot; that I started to get why it&#39;s become a thing.</p>

<p>As for making people dumb I really don&#39;t know. My opinion is that it probably doesn&#39;t make people dumb, maybe lazy due to having the internet in their pocket.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to thank the makers of all smart devices for providing me an alternative (although expensive) anger oulet. 2 phones smashed against floor/asphalt. One right into the wall. One stomped to smitherinees in bedroom. One dropped a 80 pound dumbell on, though accidentally, provided a &#39;haha, well shit, that&#39;s just meee&#39; moment at least. Possibly a repeated knuckle sandwich for another one but can&#39;t remember whether it broke.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s mostly watching others drift off mid-conversation as I realise there&#39;s nothing to do on my current old model except actually call people and somehow it feels like all this time I never wanted a gadget, but just an object to throw around that doesn&#39;t break easily.</p>
