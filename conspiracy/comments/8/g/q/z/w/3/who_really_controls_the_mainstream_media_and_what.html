       Majority of the mainstream media leans left.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a ton of bias. There are lies. There are false reportings of what actually happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the MSM (mainstream media), we are all meant to pander to minorities and feminists because they are perpetual victims of the evil white man.
      </p>
      <p>
       They hate Trump and lie about him constantly. They lie about the most trivial things regarding Trump; cropping footage and falsifying statements. I remember the most trivial thing I saw CNN lie about Trump was the whole Koi Pond overfeeding (where they cropped footage to deliberately lie about him; not just strip out context, but outright lie).
      </p>
      <p>
       Feminism is a complete joke at this point, an excuse for man-hating. Yet the MSM cater to their every whim, give them a podium, and allow the most misandric filth to be published in the name of feminism. They outright lie about things like the wage gap (myth), the findings of a particular study they are referencing, and use correlation rather than causation to make their points.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a severe amount of white-shaming going on. The MSM constantly is able to get away with inflammatory hate articles regarding white privilege, white people ruin [blank], dear white people, white people stop [blank]. Lesser MSM (places like GQ, Buzzfeed, and virtually every online news media/magazine publciation) will deliberately omit any violence/abuse/assault/hate from a colored person to a white person, but seeks out white violence/abuse/assault/hate to a colored person. Overall, the MSM are on this path of outright oppressing and shaming white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, all of this stuff spreads to all the secondary media outlets like GQ, Buzzfeed, IndieWire, etc, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       More on the ground levelyou have many US universities which have turned into an abomination. Students rioting and assaulting each other for differing opinions (usually if you like Trump, etc). You have colored people verbally assaulting their professors for not pandering to their ideological views of entitled special treatment. It's to the point where there are people (even at places like Harvard) screaming in the faces of their professors without repercussion. Neither the school nor the professor can discipline these whackos because of the cultural-political repercussions of not pandering to ethnic snowflakes. Some schools have even had students block only white kids from entering.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is tons of hypocrisy and unfairness resulting from this. You have places like the Boys Scouts now changing their name to omit "Boys" because women might want to join and we can't have their snowflake feeling hurt. Yet the girls scouts still don't allow boys to join at all, and aren't changing their names, and no one cares. Movies that don't have enough "strong" female characters are hailed as sexist and obliterated by the majority of critics across the board. You have Nobel Laureates getting fired for saying non-PC things about women, yet #KillAllMen is trending on twitter. You have men killing themselves 3.53x as much as women and the MSM could care less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the general public believe that Trump is a racist and going to deport their family members based on the false statements from the MSM. When you ask these people why they think this of Trump, they never have any answer. They mutter some shit about him saying we have an illegal alien problem, overlooking the "illegal" part of that sentence. They go on about the wall, meanwhile Hillary and Bill were proponents of building a wall for the very same reason around a decade ago. This stuff is completely overlooked in the MSM controlled hive mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway there are countless examples that I could give having cross-referenced this stuff on and off for years. There is a clear and obvious agenda to push these things at all costs regardless of how much lies, oppression, misandry, jobs lost, careers ruined, hypocrisy, etc is caused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously this is leading to conflict. Creating race wars. Making guys want to opt out of relationships (like in Japan). Making genders hate each other more than ever. Male suicide rates are up. White people suicide rates are up 36% in the past 18 years while African American, for example, are relatively steady.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the reason for all of this? Is it to quell overpopulation by literally making people hate each other, opt out of marriage, put off relationships, and put women in the work force (which is known to reduce birth rates).
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it the oligarchs attempting to regress Western civilization; opening borders to radicalized refugees, causing conflict and hate among us, etc.

       The MSM is now state run.  Kevin ship has a great video about this.  I can find it later.  There is the CIA, CFR, Bilderberg Group, and the bankers that all have a hand in this.  The MSM gets its talking points from the CIA, though.

       I totally agree that it is the NWO agenda. If you haven't caught on to what the agenda is about, just look around. It's everything the OP has described. Create a degenerate society that is lacking in morality/family values and you get the society that we have today. Devalue everything , including Male/Female roles. Oh you're a boy but you wanna be a girl? SURE... Go ahead. Where this agenda leads us is into the Abyss, where the scum sucking vampires thrive.  Que emperor Palpatine monologue.

       I'm a white dude. Dont really feel attacked at all from the media. There are a lot of reminders that people that are more fortunate need to be compassionate to other people.

       Dude over 90% of our elected officials are white males. Our president is a white Male. I wouldn't be so worried about society cracking down on white males. Our society usually changes to be more welcoming of other people. It's not an assault on your white balls.

       Perfect example of white shaming.  It is legitimately harder for a white person to get into college than minorities with the exception of Asians.  It is also harder for them to get corporate jobs against an equal or lesser candidate who happens to be a minority, because corporations go goo goo for increases in their diversity numbers.  If you don't believe that, I can provide you years of anecdotal evidence from my experience recruiting candidates for corporate jobs--where people were forced to take shitty minority candidates for jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you mock him saying he's claiming it's an assault on his white balls.  People should be concerned that everyone is getting an equal opportunity--including white people.

       It doesn't lean left.  Nor does it lean right.  The purpose of media is to sell advertising and push through political agendas.  So, it says what the readers want to hear.  However, do not confuse that with either left or right leaning.  There is obviously an agenda they are both pushing, regardless of who you vote for several things keep happening.  Immigration continues to rise, Mexicans are a convenient mask for the true mass immigration, which has increased even under Trump and that is Islamic mass immigration.  The media is screaming "Mexicans, Mexicans, Mexicans" meanwhile over a million Muslims moved in last year, and the same is expected this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are being dispersed across the nation, so you barely notice it, but you have been seeing more headscarves and burkas haven't you?  They will continue to steadily increase, just as they did in Europe.  You won't mind because they are still small in number and anyway "Mexicans, Mexicans, Mexicans".  Then suddenly you'll see mosques going up everywhere, laws being implemented to protect Muslims (same as Europe), then employment laws that promote 'equal opportunities' but it just means Muslims get first dibs on every job, all public housing will give preference for Muslim families, public schools will all give preference to Muslim kids, and just as Britain now has, top notch free hospitals will open to serve only the Muslim communities.  If you so much as fucking tweet about it you'll have armed police smashing your door in and you'll do 7 years in prison.  Then, just as in Britain, you'll find almost all the inmates are Muslims, the guards too are Muslims and they'll look the other way as the prisoners kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, why?  Is it because they want to rule over mouth breathing scum?  Middle Eastern and North African Muslims have a substantially lower iq than the rest of the planet.  Idiots are much easier to control.  Especially ones who follow such an easily manipulated religion.  Most Muslims have never read the Quran, the imams can tell them any old shit, then say the Quran commands it and they all fall in line.  Look at the stupid fuckers all wearing headscarves, nowhere in the Quran does it say women should cover their heads.  It says dress modestly, and that depends where you are.  Modest dress in Thailand is a 7 inch skirt and four inch heels.  Their own prophet used to enjoy being entertained by semi naked public dancers who were Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the only reason I can think of as to why they are flooding everywhere with low tier Muslims.  They aren't letting Indian or Indonesian or even Chinese Muslims to flood in, just the lowest level of shit they can find.

       I think you are missing the point. Money, for the rich, isnt an issue. Making money, isnt an issue, the elite are far more concerned with keeping themselfs in power and controling their interests on a global forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that society still has over arching architects, and US is no different. So the current agenda is securing US power on a global forum as EU, China and russian influence is on the rise. So the war machiences cogs are turning. Thats why everyone is pro war. Amongst other agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making money off news and mass media is just a bonus, but realise that vast majoroty dont subscribe to it as much. So where is that money coming from? The gov, they have made propoganda legal, meaning they fund narrative based news.

       Money is way down the list of priority.  The MSM is the propaganda department of neoliberal capitalism. It is more concerned with maintaining ideological control over the people, pushing state and pro-corporate agendas, demonizing dissidents and hiding counter-ideological facts.  For example, MSNBC is owned by military contractor General Electric, who is in turn owned by the major investment banks.  That's why they cheer on war in the Middle East and never questioned the 2008 bank bailout.

       OP, what left ideas do you see promoted, not attacked on the MSM since way before Bill Clinton's days.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM has been pushing the attack on Social Security since the 80s,
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM has been pushing racism, union of church &amp; state, racism, attacking education,
      </p>
      <p>
       along with supporting and pushing the wage suppression, the MSM never attacks the employers of illegal immigrants,
      </p>
      <p>
       Never attacks the ag or food processing giants about chemicals in our food,
      </p>
      <p>
       etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I had to quit reading after your first sentence.

       Distractions. It is meant to amuse and propitiate us and also serves as a source of tension and animus for people who we perceive are radically different from ourselves. If you detect overt biases and motives in news stories, then all the better; you're not really breaking new ground by pointing them out. What is not being discussed is vastly more important than what is.

       The way I see it is a combination of many different factors, 
let's start with the first step. Whoever creates a harmful narrative first has the upper hand, being as this is an election that's all one side needs to confirm their beliefs. Next the media reacts, with their image on the line, creates the most damage proof story towards the election. By this point it's pretty obvious that it is more one sided considering. In the last election the "proof" of being "unqualified" was undeniably towards Trump because the masses react to over the top stuff (like the bus video) not nitty gritty little dispositions in which Hilary had going for her. Next step is the algorithms, note that this world is run by $$$$ so more clicks = more money, so it's not hard to understand why so many "news" outlets were bashing Trump because people already saw what he was capable of saying/doing. The more clicks the higher to the top of the pages it goes, sort of click baiting people because its our nature to want to appease our cognitive dissonance. Sure there are legitimate articles that could show that Trump would do a better job but they don't get popular because it's not whats trending, and if you do share it chances are people will only judge on the pretense of "anti-progressive" or you know.

       The MSM is the propaganda arm of the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, the MSM is directed to turn everyone against Trump, by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time they are trying to divide the nation, politically, and racially. If the people unite, they would see the giant red white and blue dildo being jammed up their ass, and the people would turn against the government. Keeping the people divided makes them easy to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       This same tactic is used in prisons to control the prison population. When prisoners unite, they turn against the guards.

They are basically making fun of them how The Root a "pro black" publication owned by a gay white Jewish guy attacks straight cis black men and pushes an interracial agenda in the black community.

       There is definitely an interracial and anti-straight male + anti - nuclear family agenda being pushed on the black community. Literally the same skin tone and gender division is happening and has been for like a good 30 years at this point. I can't speak for the others on the anti-straight male but there's also an interracial agenda being pushed on asian communities. it's more multi-faceted than you think it is.
