    <div class="md"><p>Personally I can see how children having fun can be described as entertainment, especially for the grandparents the email was distributed between.</p>

<p>I saved the following comment which describes the event in more detail. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The party was an annual get together of friends who knew each other from having worked together as Congressional staffers. The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kKcwBDh.png">people invited</a> were men and women in their mid-50s, mostly married couples (except for the bottom row in that photo array). John Podesta and his wife were invited, but couldn&#39;t attend. I think Mary is actually the one who is friends with them because, the previous year, the invitation was sent to her email and she forwarded it to John because she was going to be out of the country.</p>

<p>In the email, she&#39;s letting the guests know that the pool is going to  be open and heated —even though the party was in October that year— so they&#39;ll bring their bathing suits. From the email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping
up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to
the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I’d share a couple more notes:
We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be
Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and
almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in
that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun,
and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever
attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so
we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the way, I don&#39;t know if you have ever played with kids in a swimming pool, but it is actually fun in a completely nonsexual way. They like to be thrown through the air and to stand on your shoulders and jump off and you can totally destroy them in a splash battle.</p>

<p>Mostly I&#39;ve done it with my own kids but the last time we were at a church picnic at a lake, three boys were pretend-attacking me (one on each arm and one on my back) and I walked out where it was deep enough that they were all floating so I could toss them around. Then the one on my back climbed a little higher and I couldn&#39;t move and the water was right up to my mouth! Haha, suddenly I&#39;m almost drowning! Since I didn&#39;t know how well they could swim, I didn&#39;t want to duck under the water to shake them off. Eventually I managed to take a step onto higher ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Np, also ninja edited - there was no reference to a &quot;hot tub&quot; which immediately has more sexual connotations than &quot;heating the pool&quot; - an example of how important language and syntax is, particularly with pizzagate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for the record, as a grown adult who has raised children, there were plenty of times over the years when my children were young that I referred to them as &quot;entertainment&quot; to our friends raising their own children. They are activity and bustle and occupy a lot of attention, hence &quot;entertainment&quot;. So just one vote for, I don&#39;t see this as odd in the slightest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please explain how you came to the conclusion I was defending child pork here. I&#39;d love to hear it. </p>

<p>For anyone curious 
Deepfakes were a type of video made by taking normal videos of celebrities and putting their faces onto porn stars making an extremely convincing but fake video of say for example, Emma Watson getting banged (also Nic Cage onto everyone is a very common use and how this began).</p>

<p>This thread was discussing how it was involuntary pornography for those celebrities and why it was banned from Reddit. (Similar to when they banned the fappening)</p>

<p>I correctly pointed out to another user in this thread who was concerned of people making child porn by stealing the faces of children and putting them into porn videos that it <strong>wouldn&#39;t</strong> be considered so because any video they put a kids face on would be a video from the porn industry of a 18+ woman performing and not a child. It would be glorified Photoshop, not child porn.</p>

<p>So can you explain how I&#39;m advocating for child pornography exactly? By explaining that words have meanings and definitions?</p>

<p>You&#39;re not very good at this. </p>

<p>You can find that on reddit and no one calls for it to be removed, let alone made illegal. Beyond that my original point in the comment chain you posted is that no children are actually involved in the sex or filming so it would be quite a stretch to say the end result is what most people would consider to be actual child porn (videos and images of actual nude or sexualized children). Weird you would try to conflate that with defending child porn as an industry - almost like you&#39;re intentionally trying to obfuscate my message.</p>

<p>Hey - at least I&#39;m getting you to have discussions about something other than podesta right? That&#39;s a first for you in almost over a year. </p>

<p>I mean, it kind of looks like that&#39;s what&#39;s <a href="https://ibb.co/fApBcx">going on there</a>. It&#39;s possible that it&#39;s just a bad example that makes that subreddit look worse than it actually is. Like that thread is taken out of context of larger, more detailed discussions going on there in other threads. The problem is that &quot;outsiders&quot; have no way of knowing what&#39;s going on and what&#39;s being discussed. Making a private subreddit for only certain &quot;chosen&quot; users to be able to discuss this subreddit with the mods is basically asking for people to suspect that something nefarious is going on, even if it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The ”chosen” users are users who have been active in conspiracy for a long time, and participate. Since the election, there has been a huge influx of users who come here to forum slide and manipulate comment sections. </p>

<p>Coincidencently, the only conspiracy they will claim exists is Trump Russia collusion, which has been pushed by the mainstream, project mockingbird media  </p>

<p>In particular, <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> is where many of these users come from. Rule 13 and the 2 month account rule was made to combat the brigades and forum sliding. They will stalk users, and have attempted to dox them in the past. </p>

<p>In case you are wondering why reddit admins allow the blatant site wide rule breaking, it is likely sanctioned as it has support from mainsteam media.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re willing to admit that global pedophile rings exist, can you describe how you think the operations/logistics of an elite pedophile ring operating out of Washington D.C. would work?</p>

<p>And that&#39;s your evidence that John Podesta is a pedophile - because a woman used the word pizza in a email sent to him about real estate and a lost handkerchief. </p>

<p>Those are the facts. It is very eyebrow rising and what I touched on is literally only the tip of the iceberg. </p>

<p>See if you can complete these simple steps to debunk pizzagate!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ciakx/some_simple_steps_to_debunk_pizzagate/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ciakx/some_simple_steps_to_debunk_pizzagate/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s Tony&#39;s weird art collection:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7aznh5/to_anyone_saying_tony_podestas_art_collection_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7aznh5/to_anyone_saying_tony_podestas_art_collection_and/</a></p>

<p>Take into consideration he calls Dennis Hastert (serial child RAPIST) a good friend.</p>

<p>Podesta also has a large subterranean vault under his house, and in Wikileaks dumps, he speaks of a &quot;torture chamber&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7a5coz/tony_podesta_has_a_huge_subterranean_vault/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7a5coz/tony_podesta_has_a_huge_subterranean_vault/</a></p>

<p>Again, this is just a small amount of circumstantial evidence compared to the mountains of creepy shit online.</p>

<p>And I didnt&#39;t even touch on the Epstein/Prince Andrew/Bill Clinton/Trump connection.</p>

<p>Is wrong. He doesn&#39;t call anyone a chicken hawk. He uses the hashtag chickenlovers.</p>

<p>How does a photo of a friend holding a baby with the hashtag &quot;chickenlovers&quot; indicate the activity of a pedophile and why would a pedophile post their pedophile proclivities in public? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, because everyone suspects the initial people named in pizzagate have something to do with the other stuff. The fact that Tony &amp; John were/are friends with a convicted pedophile (Hassert) deserves at least an explanation....how many pedophiles are you friends with? If I found out my friend was a pedophile, I would immediately cut ties with him, why didn&#39;t the Podestas?</p>

<p>All those cats are NTBT, imo. At the very least, some of this shit should be explained. But that has never happened, the narrative has been reduced to &#39;oh, you think kids were trafficked in a pizza parlor? FAKE NEWS&#39;, without really explaining or offering up an explanation of all the circumstantial evidence that IS valid, or DOES deserve further examination.</p>

<p>So where is the evidence he has to answer? If there is evidence of a crime he should absolutely be held accountable </p>

<p>As you said Susan Sandler emailed him to tell him about the handkerchief. Although actually it was Kathryn Tate the realtor who first mentioned the handkerchief. Because she is in the business of selling homes and wants to return property to people viewing her homes for sale - like a professional. </p>

<p>Was Dylan sexually assaulted by James in the Comet Pizza kitchen? I will possibly never know unless I ask Carole or Dylan in person. But that doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen.

<p>I&#39;m not saying pizzagate is confirmed real. I am very aware that the evidence for it is all circumstantial. Saying &quot;there are other explanations for this or that&quot; is all fine and good, and imo necessary, but it is not <em>disproving</em> something. Political figures around the world have been involved in human trafficking/pedophile rings before, and been involved in the coverups.

<p>So the <em>dominoes on cheese than on pasta</em> phrase is frequently cited as if it’s an example of some pedo code. Podesta didn’t even write that email he just received it. But with some context, which I’ve provided, it seems like a joke from an old man, Herbert Sandler. Which it is. </p>

return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that
we can demolish them.</p>

<p>Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.</p>

<p>I miss you both</p>

<p>Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p>

<p>Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>

<p>That’s how we know they vacationed together on Martha’s Vineyard </p>

<p>Shows they’ve played dominoes before in “MV” (Martha’s Vineyard), jokingly accuses Podesta of making up the rules as he goes</p>

<p>I just received the holiday package of pasta and sauce. If only I could make it turn out as special as you guys do. </p>

<p>That’s how we know he has gifted Sandler pasta the year before</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>the original email I quoted says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So instead of getting pasta like he had the last year, he got cheeses this year.</p>

<p>The joke is “do you think I’ll play dominoes better (remember, he got “whipped” on his last vacation) having ate the cheese you gifted me this year rather than the pasta you gifted me last year?”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t I just explain that? Top comment is the representative for the entire thread. It&#39;s just the way Reddit works because it&#39;s a linear forum.

<p>I actually agree with the debunk, but I don&#39;t think it should be the top comment because it creates a false consensus that &quot;this conversation is over&quot; or &quot;everyone thinks this is BS so I shouldn&#39;t read further&quot;, when in fact it is a complex topic with several avenues of discussion and tons of loose ends still.</p>

<p>And because TMOR is behind the up voting on it, and also stirring up drama to distract from the conversation, their activities in this sub should be nullified by any means. They are deliberately trying to make conspiracy research look misguided and irresponsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more so the fact that we don&#39;t really need the top comment in a thread (especially a stickied round table thread) to be a debunk of some kind. I don&#39;t mind the debunks and if it&#39;s about what I think it is then you&#39;re probably right, but the problem is when your debunk shoots to the top (seems fishy, mostly TMOR would up vote something like this) and makes the rest of the thread less attractive by nature.

He always had problems with one thing or another. He hated seeing any discussion about Pizzagate. He always caused drama about things. He was fucking full of himself, and now here he is acting in bad faith like our worst enemy, playing for team TMOR and making a whole bunch of drama out of this thread in an attempt to smear the mods and get back at them because he still has an axe to grind:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/8gsqkt/top_mod_hypocritically_engages_in_personal_attack/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/8gsqkt/top_mod_hypocritically_engages_in_personal_attack/</a></p>

<p>Hopefully that puts a few things in perspective. It&#39;s an ongoing battle. Some switch sides. But the true nature of the sub is still here, red pills are being dished out, so I can&#39;t really complain who comes and goes as moderator. My own power is expressed through sheer research and not having to deal with drama. I&#39;d rather research than deal with drama. The mods don&#39;t have an easy job especially when ego gets in the way, and let&#39;s be honest we all have an ego hiding somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? I would have hated his moderating, it sounds terrible. Posting Pizzagate on a conspiracy forum makes perfect sense, I just happen to not believe it.</p>

<p>After all this back and forth, you still assume I don&#39;t like the moderation because of partisan reasons. I specifically said I wanted mods the abstain from that sort of behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dusty was the &quot;ideal mod&quot; in most people&#39;s minds, but it didn&#39;t work out.</p>

<p>We also had a really great mod here Orangutan who was kicked out for having financial ties to a 9/11 movement. But he was an excellent mod.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is, everyone&#39;s different and each person brings along their demons and convictions. We&#39;ve had two &quot;ideal&quot; moderators who didn&#39;t last, and perhaps for good reason. It&#39;s probably for the best that things keep flowing and chairs keep changing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they would be &quot;ideal&quot;, stop implying that. You bring up mods I don&#39;t know as if I suggested they were good examples of impartial mods. Dusty sounds like a biased powertripper and Orangutan had i financial tie that disqualified him. I feel ok with both of them being de-modded.</p>

<p>Everyone brings their own biases, but I would hope they don&#39;t apply them to their modding decisions. Right now, I can&#39;t say that at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said they were ideal to a lot of people. I bring them up because they should have been the star mods who appeal to everyone, but they weren&#39;t. The point being, there is no mod who is fit for everyone. You may find yourself in a situation where you think a mod fulfills all of your ideals, but chances are, they are pissing someone else off at the same time. Orangutan for example.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve sometimes thought I would make a great mod here, until I realized people can and will find any reason to question your authoritative actions, and from there, it becomes a game of wit and ego. I&#39;d rather not get dragged into that when I&#39;m here to research conspiracies not play a part in a soap opera. I&#39;d rather just swing the ban hammer heavy and hard at those people and not look back or care who I pissed off. So I don&#39;t think I&#39;d make a good mod, even with all the insight and understanding I have about the nature of it.</p>

<p>You may feel differently, but I strongly feel the sub would be better if mods just didn&#39;t antagonize the people they mod.</p>

<p>All Joey does though, is very carefully shit on all conspiracy topics. With <em>miraculous</em> amounts of votes taking him right to the top. It is synthetic consensus. I actually think it is dangerous for me to poke someone like him this hard. I have probably banned 5 or 10 of his alts(conservative estimate) over the last couple years. I&#39;m actually tagging you right now to track on if you are one of his sock puppets. No offense.

Though it&#39;s worth noting, if all or the majority your posts to a given forum or subreddit are entirely or nearly entirely in opposition of said forum or subreddit, it shouldn&#39;t be surprising you would receive greater scrutiny as a result. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s right, just the way nearly every forum and sub operates, more or less. I try to be as impartial as humanly possible, personally, when I moderate, and understand that&#39;s not as easy for most to do instinctually. Perhaps one of the worst examples of biased moderation are <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>, where users are routinely banned without reason for having an unpopular opinion, or simply because the mods disagree with the user&#39;s point of view, in spite of no rule violation being present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, this is the weakest part of the pizzagate &#39;evidence&#39;</p>

<p>The &#39;real meanings&#39; of these &#39;codes&#39; were just a random image post on 4chan, nothing backing them up.</p>

<p>The real sort of &#39;damning&#39; thing that I&#39;ve never really seen an adequate explanation for is James Alefetanis&#39; instagram profile. Some real eye-brow raising stuff on there, with ACTUAL pedo-slang. No one has ever really explained why his insta profile picture is Antinous.</p>

<p>Also, Alefetanis has showed up on 4chan and threatened a pizzagate researcher with veiled threats of grievous bodily harm.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve dug so deep into this shit, and once you do, you realize &#39;pizzagate&#39; is a bad term, because it makes people think, &#39;oh yah, children in a hidden basement in a pizza parlor, riiiiight&#39; But the real issue is political pedophilia, which has been shown time and time again, in court documents no less, to exist. Once you understand the profile of a psychopath, you can begin to understand how most people in high positions of power ARE psychopaths; from there, it makes sense that they&#39;d get off on &#39;the destruction of something innocent&#39;, as it&#39;s the most transgressive thing ever and THEY can do it, also because it&#39;s the ultimate feeling of being God. These people don&#39;t experience empathy, compassion, fear, anxiety...they can only feel &#39;power&#39;.</p>

<p>TL;DR - political pedophilia is real, &#39;pizzagate&#39; is kind of a misnomer for what this investigation has become.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one hundred percent this. and to understand that the lefts hard push for sexual acceptance also includes that of pedophilia, and that this issue is global and not just within the usa. in the uk for example is career politician over here Harriet Harman actually put her name on a legal document supporting a group known as PIE(Pedophile information exchange) who supported relationships between pedophiles and young male adolescents claiming: “Paedophiles are ordinary, decent, sensible human beings, no more sexually depraved than yourself, and with a capacity for loving and helping children which is at present being repressed.” </p>

<p>If you, or I, were to go to work tomorrow and even suggest that we supported such views we would be fired and persecuted by those amongst us. However, for politicians this isn&#39;t damning? It shows how rife it.</p>

<p>Lumping them with pedophile claims is disingenuous and homophobic.</p>

<p>The &quot;<a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">How dare you</a>&quot; method of disrupting a discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were homosexuals liaisons between adults. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Washington Times <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/File:Franklin-nyt.gif">reported</a> there were &quot;call boys,&quot; not adults. The book <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Document:The_Franklin_Scandal">The Franklin Scandal</a> explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Washington Times reported that Spence spent $20,000 a month on prostitutes for himself and his associates, and that he had the juice to arrange midnight tours of the White House for himself, his friends, and the “call boys” whose services he leased. Paul Bonacci told Yorkshire Television that he was one of the “call boys” who took a midnight tour, and corroborated that King and Spence were partners in pedophiliac pandering.</p>

<p>A June 30, 1989 Washington Times article, “Power Broker Served Drugs, Sex At Parties Bugged for Blackmail,” revealed that audio and video recording devices were hidden in Spence’s home, and discussed his penchant for blackmail. A month later another article reported that Spence used sexually compromising photographs taken in his home to blackmail an associate.</p>

<p>Spence even told the Washington Times that his home had been bugged by “friendly&quot; intelligence agents, and he continually dropped hints to friends and colleagues that he was freelancing for the CIA. The CIA denied this, but the Washington Times confirmed that Spence was a CIA asset. “We had sources disclose that Spence wasn’t a direct employee,” says Rodriguez. “But he did carry out services for the agency.” </p>

<p>Without a single victim having come forward?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be very difficult for victims of human trafficking to just come forward, especially if they&#39;re very young kids, which they would be in this case; if not toddlers.</p>

<p>Actually I will link you to a victim: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5opvyd/i_was_sexually_assaulted_8_years_ago_by_the/">I was sexually assaulted 8 years ago by the Pizzagate guy, owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis AMA!</a></p>

<p>Very interesting case. A lot of info was scrubbed. I&#39;m sure you can find some archives/screen shots out there. He posted a picture, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s in the thread. I know he 100% posted a picture. He would&#39;ve had to put in a lot of effort to fake all of this. </p>

<p>Here are some alleged emails between the victim and James Alefantis: <a href="https://archive.is/SHacU">https://archive.is/SHacU</a></p>

<p>The story goes that James Alefantis raped the guy in the AMA, and he <em>also</em> raped Comet Ping Ping Co-Owner Carole Greenwood&#39;s son. He apparently raped him in the kitchen. Now I do remember reading an article where Carole&#39;s son stayed over in a big house together in Georgetown. I&#39;ll have to find that. My point is, they do have a link. </p>

<p>I think the question is, why did Carole Greenwood quit Comet Ping Pong? An article has stated that it was due to family reasons. Did James Alefantis do something to her son?</p>

<p>That person&#39;s claims involve them being an adult when sexually harassed. As bad as that <em>might</em> be (given that it&#39;s a completely anonymous accusation), it&#39;s no where near the accusations of pedophilia, murder, or trafficking.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when people ask for victims, they&#39;re not saying to show us victims coming forward. They are asking for evidence that the victims even exist. Were any of the accused behaving strangely right before a child they were involved with disappeared? Was blood found in their freezer? Do people consistently go missing after meeting them? These would be examples of some kind of evidence that the victims even <em>exist</em>.</p>

<p>Pizzagate simply has none of this evidence. Only anonymous accusations. And in the case of the link you sent, not even really &quot;pizzagate&quot;-related, since they were not a minor, and weren&#39;t trafficked or murdered. Like I said earlier, not excusing that behavior <strong>if</strong> it&#39;s actually true, but it hardly supports your claim that pizzagate victims exist.</p>

<p>It means that if he has raped a young boy/man like the AMA alleges, then he is obviously more likely to rape/have already raped more young boys/men. Also how is it anonymous if he showed his face? He was verified by the moderators. </p>

<p>What are you talking about? When people ask for victims, they are absolutely asking for victims to come forward. Evidence that victims even exist? Did the pictures of toddlers with black/purple bags under their eyes (due to sleep deprivation in my opinion) not do it for you? The child chewing on Euros. </p>

<p>Actually since you want a bit more evidence than what I&#39;ve already described, I&#39;ll link you a video from 2007. Washington neighborhood commissioner Frank Winstead staged a nighttime surveillance of a Northwest pizza place and put the resulting video up on YouTube -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXBrEXmowo">In the background of this video, you can hear a young girl <strong>yelling for help</strong>!</a> The couple walking by is confusingly turned around by the sound, as it is coming from Comet Ping Pong! It is NOT any of the children walking with the family, it is coming from Comet Ping Pong. It may even be coming from the sewer manhole... It is not a child &quot;horsing around&quot;. </p>

<p>Frank Winstead had no idea what he captured. He was filming because he had a lot of bones to pick with Comet Ping Pong, one of them being Comet&#39;s wish to stay open until 3AM. Frank thought it would attract crime to the area. </p>

<p>In 2008, ANC Commissioner Frank Winstead accused the owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis, of &quot;seeking to turn the quiet stretch of Connecticut Avenue in Forest Hills into a haven for rape and murder.&quot; During the course of the meeting, Winstead accused Comet owner James Alefantis of lying, cheating, stealing, spitting in a customers food, and encouraging both murderers and rapists.</p>

<p>Maybe also because she dared blame the U.S. military, with its vast budget &amp; international resources?  And every pre-Pizzagate pedo-ring scandal supports that conclusion?  Meanwhile it looks like I&#39;m supposed to pay more attention to a Pizza shop who flaunt pedo symbols, than to the multi-trillion-dollar Pentagon.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what the &quot;original report&quot; would be, let alone where to find it. I think the guy I linked was replying to someone who uploaded some documents or something. Or you can submit a FOIA request, like they did. But I&#39;m not sure what a report like this would say. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much meaningful information that can be recorded (other than the allegations) when there&#39;s no witnesses of a crime (or victims).</p>

<p>Generally speaking, police investigate crimes, not people. It can get really murky, civil rights-wise, if police go around shaking people down for little/no reason. Without evidence of a crime, like a witness or a crime scene to pin on a suspect, there&#39;s not much for them to go on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve suggested in the past that pizzagaters hire a personal investigator, but I&#39;ve never seen anything come of it. However, after researching the evidence/accusations myself, I&#39;m not even sure any investigator would take the job (since I don&#39;t think the clients would be too happy with the results). The &quot;evidence&quot; Pizzagaters are going on basically boils down to accusations and speculation, mixed in with a hefty dose of lies/misleading information. And anybody who disagrees with them opens themselves up to personally targeted attacks, which I see happen all the time.</p>

<p>Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary ‘attack the messenger’ ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach.

This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.</p>

<p>I refuse to post them because Reddit is a potential military/intelligence propaganda wet dream, mods are unelected &amp; unaccountable, and even this thread is being manipulated.  </p>

<p>Moreover, as I wrote in this thread in a now-hidden comment, the Military-Industrial-Pedo Complex (as Eisenhower should have called it) is way bigger than a Pizza Shop or the Clinton Foundation.  CF has $250 million, and the Pentagon has famously &quot;lost&quot; trillions.  Why wouldn&#39;t the military love a decoy Clinton scandal?  According to Fiona Barnett, the U.S. military breeds their own off-the-books children for sex, slavery &amp; sacrifice.  Why bother with risky human trafficking?  They just breed their own -- which was also suggested by The Finders children who had never seen running water, television or electricity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s his administrations policy, proposed <a href="http://wgntv.com/2017/03/07/us-considers-separating-children-from-parents-at-border-dhs-secretary-confirms/">last year</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently, when adults enter the country accompanied by children, they are generally released into the US and able to stay in the country, pending disposition of their cases, the official said.]</p>

<p>The proposal would allow US immigration officials to separate children from the adults they came here with. The adults could be kept in detention, and the children could be moved elsewhere under protected status, possibly with family members already in the country or to state protective custody such as child protective services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was supposedly a policy for families entering the country illegally.  But they aren&#39;t only doing it to illegal immigrants or people charged with crimes. <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2018/03/07/mother-and-child-seeking-asylum-separated-in-the-name-of-deterring-immigration/">They are doing it to asylum seekers and people with no charges</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/us/immigrant-children-separation-ice.html">handling of the children</a> is concerning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Children removed from their families are taken to shelters run by nongovernmental organizations. There, workers seek to identify a relative or guardian in the United States who can take over the child’s care. But if no such adult is available, the children can languish in custody indefinitely. <strong>Operators of these facilities say they are often unable to locate the parents of separated children because the children arrive without proper records.</strong></p>

<p>Once a child has entered the shelter system, there is no firm process to determine whether they have been separated from someone who was legitimately their parent, or for reuniting parents and children who had been mistakenly separated, said a Border Patrol official, who was not authorized to discuss the agency’s policies publicly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were being very secretive about it and downplaying prevalence, but it was [recently revealed] that approximately 700 children have been separated from their parents:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Officials have repeatedly declined to provide data on how many families have been separated, but suggested that the number was relatively low.</p>

<p>But new data reviewed by The New York Times shows that more than 700 children have been taken from adults claiming to be their parents since October, including more than 100 children under age 4.</p>

<p>The data was prepared by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services that takes custody of children who have been removed from migrant parents. Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which processes migrants at the border, initially denied that the numbers were so high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are there any contemporary accounts of the incident? I couldn&#39;t find anything other than third-hand accounts after Epstein was already in trouble. James Patterson wrote this like a decade after Epstein&#39;s accusers went public and he doesn&#39;t cite any sources. The closest I could find was this <a href="https://pagesix.com/2007/10/15/sex-case-victims-lining-up/">article</a> written when Epstein was already in some deep shit and it doesn&#39;t mention Trump at all (Epstein denied it, by the way).</p>

<p>Regardless, I&#39;m not sure how much this account, if true, helps Trump. It means he was good friends with the guy for decades before another &quot;wealthy&quot; man made a big deal about. Sounds more like Epstein simply picked the wrong girl. The worst is they didn&#39;t even file a complaint with any authorities. Doesn&#39;t exactly make Trump look like the good guy here.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t be sure this story is completely fabricated, but I think it&#39;s fair to say that had this information been about Podesta, pizzagate proponents would probably not brush it off as readily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate goes on both sides of the political isle. “Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager running an elite sex ring out of a pizza shop along with other DNC heavyweights” is disinformation. NXIVM is part of the “elite sex ring” without a doubt. Allison Mack is singing like a bird and she is just the tip of the iceberg. This is a global problem and it’s a global network.  </p>

<p>The statute is &quot;18 U.S. Code § 1591 - Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion&quot;</p>

<p>This statute covers sex trafficking of children AND adults.</p>

<p>Mack has been charged under the clause which may or may not include children as I&#39;m reading it. </p>

<p>Do you have any articles which describes the ages of Jane Doe 1 &amp; 2? Particularly the one which describes them as 12 year olds? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will be dismissals and controversy in this topic. Expect red herring political smokescreens with partisan lies and ridicule. Go beyond. Pizza toppings are just theories. Be more selective with your conspiracy here people. The monsters don&#39;t want to be found and a real story lurks in the networks beneath. </p>

<p>For the deniers, lets start with the undeniable monsters. Jimmy Saville. Mark Dutroux. Shocking and disturbing. The facts are chilling. But isn&#39;t it strange how brazen, boastful and connected they were?</p>

<p>Whilst they imply Royal associations the tentacles go beyond elite Hapsburg bloodlines. The Michael Aquino cases involved military cover-ups. The Franklin Affair was neutered by judges. The Finders torn apart by the media. The point is that establishment rings are the usual suspects for this conspiracy. </p>

<p>So it may be more relevant to ask why than ask who.. 
So why?</p>

<p>Is it a recipe for Disassociative Identity Disorder? Some macabre twist from MK-Ultra programs to condition the most appalling human programming? 
Or is it less weaponised and more trade related? Consider how sheiks are sweetened with bacha bazi dancing boys and there is a pattern in Middle East oil negotiations. Is this some commoditised trade network to do blind eye despot deals on the resource chessboard? 
It plausible if you consider the main pizza references emerged after unforeseen leaks of state dept emails after Hilary&#39;s email server got gang hacked by spooks. </p>

<p>But then why would so many priests get caught in this controversy? Is there is also some extreme sociopath behaviour that is more prone to corrupt inside these individuals? Or perhaps there is something more sinister and organised in society? Something that penetrates all power institutions? If so what the fuck is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it makes perfect sense that select, high-ranking government people would be into pedo stuff. A lot of these people get into government because they&#39;re narcissists who crave power, a typical trait for narcissists. Another typical trait for narcissists: feeling above the law/morality. Combine a lack of morality with a craving for extreme dominance and control, and you have a recipe for a rapist or pedophile. </p>

<p>It is when you accuse other of being guilty of what we&#39;re opposed to, and trying to raise awareness of, because people like you would rather sweep it under the rug and allow children to be molested.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t referring to &quot;Pizzagate&quot; which I am equally skeptical of, however doubt the majority here are guilty of what you claim, objectively. It&#39;s illogical to assume so, at best. </p>

<p>As far as Pizzagate being partisan, there are certainly partisan undertones to it for some, and a number of those who apolitical who subscribe to the theory. I&#39;m more inclined to expose <em>actual</em> pedophiles in the hope that they are brought to justice. </p>

<p>See my post above for perspective:</p>

Why do you think people would go to such trouble when it&#39;s much easier to just bribe people with money and power?  The cult you mentioned is just that--a cult.  Cults do weird things and so do religions.  But there is no &quot;sex trafficking&quot; in America and there sure as hell are no &quot;child sex rings&quot; here.  It&#39;s difficult to find adult prostitutes online and it&#39;s nearly impossible to find anything that a pedo would be interested in, so how do you people think that these rings are getting together?

<p>I&#39;m a bit skeptical of your intentions, and your apparent lack of information as to what happened between Ryan and James.</p>

<p>Ryan filed an actual police report and James was confronted by law enforcement. This actually happened dude. </p>

<p>I see people smearing Ryan all the time, probably out of desperation to cover up that loose end. Alefantis threatening an actual online researcher is a very damning piece of evidence.</p>

<p>Anyway, i dont get what that picture is supposed to show. Alefantis&#39; name is nowhere on it, all it shows is that this Ryan guy complained to the police about somebody making terroristic threats. Is there anything that actually shows that police confronted Alefantis about the supposed text message conversation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So nothing short of a confession from James himself, can convince you that Ryan is telling the truth? Why would he file a fake police report?</p>

<p>If he&#39;s faking this thing, than James could sue him for slander or fabrication, correct? Then why hasn&#39;t he? My guess is because Ryan&#39;s story is true, and that James doesn&#39;t want this incident *anywhere* near a courtroom, especially with the circumstantial evidence against him in PG circulating. </p>

<p>Would a full written elaboration on the incident help? My job isn&#39;t to convince you, but I hope you can see there&#39;s clearly something strange going on here. </p>

<p>Thanks for providing me with the Opportunity to present this piece of the puzzle. </p>

<p>Anybody can sue anybody for anything. That doesn&#39;t mean they would win. He would have to prove that not only was Ryan lying, but also that JA was hurt by those lies. Not an easy thing to do.</p>

<p>All Ryan would have to say is: &quot;I thought it was him, although it could have been a troll.&quot; There would be virtually no way to win this kind of case (I challenge you to find a successful similar case of slander/libel). No lawyer would encourage such a waste of resources.</p>

<p>Not to mention that a lot of people are aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">&quot;The Streisand Effect&quot;</a> and would rather avoid drawing attention to a case they probably couldn&#39;t win.</p>

<p>Regardless, Ryan&#39;s story simply doesn&#39;t add up:</p>

<p>Also, the reason as to &quot;why&quot; he would make it up is obvious; is/was his YouTube channel monitized or not? Also, what would Alefantis have to gain by suing for libel aside from people like you just seeing that as more &quot;evidence&quot; of trying to cover something up?</p>

<p>There definitely isn&#39;t any evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>His only proof was screenshots.</p></li>
<li><p>He claimed he <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rhyrl/i_am_the_owner_of_pizzagategearcom_and_the_guy/dd7eysq/">&quot;tried&quot;</a> to record their conversations <em>twice</em>. One of the times he had a &quot;buddy&quot; next to him and neither of them thought to at least video-record the conversation. The next time, Alefantis gives him a warning before the supposed call, but Ryan still doesn&#39;t record the conversation (despite having allegedly been threatened before).</p></li>
<li><p>He claimed to have reported Alefantis to the FBI and that they told him not to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rhyrl/i_am_the_owner_of_pizzagategearcom_and_the_guy/dd7dycw/?context=3">&quot;poke the bear&quot;</a>. Yet, he continued to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcppgo_Slk-_BeGVZtyqONw">talk about PG</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/pizzagategear.com">selling pizzagate merchandise</a> for like a year afterwards.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the FBI really looked into it, why haven&#39;t they found anything? Why didn&#39;t he ever provide evidence of the report?</li>
<li><p>If the FBI is &quot;in on it&quot; and/or he were really threatened by Alefantis, why would he continue to sell pizzagate merchandise and vlogging about pizzagate?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t look like he took the threat very seriously.</p></li>

<p>I guess vlogging on youtube is more important than threats from a man he&#39;s accusing of murder. Funny how nothing ever came of the report. His local PD must be in on it, too, and their defending the child rapist thousands of miles away! /s</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about that. I&#39;ve mentioned that libel lawsuits are pretty difficult to win. Even if he did give the police a name, his defense in a lawsuit could <em>easily</em> be &quot;I thought it was JA, but I could have been wrong/trolled/whatever&quot;. How can anyone prove he was lying, rather than wrong?</p>

<p>But even if he prove he lied, JA would still need to show that those videos specifically caused him some kind tangible harm, which is also fairly difficult.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s say he did win the lawsuit, that would still do absolutely nothing, zilch, nada, in placating pizzagate believers.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more likely JA doesn&#39;t want to feed the fire by launching a lawsuit that would only bring unwanted attention.</p>

</ul>

<p>And here&#39;s a transcript of the alleged Facebook chat with James Alefantis which if you read it looks like it was written by an idiot.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The screen-captured chat went as follows:</p>

<p>Alefantis: Just the Pegasus video. Figure out how to do it — no waves.</p>

<p>O’Neal: I am a super reasonable guy. You don’t have to scare me like that.</p>

<p>Alefantis: You can keep your kill room shit about the rest of it. Fix this and we are reasonable.</p>

<p>[Alefantis then sent a picture of O’Neail and his mom].</p>

<p>Alefantis: Thanks. Feel ok?</p>

<p>O’Neal: Not really. Just threatened to kill everybody.</p>

<p>Alefantis: No need for all of that.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Deleted the video.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Good. Blame YouTube.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Delete the thread on Voat too?</p>

<p>Alefantis: They are taking things down. I think be more creative. Say you think it’s nothing or something — it’s your culture. CAlm down and think about it first.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Ok.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Let’s look and discuss. This might be ok. Thank you. Let me know when you have calmed a bit.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Give me a week.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Ha. Welcome to my world. Call me quick I’ll be nice this time. I appreciate you taking down.</p>

<p>O’Neal: I’m riding around with somebody. Gimme a minute.</p>

<p>[Alefantis then sent a picture of O’Neal and his girlfried].</p>

<p>Alefantis: Cute</p>

<p>O’Neal: Is that you being nice?</p>

<p>Alefantis: Not yet. So call quick then I can go to bed with less worries.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Mods deleted posts on Voat. 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Ok. What’s mods?</p>

<p>O’Neal: Moderators.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Humm draws attention?</p>

<p>O’Neal: They deleted because my content was removed I guess. Reason: 1 2 3.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Humm. Looks there.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Says deleted. “It looks like you are trying to make money off this.” Link doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Alefantis: That’s on Voat. ?.</p>

<p>O’Neal: About to call.</p>

<p>[At this point O’Neal called Alefantis back and said that “he was nicer” but still assured him he “would die” if he did not pull the video down].</p>

<p>Alefantis: Ok. One more thing this “happened to me.” YOU — created this. You can uncreate.</p>

<p>O’Neal: It’s an interesting subject. Just doing research on a hobby basically. I would never want myself or family to have any harm done because of this.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Meaning — you created it for yourself — you can uncreate. Yeh well it’s good you didn’t end up like Welch — in jail for 35 years. Or everyone who ‘s getting sued. You can find a much more profitable and beneficial hobby.</p>

<p>O’Neal: I mean nothing I did was wrong but wrong or not it’s just not worth it.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Actually lots of what you did is illegal. And punishable. But it’s expensive to sue. So people don’t do it. I can explain it to you someday. There would also be criminal — state charges on some of it. But you would need someone smart enough and connected who wanted to make sure it was enforced. And so far you don’t have that.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Took down the video. You win by a landslide.</p>

<p>Alefantis: So go to sleep. Thank you for that. It’s appreciated. And by the way this story is a pack of lies.</p>

<p>O’Neal: What is it then? Pure garbage?</p>

<p>Alefantis: Yup. I mean that wall is the same wall.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Oh I confirmed that lol.</p>

<p>Alefantis: But what the hell does that mean. And our families deserve to be safe.</p>

<p>O’Neal: No doubt. What y’all building in the room? Why the trenches?</p>

<p>Alefantis: You are too much man. On the edge of total destruction — still curious?</p>

<p>O’Neal: I’m curious for myself. No worries.</p>

<p>Alefantis: FBI liked your videos. So there is something. And. PLUMBING. Have you ever run plumbing?</p>

<p>O’Neal: lol.</p>

<p>Alefantis: To build a room it’s not trenches. Any basic construction moron would see the differ next.</p>

<p>O’Neal: So the kill room stuff was just a joke?</p>

<p>Alefantis: Difference</p>

<p>O’Neal: IDK about that stuff.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Ugh.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Sorry sorry I’ll stop.</p>

<p>Alefantis: You don’t know what. It’s a freaky room.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Construction.</p>

<p>Alefantis: that’s why people put shit on Instagram.</p>

<p>[Alefantis then texted a photo of an old job in which O’Neal worked on]</p>

<p>Alefantis: You never moved pipes I guess. You are a decorator.</p>

<p>O’Neal: I designed a few bars. You like? You’re quite the designer.</p>

<p>O’Neal: They’ve been talking about Pegasus for awhile.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Everything they say about me is true. Except I don’t like kids. At all. You should soon take all your shit down. Busted for profiteering.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Goodnight. Take it down now or later?</p>

<p>Alefantis: It’s your culture.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Maybe all. Prob best. Disappear. Profiteer gone. I’m going to protect my family now. Now or soon.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Will do.</p>

<p>Alefantis: And I don’t really want to hear about you again from anyone. Night Ryan.</p>

<p>This sounds like more of an opinion of yours, than fact. </p>

<p>Do you have any actual evidence to support this claim? I understand Ryan runs Pizzagategear.com, I&#39;ve spoken with him on a few occasions. </p>

<p>Did Ryan confess to faking the IM conversation, or is that just a &quot;nothing to see here, move along&quot; &quot;Jedi wave&quot; attempt to deter others from taking this piece of evidence legitimately?</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t and everything points to Ryan&#39;s story being true. I understand you are passionate about discrediting the Pizzagate scandal, but it&#39;s going to take more than just your opinion to &quot;debunk&quot; this. </p>

<p>Why? Most of us here wish this wasn&#39;t real. Unfortunately, there are a myriad of strange connections and a mountain of circumstantial evidence, that seems to paint a very dark picture of some sort of criminal activity. People here are just doing what they consider their duty, by being a part of the citizen investigation to expose those involved. </p>

<p>&gt;I won&#39;t be silenced for disagreeing with you, and others.</p>

<p>Of course not. That being said, a disagreement would be fine, but your highly motivated and systematic approach to &quot;debunking&quot; each piece of evidence brought up, may be seen as disingenuous and agenda driven by some of the users here. Especially given the nature and purpose of this sub.</p>

<p>Well, you saying it&#39;s &quot;clearly bullshit&quot; doesn&#39;t make your opinion superior in any way, and in fact shows that you can&#39;t PROVE it&#39;s bullshit, just state it baldly like it&#39;s fact when it isn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Scary!</p>

<p>You&#39;re not a &quot;Truth seeker.&quot; You&#39;re one of many cultists making up sick fantasies to intentionally or unintentionally distract from real occurrences of child abuse. And I don&#39;t even mean the crimes your &quot;God emperor&quot; is accused of. It&#39;s not a game. Real shit happens but you want to get off on being special.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if you&#39;re too brainwashed to know better, that&#39;s tragic but maybe better optics than you doing this and being self-aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His thread is going to be interesting to watch!</p>

<p>Nonetheless politics aside, one thing I never see discussed is psychology behind why elites engage in pedophilia. Personally I have my own theory. I read in article years ago that one way chimps display dominance is stealing the baby from the mother chimp and then eating it in front of them (the article below describes such behavior). Seeing as how humans are related to chimps, I believe this is why the elites engage in pedophilia and other sexual assault. See it’s one thing to be able to dominant and exploit a person. It’s an entirely different level of power and evil to be able to exploit someone’s children and for them to be powerless to stop it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-extradition-four-mexican-nationals-international-sex">https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-extradition-four-mexican-nationals-international-sex</a></p>

<p>Between 2000 and the present, members of the STO (the “Traffickers”) have used false promises, physical and sexual violence, threats of the same, lies, and coercion to force and coerce adult and minor women (the “Victims”) to work in prostitution in both Mexico and the United States.</p>

<p>In most cases, a Trafficker entices a Victim – frequently a minor – in Mexico.  The Trafficker then uses multiple means to isolate the Victim from her family.  In some cases, the Trafficker uses romantic promises to induce the Victim to leave her family and live with him.  In other cases, the Trafficker rapes the Victim, making it difficult for her to return to her family due to the associated stigma of the rape.  Once a Victim is separated from her family, the Trafficker frequently monitors her communications, keeps her locked in an apartment, leaves her without food, and engages in physical or sexual violence against the Victim.  Traffickers often tell Victims that the Traffickers owe a significant debt and that the Victim must work in prostitution to assist in repaying the debt.  Traffickers typically begin forcing the Victims to work in prostitution in Mexico, frequently in a neighborhood of Mexico City known as “La Merced.”   Victims are often required to see at least 20 to 40 customers per day.  Traffickers monitor the number of clients a Victim sees by surveilling the Victim, communicating with brothel workers, and by counting the number of condoms provided to a Victim.  Traffickers typically require the Victims to turn over all of the prostitution proceeds to the Traffickers. </p>

<p>The simple answer is that the &quot;threats&quot; didn&#39;t actually happen and Ryan faked the whole thing. That report doesn&#39;t actually show what he told the police.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7l5vhe/voat_researcher_ryan_oneal_exposed_the_location/drkavv3/">reported the supposed threat</a> <em>hours after</em> he made/uploaded the video you link (you can check the upload time <a href="https://citizenevidence.amnestyusa.org/">here</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>His only other evidence was screenshots. He&#39;s from Texas where a simple google search reveals conversations can be <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/reporters-recording-guide/state-state-guide/texas">lawfully recorded.</a> Why didn&#39;t he record any of his conversations with the police, or the FBI? He even admits that the thought went through his head. Yet, no action...</p></li>
<li><p>He claimed he <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rhyrl/i_am_the_owner_of_pizzagategearcom_and_the_guy/dd7eysq/">&quot;tried&quot;</a> to record his conversations with JA <em>twice</em>. One of the times he had a &quot;buddy&quot; next to him and neither of them thought to at least video-record the conversation. The next time, Alefantis gives him a warning before the supposed call, but Ryan still doesn&#39;t record the conversation (despite having allegedly been threatened before). Why didn&#39;t he ever call him back and record that?</p></li>
<li><p>He claimed to have reported Alefantis to the FBI and that they told him not to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rhyrl/i_am_the_owner_of_pizzagategearcom_and_the_guy/dd7dycw/?context=3">&quot;poke the bear&quot;</a>. Yet, he continued to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcppgo_Slk-_BeGVZtyqONw">talk about PG</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/pizzagategear.com">selling pizzagate merchandise</a> for like a year afterwards.</p>

<li>If the FBI is &quot;in on it&quot; and/or he were really threatened by Alefantis, why would he continue to sell pizzagate merchandise and vlogging about pizzagate? It doesn&#39;t look like he took the &quot;threat&quot; very seriously. Or it was, you know, made up.</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Right, because people never do things for money. /s</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t only selling t-shirts. He was begging for donations on his channel and he had a Patreon.</p>

<p>Although, it&#39;s really funny that you talk about plausibility when discussing pizzagate of all things. His videos are about taking a &quot;killroom&quot; hashtag on instagram as evidence of a literal murder. The replies on the picture also include a comment about werewolves, so I guess they&#39;re literally talking about man-beasts that roam the earth! /s Yet, in your mind, Ryan finding a &quot;killroom&quot; without evidence of the actual &quot;kill&quot; is more plausible than him trying to take advantage of gullible people? Ok.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh come on, do you believe everything you read in GQ? there were party planners ahead of him on that list for crying out loud lol. What kind of &quot;power&quot; do you think these people have? He was dating David Brock at the time, which would have put him on the radar for a magazine of GQ&#39;s caliber...</p>

<p>Regardless, if JA is so &quot;powerful&quot; why did Ryan continue posting Pizzagate nonsense (after a short break) on his channel and selling pizzagate merchandise on his site? If you were threatened by such a &quot;powerful&quot; foe, would you also do the same? Either he didn&#39;t take the threat (from a man he&#39;s accusing of murder) or the warning from the FBI seriously, or the &quot;threat&quot; and talks with the FBI were simply fabricated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>f this is all a stunt as you claim, then why hasn&#39;t Ryan been arrested after filing the false report?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because, short of a confession, it&#39;s virtually impossible to prove. The police aren&#39;t going to waste resources putting an investigator on a fruitless effort. It was a pretty low risk move. A move that he didn&#39;t make until <em>hours after</em> he recorded, edited, and uploaded his youtube video (almost as if he wasn&#39;t going to report it until people started asking for evidence). We also don&#39;t know exactly what he told the police.</p>

<p>But, again, forgetting that, if he was really threatened and reported those threats to the police, why didn&#39;t he ever record <em>any</em> of these interactions? Not just JA, but he could have called back the police and recorded himself asking questions or giving details/evidence about his report. He could have recorded the FBI telling him not to &quot;poke the bear&quot; (a point which you completely ignore). If any of his claims were true, he&#39;s had ample time to prove them. But, let&#39;s be real here. If <em>you</em> were threatened by a &quot;powerful&quot; man that you are accusing of <em>murder</em> and the fucking <em>FBI</em> told you to back off, would you continue hocking PG merch and vlogging about it?</p>

And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, &gt;&gt; and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever &gt;&gt; attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so &gt;&gt; we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was nothing about live stream Web cams on the blog and it wasn&#39;t run by Tamara. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63l7zm/tamera_lozzatto_from_the_invite_only_emails_zoom/dfvgvb3">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63l7zm/tamera_lozzatto_from_the_invite_only_emails_zoom/dfvgvb3</a></p>

<p>This was a blog of cute baby pictures with a few videos. Tamera Luzzatto did not run the blog, Evie&#39;s father did.</p>

<p>The blog was not invite-only until internet stalkers started harassing the Luzzattos. </p>

<p>There is a little bit archived here: <a href="http://archive.is/3nW3z">http://archive.is/3nW3z</a></p>

<p>There were more pictures archived on sli.mg but that site has been down since mid-January.</p>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s nothing unusual about the photos <em>at all</em>. </p>

<p>Also, the father tries to make humorous remarks on nearly every picture. People are trying to insinuate that there&#39;s something sinister about the phrase &quot;raw and uncut&quot;, but that&#39;s just the way he writes. </p>

<p>EDIT: Well, after looking at the header on the archive.is page, I figured out there are more pages archived.</p>

<p>Here is the biggest group of pictures: <a href="https://archive.is/2g30Y">https://archive.is/2g30Y</a></p>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s nothing suspicious about <em>any</em> of the pictures.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://archive.is/8PZDn">here is the first post on the blog:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is where the magic happens!</p>

<p>Welcome! If you are here you are one of the first people to view Evie&#39;s blog! And our friends should thank us---by indulging ourselves with this web portal we are NOT filling your inboxes with large files of pictures and videos! </p>

<p>Enjoy and we will look forward to your comments....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://archive.is/Gm498">another one from that day:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evie&#39;s first day</p>

<p>Here is Dad the night I was born. Very glad he didn&#39;t make it through Organic Chemistry to become a doctor, this site doesn&#39;t inspire confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it is the father who made the site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except this video and her allegations were debunked years ago and can be traced back to the satanic panic of the 80s and 90s.</p>

<p>This interview came from a psychiatrist who claimed that people who have experienced trauma suppress their memories, and a certain kind of treatment can recover these memories. </p>

<p>It turned out to be total bullshit. It&#39;s basically the power of suggestion and coercing events. It actually had devastating consequences as a lot of people went to jail from people all of a sudden &quot;remembering&quot; things that didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>After the satanic panic subsided, the psychiatrist admitted it was flawed. </p>

<p>&quot;Stuff You Should Know&quot; covered this in more detail in <a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/the-satanic-panic-of-the-1980s/">their podcast.</a> </p>

<p>Satanic panic began with this book, Michelle Remembers </p>

<p>Get informed about this stuff, none of these satanic cannibal pedo sex rings had been proven true. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was first pointed out in the United States that no material evidence of ritual or satanic practices had been forthcoming in any of the cases in which they had been alleged. In Britain the position has been substantially the same as far as allegations of satan-worshiping rituals are concerned. As one journalist put it, in a phrase that has become well-known: <strong>Investigations have produced no bodies, no bones, no bloodstains, nothing.</strong> In the United States, the only adult witness to corroborate the testimony of children in a case has continued to claim that her evidence was given ‘to get it all over with’ and was the result of plea-bargaining. An FBI agent, Kenneth Lanning, has reported that he has been unable to document any satanic murders in the United States. While this book was being written, a report of a very large study carried out be Gail Goodman and associates in the United States claimed that none of the cases reported to them produced any evidence of the existence of organized satanic worship that included sexually abusing children.  </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>During the 1980s and 90s a moral panic about alleged satanic ritual abuse occurred, mainly in parts of the English speaking world. This was propagated by certain psychotherapists, social workers, Christian fundamentalists and law enforcement officials. Some of the cases ended in prosecution and imprisonment. Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have had several incidents of alleged SRA which received national and international news coverage. Other countries have also had isolated events in which abuse or murder took place with satanic ritual elements, including Argentina and Brazil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that was obviously a cover up.  It&#39;s definitely real.  The victims who speak out are far more convincing than some &quot;expert&quot; debunking. </p>

<p>They haven&#39;t been proven true because they own the system.  They continue to get away with their crimes because of the apathetic public.   They created the system.  Court houses are actually Satanic Temples created to take away humans natural law.  <a href="https://aim4truth.org/2018/05/04/the-british-crown-runs-the-u-s-legal-system/">https://aim4truth.org/2018/05/04/the-british-crown-runs-the-u-s-legal-system/</a></p>

<p>These are the richest people in the world doing this stuff.  The &quot;El- ite&quot;.  It is in the name itself.  These rulers are satanists and they can continue to cover up the truth because they created the entire system.  </p>

<p>Just look at Michael Aquino...  The guys started an off shoot of the The Satanic Church called the Temple of Set.  He is an admitted Satanist and he was in charge of US military psychological operations.  If that doesn&#39;t bring up any red flags in your mind, you&#39;ve been got.  Satanists run the world, of course their not going to bust themselves.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to chip in with what will undoubtedly be seen as a provocative post.  Human sex trafficking is being blurred purposefully by the media.  On the one hand, there is the very real child trafficking from third world and war other torn countries, this trafficking is being carried out by organisations most people think are &#39;there to help &#39;.</p>

<p>However, the lines are being blurred by the adult trafficking, where, it is claimed the women thought they were getting jobs as cleaners or au pairs but were forced by wicked men into prostitution. These are almost always complete bullshit. Allow me to explain. </p>

<p>I know of a couple who operated in Paris, they would go to cambodia, Vietnam and northern regions of thailand to recruit prostitutes. They would arrange visas, pay for flights and provide accommodation. The girls all knew they would be prostitutes, but told their parents that they had been offered real jobs in France.  This couple would provide all clients for the girls and until their debt had been paid they needed to pay 30% of their earnings to the couple.  Once the debt had been paid they just paid 10% of their earnings.  All of this is made clear to the girls. </p>

<p>So, off they went to be prostitutes.  Even with the 30% deductions they would be making more money than they could ever hope to earn in their home countries.  Please remember these girls are whores, they were whores back home too.  One thing whores do better than anything is lie.  They lie to punters &quot;you&#39;re so handsome&quot;, &quot;i love a fat man&quot;, &quot;i prefer older men&quot; etc.  They lie to their friends and family &quot;i work at the airport&quot;, &quot;i have a rich boyfriend&quot; etc.  Yet you all think that when the police raid their brothels they suddenly become bastions of truth? </p>

<p>Think about it. They get raided and they have two choices,  tell the truth and be immediately imprisoned, have all their belongings confiscated and await deportation.  Or,  say they thought they were going to be a cleaner but the evil men forced them to be whores. This story will get them immediately put on a working visa, authorities will try to get them proper jobs,  pay for their education and give them full welfare rights.  No surprises for guessing theyll claim to have been trafficked. </p>

<p>Just go on holiday to Thailand. Go to any border control and look at the queues of young girls all waiting to get in.  You can see the girls who are wanting to get in to become whores, and there are thousands of them.  Often travelling alone or with just one other friend.  There is an over abundance of girls willing to be whores. The same is true of eastern europe, they are awash with prostitutes. Why would you need to force anyone to do something that an over supply of people are willing to do?  You wouldn&#39;t! </p>

<p>These adults who claim to have been trafficked are being used as a smokescreen for the real trafficking that is going on.  Almost all the busts are dealing with adults, not kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think about this as if everything that Podesta/Alefantis was accused of as merely coincidental just to see if it changes my mind. </p>

<p>The freaky art and performances are simply a progressive, urban art style that my simple conservative mind can’t understand. </p>

<p>The association with known pedos and deviants like Epstein, Silsby, Clinton, Weiner, and Richards are all coincidental. Just because their associates are guilty of certain crimes, doesn’t mean that Pgate is automatically true. Their relationships are established as somewhat close but not necessarily beyond a business capacity. These are wealthy people after all. </p>

<p>Bill Clinton really is Chelsea’s father and Danney Williams is a hoax. We can never definitively prove either parentage without DNA, no matter how similar in appearance Hubbell/Williams may be to their alledged progenitors. </p>

<p>All of the weird sexual comments involving minors and murder are unfortunately timed private jokes not meant for widespread scrutiny. </p>

<p>All of the money associated with the political connections are no different than when conservative heavyweights promote their causes, and does not indicate a black market cabal. </p>

<p>Clinton et al. really are simply progressive patriots that only wish to champion liberal causes and ideals but can’t escape constant stumpings by Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the response to the new Qposts. Especially: #FutureProvesPast #TrustNoOne I think people need to start looking at the connections with Jones, Stone, and Megyn Kelly. Joe Biggs left Infowars after he was covering the weird emails from Podesta involving pedo language. Then Alex went on and on about a False Flag and blaming him/Infowars. Well what do you know. It happened, exactly like he said. It was like he had &quot;good intel&quot; or he &quot;knows the Globalist&quot;. Because some dude shot a computer in Ping Pong Pizza parlor and it was blamed on infowars. Then Megyn Kelly did an interview with the owner of Ping Pong Pizza to discredit Infowars when she was still on Fox. Then the lawsuit emerged from the owner of Ping Pong Pizza and Alex made an official statement about it being fake. It was no longer discussed. Then there was the epic Megyn Kelly interview where it was a supposed &quot;hit job&quot; on Alex. He recorded her and posted. Blah blah blah. Then when you go back in time before the election during the debate hosted by Megyn Kelly she asked Trump the question about women. That was the one where Trump said, Only Rosie O&#39;Donnell. Roger Stone resigned from the campaign (Trump claimed he fired him). Then a little later he joins Infowars. All of this is very weird. Jones has been in a lot of films and the media all make fun of him. He seems like he doesn&#39;t even bat an eye to all the negativity. It is looking to me like that is his job. It doesn&#39;t bother him and he is not afraid, because he is in on it. He has people all over the place using him as a &quot;scapegoat&quot; to make fun of &quot;truthers&quot;. He freaks out with hysteria and fake crying. He makes sure guest don&#39;t say certain things.  It&#39;s like he is, &quot;controlled opposition&quot;.</p>

<p>Or better yet....they are all connected to the SEX CULT! Go to minute 3:30 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0-Sf4Fo9OM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0-Sf4Fo9OM</a></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Actually I will link you to a victim: I was sexually assaulted 8 years ago by the Pizzagate guy, owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis AMA!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That person&#39;s claims involve them being an adult when sexually harassed. As bad as that <em>might</em> be (given that it&#39;s a completely anonymous accusation), it&#39;s no where near the accusations of pedophilia, murder, or trafficking.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when people ask for victims, they&#39;re not saying to show us victims coming forward. They are asking for evidence that the victims even exist. Were any of the accused behaving strangely right before a child they were involved with disappeared? Was blood found in their freezer? Do people consistently go missing after meeting them? These would be examples of some kind of evidence that the victims even <em>exist</em>.</p>

<p>Pizzagate simply has none of this evidence. Only anonymous accusations. And in the case of the link you sent, not even really &quot;pizzagate&quot;-related, since they were not a minor, and weren&#39;t trafficked or murdered. Like I said earlier, not excusing that behavior <strong>if</strong> it&#39;s actually true, but it hardly supports your claim that pizzagate victims exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what the &quot;original report&quot; would be, let alone where to find it. I think the guy I linked was replying to someone who uploaded some documents or something. Or you can submit a FOIA request, like they did. But I&#39;m not sure what a report like this would say. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much meaningful information that can be recorded (other than the allegations) when there&#39;s no witnesses of a crime (or victims).</p>

<p>Generally speaking, police investigate crimes, not people. It can get really murky, civil rights-wise, if police go around shaking people down for little/no reason. Without evidence of a crime, like a witness or a crime scene to pin on a suspect, there&#39;s not much for them to go on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve suggested in the past that pizzagaters hire a personal investigator, but I&#39;ve never seen anything come of it. However, after researching the evidence/accusations myself, I&#39;m not even sure any investigator would take the job (since I don&#39;t think the clients would be too happy with the results). The &quot;evidence&quot; Pizzagaters are going on basically boils down to accusations and speculation, mixed in with a hefty dose of lies/misleading information. And anybody who disagrees with them opens themselves up to personally targeted attacks, which I see happen all the time.</p>

<p>Because he has been widely implicated in a political pedophile/trafficking ring and accused of using pedophile codewords. </p>

<p>So where is the evidence he has to answer? If there is evidence of a crime he should absolutely be held accountable </p>

<p>If you were accused of such a thing and could easily explain yourself, why wouldn&#39;t you?</p>

<p>Because acknowledging such ridiculous claims can only be damaging. </p>

<p>If you replaced handkerchief with keyring or mobile phone it would still be strange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t agree. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who emails someone to tell them they left a hanky behind and do they want it returned? What is a pizza related map and why was it on the handkerchief? Why is this mentioned in the email as if it is significant?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you said Susan Sandler emailed him to tell him about the handkerchief. Although actually it was Kathryn Tate the realtor who first mentioned the handkerchief. Because she is in the business of selling homes and wants to return property to people viewing her homes for sale - like a professional. </p>
