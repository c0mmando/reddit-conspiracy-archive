       Definition from the Urban Dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       incel
aka "involuntarily celibate", a person (usually male) who has a horrible personality and treats women like sexual objects and thinks his lack of a sex life comes from being "ugly" when its really just his blatant sexism and terrible attitude. incels have little to no self awareness; even when they see other "ugly" men with girlfriends, they consider these men to be tricksters who have somehow beat the system and can get women despite being cursed with unattractiveness (in other words, theyre respectful to women and women are attracted to their personalities, but incels cant comprehend such a phenomenon). they believe that women owe them sex, and many of the more extreme incels like to spend time in incel communities on the internet coming up with ways to make women have sex with them (often involving genocide of people of color, genocide of "Chads" (men who have sex), taking rights away from women, raping them, having sex with women's dead bodies, and other horrid, disgusting things. they cant understand that that is PRECISELY why women want nothing to do with them).

       This isn’t a control issue at all. I’m suggesting that if you wish to provide a definition of the topic at hand and have a good faith discussion about it, then posting an egregiously biased, highly caustic, and immature definition from a website where pretty much anyone can define anything they want in any manner they see fit with very little checks and balance isn’t the way to go about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the sheer number of places you can find a relatively neutral, and reasonable definition or description of the term “incel” for the sake of discussion, no sane, rational, intelligent human being is going to cite urban dictionary as a source unless they are trolling, or they supplied said definition. Period. End of story.

       "INCEL
"Involuntary Celibate". A frustrated virgin who feels as if the world owes them sex. A self-described 'incel' is highly likely to blame their virginity on the other 6,999,999,999 people on the planet rather than consider that maybe the problem lies inward.
Mark's started calling himself an 'incel', because he can't get laid.

       That's the rub. By merely existing, attractive people are on a huge advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just about getting laid tho, attraction factors into other parts of life like getting a job. It's a harsh reality of life. But it is a reality, and I think they deserve sympathy, not ridicule.

       Well they just need to suck it up and get on with life then. Not everyone gets to win all the time. Sure they may have been dealt a worse hand than most but it's no excuse to think that rape should be legalised.

       Slut culture is ruining modern women. Thanks to the "media" being a slut is praised as liberation. What a fucking joke. The "incel" movement forms from the adoration of slut culture. It stems from people living in massive cities where the women are able to be absolute sluts without the general population finding out. This is an impossiblity in a small town environs where every action is known. Find a nice Christian farm girl if you can. They are moldable. You can create a nice wife out of them. A party thot? Never wife material. Maybe bang one behind a dumpster but don't take the slut home.

       Christians have been brainwashed their entire life. The unprogramming process is quite easy. And once that takes place you replace their Christ with your chiseled body. It's that simple. Get one like that and they will never leave you. Which might be a bad thing if you have commitment issues.

       One earlier this week said that moderation of this sub is their "job". I told them that that is the wrong attitude. The mods are members of the community first. They are equals among us. The second they start seeing their arbitrary "voluntary" position as a job the power has already gone to their head. We need stuards not masters.

       I get where you're coming from. I have to admit that I sort of agree with him, though. You might find a woman who is compatible with you, but if she has been corrupted by the degenerate media there is a high likelihood that you will eventually divorce for one reason or another. Whether its due to cheating or any of the other mind viruses that can lead to dissatisfaction. A good, loyal, humble girl is a much safer bet.

       I agree completely, this definitely goes both ways and I was speaking from a male perspective. But I do think that men and women are different. If I were speaking from a female perspective, I think I would argue that you should find a loyal, trustworthy, industrious, non-degenerate man with good self-control. Most men these days are degenerate soyboys, and they deserve as much blame as degenerate women for the decline of society.

       Men and women are different and both bring separate values to the table. The entire conversation indicating women are either to be treated like garbage or molded in to servitude is an insult to all women. This leads one to believe the only thing men
       <em>

       value from a woman is how she fucks him and/or how she caters to him. Its caveman logic.

       I could be wrong, but I don't think he was advocating that they should be molded into servitude, but instead molded into loving wives, mothers, and homemakers. You may disagree, but I find that women are generally a bit more conformist than men, and that they are less likely to go against the grain. By finding a good innocent girl who hasn't been poisoned by the degenerate media too much, you can help prevent her from falling into that trap and guide them towards a healthier attitude and outlook on life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically, women were valued as homemakers and men as providers and defenders. I think they are both equally important roles.

       This actual comes from how she was raised by her own mother &amp; father dynamic, not by what her man wants her to be.  I imagine you would be hard pressed to find a girl that was not raised with a loving mother/caretaker and develop those traits because that's what you wanted her to be.  Not saying it's impossible, but girls generally mimic their role models (mothers/grandmothers/aunts/sisters).

       I have no issue with women being homemakers or bread winners. I am both of those in my household, like many other women today.

       Wrong.  So wrong.  You're basically falling into the trap that the incels face and this goes to all the conversations you and I ever had.  From a comment i made above:

      <blockquote>

        It's a product of a society and culture that has radically changed over the last 40 years from a more centralized, extended family culture to an isolated, broken home structure where extended family is gone, community is a desert called the suburbs and the children of these families exist in a latch key environment (both parents working, divorce, single parents). Especially in their teen years, these isolated kids literally miss out on the developmental stages 10-18 year olds need like socialization, dating, getting jobs, learning to be an adult, etc etc.
       </p>
       <p>
        As despicable as their behavior can be, incels are a product of a sick society in transition and these millions upon millions of kids are falling through the cracks. This is probably the third generation to start this broken ascent started during the Gen X formative years.

       And I am here to tell you and everyone with the toxic thinking you exhibit that you are wrong and that there is a way forward out of your pain and the morass of the adult child existence.

       When discussing incels and folks broken this way, it does them a disservice to blame things outside of themselves.  This is the ultimate form of projection as a human uses the focus on others as a way to avoid the real problem: themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fix what ails the incel, their needs to be a committed effort to look within and focus on the issues facing the incel themselves...not the perceived sluts or the chads or the normies but the broken and immature habits left inside these incels by a home life that did not meet their needs as a growing child.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once again, when one makes excuses for one's own behavior and blame others, someone is not only avoiding their own culpability they are eschewing the only way to ever get better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I help people like this everyday.  I am always willing to talk privately to folks like this and help them start the road to recovery which in the end, brings them peace and happiness in their own hearts.  Can you imagine being happy and content IRL?

       No it absolutely is not manufactured. It's a product of a society and culture that has radically changed over the last 40 years from a more centralized, extended family culture to an isolated, broken home structure where extended family is gone, community is a desert called the suburbs and the children of these families exist in a latch key environment.

       It shouldn't be. I am a voluntary celibate, simply because sex is overrated, I used to be a sex addict who had tons of it and need to keep this in check, am a Gnostic who practices stoicism, detachment, and self control. I value my free time and finances to be used for what I want much more than sharing it with someone who (its only my turn to be with), and we spend our childhood being free, being children who play and do not concern themselves with sex (Jesus: Be Like Children)
      </p>
      <p>
       So I am a Voluntary Celibate (Volcel), am proud of it, but every so often hook ups happen and that's fine too. I simply dont do relationships or cohabitation.

      <p>
       Its not weird, its fine. We are just hated on because we are free from the prison system of (You absolutely have to be with someone, have kids, and be the beta provider to "her")

       Look, don't get me wrong, it certainly is nice to have, feels great, and it can be a deeply profound experience when shared with someone you love and who loves you to connect on the level, sure.

       However, Sex is a tiny % of our overall lives. In a certain sense, it is merely a program of these animal bodies to perpetuate more animal bodies to be born. It can become an addiction. People manipulate and control each other over it. People are imprisoned and trafficked over it. When you are done, you don't care about it anymore and are right back to clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, its such a powerful enslaver of logic that people who have almost zero resources and are on the brink of starvation in 3rd world countries, will still fall under the spell of lust, make more babies, all despite the fact that they live in areas where there is hardly even enough resources for those who are already alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sex is fascinating when you are a horny preteen leaking out the ears and you do anything you can get to get it, keep it around, and have it a lot. Once you get older, get into a relationship, and only have it a few times a week, it becomes boring, mundane, overrated, and just a tiny fragment of what life is about

       I’m no one to disagree with your choices. They are personal, they affect only you and they matter only to you. I think it’s admirable that you have been able to make that choice. Many of the brightest minds in history (Newton, Tesla, etc) made the same/similar choice. But for most people, given the choice without much repercussions, they’d pick sex over almost anything else. Generalization, of course.

       Yea I agree. I was fortune enough to have had access to lots of sex and different women since High school/college and the guys a grew up with always had new girls coming around, so it was plentiful/abundant. However, almost all my life issues and troubles were because of whatever Woman was in my life either lying, stealing, creating drama, anger, jealousy, her or me cheating, and so on, and my time between relationships, I found, were always filled with my learning a new craft (beer brewing, motorcycle building, Kefir/Cheeses, DIY flotation tank, traveling to India/Japan, staying at a monastery, etc)

      <p>
       Also as someone who now owns paid of real estate, investments, and is partnered up in a metal works side business that is starting to bring in more profit, the juice is not worth the squeeze to get married knowing I am risking the loss of half of everything I worked my ass off to get in a future possible divorce rape scenario.

       Heck even guys like John Cena, now that hes acting in Hollywood, had his GF sign a 75 page agreement before her moving in, specifically because the money he makes he uses to feed his Mother and Siblings, one of which is special needs/handicap, and hey has stated openly that no woman and relationship is worth the risk of him losing everything he's working for thus far to be able to support his family members with:

        Before Nikki Bella moved in to John Cena’s home back in 2013, he made her sign a 75-page cohabitation agreement that said she would have to vacate his home with her things as soon as possible upon their potential split.
       </p>

        “This is what my life is. This is what it’s become,” Cena told Nikki. “You met my family. You think my mom paid for that house herself? She didn’t. My brother lives in that house, they’re expecting a child. My younger brother, he’s got medical problems. I make sure he’s okay. I always tell them, I’m a horrible brother, but I try to be the best provider that I can. I just don’t want to ever be in a position where that’s in jeopardy.”

       So I am part of a new Generation of Men, where we are conscious enough to understand Western Programming, the stats on divorce, that sex/woman/relationship is never EVER worth losing half of what you worked your life thus far to build up, and that these days NSA sex is always on hand with dating apps/bars, etc or that sometimes a quick yank and some pron is the easier, cheaper, more efficient route to release that excess energetic sexual need and move on with your life .

      <p>
       I actually had parts to set up a high speed dual liquid cooled overclocked PC to put together for Bitcoin mining, which I never did because after work, most of my time was going to this girl I was dating at the time. She would get jealous when she was over and I was working on my projects, and of course with sex, would convince me to give her all my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never got that rig built until a year later and never ended up mining BTC until much later like when it already got to $200. I still made some $ off of it, but missed out on millions because of a woman

       This is getting off-topic I guess, but I updated my post to indicate that I believe intentionally keeping your virginity is an inherent part of being a volcel. "I used to be a sex addict who had tons of it" kind of indicates that you don't fit the description.

       regardless, as a member of r/mgtow there is a massive shift of Men becoming conscious to the System, the wage slavery, the theft of attention/energy/time/resources by others, that "A diamond is a girls best friend," is a scam created my a marketing company, that diamonds only have value because of same said marketing company, that you don't have to get married and have kids, that you can focus on yourself and the things that you want to do instead of getting married and supporting another person and the kids you create.

       As far as incels, its pretty sad that
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/xyx3k9b65pv01.jpg">
        people like Ex-Reddit CEO Ellen Pao
       </a>
       are going after these kids and marginalizing them even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there are nerds, beta males, males with aspies/autism, socially awkward and all that who stay virgins for longer periods of time, but that doesnt mean that you should be a fucking bigot like Pao towards this group of young men.
      </p>
      <p>
       This hate towards these communities is happening because people are becoming awakened to the bullshit social contracts and are choosing to no longer partake in them, or they are marginalized because of them

       It’s kind of Ironic, First they were saying it was the excessive masculinity that was causing men to use guns and kill people, now it’s literally the opposite. 
How about people just agree that crazy people are crazy and need help. 
As I side note, I would love to meet an incel in real life, just to tell him theses words of wisdom “If you want things to change, you must change”. 
This world is not made for weak men. (weak, mentally as well as physically)

       It's a symptom of modern culture. They've ruined interpersonal relationships for a lot of people with the internet. People feel lost and hopeless due to a lack of socialization. Being depressed, desperate, and lonely people lash out because they have no idea who or what to blame for their life not working out as 'normal'. Incels, sjw, furries, and whoever else I'm missing are all the same fundamentally they just express it in differing ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the crime and violence of kids with no hope is going to get better, you are wrong. People lack purpose and identity so they lash out.

       Yes, definitely manufactured. TPTB spent the last 100+ years driving the sexes apart so we'll be lonely and depressed and sexually frustrated -- both men and women. They do it both for divide and conquer and because it helps profit margins (sad lonely people are better consumers). So now they create this absurd category of "incel" and go on-line and get a bunch of guys to believe in it and adopt it as part of their ideology and identity, which just serves to further drive the sexes apart. Yes it was manufactured or created by TPTB and led by them at the top, but there are still many regular guys who have bought into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many women will not even agree to go out with guys any more, afraid that if they don't agree to have sex they guy will freak out on them. Better to just stay at home, watch movies and use a vibrator.

       Shameless hookups have literally never been easier with the likes of Tinder and other dating apps.
      </p>

       You could argue that this is a negative as there is more focus on one and done met ups than real meaningful relationships. But to say that they are pushing a sexless society is silly.

       Ugly people always had a hard time getting laid and that has always been the case. The only difference between now and 100 years ago as it's now considered bad form to just straight up buy a wife, but even today people still do that.

        Many of the brightest minds in history (Newton, Tesla, etc) made the same/similar choice. But for most people, given the choice without much repercussions, they’d pick sex over almost anything else. Generalization, of course.

       Yea I agree. I was fortune enough to have had access to lots of sex and different women since High school/college and the guys a grew up with always had new girls coming around, so it was plentiful/abundant. However, almost all my life issues and troubles were because of whatever Woman was in my life either lying, stealing, creating drama, anger, jealousy, her or me cheating, and so on, and my time between relationships, I found, were always filled with my learning a new craft (beer brewing, motorcycle building, Kefir/Cheeses, DIY flotation tank, traveling to India/Japan, staying at a monastery, etc)

       Also as someone who now owns paid of real estate, investments, and is partnered up in a metal works side business that is starting to bring in more profit, the juice is not worth the squeeze to get married knowing I am risking the loss of half of everything I worked my ass off to get in a future possible divorce rape scenario.

       Heck even guys like John Cena, now that hes acting in Hollywood, had his GF sign a 75 page agreement before her moving in, specifically because the money he makes he uses to feed his Mother and Siblings, one of which is special needs/handicap, and hey has stated openly that no woman and relationship is worth the risk of him losing everything he's working for thus far to be able to support his family members with:

        Before Nikki Bella moved in to John Cena’s home back in 2013, he made her sign a 75-page cohabitation agreement that said she would have to vacate his home with her things as soon as possible upon their potential split.

        “This is what my life is. This is what it’s become,” Cena told Nikki. “You met my family. You think my mom paid for that house herself? She didn’t. My brother lives in that house, they’re expecting a child. My younger brother, he’s got medical problems. I make sure he’s okay. I always tell them, I’m a horrible brother, but I try to be the best provider that I can. I just don’t want to ever be in a position where that’s in jeopardy.”

       So I am part of a new Generation of Men, where we are conscious enough to understand Western Programming, the stats on divorce, that sex/woman/relationship is never EVER worth losing half of what you worked your life thus far to build up, and that these days NSA sex is always on hand with dating apps/bars, etc or that sometimes a quick yank and some pron is the easier, cheaper, more efficient route to release that excess energetic sexual need and move on with your life .

       I actually had parts to set up a high speed dual liquid cooled overclocked PC to put together for Bitcoin mining, which I never did because after work, most of my time was going to this girl I was dating at the time. She would get jealous when she was over and I was working on my projects, and of course with sex, would convince me to give her all my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never got that rig built until a year later and never ended up mining BTC until much later like when it already got to $200. I still made some $ off of it, but missed out on millions because of a woman
