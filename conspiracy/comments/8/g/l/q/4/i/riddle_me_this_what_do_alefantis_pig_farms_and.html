        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The long awaited NWO goal line was just inches away, and people were getting arrogant and careless…look how sloppy and lackadaisical Hillary was with her secret email server security, which led to the Piecznick coup and the Clinton Foundation scandal revelations, which led to more email investigations, which, with help from Anthony Weiner, led to James Alefantis and Pizzagate!</p>

<p>Comet Ping Pong is pretty gay | Pizzagate | Know Your Meme</p>

<p>Deceased at Comet Ping Pong | This is Deceased when they pla… | FlickrSo we’ve been thinking that in the case of Comet Ping Pong, that it’s just become part of the cultural norm. The art. The music. Listened to one of the musicians that plays there and the two songs I listened to were about shooting up drugs and having sex. Alefantis seems to Comet Ping Pong a hidden gem in D.C. music scene | WTOPdelight in being a provocateur. So much so that he brought on the heat. As far as the elite politicos go, seems like classic narcisstic and sociopathic behaviors. Entitlement.</p>

<p>James Alefantis is the owner of Comet Pizza, Comet Ping Pong, Transformer Museum and Pegasus Museum – the one that he strangely never mentions.  Many on Steemit have speculated that some sort of “kill room” or “holding center” for trafficked children exists there and others think that it is a shell business to hide illegal transactions; then again, those things are not mutually exclusive. Perhaps he doesn’t mention it because he is embarrassed about a failed business venture??  He became a man of high interest to the Inside Comet Ping Pong â Forbidden Knowledge TVtruther community after the leak of the Podesta emails last year. His suspicious behavior, disturbing taste in art, reputation as being one of the most powerful men in Washington DC, and his controversial instagram posts added fuel to the PizzaGate theory fire. Is there a sinister side to Alefantis, is he linked to child trafficking and money laundering… or is he innocent?</p>

<p>Some of the controversial posts on Jimmy Comet (Alefantis) Instagram account pertained to a pig farm in Emmitsburg MD called Whitmore Farm. It had me questioning the connection, farm, restaurant, trafficking/missing people. But I can see how a farm could be useful in many ways now.  Some are pig farms. Great, cause pigs eat anything and everything. Organic seems to be the food of choice for them. Clean, healthy living I guess. I think other people know more about the organic connection then I. Also, many farms are usually isolated, private. Much like private islands. I just found it odd that so many seem to have gone into the culinary food industry and had farms.</p>

<p>So Alefantis is connected to a pig farm. Ok. Then there’s some info tying Kent Ozkum as Head Shepard and Pig Herder at Whitmore Farms and he just so happens to be a pain medicine/ anesthesiologist!  “so when you look up Kent Ozkum in FB, almost all the articles and post that are pulled up are friends of Alefantis….mostly all live in DC, and one reviewer or whatever works at THE DEPT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. Thats a whole lotta federal love for a PIG FARM”.  James Alefantis makes a lot of references to “oysters” meaning strong pain medication. We also found this article proving we were on the track of the same Kent Ozkum.  Since 2003, Morrow, a former EPA scientist, and Kent Ozkum, an anesthesiologist, have provided humanely raised pork, lamb, and eggs to chefs. Is his buddy Kent helping him out?</p>

<p>This first occurred to me a few weeks ago when I read that Alefantis owns a farm, and he’s talked about them producing their own ingredients for the restaurant. It’s all too convenient, the kids, the ritual sacrifices, processed meats. We questioned that if these evil people were hurting or molesting very young children, surely some are dying on a routine basis, right? Hard to think about it I know. But then you have bodies to deal with in a way that leaves no trace or suspicion. How better than to eat them or feed them to the pigs for disposal?</p>

<p>We then did some more digging. At the edge of the CIA grounds is a pig farm that John Podesta worked at for 2 years while at Georgetown law school. It’s not far from the UAE “slave mansion” on Turkey Run and the Saudi trafficking house.  The farm was within a walking distance from the Saudi house that caught on fire. Saudi diplomats lived at that house. There had been a scandal at the mansion before, as they held the house help (maids) like slaves and the maids passports were confiscated by the diplomats. Nothing was done to them because of their residence status; i.e., they had diplomatic immunity.</p>

<p>The address of the mansion and the farm, however, ran chills down my spine. They’re both right next to the CIA headquarters. So now I’m wondering whether the home was a brownstone operation and/or whether the fire was covering up evidence.  The house burned down around the time everyone was searching around trying to find out where the tunnels under Alefantis’ Comet Ping Pong were, where they led to, and what was happening in the basement.</p>

<p>The entire block where James Alefantis’ Comet Ping Pong and Comet Pizza is located AND the burned UAE mansion is owned by the Prince of Saudi Arabia that was arrested last week.
John P. worked at the pig farm while he was going to college. He loved killing pigs and still brags about it.</p>

<p>Claude Moore Farm was once called Turkey Run Farm.  The pig farm map had a river called The Long Tom river running right next to the farm.  The Long Tom River near Tom’s River, New Jersey has a lot of pig farms in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Then we found this interesting piece of trivia from 2009 by Politico while digging:</p>

<p>Podesta cooks dinner every night he is in town, as he did when his three children lived at home, and thought nothing of introducing them to exotic foods like frogs’ legs, sweetbreads and squid. He and his wife seldom eat out and entertain about once a week.</p>

<p>Talk of pig roasting and slaughter kept popping up during dinner and was the last tale Podesta told before the guests left. To earn money while attending law school at Georgetown, he spent two years working at Turkey Run Farm in McLean, now called the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, an 18th-century re-creation.</p>

<p>He dressed in britches, a blousy linen shirt, floppy hat and homemade shoes and learned how to butcher and roast a pig.</p>

<p>Standing in the kitchen and acting out his role, Podesta explained: “It’s best to do the butchering at 4 a.m., “because pigs should be slaughtered when it is cool, and it takes a long time to roast them. The pig is hauled on a front-end loader in order to split and gut it. It’s most important to slow the pig down by shooting it between the eyes so you can cut its throat. It makes the pig less ornery and a whole lot more cooperative than if you just stick a knife in its throat.”</p>

<p>In homage to these skills, Podesta used to have a picture of a pig on a spit as his screen saver, but his staffers made him get rid of it, because he said: “They couldn’t stand looking into the pig’s eyes during meetings.”</p>

<p>The powerful John Podesta does not always get his way</p>

<p>How many pig farms are in the DC area? Can you feed pigs people and still have organic pork?  There seems to be a commonality among these people that own a lot of farms, mainly organic.  Pigs eat anything, including human remains, and we saw a sample of that in a tv series (criminal minds?). A man would kidnap people, would chase them into the woods, kill them and feed them to the pigs. Coincidentally, the man also had a brother, just like John. The brother found out what was happening and had to play along to save himself.  Another movie that came to mind was the second Silence of the Lambs where agent Starling was almost eaten by the wild boars at the pig farm that millionaire Mason had bought to destroy any remains of evidence. Then there is the true story of serial killer Robert Pickton The Pig Farmer and Killer documentary where 49 missing persons were linked to his pig farm.</p>

<p>A case of art imitating life imitating art??</p>

<p>This isn’t really important, but while scanning some unimportant movie trivia we came across Pirates of the Caribbean and learned this: When Will is looking for Captain Jack Sparrow, the last guy he asks tells him about an island where the “long pork” is very good. “Long pork” is a euphemism for human flesh. Anyone who had eaten human flesh often had “Long” added to their name, such as “Long John Silver” in “Treasure Island.” – just an fyi.</p>

<p>Some have said that these people were guests at special restaurants where human flesh was on the menu.  Cannibals have said that human flesh is similar to pork. Just a little sweeter.</p>

<h1>PizzaGate – #Pedofiles Unravelling Secret Network of Child Traffickers and Pedophiles ...</h1>

<p>So are the Alefantis’ accusations that he has a pig farm that helps to dispose human remains true?</p>

<p>For this and much much more on this topic please followup with The Millennium Report from November of last year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very pro-pizzagate, but if this literally devolves into actual widespread cannibalism...like I mean we prove that is actually happening? I just don&#39;t know how I should respond. I am pretty well convinced they torture and fuck a ton of kids. But are they (a majority) eating them too? Makes me look at the organ harvesting stuff again. I could never really get into it for reasons i&#39;m too lazy to explain that I consider obvious. But it sums up to where is the demand for this volume of organs?</p>

<p>Unless they are eating them.</p>

They registered a non-profit charity, the Piggy Palace Good Times Society, with the Canadian government in 1996, claiming to &quot;organize, co-ordinate, manage and operate special events, functions, dances, shows and exhibitions on behalf of service organizations, sports organizations and other worthy groups&quot;. Its events included raves and wild parties featuring Vancouver prostitutes and gatherings in a converted slaughterhouse on the farm. These events attracted as many as 2,000 people. Members of the Hell&#39;s Angels were known to frequent the farm.</em></p>

<p>Information on this group is difficult to find. Some claimed police and politicians attended these parties and the RCMP brought some of the prostitutes to be murdered on film.</p>

<p>From what I can understand, there is some sort of publication ban in Canada regarding the case. The Vancouver Sun had a lot of good articles that I can’t find now. Most are  copypasted  here:</p>

<p>It’s an exhaustive, unsorted list of news stories related to Robert Pickton and Canadian missing persons cases. </p>

If you never heard that it doesn&#39;t mean the saying doesn&#39;t exist. He has shown no proof because it&#39;s an opinion. A lot of people already think Podestas a weirdo.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. Man you&#39;re to much. The internet is full of people with opinions. Not everyone has the same one as you. Just because they don&#39;t share your opinion doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re part of some giant disinformation conspiracy. Does disinformation exist? Of course. Is this it? No. OP made some connections and posted it in a conspiracy sub. That&#39;s what this sub is. It can encourage a dialogue about the subject. What&#39;s strange to me is out of the entire posting the only thing that you seem to mention is the word long Pork. One point in making this connection would be to have conversations about the other strange things connected to it like Ping Pong James&#39;s pegasus museum and the strange Instagram content. Getting hung up on a word like long Pork is petty and it makes you seem like you&#39;re trying to discredit the actual facts that OP presented by saying long Pork doesn&#39;t mean human flesh. &quot;Riddle me this&quot; implies that OP is asking a question and wants to open dialogue.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re just wrong. The thing about the podesta emails is their <em>context</em>. It&#39;s not unusual to talk about dominoes or maps or pizza or hot dogs; the distinction comes in the context of the email. Those words don&#39;t make sense in that <em>particular context</em>. These words <em>appear</em> to be referring to something else; in the same way drug users often use code to <em>obfuscate</em> talking about illegal things. Certain social groups develop their own sub-languages based on the usage and <em>context</em> of these words.</p>

<p>Anything related to comet ping-pong other than alefantis&#39; twitter feed is probably fake. Those tweets were pretty creepy. But, Alefantis does know Podesta.  In addition to being a strange guy, he knows these people <em>personally</em>. They chill. Allegations exist that both Podesta and Alefantis are world class creepers; but Alefantis is described as &quot;well connected&quot; in Washington. Podesta obviously so. Why is Alefantis &quot;well connected&quot; though? He owns a pizza place and what a couple museums? Does this make sense given the <em>context</em>?</p>

<p>That&#39;s sort of the thing about this reality; you can&#39;t just have one specifically isolated bit of data in any system. You need how that data relates to <em>other data</em> in the set otherwise everything is irrelevant. </p>

<p>Your pseudo investigation of this podesta emails thing shows you have formed a fairly inaccurate opinion and are taking some pretty wild and creative interpretations of the information available. Are you practicing your sophistry here, now, for us? </p>

<p>What &quot;foreign entity&quot;?</p>
