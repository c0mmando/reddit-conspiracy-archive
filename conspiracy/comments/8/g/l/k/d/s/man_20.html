They seem to have selected Bonobos (our closest match) to mix with their own Dna in order to make a race capable of surviving on earth.  Also bonobos have sex constantly so the successful hybrids would populate quickly.  The different environments the hybrids were isolated in led to adaptations and slightly differing appearances.</p>

<p>yes 100% without a doubt</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or is it competing with transhumanism and bionics?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>transhumanism and bionics will be fuly merged with 3.0 Humans</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like, if we chip up too quick, will we be able to unblock 3.0 (or is chipping up part of 3.0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean chip like the mark of the beast where you cant buy/sel unless you have it?</p>

<p>I think the chip like this is coming and will enslave most humans, however 3.0 Transhuman/Bionics will first be only within the 1%, some will leak out or get hacked and be released to the general public which will create a black market for genetic/A.I. upgrades, but it will be a slower/less better version than what the 1% have (all their kids will born as 3.0&#39;s eventually)</p>

<p>I think there would be a chance for a 3.0 to break from the 1% and join we the people in future revolutions, but at the same time, regular modern day humans will hate the 3.0&#39;s and will want them dead and revolted against.</p>

<p>I think the 3.0&#39;s eventually colonize a new Earth and start up a future Utopia that is based on intelligence, balance, consciousness, peace, and so forth, while the Earth destroys itself via Nukes (or future type weapons) over religion/politics/differences/resources</p>

<p>This sounds awesome, can you expand on these? I kind of already have an idea what this is about, and have seen some of the bay area folks taking sides against each other, was just other there in October since I have some family that stays an hour north of San Fran, and they are also mad at the techie/sjw take overs and side effects in the area</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I often use the Sparkle Pony vs Darktard sotry in my replies and kept it brief in case I&#39;d blahblahblah&#39;d that to you on another thread.</p>

<p>Humboldt vs Silicon Valley:  The folk north of SF, since you are familiar, 101 north of Santa Rosa, are the original back-to-the-earth hippies.  They were able to avoid the limited hangout attempts of the 60s/70s-era CIA to corral these free-thinkers into Sex Drugs and Rock n Roll (mostly, anyhow).  These folk started farms, not Institutes, like Esalen.  They&#39;ve continued to farm, while most of their cohort sold out (see:  Marin County).</p>

<p>This energy, diluted by Marin Co sell-outs, etc, still flowed into the SF Bay Area and was the dominate energy.  Highly, highly Libertarian with healthy disrespect for gov&#39;t.  Then the tech boom happened, and instead of importing freaks and geeks from around the world, the Bay started importing tech-bros looking to get rich.  Highly, highly Statist/Capitalist.</p>

<p>Now, the tech bro is the dominate energy, and the hippy folk are pissed off.  No longer the US&#39;s renegade region, SF Bay Area is the heart of the future surveillance and neuro-tech scenario.  This angers those who&#39;ve been renegades for decades. This region will be ground zero for the pending Bionics vs Humanists.  Likely merely a culture war, unless...</p>

<p>I also see a pending Weed War, as Monsanto and RJ Reynolds will not be happy with the current situation in Humboldt/Emerald Triangle.  These corporations will ally with the Bionics (both Statist, corporatist) to smash the Humanists, who by then will be revolting against the Bionics (how dare we chip up) and the State (how dare you come for my weed).</p>

<p>There is stencil art on sidewalks all over SF:  &quot;Queers hate techies.&quot;  Queers are not hippies, per se, but the overlap and general sentiment is the same.  </p>

<p>Darktards:  Nickname given to Humboldt/NorCal native-types at Burning Man.  At night they purposefully eschew LEDs and other lights where the Sparkle Pony (and every other human at Burning Man) lights up for safety.  It&#39;s pretty freaking dark in the desert at night, and people are riding bikes 10-15 miles an hour so lights make sense but... the Darktards see the LED/lights as, IMHO and I am speaking for them, early examples of Bionics.  Not wearing lights is a social commentary against the Sparkle Pony Rave-In-The-Desert types, which are whole cloth the new techies (or the international Ibiza set but they&#39;re irrelevant).  These same folk will eschew bionic contact lens&#39; or processing chips just as they eschew LEDs.</p>

<p>Fights break out at Burning Man as lit-up ravers plow bikes into a pack of Darktards, hilarity ensues.  This is the divide writ small.  In the years to come, I see it getting writ larger and larger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome write up man. Totally dig it.</p>

<p>I dont see how the humanist have a chance against the Techies who own the real estate, the local govs, the social media, the White House positions (via donations) and so on. SF is theirs. </p>

<p>Some of my family members, who live an hour north of, SF, they all are getting priced out from taxes, real estate investors buying everything up, majority are all old and retired with all the youth gravitating to the City/Tech Philosophy.</p>

<p>So as the old folks/land owners up North die off, the next generation sells their property to developers, allowing the Statists/Capitalists to expand North and further up end the Humanists.</p>

<p>Its a no win situation. Only thing the Humanists can do is to create enclaves in smaller cities/areas, but even with this, the techie liberals move to places like Austin and transform that city into a bay Area Clone with all the same bullshit.</p>

<p>Its certainly interesting watching all of this go down though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the new weed rules, scores of old grow sites are for sale.  Food farmers are staying so far, weed growers are leaving en masse.  This will reduce the renegade vibe, along with the aging hippies.  Statists will fill the vacuum, yea.</p>

<p>If they stand a chance, it is due to lots of guns, lots of trucks, lots of land, and lots of local area knowledge. Guerrilla-level civil disobedience to discourage corporate America from investing in the area.  And, biggest factor, Monsanto and RJ Reynolds are not interested in the Emerald Triangle as weed farm property (they already have acreage in Tobacco Belt, nice and flat).  The existing grows are all remote and disparate, not a smooth transition for corporate growing.</p>

<p>Humanists will continue to get pushed into the hinterlands.  Most dystopia fiction has this group in their art by one name or another (hill people, whatevs).</p>

<p>But yea, the 3.0 model is much more likely to happen then the 2.0 model deciding it has more under the hood, so to speak, and exploring what more we can do now with what we have &quot;naturally&quot;* and rejecting the chipping.</p>

<p>*Naturally given possible ancient GMOing or cross-breeding of humanity. </p>

The next version of man was far too advanced so they had to go, which is where the story of The Tower of Babel came from. The next group was made a bit less smart and given a veil between them and Universal Source so they wouldn’t even know their true capabilities. Then, over the years, humans have been genetically tested on and bred with by other ET races to give us our wide variety of abilities and appearances. </p>
