        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s time to drop the hammer and expose the Space fakery. I have researched a lot of conspiracy theories but perhaps the most shocking was the one oriented around Space. Space as we know it is fake, or atleast the material we have been given is absolutely fake and CGI, all of it.</p>

<p>Now before this thread get&#39;s invaded by Flat Earth shills, a disclaimer:</p>

<p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A FLAT EARTHER, THE EARTH IS A GLOBE, SO FUCK OFF SHILLS!</em></strong></p>

<p>The flath earth movement is a disinformation campaign meant to make everyone look crazy that questions physics related conspiracies. And the truth is always in the middle, now this is mostly true, it&#39;s not an middleground fallacy, stop parrotting that, whenever I bring up centrism people always shove that in my face as a knee-jerk response, the truth is, due to the massive disinformation, is that almost all extremist positions are wrong, and the truth is indeed somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>So that being said, Space as we know it is fake. I could not find a single original photo of any celestial object that was real, every single one of it is either a:</p>

<ul>
<li>composite</li>
<li>an artistic illustration</li>
<li>or a CGI footage in case of a video</li>
</ul>

<p>The funny thing is that they even admit it, so I challenge anyone to find me real footage or real pictures, you won&#39;t find any. All of it is fake, and there is a very good reason why it is, because it ties into even bigger conspiracies. So let&#39;s detail it:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Satellites</h1>

<p>Satellites simply don&#39;t exist. That&#39;s it. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The GPS system is basically just radio towers. There is no GPS signal in the oceans. You can track commercial planes, they all dissapear over oceans. (Interestingly the flat earthers also use this argument but it is actually something different) Basically if there were satellites up there, couldn&#39;t they just rotate like a few degrees to give signal to planes over oceans? No they can&#39;t all signal magically dissapears once you are out the cover zone of the nearest radio tower network. Check it out yourself, no GPS far from radio towers: <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com">https://www.flightradar24.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>Military satellite phones just use flying drones or multiple flying drones above to relay the signals to the nearest radio tower.</p></li>
<li><p>Civilian &quot;satellite phones&quot; are not really satphones, they are probably just lying, and I bet they also don&#39;t work on the middle of the oceans. Ships and boats probably use long range radio. Or perhaps they also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave">Skywave</a> effect and it&#39;s not available in bad weather incidentally, while the military must always have connection, so they use drones to guarantee the signal.</p></li>
<li><p>If the weather is clear then due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave">Skywave</a> effect you get the exact same kind of relay system as if you would use satellites, so what is the point of satellites anyway? The ionosphere reflects radio waves that you shoot up , so you can have global communication if the weather is clear. If it isn&#39;t then you don&#39;t have signal do you. </p></li>
<li><p>Every major city has a radio tower to relay signals to longer distances.</p></li>
<li><p>Phone networks now all use the internet, and the internet is run in underground cables. They even bother themselves to lay cables across oceans, so cable connections are more reliable. Before that the phone network used radio towers.</p></li>
<li><p>So nothing really uses satellites, and anything that claims they do, can just use radio towers instead which would be more reliable, so there is not even a point in doing it via satellites, and the interference in the stratosphere/ionosphere would probably make that very inefficient form of communication.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Space Telescopes</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Hubble telescope doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_Observatory_for_Infrared_Astronomy">SOFIA</a>, it&#39;s basically just a camera on an airplane. The photos from SOFIA match identically those of Hubble, only the colors are offset a little, any graphical artists can just offset the colors from the SOFIA and claim that it&#39;s photos from Hubble.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guy exposed all of it: <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=SIfp0lIpyxs">https://hooktube.com/watch?v=SIfp0lIpyxs</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Probably all other &quot;space telescopes&quot; are either just photos from ground observatories where &quot;artists&quot; have &quot;worked&quot; on them, or similar airplane based cameras.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Space Stations</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The Mir was cold war soviet propaganda just as the Moon Landing was US propaganda. There was absolutely no proof of it&#39;s existence whatsoever. They just faked all of it, and given how censored the media was back then, no skeptic information was leaked then.</p></li>
<li><p>The ISS doesn&#39;t exist. Some people claim they can see it on their telescopes, well it might just be some meteorite. I have seen no high resolution photo of it. Analog telescopes only show you a blurred spot and digital telescopes could just be hacked to show you want you want to see. So no image of the ISS from Earth.</p></li>
<li><p>The ISS life footage loops after a certain time and it looks like horrible CGI, they didn&#39;t even put the effort into faking it at least in HD mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The videos where astronauts jumps up and down, in some frames you can see their harness. And of course the whole permed up hair of that woman is just ridiculous.</p></li>
<li><p>The width of the ISS is just as wide as an airplane so it could just be filmed in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced-gravity_aircraft">RGA</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>They never show you uncut videos of of ISS interior. So given that RGA could create reduced gravity for only 10-15 minutes as the plane tilts downwards, that is probably as long as a continuous video sequence can be seen in any ISS video, then the plane goes back up and then down again so they could film another 15 minutes of low gravity and they just merge those segments and it looks like as if we would see a continuous footage them floating in space.</p></li>
<li><p>There are of course bubbles in space in many videos when they go out. They do admit that they have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Buoyancy_Laboratory">underwater pools</a> that they use for &quot;training&quot;. Well they might as well just film all of outer space in these pools and then edit the footage with CGI to remove the water.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Space Launches</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Launch sites are closely guarded and who knows they may not let anyone film it. Or they just fill up the launch sites with paid shills, and if you want to buy a ticket they will just say that there are none left. So that would give them cover to create CGI fake footages of space launches, and nobody would have real footages. There might not be anything launched there, who knows how much they are lying about.</p></li>
<li><p>But on the eventuality that launch sites are real, you can see in many launch videos, that the rocket goes up and then it goes in an arc, and it probably crashes back into the ocean. </p></li>
<li><p>Rockets are probably too heavy and can&#39;t go to space, and balloons pop out due to the pressure problem, so nothing can be launched up from ground.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s illegal to launch up things, so your average person can&#39;t even verify these claims. You can only launch with a special permit, but who knows they might co-opt anyone who would do that and make them a shill too. Give them 100,000$ and they will push the official narrative, how hard it would be?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Pictures of Planets / Galaxies</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Saturn_Rings.jpg">Look at this allegedly original photo</a> of Saturn and try to not laugh. The fucking rings around it are supposed to be gas and meteorites yet here it looks like it was drawn with a pencil. Also look at the edge of the planet, it&#39;s damn weird, very blurred and not even circular, it is definitely a hand drawn photo. </p></li>
<li><p>Other photos are all illustrations in graphical animation programs, and they even admit it. Look here an <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Celestia_saturn.jpg">admitted animation</a> and an <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Saturn_during_Equinox.jpg">allegedly real photo</a>, I mean the animation looks more real than the real one.</p></li>
<li><p>All galaxy photos are fake illustrations. Search in any search engine for real galaxy photos, you won&#39;t find any. All of them are fake and they even admit it. It&#39;s to mesmerize people with cool graphics and artwork and colors, but it&#39;s fake at the end of the day.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an organization that now wants to make the first real picture of a Black Hole, it started in 2017 and by now they promised good photos. So I got excited naturally, I really wanted to see how a real Black Hole looks like, because obviously everything in search engine images are fake. They did make photos, <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/galleries/2017-observations">the entire gallery is here</a>. No fucking black hole photos instead we get lame ass groupy photos for Facebook and a few shots of the observatories. No photo of a black hole whatsoever. Instead we <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/simulations-gallery">get animations here</a> which is just more CGI fakery. So they said they will give us &quot;real photos&quot; of black holes and instead of that we get lame CGI animations. Awesome.</p></li>
<li><p>So basically ground based observatories are just magnifying glasses. Somebody pointed it out earlier that binoculars, magnifying glasses (because that is what these observatories are basically) are just magnifying the light on the lense. So they can&#39;t realy see anything more than what you can see with your naked eye without going closer. They just see it more clearly since the lense is much wider. So yes a spider has probably bad vision because it has a small eye, and an observatory lense can see better, but it&#39;s nothing magical, as the light converges over a distance so the only thing we could do is to go closer to it. Wonder why we don&#39;t have HD pictures of the Moon? That is why, because probably all Moon photos were done in the observatories and they just zoomed it in to take a shot, we didn&#39;t got close to it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Newtonian Model</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Newtonian Model is certainly flawed, to what degree and how I don&#39;t know I am not a physicist, but the evidence coming from Quantum Phyisics will probably slowly override it. There is basically no evidence for it, things like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment">Cavendish Experiment</a> are just horrible insults to our intelligence.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Moon Landing</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Naturally this concludes that the Moon landing was a Hoax.</p></li>
<li><p>Footage: 3rd camera anomaly, shadow orientation, dim light based short shadows instead of long shadows from distant light source, wind blowing the flag, lunar lander made of tinfoil, lack of energy to transmit radio signals very far away compared to what radio towers use, too short antenna for transmission, too heavy rocket to lift off , ridiculous jump moves, knee bending issue, harness showing, etc etc... many many plotholes!</p></li>
<li><p>I think the control room probably ran fake software so that the operators were either in on it, or they had no clue that they were fooled and they thought the numbers they saw on the screen was real.</p></li>
<li><p>It was simply wool puller over all humans eyes, even the people working there could have not realized that they have been totally fooled, it was probably a masterpiece of deception.</p></li>
<li><p>Allegedly Kubrick filmed the footage in a studio, there might be some evidence for this. The &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; movie made in 1968 by him was probably predictive programming for the moon landing and may have some hints about it, I haven&#39;t watched it but have heard many people talk about it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Shape of Earth</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The Earth is a globe despite all of this fakery. Why? Because there is overwhelming actual evidence for this, that anyone can verify, while there is literally 0 evidence for the &quot;Space stuff&quot;. </p></li>
<li><p>So many Flat Earthers will just look at all the fake evidence and think that it&#39;s all fake, yet they fall into a trap this way. Just because all evidence in a theme is fake that doesn&#39;t mean that you can jump 1 step ahead and make a totally illogical connection. There are other explanations. So we know for sure that the space stuff is fake, simply because there is no evidence for it, and all evidence relies on a trust for an authority figure and people at home can&#39;t verify the claims. The shape of the Earth on the other hand is easy to verify, literally you only need 2 sticks in the ground, so anyone who questions that is really crazy.</p></li>
<li><p>I think the Flat and Concave Earth movements are disinformation run by paid shills.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The conclusion is that all images of space are fake illustrations and CGI videos. Humans can&#39;t go to space, or atleast yet, not with our current primitive technology and certainly not with that of 1969. I personally even think that the German V2 rockets were fake, it looks like it was just a fake decoy to mislead the Allies. Still many rockets fall into the ocean, so I find it extremely unlikely that rocket technology in 1969 was more than the level of a confetti rocket. (As for the Nuclear ICBM scaremongering of the Cold War, I think that was extremely exagerated to keep people in fear).</p>

<p>So either rockets are too heavy and we don&#39;t have the fuel, rocket design or thrust capacity to launch anything into space or maybe outer space is really a hostile environment.</p>

<p>They claim that there is close to 0 Kelvin out there, well any metal would freeze and become very weak in that temperature, so given the friction it has to go through the atmosphere, it&#39;s likely that anything going up would disintegrate.</p>

<p>Of course the radiation, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">Van Allen belt</a> would totally make it impossible for humans to go up there even if we would perfect some kind of durable material for it. And of course the ionosphere/magnetosphere radiation would make communication near impossible up there, let alone as far as the Moon. </p>

<p>Even the SETI project all they can hear is just noise, even if there are Aliens trying to talk with us, the magnetic shield of the Planet might be so strong that weak radio signals from far distance can&#39;t go through. We only see the Stars because they are extremely strong radiations, but anything with a power of a power plant simply can&#39;t go through that shield.</p>

<p>Others have claimed that there are endless microasteroids moving faster than bullets out there. They do incinerate in the atmosphere so they are not harmful to humans, though some scientists have found fist sized asteroids falling down into deserts. Up there micro asteroids like the size of your fist would bombard any space shuttle with speeds faster than a bullet or a cannon ball. No material can resist that siege in the long term, so that immediately puts the ISS claims in question, let alone when they go out in space and repair it from the outside, the space suit can&#39;t protect them against that, they would become Swiss cheese if they step outside.</p>

<p>Others have raised the issue that if space is really an empty vacuum, then how can you move there? We can only move on Earth because we have molecules to push ourselves against, but in empty space how do you move? This might lend credibility to the Aether theories, and it might actually be space moving around us, not us moving in space. Might explain the Dark Energy issue, who knows.</p>

<p>So all of it is fake, they all take out tax money and in return we only get lame ass CGI and artistic illustrations. It is the most astonishing conspiracy out there.</p>

<p>That&#39;s absolutely false. There are many parts of the EM spectrum that don&#39;t penetrate the atmosphere, or get diffused along the way. It is impossible, for example, to make x-ray observations from the ground.</p>

<p>Look I am just looking at the pictures and really the only difference between the pictures in supposedly different wavelength recordings is just the color balance and the smoothness. That can be easily changed with a photo editor. I have even tested it, took a Hubble photo and played around with the color and it looks like a SOFIA photo.</p>

<p>Any photoediting expert can just thinker with that and claim that the &quot;new&quot; photo is now of a different wavelength, but it&#39;s the same photo, just manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hubble probes the visible part of the spectrum. It makes use of the fact that lower earth orbit allows for longer, uninterrupted periods of exposure that are crucial for some observations that cannot be made from the ground (e.g the Hubble deep field). It can also, though, make redundant observations that can also be made from the ground (I assume that&#39;s what you were referring to). So it&#39;s inclusive in a way.</p>

<p>Then you have telescope like Chandra that look at parts of the spectrum that are well outside the visible (no &quot;color tinkering&quot; can shift what the observe to something seen on the ground). I was talking about those. Luckily, they cannot be made from the ground since otherwise life on earth wouldn&#39;t survive the radiation levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your theory of it, but I am simply just pointing out that the photos are just artwork, not real recordings. Just look at all the gorgeous space wallpapers you can find on the internet, how hard it is to fake all the &quot;real&quot; photos too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t giving you a theory, but rather pointing to a direct counter to your argument. </p>

<p>So the essence of your claim is that you think any observations of outer space are just artwork and that the are &quot;probably&quot; (as you used elsewhere in your post) fake simply because it&#39;s possible to fake them. You&#39;ll have to add more substance to that. Otherwise, this premise alone can be used to deconstruct pretty much any aspect of what you consider reality (which can all easily be faked).</p>

<p>If Earth spins around it&#39;s vertican axis, then why isn&#39;t the Eath looking like an &quot;eye-shaped&quot; thing but with the two ends smooth, like a symmetrical egg shaped thing.</p>

<p>Like a ball would become a sphere because it spins in all directions randomly like a soccer ball for instance. But the Earth rotates only in 1 direction across 1 axis, why are planets becoming spherical then instead of egg shaped?</p>

<p>Due to these factors the Earth is actually &#39;pear shaped&#39; - an &#39;oblate spheroid&#39;</p>

<p>To further the myth of space. Now they want to go to the Mars more billions of $ into the space program. It&#39;s a giant scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsRsap2_RAc">Here</a> is a great video explaining how the retro reflectors on the moon work, and how we&#39;re still using them today.</p>

<p>TL;DW: If you have three mirrors, all at right angles to each other, a beam of light shined on it will return to its source.  If you stick this on the moon, a laser will bounce back to where it came from.  Normally, if you shine a laser on the moon, it&#39;ll just scatter randomly, but there are several spots where the Americans and Russians left retro reflectors.</p>

<p>Typically, for the experiment, a color that isn&#39;t common in space is used for the laser, like a particular green.  The laser is shined on the moon, and then the systems waits for photons of that particular color to come back.  We get consistent results from multiple different sources, all agreeing with the time it takes for the photons to come back.  Toss in the speed of light, and you now know, very accurately, the distance to the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Satellites</h2>

<p>1) GPS works by using signals from multiple satellites to triangulate your position relative to them. That&#39;s all it does. To track something that&#39;s not yourself, the plane would have to be able to send the signal to an observe which is impossible once it goes out of radio range. It takes a lot of power to broadcast through the atmosphere.</p>

<p>2) How did they work before we had drone technology? What&#39;s to stop the enemy from disrupting our communications by destroying radio towers? If we&#39;re sending a signal halfway around the world by jumping between radio towers then it would be trivial to disrupt our comms by bombing a few towers.</p>

<p>3) &quot;Probably&quot; and &quot;I bet&quot; is not the kind of language I&#39;d use if I wanted to convince people to believe my insane ramblings.</p>

<p>4) Explain how VHF works then</p>

<p>5) Radio waves are incredibly inefficient over long distances and take a ton of power. They work fine for a hundred miles or so, but if you want people on the other side of the planet to hear you without loss (especially if you want to encrypt your signal) then it just doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>6) Cell phones still use radio dummy. Also, what does this have to do with satellites?</p>

<p>7) Blah blah blah, still no evidence for your assertion and you obviously don&#39;t even have an elementary grasp on telecoms</p>

<p>8) More of the same mindless garbage</p>

<p>Seriously dude, that&#39;s just the first section. I could literally do this to every point in your inane gibberish. Please read some articles or research papers. Learn some physics. Something. I&#39;m begging you</p>

<p>Nothing, in WW2 there were entire regiments that laid down cables and repaired radio towers.

<p>Now we didn&#39;t had any major wars since WW2 and there were drones from the 70&#39;s. So that covered the Vietnam war, or they could have just used submarines or whatnot. Vietnam was a thin country so they could have used neighboring countries radio network to broadcast stuff.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not like 1 tower is sending it all across, but more like using radio towers as a relay, like a network of communcation. Each tower sends the message to the nearest one and it hops around until it reaches the end. That would be pretty efficient and less power consumer.</p>

<p>I was talking about long distance communication between relays. The cell phone itself has a very short range, that is why they put cell towers every few hundred meters. In rural areas they just have a big radio tower nearby to collect all signals.</p>

<p>Why do you think they don&#39;t have communication in africa? Since it&#39;s not developed yet. Bullshit they don&#39;t have satellite phones there, because it does&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>No what I was saying is that satellite phones or for that matter any cellphone doesn&#39;t work in remote African areas because it is not developed, it doesn&#39;t have tower networks. Hence you can only communicate if you have towers, and the supposed satellites don&#39;t help at all.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think Kenya or some richer African country would bother launching at least 1 satellite up there to fix that issue, but no they don&#39;t. And putting up towers for smaller remote villages is not cost effective, hence no mobile network.</p>

<p>So satellites are avoided again, it&#39;s almost like they have no use case whatsoever.</p>

<p>Satellite phones work literally anywhere. They work in the middle of the ocean. Cellphones require towers because their frequencies are only short range and only work in line of sight</p>

<p>I had a casette recorder (I&#39;m old enough to lived throug that) as a kid in the 80&#39;s, and I recorded myself singing and asked the store owner whether it can be rewritten and he said it can&#39;t. There were special tapes that could have been but they were rare and needed a different equipment, more expensive.</p>

<p>If they were so cheap, they probably used the cheap tapes, so I don&#39;t think they could have had the ability to rewrite that.</p>

<p>I guess they referred to the equipment, a lot of the stuff is now in museums, though they didn&#39;t put the original there allegedly but a replica, probably to make it look more genuine as the original was just too silly for 21 century standards.</p>

<p>He already wanted to expose some corruption and he probably didn&#39;t know that the moon landing is impossible, and if it would have happened on his watch, then he would have exposed it for the lie that it was, so perhaps they waited with the moon landing hoax until they had their guy in the office, whoknows.</p>

<p>I think they were all in on it, every country knows how fake space is, but it&#39;s not a grand conspiracy by choice, like many people would argue.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s in all of their best interest to not out eachother, they could use that information as leverage.

They know it, and they won&#39;t out eachother, instead they just blackmail eachother probably.</p>

<p>And now that this scam is established, every country can now have it&#39;s own &quot;space program&quot;. So why would they expose eachother, when they can all benefit from this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about the Nazis is that they were funded by American bankers and globalist so I think the cabal is a little more complex than that (but that’s my opinion). You should really watch the documentary “JFK to 911 Everything is a rich mans trick” it was posted on here the other day and is one of the best docs I’ve watched on the subject. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, i watched that documentary but I don&#39;t agree with all parts of it, it all blames it on big industrialists while totally ignoring the leftist subversion that has been happening since the 1700&#39;s in Europe, in fact the American Revolution was part of it, it was a liberal revolution basically, while Britain at the time wasn&#39;t even bad.</p>

<p>The Nazis were basically leftists, now many people deny this but looking at the actual policies it was a weird combination of leftism and militarist nationalism, hence the National Socialist name. The Bolsheviks, the nazis were all the same Gang perhaps in rivalry, but the Mao Chinese were also in rivalry with Stalinist Soviets, so it&#39;s just 3 different flavors of totalitarian leftism like in Orwell&#39;s 1984: Oceania, Eurasia, Eastasia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point but look how the leftist agenda is being pushed today and it’s the same bloodlines making those decisions. The industrialist don’t care about the political spectrum as long at the profits keep rolling in. I mean look at the German philosopher Karl Marx who wrote the communist manifesto and I’m pretty sure was funded by the Rothschilds. </p>

<p>I am pretty sure he wasn&#39;t. For multiple reasons:
* The Rothschilds were basically British allied.
* A lot of the Rothschild influence is overly exagerated in conspiracy circles especially due to Nazi influence.</p>

<p>I know about the Rothschilds funding Britain in the Napoleonic Wars, but that was normal as Napoleon was a crazy maniac like Hitler, of course they would fund against that. I also think they helped the British in WW2.</p>

<p>So actually I think the Rothschilds were the good guys, or at least the better ones, and whatever bad you hear of them is probably Nazi propaganda, they were enemies of the Nazis.</p>

<p>But they are not the man behind the curtain, there are much more sinister Elites out there, who we probably don&#39;t even know their names of. They would certainly not reveal themselves, and are the actual ones having the power. It&#39;s not the Rothschilds, it&#39;s not the Jews, it&#39;s not the Illuminati, it&#39;s something else entirely....</p>
