       I have adapted this into a post from a comment I was writing, so it may be a tad disjointed in places. I don't have the time to fix it all right now and don't want to forget to post it so I'm just leaving it as is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen very few people talking about this information so I wanted to provide a quick introduction and some sources so you can further educate yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion this is the conspiracy of all conspiracies. Personally as I learned about all the injustice, lies, corruption etc, as well as realized the amazing potential of human beings and the type of world we could and should live in, I started to feel like none of this makes any sense, there is far too much disparity from the overall state of human beings on the planet and the potential I see when I look at all that we have created and observe the love we are capable of even with strangers. How could it be this way, how could we have been so thoroughly duped and driven to shallowness, greed, and hatred? I believe humans are naturally loving, but that the culture corrupts us to our cores and leads to this world where half of the people starve while the rest live in excess and grow fat and lazy. How could loving beings allow such a culture to grow so encompassing? I don't think it's natural, and I don't believe a few wealthy families could accomplish manifesting such an inversion of our nature into our culture at such a scale. Then I discovered the idea of Archons, and later began studying NDE's, then it clicked. The NDE's as a whole serve as a massive amount of evidence that Archons do indeed exist, and that they are running some kind of matrix reality where they feed on the energies of our emotions. Free Will is a law of the universe so they have to use tricks to keep us playing they're game and reincarnating here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I plan to exert my free will after I die and refuse to be incarnated in this reality again. The hundreds of NDE's Ive read indicate that the beings(I think they are Archons) that greet you after you die draw you into the light, and put you through a life review, are trying to remind you of attachments to this reality and convince you that you didn't live well enough, have people to help, etc etc so that you choose by your own freewill to remain within their matrix system by reincarnating.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information is far to broad(including everything from the mentioned NDEs, to sumerian tablets, UFO abductions, elves, fairies and psychedelic experiences etc etc) for me to really achieve any level of overall clarity here. So, if you're interested in learning more about what I'm talking about above, I'd point you to (trickedbythelight.com) Near the top of the first page there are a list of updates including interviews and podcast appearances. I'd recommend starting with either listening to one of those or reading the transcript notes provided. That will provide a primer and introduction if you are new to the field of information.

       Hi. All roads lead to this. This is the
       <strong>
        ULTIMATE CONSPIRACY
       </strong>
       . I have studied this type research intensely for many years now, as well as compiled a large amount of
       <strong>
        OBE/Astral Projection/Lucid Dream Experiences

       .  at this point I can now say that it is
       <strong>
        100 PERCENT TRUE
       </strong>
       .  An
       <strong>
        Alien
       </strong>
       Group known as
       <strong>
        ARCHONS
       </strong>
       are controlling this reality. The
       <strong>
        After Life Review
       </strong>
       is done by them. They masquerade as Guides/Angels/Ascended Masters. They are in fact brutally sadistic
       <strong>
        Predatory Aliens

        ARCHONS 
Some speculate that the Agents featured in The Matrix films were intended to metaphorically represent Gnostic Archons, in that they stood between humanity and their transcendence from the Matrix, into the enlightened real world. Also the robots could be seen as Archons in that they are our creations who have in a sense enslaved us in a false reality and live off our energy.

       IDK, thinking about it, gnostics have known about it for millenia, right? They didn't start a suicide cult to get out of the archons' matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Archons are creations of the Source, same as us. Maybe we're here to discover an alternative energy source for them (fits with the times we were born into)?

       In any regard, I would choose to come back. Even if there's no way to stop them, someone's got to stay behind and help everyone else stuck in here.

       If the after death experience is anything like the dream state, then we might be in a mentally challenged and incapacitated state that will make it exceedingly difficult to actually form logical, coherent thoughts.  It will be easy to get taken advantage of and relinquish your sovereignty under those conditions, unfortunately.

       I have a difficult time seeing how anyone who knows the information we do here about the possibility of manipulative Archons, etc can allow themselves to continue reincarnating
       <em>
        unless
       </em>
       there are some other as of yet unrecognized and unanticipated factors.  One would of course imagine that there are a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of factors we might not be anticipating, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       I post a response a while back detailing the different levels of evolution we go through as beings, and how that level can dictate where you reincarnate.  If Archons are indeed negative, manipulative beings sucking energy from us, I’ve no interest in allotting them any quarter whatsoever.  However, I do wonder if our manifesting here in this plane, on this planet, is simply part of the spiritual-evolutionary “grade” we’re just in and have to go through and “graduate” from before we move on to other more evolved realms.      Perhaps this place seems bad only because we are not fully developed yet, and once we evolve enough to move past this level, we can look back on our time here and see it as a type of school and learning experience that helped us know what to do and not to do as we continue journeying forward on our path.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reminds me of
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt3Ny_BG3yQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=26s">
        the moment from Jacob’s Ladder referencing Meister Eckhart.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The hundreds of NDE's Ive read indicate that the beings(I think they are Archons) that greet you after you die draw you into the light, and put you through a life review, are trying to remind you of attachments to this reality and convince you that you didn't live well enough, have people to help, etc etc so that you choose by your own freewill to remain within their matrix system by reincarnating.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Perhaps part of our learning and evolution occurs as and when we begin to see through the potential veil of Archon manipulation and can resist their chicanery - if that indeed is what it actually is.

       I admit that's something I've wondered about. I love topics like this because imo they're the most important "conspiracy" of all. And I hate even saying conspiracy for something like this. I look around this world, see, acknowledge and bitch to myself about all the shit that goes down in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll come across somebody that thinks you need to say some long and drawn out 'oath' when you die and that's just not realistic to me for a lot of reasons. There's no telling when somebody's gonna die or what will happen to them throughout their life. It's fine and dandy if you're young and can memorize this little oath. What happens when you get older, have memory issues and you can't remember this quote? Or they got you so drugged up on pain killers that fucks with your memory? Or what if it's the "love" they beam at you when you have a NDE? I'd read one of those on some reddit community and saw a pretty big red flag when I saw the person saying something like "It's hard to feel angry at something that makes you feel that good." I can easily call it manipulation when I read it on a website. But am I strong enough to fight it if I experienced it myself? Or will I be too busy with the "love drug" that's amount to being a date rape drug?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I realize people might argue and disagree with me saying that last part. Forcing me back into this existence by drugging me by any means would be the equivalent of a sexual attack. I don't want back here. As bad as things are now, I don't want to picture how bad it'll be after my life is over and I'm thrown back here. It's been way too much. I hope you don't mind me using this example. I recently watched this again and still can't help drawing parallels. I wrote this on another site and want to share it here. This was in a thread challenging peoples beliefs about a 'benevolent god'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other persons comment: "My question wasn't answered! You CAN'T answer it because there is no logical explanation as to why a benevolent loving being would sit back and watch its creation get abused this entire time."
      </p>
      <p>
       "I love threads like this one tbh. It truly doesn't make sense. I know I've used the hot stove as my example on other threads. Can you imagine the ass kicking if a parent saw another person grab their child by the hand and the person drag them over to the stove in order to burn them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not 'god'. Never gonna see that in that fucker. Makes me think of an Alfred Hitchcock Hour episode called "Lonely Place" with Bruce Dern. I highly advise people to seek out that episode and watch it. I don't want to give out all the details in the episode. I just see how it parallels to our real world. The wife in that episode was terrified of Jesse (Bruce's character). What's her fucking husband concerned about? Being able to keep Jesse on for hired help at such a low wage. Jesse's really being a nutcase to the wife at the end. What's the husband doing? Pretending to sleep inside the house while his poor wife's screaming her head off outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I thought you could handle it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesse = all the evil assholes in this world
Wife = all the innocents in this world
Husband = the shitty creator that just thinks we can handle it
      </p>
      <p>
       There should've been another character to represent the assholes in this world that think we asked for this shit or deserve it."
      </p>
      <p>
       I just can't believe in a loving being anymore. And I never believed in karmic debt or learning lessons. How cruel is it to be punished for something that you might not have done? And let's face it, this shit doesn't really seem to be on the up and up. Even if somebody did do shit in their life, what sense does it make to wipe their minds clean and make them pay off debt they don't remember racking up? And why are these fuckers in the middle of this process to begin with when it should be something between the ones doing the hurting and the ones that got hurt.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the lessons theory doesn't make sense when they don't stick with you. It'd be like taking a math class and your mind is wiped to the point you don't even know your numbers or remember what a number even is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might earn me the 'bitch' label or 'very cynical', I just can't see this as being something special, wonderful, worthwhile to go through. I personally think those explanations are methods used against people so they'll sit down, shut up and forget about fighting against the machine. jmo

       As far as I can assess it, anger isn’t necessary in order to reject any possible chicanery.  Only awareness is what’s necessary.  If there is deceit in front of you, and you’re aware enough to recognize it, then it would seem that one doesn’t need anger in order to reject it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don’t know if we’ll be aware enough immediately upon discarding the physical vehicle called the body to become aware of any possible deception before us.  I certainly hope so, but do not know at this juncture.

       I personally don’t see them as being the same at all.  One knocks you out (the latter), the other presumably makes you feel
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       good that you move toward whatever the source of that feeling is (which is the white light that has been said to wipe your memory of the life you just experienced and proceeds to then throw you back into the cycle of reincarnation to manifest again on Earth).  It seems then that the logical conclusion is to be prepared to be overwhelmed by a feeling of powerful “love”…and then get ready to resit and
       <em>
        reject
       </em>
       that feeling so as not to go toward it (and get recycled again).
      </p>
      <p>
       Easier said than done, obviously, but such seems a proper response under these circumstances nonetheless.

       Much as I don’t disagree with this sentiment, I’ll say that it still sounds exactly like I did when I was in kindergarten and I would cry vehemently to my parents that I didn’t want to go.  They still forced me to go…and although I am very critical of the education system on this planet in general, I imagine I can still say it’s better that I went through all of it than not have gone to school at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This planet seems like the spiritual equivalent of a broke ass inner city middle school in the middle of a pretty ghetto side of town where stabbings and shootings (among other illegal things) regularly threaten to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be sure, it’s pretty shitty here.  However, I’m not sure the appropriate response is to drop out of this “school” altogether.

      <p>
       Perhaps the better response is to hurry up, graduate, and then GTFO asap.

       In karma, you don’t get punished for anything you didn’t do.  Matter of fact, you don’t necessarily get punished at all actually.  If you put your hand on a hot stove, for example, and get burned, the burn isn’t so much a “punishment”.  It’s simply what happens when you put your hand on a hot stove.
      </p>
      <p>
       Karma’s the same way.

       It’s been said by various sources that our minds can’t get completely wiped.  We still remember bits and pieces of what was “erased” - if only subconsciously.  Additionally, our emotions get even less wiped than our minds.  Our minds can get wiped quite a bit, but our emotions not so easily.  That’s why we have feelings about certain things even though we might not have had any actual experience with the thing in question in this life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The memory wiping seems shitty.  I don’t disagree.  One thing that’s said about it, however, is that this is one way that the lessons that can get learned in life after life get
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       imprinted into the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lessons we are supposed to learn (whatever they might be) get most greatly imprinted into us if, life after life, they happen over and over again and to such an extent that we don’t just “think” about the lesson intellectually, but we
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       the lesson on a deep, emotional level.  It’s said that it takes more than just one go around to imprint this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not necessarily what
       <em>
        I’m
       </em>
       saying.  It’s what some sources I’ve come across have imparted.  While I feel there seems to be some validity in that thinking, I do also think that there are other ways to accomplish emotional learning as well other than having us have to go through the tortures we do on this planet.

       There are different tiers and levels of management as far as teaching and giving lessons goes.  Just like a school on this planet;  There are teachers, principals, superintendents, counselors, tutors, and all kinds of other educators all working together at different tasks designed to help students learn whatever the needed lessons are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn’t doubt that it is similar on other-worldly levels as well.

      <p>
       They don’t necessarily stick with you if they only happen once and/or if they’re not that strongly imprinted.  If the lesson is imprinted in a powerful manner, however, and occurs that way in life after life after life, I imagine that the person in question will definitely start getting an internal feeling of what to do and not to do regarding any given thing or issue.

      <p>
       Correct, but if you take enough math classes, and you keep getting wiped, every succeeding time you take the class, the lessons will imprint themselves faster in your being because they’re actually already there from all the previous times you took the math class before.  Again, remember that it’s been said that we are never completely mind wiped, and not very emotionally wiped at all ultimately - so although we won’t remember a lot intellectually, we come in with certain emotional proclivities from previous experiences that we can use to guide us through things in life after life.

      </p>
      <p>
       On one level, this reaction can be understood.  It’s one that many 7th graders (myself definitely included) have had.  On another, I think many will say that it’s probably still a better idea to go through with and finish the 7th grade rather than, say, drop out of it.

       That makes a lot of sense - and even though I’ve been giving the whole process a lot of benefit of the doubt in much of what I’ve been saying here, I wouldn’t necessarily disagree with what you said here on a certain level.  However, things are very variegated and complicated also.  I know, for example, that there were many times when I was young that my parents made me do certain things that I didn’t like or want to do, but years later I realized they were better for me and I was/am ultimately grateful they made me do them.
      </p>

       Although I’m not saying that this is what the Archons or doing and we should therefore “go along with it” (No.  I’m not saying that), I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       saying that there are different sides to the story that the whole dynamic can be looked at from.

       I'm very short on time but wanted to make a quick comment. I'll be back later because this is truly something I want to discuss and see all the different view points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see where you'd think it'd be like not wanting to go to school. Fair enough. But the thing is that I KNEW the purpose of school. I was somebody that bullied and hated school for that and hated school for some of the utter stupidity that happened at school. When I say stupidity, let me use an example from high school. They called themselves "cracking down" on smokers by doing this. There were 3 bathrooms spread through the hallways. They kept 2 out of the 3 locked when class was in session and it was a 50/50 shot somebody would unlock the two locked bathrooms when classes were changing. There just wasn't any way to make it to that open bathroom if you were on the other 2 halls. And here's the whopper if the bathrooms did get unlocked. Smokers would go in the stall to smoke. All the school did was penalize the students that had to go. I was fed up with school and literally counting down til I got out of school because I was that sick of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way I'm glad I told that story. I don't know what happened after I graduated, I don't know if that stupid policy changed or not. I was a goody goody back then, let me follow the rules because I don't want to get in trouble. I'm just so scared of getting in trouble. It's as an adult I realize how that policy wasn't just stupid, it was fucked up. All those bathrooms should've been open the whole day. It's a policy that should've been stood up against and fought. But obviously nobody I went to school with fought it. We accepted it as the nature that it was. "Let's see if I can win the bathroom lottery" and be able to get into a stall during the time I have to go!" Some teachers would get bitchy if you asked to go during class or if you went a certain number of times (think it was 3), you'd have to serve detention for being out of class. But again, I was a good girl. Goodness knows I couldn't get bitchy right with them and openly bitch about the bathroom policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize I'm getting off topic. I just want to say I compare our existence to a hostage situation. Or even being in a burning building and you're tied down and can't escape. I want to escape. IF there was any reasonable explanation for this existence and the way of it. I want the chance to hear it and I want the chance to defend myself against it. I'm a changed person from my younger self and that bathroom situation. I won't just take it up the ass because "good girls" don't bitch, they don't want to get in trouble. There's a difference between doing stupid shit like getting into a fist fight with somebody versus standing up for a need that's NOT being met.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'll be back tonight to answer the rest of your post. I just wanted to comment on that one thing for now.

       Just as school is by no means perfect, and there are teachers and school policies that are rightfully regarded as utterly stupid, I would imagine that spiritual-multidimensional school is also not “the best possible, most perfect way things can ever be”.  There are things that are done in this civilization that I imagine could help us learn in a much better manner than is currently the case.  There are manners in which the forgers and creators of the experiences we all have in this life (whoever they might be, if indeed there are any)
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       in fact make things perhaps a bit more conducive to evolutionary growth
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       all the horrible experiences and negative growing pains so many of us definitely go through here.  Life here is beyond not perfect.  However, just as our school experiences were often less than stellar
       <em>
        and yet
       </em>
       we still got through them, graduated, and are now presumably a better, more “educated” human being for the experience, the lives that we live here on this planet, in this civilization, can be looked upon as a sort of frustrating, considerably imperfect “grade” that we go through and hopefully learn from and “pass” so that we can move on to the next level of development.

       Well, I feel I’ve provided at least one reasonable (if not at least somewhat viable) explanation to account for all the difficulty we have in this life, but I’m not sure that hearing and understanding what I say will necessarily give you the chance to “defend” yourself against it.  I’m actually not sure that this existence is anything to “defend” oneself against, actually.  It’s a lesson to experience here - not to “defend” oneself against.  In other words, take in the lessons, and learn as much from them as possible so as to benefit your higher self and your learning in the future.

       Definitely question the world around you and your experiences in it.  Absolutely.  Realize also that there are also multiple possible reasons for why we experience difficult things and trying times, however - and it’s not only because “life sucks” or “this experience sucks” and that’s it.

       <em>

       Correct and agreed.  There are multiple ways that one can stand up for a need not being met, however.  Some of those ways might help you develop and evolve in ways that you might never have otherwise.

       Nah, I disagree with thinking the teachers were stupid. Overall I liked the teachers I had. I was the stereotypical shy bookworm so it's not like I had teachers getting onto me every 5 seconds. I respected my teachers. I don't respect the entities or beings in charge of this existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never thought I was being held hostage in school. Like I was saying before, I knew what was expected of me and I did it. As for signing up for classes, I knew I had to have an interest in it or I would've had a horrible time. I'm also pretty good at typing and started taking Keyboarding classes in middle school. I can type without looking at the keys and see how it's practical to have a skill of that nature. I can't imagine how long I'd be here if I had to 'hunt and peck' at every single key instead of having my hands on the 'home row keys' and knowing where all the other keys are because of many years of experience. It's something I learned and kept with me. I didn't have the attitude of 'fuck it, I took the class and don't have to do that anywhere else."
      </p>
      <p>
       I do appreciate your view point. I want to hear the ones in charge say it and I argue to them about it. Like I was saying on other posts, you still have trust in this system and I don't. For thinking there's lessons being learned, I'll agree to disagree. I don't want you to think I'm being difficult with you. We just wrote different answers on our blank lines to explain this existence.

       Your personality was such that you gelled well with your school experience. --But I also had a bigger target on my back when it concerns being picked on. I would've traded some of the 'easy' school times for being able to go to school with the peace of mind that I'd be left alone and not pick up a load of emotional garbage that's still with me today. I'd say there were some that had it better. They gelled well with the school experience AND were left alone without anybody picking on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for not respecting the entities/being in charge, I'm different than you. I don't think of this as lessons. I think of it as being fed off of. They're no different than a blood sucking flea or a leech as far as I'm concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if it was a class that you new you had to take to pass to the next grade, but that you also knew you had no interest in?--I looked for something positive about it. Maybe I've got people I like in the class with me. Or a more shallow note, maybe there's somebody I had a crush on in the class. That made it more tolerable. As for positive experiences in this existence, I see them and see they're gonna turn to negatives. I look at the ones I love in this existence and the soul crushing thought of having to watch them get old, get sick and die. It pains me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t imagine either one of us would even be on this planet in this time if we didn’t still have quite a lot to learn still, to be honest.--What if it's not lessons? What if it's like I said before about feeding off the negativity in this existence? I hate wording it like that because I don't want to go off into woo-woo territory. I just want to think of it and wonder what THEY'RE getting in return from all the shit going on in this world? Don't you think it's suspicious we're so in the dark about what this place is? Anyway, is it the equivalent of a Thanksgiving dinner every hour of the day, every single day of the week for them?

       I think your answer is more on the right track. As I posted above..the simple fact that everything exists points to a creative force: creativity vs. destruction. What I've learned from my life is that all evil and suffering serve as contrast against good by raising our awareness that love is real. I think that if we die and transcend this plane of existence of body/flesh we probably would feel a huge relief: we no longer have to kill to survive, we have no bodily needs, no attachments..and furthermore we become more sensitive towards love because it would be a force that would be so strong that it would be hard to not want to stay on it in comparison to earth. I see it more like a physics problem than the theosophically charged ideas presented on this thread. We as humans know that love leads to creation and creation is existence. An infinity of evil does not make sense. I remember the cases of people having NDEs and wanting to kill themselves to go back... There's a lot of reasons why I don't believe we are metaphysical slaves forever.

       I imagine we are most definitely not metaphysical slaves forever.  Depending on one’s perspectives, it can be perhaps said that we are
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       metaphysical slaves regardless of where we might happen to find ourselves.  These are experiences we have - some desirable, some very much less than desirable.  They are steps on the way toward our finally realizing that we have always been where we’re ultimately headed.

       I agree completely. It's even more relevant if we take into account the teachings of dharmic religions and even philosophy. Archons and all that stuff comes more from abrahamic religions. I like to see good and evil as physical forces and analyze them without judgement and I usually find they together serve our consciousness. Evil is just a manifestation of free will. Creative force is behind everything even evil perhaps even chaos, love as a force is above all these things, imho.

       I can see that.  It also seems to me that it’s a manifestation of ignorance.  Perhaps ignorance itself is a self-imposed manifestation of the Prime Mover’s will upon Itself for the purpose of…of…of who knows what, honestly.  I was about to say “for the purpose of playing games with Itself”, but to classify it all as a "game" seems like it might be minimizing of what the greater meaning might be.

I agree it is ignorance, ignorance as a lack of awareness/consciousness that we are all one. I know it's a new-agey cliché to say we are all one at this point, but putting that aside, what it really means is that we are all bound to the same reality we are all different consciousness(es) sharing the same space, being conscious is assimilating that if I do evil to you, the same is applicable to me, because we're the same regardless of cultural/human/natural hierarchies. Even in a pragmatic sense this fits: If we as a race keep on an evil path it could mean the extinction of our own species (in a nuclear holocaust for example) I believe the purpose is to be aware of our creative power  (choices have consequences, probably in a huge scale which we oversee)
and to assimilate we are one. Once we are aware of this who know what happens? and after death, well, we are transcending our body..I can't imagine the impact that could have.

       I'd read something about the white light that bothered me. I'd always wondered if you could control your actions, walk where you want to walk, go where you want to go. The possibility of that white light SUCKING you to it disturbs me. There's a lot of things we're in the dark about and there's no telling which answers might be right. I know I'm posting my point of view here and still acknowledge your answers might be the right ones, I just want to go with and do what feels right for me. At the same time, my answers might be right and it'll be that way for you. You'll do what feels right for you. We might both be wrong and it might be something else entirely that somebody else has thought of or even something that nobody has thought of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know how to have OBEs? I would like to try Lucid Dreaming and OBEs, just can't get the hang of it. I know I've seen some people saying it's important to master that so you know how to control yourself better when death occurs.

      <p>
       My trust is gone when it concerns what goes on here and what goes on that sends us here. I know about the human vampires I grew up around that loved to feed off others pain and misery. I believe it's a larger scale of that. Forever conned into thinking you didn't do enough, you didn't 'learn enough', you feel you can make this world a better place and you still have this mission to do, etc. I can't go with any of that. I feel sick in this existence in a lot of ways. And I can tell that. That's another reason I want to flee because I see what danger this is doing to me. I would LOVE to help the ones that I love get out of this place and perhaps there's a way to do that. But there's been thoughts coming to my mind lately that range from "This is something you'll have to do on your own." to "If I don't get out of this place during this life, I'll never make it out of here."
      </p>
      <p>
       I still can't buy that about karma tbh. I have no reason to trust the beings or entities that put us here. That's another difference between my younger self and my now self. I became very depressed as a child and tbh I wanted to kill myself. I wanted the pain to go away. IF I had killed myself as a child, I would've been riped for the picking because I would've trusted every single thing that came up to me. There was no distrust in me, no fire to ask questions, no thought about the possibilty of voicing my doubt if I felt like I was being fed bullshit, no desire to fight for my life with whatever they threw at me. I have those qualities now. And I also have looked outside my own door and saw all the pain and suffering others go through. I know you're not saying that but I want to say that in case anybody tries to fire back and me with "You're just unhappy with your life. You sound rather me, me, me about all of it." To see all this shit as a 'big picture' kind of deal, I just can't help comparing it to a compulsive liar. Get to a point where you're around a person that tells one lie after another and you'll start taking every single thing they say as a grain of salt. Even if it was something common like "Looks like a sunny day today." "Yeah, let me see for myself."

       I see pain as a domino effect. Sometimes you're dealing with shit and it is a case of "I fucked up and I hurt myself." And other times you have people that will create the pain and make others suffer. Whether we're talking the high level elites in this world that create suffering or if it was something along the lines of "Johnny's at a bar and he gets completely shitfaced. He decides to get behind the wheel and drive home instead of asking somebody to take him home or calling a cab. He gets into an accident and doesn't have a scratch on him. The other driver was killed on impact." What if that other driver had a family that he or she left behind? Not only was the other driver impacted by a stupid decision, that other driver's family will have to spend the rest of their lives without the person they loved being in their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       And sometimes there's just a free for all when it concerns bad shit. I want to use an example that people can look up if they want to know more about his life. I loved older stuff when I was a kid. One of my favorite actors was an actor named Bill Bixby. I'm pretty aware enough to know not to put celebrities on pedestals or have stars in my eyes thinking they're perfect. There was a long time I was a fan of William Shatner's and I could easily admit that the guy acted like an asshole to a lot of people and it was difficult working with him. Back to Bill: I never heard anybody say an unkind word about him. He genuinely seemed like a nice guy. He had so much tragedy in his life from his kid dying at a young age, his ex-wife (mother of the child) not being able to deal with the grief of her little boy's death and she ends up killing herself. Bill ended up with cancer and that was what caused his death. There's an interview with him from Entertainment Tonight that's pretty hard to watch because that cancer ate him alive. That's the only way I can word it. It ate him alive. So to see a nice person go through so much pain, so much shit and for no reason. And then I see the evil elites with the shit they do, where's their karma at? Because I sure as hell don't see it.

       I said this on another site and I wish I could remember some of the words and phrases I used so I could go to that post and get it. I was posting as a guest so there was no way to gather everything together. What would you think if the government had a way of erasing parts of our memories and they used it on people? Would you be okay with that? What if you were in an abusive relationship with a person and that person erased your memory whenever you were getting ready to leave this abusive person/relationship? I would think people would be outraged at either scenario. Why do the entities that do this to us get a free pass? Whether they only erased 10% of your mind, I still have a problem with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the real people in a real school, those are helpful people that you can go to. If you had a question every single day about an assignment, you could go to your teacher and that teacher explain it to you. There's nothing here when it concerns these entities. I can't draw a door on a wall and go into their 'world' anytime I wanted to ask questions. And in my case, rip them to shreds. :D
      </p>
      <p>
       And if we're supposed to be advancing, why do we have the human race going backwards in so many ways? I'm not somebody romancing the past. Just saying the present isn't any better if we're supposed to be getting to a 'kind' and 'enlightened' period in our lives. I can't help thinking about bullying for this one. So many have this belief that bullies will end up flipping burgers or end up in prison. The ones being bullied will have wonderful lives. I don't look at it like that at all. The bullies will be welcomed in this world because they've already shown that they don't care about others, they can cause others pain and suffering while getting off to it. That's not to say some of them won't end up dead or in prison. Just saying that the smarter bullies will be able to advance their way up the ladder. There won't be one moment that they'll think "Wait, I'm doing something wrong. I can't do this."
      </p>
      <p>
       I still can't even compare this to a real school. I know I said I hated school because of bullies and the stupid shit. But I knew what was expected of me and I did it. I can never recall whining to my parents "I hate homework. I don't want to do it. Why do I have to do this?" I don't have that feeling at all when it concerns this existence. All I feel is the need to walk away towards freedom, maybe I can heal myself for what this shit's done to me. Maybe I can finally see what peace really feels like. Cause it won't be found here on any level.

        That's another difference between my younger self and my now self. I became very depressed as a child and tbh I wanted to kill myself. I wanted the pain to go away. IF I had killed myself as a child, I would've been riped for the picking because I would've trusted every single thing that came up to me. There was no distrust in me, no fire to ask questions, no thought about the possibility of voicing my doubt if I felt like I was being fed bullshit, no desire to fight for my life with whatever they threw at me. I have those qualities now. And I also have looked outside my own door and saw all the pain and suffering others go through.

       I understand this, but know that the identity we have when we’re young, or even throughout our entire physical life, isn’t necessarily the identity of the soul that is animating the body.  What this means is that if you were to die at, say, seven years old, your soul/spiritual identity wouldn’t necessarily remain a seven year old child after you cross over to the other side.  This is a quite complicated topic, and I’ve already posted a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of information here, so I don’t want to bog things down with even more walls of text, but know that the identity that you have during your physical life isn’t necessarily the same as or the totality of your complete spiritual identity.

       This might sound harsh, but it’s possible that the person he killed actually agreed to experience that prior to that life, and that person’s entire family also agreed to experience what it was like to have to deal with the loss as well.  Sounds totally backward, yes, but most of us humans in this world are kept entirely in the dark about what’s really going on spiritually and multidimensionally - the lessons that might be involved - and the truth is a bit more complicated than many of us might think.

       The “Bill Bixby vs the elites” example is a very good one as it pertains to karma.  If one doesn’t know anything about karma or past lives or the eternality of the soul, then the things that happen in any particular life might seem completely unfair.  However, when you understand that karma is based upon
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the lives that a soul has lived, then one begins to understand that you might not experience the repercussions of what you did in, say, “Life A” - which might have happened a hundred lifetimes ago in 1422 - until
       <em>
        this very life right now
       </em>
       in 2018.  It just really all depends.
      </p>

       If one doesn’t understand karma, then a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of the things that happen to us and to everyone else seem more and more unfair.  It’s very difficult to have a real knowledge of karma, however, because, again, we are
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       very kept in the dark in this world and in this civilization.  We live very short lifespans, and the majority of the time we’re here, we’re largely ignorant of anything but the most superficially physical things.  The vast majority of what really happens, however, takes place in the non-physical world.  If one is ignorant about the laws in the non-physical realm and how those laws effect our physical lives, then almost everything that happens to us physically seems random and often unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are kept ignorant and in the dark by TPTB on this planet because it makes it far easier to debilitate and control us that way.  We are a slave population on a prison planet…but this is a different conversation, so I’ll move away from that for the moment.

       That’s why things seem to be going backward.  It’s because we’re transitioning, and the old guard is fighting hard against the changing of the systems, and the completion of the transition won’t happen overnight.  It’ll take, again, a generation or two.

      <p>
       It does indeed seem rather disconcerting, yes.  Perhaps whether one gets immediately and uncontrollably sucked into the light or not, however, might depend upon the person’s level of individual spiritual, emotional, and mental evolution.  I see various choices involved:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         If, for example, it’s an individual who has no understanding at all of the concept of the white light (or of even life after death for that matter, if, say, they’re an atheist), then they might be so taken aback and disconcerted by discovering that they’re still very much awake and alive after physical death that they become quickly confused, sucked in by the white “loving light”, and get quickly recycled without much if any resistance.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If it’s an individual that knows about the white light, but they happen to think that the white light is “all good and loving” and they have no understanding of the possible deceit involved, then they might be fully awake after physical death, but
         <em>
          still
         </em>
         go right into the light and get recycled as well.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If it’s an individual that has an idea about the possible deceit associated with the white light, but the individual isn’t otherwise very mentally or spiritually evolved, then they might be in a very compromised state upon physical death and get sucked into the white light anyway.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If it’s an individual that knows about the white light
         <em>
          and
         </em>
         they happen to be sufficiently evolved, they might pass over upon physical death and be awake and aware enough to be able to resist the white light.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       My point is that whether one gets immediately sucked into the white light or can resist it and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       get caught in it might all depend upon the individual’s level of evolutionary development and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah.  The prospect of not being able to prevent yourself from getting sucked into the “loving white light” does seem a bit disconcerting to me as well.  I guess at the end of the day, if you get sucked in, it just means that you have to repeat another life cycle…and you’ll repeat life cycle after life cycle and keep getting sucked in over and over again so long as you’re not sufficiently evolved.  Presumably when you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       get sufficiently evolved, you’ll finally be able to prevent getting sucked into the white light from happening again.  That kind of alleviates my issues a little bit, since I figure what’s a few lives to an eternal soul?

       I cannot agree more.  Heck, the whole concept of the loving white light might not be all that accurate, as far as we know really.  It seems like there might very well be some validity to it as far as I can see, and there is some evidence suggesting it’s valid, but, as you correctly said here, it seems that we’re mostly just in the dark about what’s really going on, unfortunately.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Exactly.  I’ve been gathering for a bit now that apparently there seems to be an important link/connection between being able to have good mental control in the dream and meditative states, and being able to be more awake and aware after physical death.  This appears to be one of the main benefits of regular meditation.  Regular meditation helps one achieve better control of their subconscious, somnambulistic mind - and presumably, if you have good control of your subconscious, somnambulistic mind, then you will be even more awake and aware after crossing over to the other side after physical death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, meditation seems very, very important…yet, ironically, I no longer meditate anywhere near as much as I used to…:/

       That feeling seems fair and valid to me.  Yeah.  I’m pretty sick and disgusted by being here as well.  However, as of the present moment, we

       Although I would say that there’s always help around in many forms - from other people and beings, from your own personal inspiration and thoughts, etc, etc - I do agree that it’s something we’ll all have to ultimately do on our own.

       Na.  I can almost guarantee that won’t be the case.  Even if we reincarnate over and over again for a thousand - a
       <em>
        million
       </em>
       - more lifetimes on this planet, eternity is far longer than that still, so after we’re done with all those many manifestations, we’ll move on to something else…something presumably (hopefully) better.
      </p>
      <p>
       And after we’re done and over with however many more incarnations we might have to complete in this planet, then it’ll be done, and we’ll move on to whatever the next journey in our evolution will be.

      <p>
       But you
       <em>
        won’t

      <p>
       It’s okay to not buy the concept of karma, but know also that the concept of karma and the concept of the beings or entities that put us here are actually two separate and distinct things.  One isn’t necessarily linked with the other.

       One can distrust the beings and

       understand the concept of karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a “good reaps good, bad reaps bad” concept, but it applies also to the eternal soul - not just the individual, very limited physical life we live right now.  It gets complicated when one mixes in all the different levels of good and bad that constantly come into play, and we often aren’t even aware or conscious of many of the things in our lives that
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       “good” or “bad” to begin with, but karma is simply a law that relates to the balancing of one’s acts and the responsibility that must be accounted for as one strives toward more and more awareness.

       Got one more thing to add about the white light: I've read some saying there's multiple lights and it's not just a white light. I believe it was a purple light and a gold light? That also adds more to the confusion if that's true. It's like playing a board game that you don't know the instructions to and nobody will tell you how to play it. Idk about you, I wouldn't sit down and play a game that nobody lets me see the instruction booklet or tell me what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess at the end of the day, if you get sucked in, it just means that you have to repeat another life cycle…and you’ll repeat life cycle after life cycle and keep getting sucked in over and over again so long as you’re not sufficiently evolved.--And if the system is indeed corrupt? Isn't that like following unlawful orders instead of standing up and refusing to follow unlawful orders? I don't remember any past lives. I don't remember if I ever had the suspicion that something could be wrong, something's definitely wrong, etc. This might be the closest I've ever gotten to even thinking about our existence as a whole. That means something to me. I compare it to being a lemming walking off a cliff. I don't want to just follow the lemmings in front of me. If they're walking off the cliff than I damn well better do it to. No thought process of my own telling me that maybe this isn't such a great idea. Maybe I need to get out of line and walk the other way.
      </p>
      <p>
       it seems that we’re mostly just in the dark about what’s really going on, unfortunately.--And I don't think that's good. And it's no wonder I filled in my blanks the way I did. At least with a real school, you know what's expected of you. You know the classes you're taking, you have the teacher explaining the lessons, you have your textbook, you have the teacher telling you "We're going to have a test over chapter 8 tomorrow." This is just nothing. You ever watch "Quantum Leap"? Yeah, I realize it's a work of fiction. Just trying to point out that Sam would be up the shit creek without Al and Ziggy's help. They were just as important as what Sam was doing for his 'missions' in order to help whoever he leapt into.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish, to be completely honest with you--And I appreciate that. Here's hoping we can both master it one day. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust is the word we have for believing in something without too much of a viable or logical reason to do so. --I would absolutely agree with that. There were quite a few things I could see through the smoke and mirrors for and I'm glad of that. But there were also a few things that I gave out blind trust for and it ended up blowing up in my face. I realize now that trust is a lot like respect, you can't just give it out like free coupons. It has to be earned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, I would say our best bet is to just do the best that we can while we’re here, and work on improving ourselves and becoming as aware as possible so that we can keep ourselves from having to come back here again if that is at all possible to do.--And I'll also agree with that. This goes back to what I said in one of my first few posts about how this is the most important "conspiracy" to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we reincarnate over and over again for a thousand - a million - more lifetimes on this planet, eternity is far longer than that still, so after we’re done with all those many manifestations, we’ll move on to something else…something presumably (hopefully) better.--That sounds like an absolute nightmare to me. I'd say this is the theme song for me:

       I watched that "Head" movie one night and it took me by surprise by how much it made me think. I think the movie got written off and looked down on as a 'stoner film'. Like it's so off the wall that you'd probably have to be on drugs to watch it. I watched it sober and talking about it again makes me want to watch it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s okay to not buy the concept of karma, but know also that the concept of karma and the concept of the beings or entities that put us here are actually two separate and distinct things.--But again, who says these beings/entities are honest, fair? They might be as monstrous as the evil pieces of shit in our existence. They just managed to worm their way to the top and have control on what's beneath them.

       That’s a good quality to have.  It seems that you don’t see too much about this life that’s too positive, however.  I wouldn’t disagree too much with this, to be honest with you.  It’s certainly very tough here.

       <p>
        Maybe I've got people I like in the class with me. Or a more shallow note, maybe there's somebody I had a crush on in the class. That made it more tolerable. As for positive experiences in this existence, I see them and see they're gonna turn to negatives.

      <p>
       Just like the positives that you just talked about in an actual class that you can use to help you see the class in a “more tolerable” light, there haven’t been any positive experiences you’ve had in the actual “class of life itself” to help you see things in a more positive light?

       Well, again, learning how to keep yourself from continuing to get fed upon
       <em>

       </em>
       a life lesson.  I’d say it’s one of the most important life lessons, as a matter of fact.  If you don’t know what you have to do in order to keep yourself from getting fed upon, then you’re simply not evolved and developed enough to keep yourself from continuing to get sent back to this planet over and over again.  When we evolve enough to learn to keep ourselves from continuing to get fed upon, we will presumably graduate and no longer have to keep reincarnating here.

       I'm short on time again, be back later. Just wanted to reply to this: Wait a minute. Didn’t you say you really liked school and were really good at it and really enjoyed your classes and such?
      </p>
      <p>
       No. There's a difference between liking teachers, liking the subjects you like and that's what I was talking about. I liked that part. Take note of what I said earlier: " I was somebody that bullied and hated school for that and hated school for some of the utter stupidity that happened at school."
      </p>
      <p>
       You're making it sound like a package deal and I didn't view it as a package deal. "You either LOVED school or HATED school. No in betweens." I liked what I liked but the rest of it was hatred. Cause let's face it, people can be cruel. There's no such thing as "I'm leaving you alone, why can't you leave me alone? Mutual respect." And let's face it, the positivity isn't enough to make me say/wish "Wow, I wish I could be young again and go through school again." I wouldn't make it this go round. I was barely hanging on by a rope as it was when it concerns the assholes I had to be around.

       OMFG I have literally never posted a response anywhere near as long as this one in my entire time on Reddit (and I've posted some looong responses before in the past).--lol, we also have that in common. If I'm passionate about something, it's like you can't get me to shut up about it. Needless to say I'm not fond of sites that have character limits. :D
      </p>
      <p>
       Being fed off of and knowing what you have to do to stop from continuing to be fed off of is one of the most important lessons you can learn on your spiritual journey.--And I would agree with that. I saw that from human feeders. You can't just let somebody continue to drain you dry, you have to fight or this this never going to end. So yeah, I agree with that. I'm just combining everything into one box for that answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that you don’t see too much about this life that’s too positive, however. I wouldn’t disagree too much with this, to be honest with you. It’s certainly very tough here.--You'd be right. I know I talked about loved ones before. I'm also very passionate about music. I don't play instruments or sing, I just love to listen. Music has been an outside subject that brought me a crumb of peace in life. At the risk of this being an off the wall answer, I particularly want to single out Falco for that answer. He's been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. I bring up Falco because I also want to tie him with another answer that's coming up down the line. And side note: I realize Falco is an unusual artist for somebody my age to enjoy. You're talking about somebody that had his career die in America in the 80s. I credit the internet because that was literally going to be the only way I could discover the rest of his music and his albums. There's very few of his songs and videos that get played in America. I've heard one song on the radio and seen two videos on tv. That's it. I'm somebody that only speaks and understands english. And here's this man that overall wasn't singing in english. I still love his music. That barrier just didn't exist for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the positives that you just talked about in an actual class that you can use to help you see the class in a “more tolerable” light, there haven’t been any positive experiences you’ve had in the actual “class of life itself” to help you see things in a more positive light?--I think that's what's been keeping me hanging on are the few positives I can grab hold of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The opposite to this, however, is to have them remain alive forever on this planet…but haven’t you said that the elite on this planet are pretty horrible and manipulative? It would seem that the last thing anyone would want on a planet like this then is to continue living on forever. If it’s as bad as you say (and as I often myself think it is), then the sooner you die, the better, no?--I think love changes that. Don't get me wrong, this world is a shithole to me. But things would be all the more devastating without the ones I love and that's within reason. Here's where I bring up Falco again. I want to word this in a very careful way. I don't want to come across like the poor bastard would need to get a restraining order against me. For the art that man did in his lifetime, I absolutely love him. It's not a love of "Wow, would love to get married to that man or be his friend if he hadn't died! Sign me up!" I realize the man had his problems, he wasn't perfect. He went through a lot of shit in his life and I sympathize. I'll defend if I need to and get on the opposite side if I need to. I'm not a "stan". Maybe that's the way to word it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Falco had his share of drug and alcohol problems. I don't really think he managed to get on the wagon and stay on the wagon. Anyway, he was in his vehicle and he pulled out in front of a bus and I would say his driver's side got the full impact. I won't defend him if he was drinking and doing drugs while he was driving a vehicle. He could've easily killed somebody else. So I won't defend there. But as somebody that loves this man and his work, I can't help thinking what kind of music he would've done if he hadn't gotten into the accident at all. And I want to stress that last part. But I look at his vehicle, reading his manager's book that talked about the injuries he received during the accident and I'm seeing somebody that I don't have a good feeling he would've had a good quality of life if he had lived. And I'm not even talking about his career there. I'm strictly talking about his own life. So as much as it PAINS me to say this, I hope he died on impact. I can't imagine how scary it would've been to even live a few minutes after an accident like that. My feelings about his death pretty much involve the hope that I hope he got freedom from this world. So this is one person that you wouldn't catch me wishing back to life if at all possible. So there's my two answers involving love of somebody and when it concerns the end of their life.

       Yeah.  It is indeed pretty horrific.  Agreed.  I personally can understand a parallel, however, between the difficulties presented to us in this world on one end, and the difficulties we face growing up and getting, for example, disciplined by tough but loving parents on the other.

       As far as the law of karma is concerned, there actually kind of

       </em>
       no punishment per se.  Again, there is only balance.  The victim and the punisher in this life, for example, switch places in the next life until both develop a better and better understanding of the grand scheme of things, of the rules of actions-and-consequences, and of the manner in which all things are connected.

       good observation.  Very good point.

       In many ways, it

       a loop.  It is a “ground hog day” type of event over and over again.  These lives we lead can be looked upon as that.

      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, it’s simply like a math class.  You’re not going to get the 2+2=4 lesson immediately when you first start.  You have to go through it over and over again sometimes until you finally get the lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get tests, you fail, you study, you do better, you get more tests, you fail less badly, study some more, get more tests, do better in them, and graduate to the next level of tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       These lives we live are just tests we get - over and over again - until we finally get the lessons we’re supposed to learn.

        And that doesn't seem right to me. I've said on other threads and sites that I'd compare that to somebody that killed a lot of people, you get punished and get the jail sentence in this life. You die before the sentence is completed. Still got a sentence to complete. Gonna track who this person reincarnated as and go arrest a newborn. Still got that sentence to complete and you'll do it whether it take you 10 lifetimes to do it. Still seems like a ball and chain dragging behind you.

       If you did the crime, you should do the time regardless of whether you die or not.  That doesn’t seem unfair to me.

       That’s how you learn to not do the crime again.

       It can be said that she is preparing her students as best as possible for the difficulties they will face as they continue forth on their scholastic journeys.--But to me there's a quite a difference in getting up to teach, assigning class work, homework, projects and giving out tests that don't involve pain and suffering. Again, you know what's expected of you and you do it. You get a failing grade, well, try and do better next time. Fail the class, well, maybe this was the only class you failed and this is your weakest subject. It would be more devastating to have to repeat the grade imo. I passed through all the grades and didn't get held back. So I'm just talking about what I would think it'd be like. It'd be sad watching the people you know get promoted to the next grade and you're in a grade with people you don't know at all or don't know that well. This existence to me is like being in one lab rat cage. The aggressive species are gonna have a field day. And again, I can't think of that in a positive light. I won't proclaim evil or assholes as being heros. There's no way.
      </p>

       It certainly does sound cruel on a certain level. Yes. A child getting a spanking from a parent who is disciplining them might sound (and actually be) cruel as well - but it can also serve as a valuable lesson and learning tool as well.--This might get me a thumbs down from anybody reading this thread. I DO see the need in spanking a child that misbehaves. No, I don't have kids and don't want any. Maybe that's an old fashioned answer when it concerns spanking. I know a lot of people think it's wrong to spank a child. I don't see a problem with one swat on the bottom if they're showing their ass. There's a huge difference between spanking a child and beating the child. Of course I'm against beating a child. But a spank is teaching your kid when he or she's doing wrong. The child knows that you're still there, the parent still loves the child, maybe the child learned not to do the bad thing again. While I think of something like the parent dying in an accident and can't help wondering about any possible domino effects that might have on the rest of the family. Will they survive together? Will this be the point where everything goes downhill? I can't help tying bad events to bad things happening in the future.
      </p>

       I was reading the paper awhile back and this is something I've referenced on other sites because it stuck with me, made sense to me and still makes sense to me now. It was about Boy Scout masters that molested boy scouts and it got swept under the rug. One of the victims was interviewed and he talked about how his molester has a wonderful life and his life took a turn for the worse because of his molestation. He mentioned a drug problem. He said in the article that he wondered how his life would've turned out if he hadn't been molested. I realize something like a drug problem might've happened anyway. Maybe you fall into the wrong crowd, maybe something else happened to damage you and you still turned to drugs. It also could've been a case of "I didn't get molested" + "I didn't have any sort of addiction problem." = life turned out pretty well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting that you say this because it actually seems entirely fair to me as far as I can assess it. If one does a crime and there’s a certain punishment for it, then death should not be looked upon as any sort of “free ticket out” of your punishment.--While I look at it as being a case of the person doing the shit does need to be punished. They just also need to remember what they did and the process be on the up and up. Let me interrupt and talk about something else I've read people say that concerned the life review. You get to see what you did to make people feel good or bad and you get to experience it from their point of view. If I had more belief in what was being done, everything on the up and up, I can see why that'd be done. And that's why I also said it should be between the one that got hurt and the one that did the hurting. Will an apology make it all okay? Or are you dealing with somebody that's gonna tell the other person "Yeah, I heard your apology. All I want from you is to never want anything to do with you again. I never want to see you, hear you or have any KIND of dealing with you again."

       I’d personally say it’s a bit of a difference in degree and not so much a difference in kind.  What I mean by this is that some difficult school lessons
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       in fact involve physical pain.  I’m reminded of my own life and how I’m surprised I didn’t get stomach ulcers because my experiences filled me with such a level of constant, daily, palpable dread.  It was horrible.  The pain and suffering I experienced is not the same as someone who is, for example, a prisoner of war, of course, but what I experienced did indeed involve its own level of definite pain and suffering on multiple occasions throughout my early life.
      </p>
      <p>
       One’s tolerance of pain and difficulty changes with one’s experience level, however.  As one grows more developed and evolved, one becomes stronger and has the ability to overcome more and more difficulty.  The drills, for example, that completely incapacitated me and made me break down in abject sobbing when I was young don’t do anything to me today, and I have the ability to do far, far more arduous physical tasks and work outs than anything I could have ever imagined then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Difficulty and conflict within reason - and being able to overcome said difficulties and conflicts - are things that can function as elements of growth and can help make people far more developed than would be the case without having to overcome those obstacles.

       The things that are expected of us on a multidimensional and multi-life basis can be quite a bit more subtle than what’s expected of us in grade school classes, but the principle seems similar, if not exactly the same, in that we are faced with challenges that A) are in no way easy and that we may actually fail at and have to do over again, but B) they’re challenges that are ultimately designed to help us develop and evolve and become better as beings.

       And you shouldn’t.
      </p>

       However, what constitutes “a hero” and “an evil asshole” can be a surprisingly relative thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This incidentally reminds me of the film "The Crossing Guard" with Jack Nicholson where he played a detective trying to hunt down a pedophile murderer, and - to make a long story short (major spoiler upcoming here) - he basically saved the day and preventing the daughter of his girlfriend from becoming the next victim.  Awesome, right?  Well, the circumstances just so happened to turn out that he saved her in a manner that ultimately made he himself actually look like the pedophile murderer...so he ultimately ruined his entire life and his relationship with his girlfriend since she ended up thinking that it was he who was the child molester murderer and was trying to murder her daughter.  The reality was that (unbeknownst to literally everyone in the movie but him) he actually was the sole figure responsible for making sure that the little girl was ultimately saved and protected from a terrible fate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess all I'm saying here is that sometimes a being can seem absolutely horrible on one end, but things aren't always quite as black and white as they might initially appear on the surface.  I'm, again, in no way excusing any of the harm caused by TPTB.  At all.  However (and again), it would be remiss to think that there is no possible good that can come out of the difficulty we experience on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The example you gave of disciplining a child by occasionally spanking them is one I don't disagree with, and that was in fact my very own point with regard to some of the things that we ourselves experience in this planet.

I'll give credit where it's due, I think times are changing and people can realize that a young child can suffer from depression, feel suicidal, etc. I don't think it was treated that way in the past. There was just this scoffing, ya know? "You're a kid, what you could possibly be depressed about?!" So yeah, I pretty much have that same thought about music literally being a life saver for me.
      </p>

       On one level, I wouldn’t disagree with this. On another, however, the problems and difficulties that plague this civilization will continue whether one finds love or not. In other words, love may change it on a personal, internal level in the sense that you yourself might suddenly see the world in a much better light after you fall in love, but externally, the world will remain quite damaged by the manipulative elite existing here regardless of whether one is in love or not.--And I honestly get that. When it concerns romantic love, I have the attitude about it being blind. I'm not into romance, I don't date and never been married. I want to avoid it. It's a case of paying attention to family history and seeing that it's been another thing that's blown up in faces. On the outside looking in, I see this stuff and think of all the warning flags I can see. But I realize the love is blind comes into play for the couple. You assume that won't matter, it can be overlooked and that'll be the thing hitting you in the face when things go sour. I know I'm talking about it on the personal level. Just saying I can also see how it relates to what you're saying as well. There's never gonna be any kids in my life. This is something I'm stubborn about and very firm in my beliefs about. I'd said on another post about health issues being passed onto me and I would pass them onto any kids if I had any. That's the second reason. First reason is I'm not too fond of kids to start with. And the last reason is seeing how cruel this world is/has been. I'd consider that to be a form of child abuse if I put my needs first. "I wanted kids because I wanted them. You're just shit out of luck when it concerns any health problems I pass onto you or the cruelty of this world. You'll just have to deal with it." I just can't do that.

       Regarding Falco and his death, I wouldn’t doubt that there are various valuable lessons that were learned in that life and that can possibly be used if any type of reincarnation does takes place with that individual.--Again, let me be careful with how I word this because I don't want to sound like a creeper. When you like somebody, you just have this ideal of wanting them to be okay. And I realize this might be something that a LOT of people wouldn't have sympathy for. I enjoy "Roseanne" and you know how they rebooted that series? It bothers me to see a lot of people taking pot shots at Glenn Quinn (Mark, Becky's husband) because of his drug use and death. I see where people would have this attitude of "I have REAL problems that I didn't bring on myself. Why feel sympathy for a drug addict and/or drunk? You're the one doing that to yourself. You." And I tend to take a more compassionate look. Nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors to make somebody turn to drugs or alcohol. I look at somebody like Falco and I didn't know it was as bad as it was. There was a Russian site that had translated ths book his ex-manager had written and it was just a hard book to get through. It was interesting, don't get me wrong there. I don't want to make it sound like it was dull and boring. It was just difficult seeing somebody that got worse with each passing year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think of how I felt about Amy Winehouse. You see somebody with problems and it's not a huge surprise when she died. I can't help feeling I'd feel the same way about Falco if his career had lasted longer in America and if he had gotten media coverage. And that's a topic that bothers me on another level. I also like Britney Spears and I literally don't see how she made it through her public breakdown. I'm having troubles and they're private. Poor woman must've felt like she lived in a fish bowl with everybody watching her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m reminded of my own life and how I’m surprised I didn’t get stomach ulcers because my experiences filled me with such a level of constant, daily, palpable dread. It was horrible. --And I could relate to that from the bullying issue. Might not have been ulcers but I'd also say the stomach problems I mentioned in another post along with anxiety being another trigger for it. I'm a shy person and I might've had a touch of nervousness if I had to get up in front of the class and present a project or whatever. But that wasn't something that made me puke my guts up.
      </p>
      <p>
       As one grows more developed and evolved, one becomes stronger and has the ability to overcome more and more difficulty.--I'm different than that tbh. I feel shattered from the bad stuff. Not talking about bullying there, just saying everything lumped together. I feel like sometimes it's a case of being like the walking dead and there's just an empty shell walking around.

Never have been even though I used to be in pretty heavy rock bands and everyone around me used to be the craziest substance abuser and I had all kinds of crazy stuff going on around me at all times…and yet I never felt even mildly interested in partaking in any of it.  I knew it was pointless and useless even though I didn’t have any long history of “knowing” about it in this life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t doubt that I might have experienced everything and gotten things like that out of my system in lives past so that it means nothing to me now and I see right through it all.

       That’s how you learn.  Do I
       <em>
        specifically remember
       </em>
       any of those past lives?  No.  I don’t.  However, I do have very strong feelings about certain things to do and not do.  I emotionally have a deep understanding of
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7405j4/itzhac_bentov_on_drugs/">
        things like I explained here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that I don’t really have a sufficient amount of information from this life to account for my feelings about this, however, lets me know that those feelings were likely acquired in another manner - from some other experience independent of this life I’m living now.

       What’s my point in all this as it pertains to your “You’ll never break free because everybody’s gonna fuck something up” statement?  My point is that you likely won’t fuck
       <em>
        the same thing
       </em>
       up over and over again in life after life.  You learn from your experience.  The more you experience, the more you learn what to do and what
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to do…and the more you learn this, the more you evolve and become a being that is far better able to keep yourself from being taken advantage of in the future; the more you’re able to break out of whatever manipulation you might be under.

       You wanna know something?  We actually
       <em>

       </em>
       pay for being a cockroach serial killer.  However, the price won’t be as severe as if one was, say, a human serial killer.  And what would the punishment be?  Well, let me put it this way:  The type of mentality that a human would have to have to be a serial killer of other humans is also the type of mentality that would likely make one be pretty devolved in other areas of their life that would make them accrue pretty heavy negative karma - karma that would likely force them to come back and live life after life over and over again.  If one were a roach serial killer and that’s it, however? One will likely end up having to come back and be reborn again as well, but the lessons one would have to learn are
       <em>
        nowhere NEAR
       </em>
       as massive and as serious as a human serial killer would.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s kind of like the difference between getting an 85 on a test as the roach serial killer and a
       <em>
        40

       on the test as the human serial killer.  In one case, you passed, but still have things to learn, in the other, you failed and kind of have to do quite a few things over again to learn what you should and shouldn’t do.

       I see your point.  Definitely.  It also depends on what one’s state of development is, what needs to get done in order to evolve, and how willing or resistant one is to improving themselves.  For example, if one is a straight F student, has a very “fuck school” attitude and has fought with every nice teacher that’s ever tried to help, yet you still want to help that student pass their class, then there have been times when the best approach under these circumstances is to have “very tough love”.  There have been many individuals like this who have been put in very rough, take-no-shit reformatory programs who ended up getting “scared straight” by some extremely hard-nosed “prison teachers”, and were better off for the experience.

       Yes.  I can understand this.  There is much negativity in this world.  Absolutely.  One good thing that you in particular can be said to be getting out of all the horror shows from the past and present, however, is that it reminds you of what you yourself must never be, must stay away from, should always strive to be better than.  It can serve as a consistent reminder to you of what you never want to move toward at all.

       Like, take me, for example. I’m not a smoker or a drinker or a substance abuser of any sort.--Somewhat describes me. I don't smoke. My dad smoked for a lot of years when I was a kid and to his credit, he was able to kick that addiction. I might drink every now and again, I just don't get fall down drunk. Don't abuse drugs either. Way I see it, life's hard enough without opening a door to shit that might make life even harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn’t say you’ll be treated the same, but there are, believe it or not, certain qualitative (although perhaps not quantitative) differences between those who kill them and those who do not--The only bug I could let out the door would be ladybugs. And sometimes they'd fry themselves before I could grab hold of them to let them out. :( But roaches, that phobia's been with me since I was a kid. They scare the absolute shit out of me. I realize it might sound silly. I'm larger than a roach. What's there to be afraid of? But they do. And at the risk of sounding like a nutcase, I can hear them. I don't understand that one myself and realize how anybody that reads that comment might think I'm full of it. How could anybody say a roach is LOUD? I'm somebody that wouldn't necessarily say that I have sensitive hearing. It's not like I could be upstairs somewhere, hear people whispering downstairs and be able to tell you everything they said. This is just the one area I'll say that I guess I do have sensitive hearing. A time I'd be in the kitchen, back turned to the next room and I'd hear the roach madly running around in the cat litter container. I'd hear it from where I was standing in the kitchen and then see it once I approached that room. Be on the bed and have my back turned to the bathroom, hear a click from behind me and turn around and see where the roach had fallen on the hard floor. And those are just a couple of examples. I hear them and my radar comes up because I know one of them is around me. And when I talk about roaches, I'm talking about the really huge ones. They're huge, super fast and can fly. ugh, gotta get off this topic because just talking about them freaks me out.

       One good thing that you in particular can be said to be getting out of all the horror shows from the past and present, however, is that it reminds you of what you yourself must never be, must stay away from, should always strive to be better than. It can serve as a consistent reminder to you of what you never want to move toward at all.--I really like that comment. I'm somebody that can put myself in another person's shoes. Maybe it's because of something I went through or perhaps it's something I can picture. I try my best on that last part. But I realize how some people might have the attitude of "Unless you've actually went through x, you need to keep your mouth shut because you don't know your ass from a hole in the ground."
      </p>
      <p>
       So then stop looking at it - as much as you can anyway.--Yep, I've started doing that. But sometimes things still leak through. Either I'll flip by something on tv, pull up a homepage and see a header that disturbs me, etc.

       Reminds me of this.. The character in the video doesn’t know that they’re heading toward a dead end. Why don’t they know it? Perhaps because they had never before experience what they’re going through in the video.--Pretty interesting/creative video. I was putting myself in the character's place and I think it ties in with what I was saying up top about opening doors to make everything harder. The 'highs' might be fun but the things that would stick with me would involve the crashes. "This makes me feel like shit and I don't want to do it anymore." That makes me think of something I went through as a kid. I've had stomach problems throughout my life. It's something that other family members have/had and I have no doubts it'd pass down the line if I had kids. Anyway, there's certain foods that would trigger the very bad stomach days. And sometimes it could be a case of very bad anxiety that would kick it off. The food's what I want to concentrate on. I don't want to make it sound like I ate fast food everyday. It was considered a "treat". There's no other way to word this and I apologize if I sound crude. Greasy foods is something that makes me sick. Literally. I just didn't have the ability to connect to that when I was a kid. It might've been a "treat" going down, it wasn't a treat when it got thrown back up. I do listen to my body better now and I know what to avoid. It's just not worth it.

       The recent past in this civilization hasn’t.  True.  Recent as in the past few thousand years.  The concept of civilizational cycles influenced and dictated by this solar system’s progression around the galaxy, as well as its proximity with and orbit around the solar system of Sirius A (a solar system it’s been said
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       solar system is in orbit with - so both solar systems are orbiting around each other), dictate the energy level of each star.  The closer the stars are to one another, the higher the collective energies of each star, as well as each of the planets revolving around each star (and all the beings living on/in each of those planets).  The further apart each star is, the weaker each star is and their planets and beings on those planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stars were at their aphelion points (furthest away from one another) for quite a long time, so they and their planets and inhabitants were at their lowest, weakest, most ignorant, devolved points.  They just rounded the corner and are beginning to move closer to one another now, however, so their collective energies are rising.

       Then you can still break out of it - just like African slaves did years ago. Shit, horrible, corrupt system they were in during slavery times, but even though it can be said that African American culture is still quite debilitated today, they’ve been able to accomplish a lot of freedom nonetheless from the horrible, corrupt system they’ve been in. Are they completely out of it? No. However, they’re still not in the same place they were even only a century ago.--Excellent point.

It is in no small part because of these “blow up in my face” experiences that I realized that blind trust is generally something I never want to go on if I can at all help it.--And I can see where that'd be helpful.

       Other link: I've heard and read this talked about on various occasions from practically every source that mentions the "white light" - from movies like the famous Poltergeist, to books to shows, etc, etc.--Got a couple more references for you. There's a mention of life is white light slightly out of focus (2:00 mark) to the ending that repeats about get into the white light

       The chorus is in english (:59). There were a lot of rumors around that song. Lot of people thought it was a song that showed Falco knew he was gonna die soon. He didn't write the song though. Still, that's what others say. There's a part in the song that translates to something like "Do I have to die in order to live?" I can see where the parts I can understand that it's a very 'hopeless' song. "I'm tired and just want it all to be over."
      </p>
      <p>
       And bloody hell, both Max and Simon even make specific mention of humans being genetically devolved/manipulated/brought down to only have two strands bands/helixes of DNA (thanks for helping me w/the word usage,

Max mentions it at 35m and Simon at 1h54m27s.--This doesn't surprise me in the least bit tbh.

When I got a little bit older in my younger teens, I recognized this great phobia I had of them, so in order to address it and deal with it, I decided to undertake an ongoing, personal, study of them.  I gathered quite a few of them at different stages of development, and drew detailed diagrams of each one so as to get a better understanding of their anatomy.  This icked me out quite a bit, and it’s not like I’m “the great friend of all roaches!” today, but I have a
       <em>
        lot

       less of a problem with them than before because of my having faced the ickyness and the fear I had head on.

       I know you haven't said anything of the sort like this, I just want to say this to try and prevent anybody coming in here and saying the stuff that's been talked about is coming from people that's watched "The Matrix" and "The Truman Show" too many times. That's not my case. I've never seen a minute of any of those movies. And I do draw a reference to something fictional, I always stress I'm about to reference works of fiction because I don't want anybody to come back with the standard reply of "You can't tell reality from fiction, can you?" I just want to prevent that if it does happen. Again, this part isn't aimed at you, no1113.

       Okay, back to your reply: Especially communicating via the written word. It’s difficult enough to prevent misinterpretations when people are talking in person with one another. When you communicate textually and take out vocal tone, inflection, and audial context (which are all very important in being able to really understand what one is saying and meaning), it tends to become even more difficult to really fully understand the true meaning of what someone is trying to say.--Absolutely. I tend to stay pretty much to myself when I'm online. I have to admit that usually I'm a bad replier on reddit. It's just topics like this one that I want to track and actually reply to if a discussion comes up. Sometimes there's simple misunderstandings and then there's people just trying to be assholes. I think of youtube for that last one. I'll see somebody posting that they're x age (young age) and how they prefer the older music to what's being done today. You'll sometimes have people jumping all over these young people for posting that while I honestly don't see a problem with it. Maybe it's because I could relate to their attitude of being young and liking stuff from before they were born or stuff that was around when they were very young kids.

       Absolutely. This is a big part of the problem on this planet.--And that bothers me. Look, I'll be the first to say it's not even like I'm the sharpest knife in the drawer or the brightest bulb. But so much of this shit is pretty out in the open to me. It's not like it's being cloaked and hidden. So I guess that leaves me wondering why some people can see it, can think about it and others can't. What will it take for everybody else to at least wonder "What in the hell is happening to us?" And I realize there's a lot more going on than just the two items I listed. It's just long gotten to the point where there's so much shit happening, so many things heading your way to the point where it's completely overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some random tracks of some of my compositions. Just sharing.--Thank you for that link too. I'm gonna save both for when my net's less buggy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side question: What do you think about the Mandela Effect? You think it's a load or do you really think something's happening? There's a lot of stuff I don't know and don't have an opinion on either way. I think of something like "Dolly's braces" and wouldn't have a clue. I've never watched any Bond movies before. And some things I feel like could be something that could easily be tripped over. Especially feel that way when it concerns an old actor or actress. I know you've got people talking about Jim Nabors repeatedly dying and he's only died once for me and that was when he actually died. I loved "The Andy Griffith Show" and "Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C" reruns. There were quite a few of the main actors that passed away over the last 15 years. I tend to take notice of news of somebody I liked or used to like passing away. Jim had health problems before he passed and I couldn't help feeling that he must've gotten even sicker when he married his partner a few years ago. So sometimes I do think a lot of people see old person + health problems = hell, I just assumed you died! And here you are still alive!
      </p>
      <p>
       But some things have changed for me. I like a few Robert Palmer songs. Can't say I was as diehard fan of his as I was Falco. Anyway, I remember that he had his heart attack on a golf course. I had looked up Robert for something or another and felt very strange when I saw that it said he had died in a hotel room. No mention of golfing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other involved a singer coming out of the closet. It was a country singer by the name of Ty Herdon. And I'm clearly thinking of him because it's not like there's that many out country stars. I remember him giving an interview about coming out killed his career. And I remember stuff like this because I honestly bitch about it. I can understand if putting distance between somebody if they killed somebody, raped somebody, did something equally bad like that. But it kills me if somebody genuinely liked somebody's singing and they drop that person like a hot potato because he or she came out of the closet. The timeline is all wrong now. This is what I said on another site:
      </p>
      <p>
       "This might be a bit off the wall but I want to mention it anyway. I was reading the paper today and came across an article about country singer Ty Herndon. I went through a country music phase when I was a teenager and I have one of his cds. His sexuality is the thing that's really throwing me for a loop. I clearly remember Ty coming out of the closet many, many years ago and it effecting his country music career. For this article to say he came out of the closet in 2014 (article also mentioned Billy Gillman (sp? came out of the closet because he was inspired that Ty had came out of the closet).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm so positive about this--I'm not thinking about George Michael or any other singer that came out of the closet or was outted. I'll be honest and say I can't peg the exact year I think he outted himself but it sure as hell was earlier than 2014!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       And I should also mention that I'm not mixing up an official announcement versus rumors of his sexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does any of this sound familiar to anybody else? Or is everybody scratching their heads wondering who the fuck Ty Herndon is?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And I realize those aren't even that big. You're still talking about a dead singer that stayed dead and a singer's sexuality. But I would swear up and down it's changed. Believe me when I say I'm honest enough to say "I don't know" if there's something I clearly don't know.

       This is a prison planet we live in that’s currently controlled by some global corporate powers that have a vice grip on the mainstream, and the narrative they publish is what they want everyone to think is "the only thing that's going on".  Unfortunately, too many believe it even though it's mostly trash.

       What actually
       <em>

       going on is that people are beginning to wake up bit by bit though.  Wake up to what? Wake up to the fact that this planet is controlled by nefarious elite; wake up to the fact that we are surrounded by ETs on, around, and
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       planet Earth; wake up to the fact they’ve kept us from technologies that would make fossil fuels entirely pointless and useless - technologies that would put us far, far ahead of where we are today; wake up to the fact that these global powers have been manipulating and killing us in droves for ages; wake up to all kinds of other horrible maladies that they’re responsible for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  A lot of shit is out in the open, and a lot more shit is coming out even more so…but there is in fact still a big, concerted effort to keep the flood gates of information from being opened to the public.

       This is probably the most I’ve ever replied and responded to anyone in all my years on Reddit - and I’ve responded with some pretty long messages before.--I thank you for doing that. It's been nice chatting back and forth about this topic.

       What actually is going on is that people are beginning to wake up bit by bit though. Wake up to what? Wake up to the fact that this planet is controlled by nefarious elite; wake up to the fact that we are surrounded by ETs on, around, and in planet Earth; wake up to the fact they’ve kept us from technologies that would make fossil fuels entirely pointless and useless - technologies that would put us far, far ahead of where we are today; wake up to the fact that these global powers have been manipulating and killing us in droves for ages; wake up to all kinds of other horrible maladies that they’re responsible for.--I really hope I'm wrong and you're right for all of this. I can see where some people could be waking up to some of the more "saner" things. But I look at this thread that we've been talking back and forth about and I'm afraid that might be too off in the "batshit insane" department for a lot of people to even think about. My gut feeling would be the reaction would hit on "This is nuts. What the hell are you smoking to even talk about this theory?" I hate how the term "conspiracy theory" is basically made fun of. I look at this and think it basically adds up to 1 + 1 = 2. You have bad people in this world + You have bad people that have power and control = evil things happening. And maybe that's the simple way to word it. Maybe it's more along the lines of "I know. You're a little kid and you're told that there's no monster under the bed. Don't worry about it, don't be afraid about it. And you're able to hug your teddy bear and go to sleep. To realize that there are monsters in this world and they're everywhere, well, is it any wonder we've gone into shock, don't know what to do, etc?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's other things I've noticed where a lot of people don't think. And I might be wording that incorrectly. I'm not calling them 'sheeple' or something like that. I think of 'freedom'. I think of the meaning and the whole concept of it. It seems like so many have boiled it down to a bumper sticker slogan and there's just nothing to think about. "America, we have freedom and always will. Nothing to think about!" While it's a very difficult pill to swallow if you do think about freedom and wonder if you have it. If you do have it, can it be taken away? If you don't have it, how long will it take others to sit up and think about freedom?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. A lot of shit is out in the open, and a lot more shit is coming out even more so…but there is in fact still a big, concerted effort to keep the flood gates of information from being opened to the public.--And I think that's why they want to create these wars between the 'peons'. Fight each other and they won't see the biggest enemies that the 'peons' should be standing against.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn’t doubt that something might be happening. There are a lot of things we don’t know that go on in the universe, after all.--True.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, I don’t even know what “Dolly’s braces” are. Did Dolly Parton have braces and then not have braces in the Mandela Effect thing or something?--This one might be difficult for me to explain because I'm not familiar with the Bond movies. There's a male character that has a metal 'mouth'. He meets this Dolly character and she has braces on her teeth. That's a reason why they bonded because they both have 'metal mouths'. She doesn't have the braces anymore and supposedly never had them to start with. And people are swearing up and down that it's wrong and that she definitely had braces.
      </p>
      <p>
       …I don’t even know who Jim Nabors is…--lmfao, fair enough. Again, I was somebody that grew up on so many old shows and my favorite channels were Nick @ Nite and Tv Land. That was pretty much the reaction I'd get from school if I mentioned something old I liked. So don't feel about not knowing who Jim was. :D
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wow. Robert Palmer’s dead? Didn’t know that.--Yep, 2003.

       What seems to be happening as far as I can assess is similar to this in the sense that we’ve been told and have been reared and raised and indoctrinated to believe things are one way - “The world and the civilization we live in and the universe around us are one particular way only.” we’ve been told - but some of us (many of us even) are starting to wake up to the fact that much of what we’ve been told has actually been a pretty heavy lie.

       We have it, but I’m not sure too many of us understand the ways in which we do and don’t have “freedom”.  Our Greater Identity might be free in many spiritual and multidimensional ways, but here on this planet, we are largely limited and trapped in much of what we do and can’t do.

I do feel like I side stepped a lot of the traps set up here, that's not to say I didn't fall through some of them. And I do realize how difficult it must be to even find yourself in a trap and know you have to get yourself out of it. I've compared it on other sites to being buried alive and trying to dig your way out of that. The shit's just that thick.

Doesn't mean I agree with what they're doing. I just see how it'd be dangerous if they didn't try and throw dirt on people that can think for themselves, not swallowing the bullshit and are talking about the shit being done. "Don't listen to them, they're crazy!" Huge problem for them if people realized the shit is truly shit and just how deeply the public has been bullshitted, lied to, manipulated, etc.

       I watched an hour last night and plan on watching the rest tonight. I really wish everybody could watch this and have an open mind about it. It's not so hard for me to watch this because I already go into it knowing so much has been hidden from us, destroyed so we wouldn't know, etc. I say it that way because of I realize how easy it'd be for some people to hand wave off about how weak we are compared to those that came before us. "Ah, he doesn't know what he's talking about. There's nothing wrong with us!"
      </p>
      <p>
       A part that stuck out to me involved Lloyd talking about the way humans walk and how it wears out our joints. How do I word this next part? It's not like I'm 8 years old and it's not like I'm 80 years old. Even with my young(ish) age, I already have my problems. Fair warning, I'm a klutz. I've never broken any bones before, I've just busted my ass enough times that one knee in particular is gonna give me hell as I get older.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weakness of our bones compared to the past species is another bitter pill to swallow imo. I've got how I want to word it in my head. I've talked about thought a lot about the stuff being done to us. But this is like another rabbit hole that I'd honestly never thought deeply about when it concerns being made inferior on purpose. I'm not the person that made that youtube comment and I'm not sure if you've seen it, I just couldn't help thinking "Yeah, that's pretty much it in a nutshell" when I read it: "I can definitely see why they wouldn't want this main stream because everybody would be pissed and in an uproar. We was slapped together in some extraterrestrial lab like a cheap Made in China toy then sent out to do the slave work disposable nothing but an inefficient, weak, unstable being.﻿"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm enjoying the delivery of the lecture. It's not dry or boring, it's being told in a straight forward way, understandable way. And I thank you again for passing the link along. I'll come back when I finish it.

       Sounds about right, unfortunately.  Interesting that you post that because I was just listening to
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtonZ37Pn9k">
        this

       , and it intimates quite a bit of the same sentiments as you just did here.

I think it’d help a lot of people understand that a lot of this world is not much like we’ve been taught and indoctrinated to believe it is.--Even if it's said in a joking manner like "Are we in the Twilight Zone? haha, what is up with this place?!" would make me somewhat pleased that the person is at least noticing there's a lot off the rails here.

       Yep. Thinking about us being made inferior on purpose is a whole other ball of wax altogether when you consider things in that manner.--Truly. I know I've been very vocal about how pissed I am about what's going on here, the not knowing, having to fill in your own answers, etc. But hearing that stunned me into realizing there's still more to go down this rabbit hole, more puzzle pieces left to put together, etc.

       Gonna give the link you just listened a listen after I submit this post. Here's what I took from the rest of the Lloyd lecture:
      </p>
      <p>
       I forgot to mention that I'd read/heard from other different sources about how we're not adapted to live on this planet. And I'd also heard the gold theory before from other different sources. And also how stuff like the pyramids weren't made by humans. But I'd say pretty much the rest of what he was talking about was new for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something that makes me uncomfortable takes place when Lloyd's talking about how you don't want your 'slave' to be smarter than the creators. Fair enough, makes perfect sense. Make something stronger/smarter than you and it might be able to fight back and overthrow the old 'system'. Anyway, it's that bit of laughter when he's talking about us being pond scum compared to them really bugs me. I don't pick it up as 'haha, he's crazy' laughter or even nervous laughter. It's like he cracked a joke and he really didn't. No matter what's really going on in our existence, can I honestly sit here and say that you don't have others that have that attitude? The people are the easiest to prove since they're right here. Can't tell me that the ones higher up on that totem pole don't think of us as being pond scum or even worse. :/

       I want to stop this video and go ahead and make a comment on something. Let me be careful of how I word this because I don't want to be somebody that bitches about advances when I'm typing this out on a computer connected to the internet.  I get that. It's just two different things when I compare the things that truly can make life easier/better, whether it's known about or it's hidden away from us versus the stuff that I think's gonna be like a boot cracking down on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad he's pointed out Boston Dynamics, I believe I've seen some of the creations they've made on other youtube videos before. It honestly freaked the hell out of me tbh.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ending makes me feel bad tbh. I'll hear crazy shit and think the person that did that was an idiot. I'll use Tide Pods as an example. I had seen somebody making a reference to people eating Tide Pods and at first I didn't have a clue what the hell they were talking about. Goodness knows I know how a VERY young child might not know what they're doing. Anybody above a certain age and intelligence level doing that, something went wrong somewhere.  I'm not sure what to make of it. A lot of people blame social media, let me act like a twit or do something stupid to share with my 'followers', etc. I can't really say that's not involved. I just think of common sense and how it's seem to have gone out the window. Imo it's all by design. Who gets the blame for that? Do you blame the 'zombie idiots' for being zombie idiots or trace the downward spiral changes and blame the ones making the designs for us being total idiots?
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize this is a work of fiction, you ever read or watched "Flowers in the Attic"? You know the arsenic poisoning storyline? Who gets the blame for the kids being poisoned? Should the blame go more towards the kids that didn't know about it til Cory and Mickey (Cory's mouse) died or the one doing the poisoning?

       That’s, I think, a really good question.  I think it’s a complicated dynamic.  Initially, I personally blame the creators - the ones making the zombies in the first place.  I wouldn’t blame the zombies themselves.  They were created that way.  However, if and when the zombie wakes up to the fact that they’ve been manipulated, but they don’t do anything to change their situation, then at THAT point I’ll blame the zombie if they don’t want to be that way but they KEEP being a zombie even after they find out that they were created to be that way.

       Well-said. Yep. Rabbit hole goes pretty fathomlessly deep, it seems. Lots of puzzle pieces left to put together indeed.--Truly. You think you're getting a tiny bit of a grasp on what's going on and there's always gonna be new things that make you think otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wish I could disagree with that, but this might be closer to the truth than not, unfortunately.--Yeah, I know why you're wording it that way. Sad thing to say is I knot I singled out the higher up on the totem pole for that. Don't get me wrong when I say I think it goes all the way down. The ones in the middle of the pole can be openly scornful for the ones beneath them, ones on the lower can look down at the ones not even on the pole. Again, it's shitty to talk like this. Just think it's something that needs to be said and though about.

But I also think a lot of 'out of the box' thinking is required if you stumble on something that makes you think even for 2 minutes about your situation. There's a lot of batshit crazy things going on, I'm not so sure if the person would make much headway if they stay on the 'straight and narrow' though process instead of "Maybe this is a subject I need to think for myself about." Imo that goes back to so much of what we're taught. We're taught WHAT to think as opposed to HOW to think and those are two drastically different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       And goodness knows I know this is a damn difficult topic to talk and think about. I get how it'd be impossible to keep your nose to the grindstone during every period of time you have free time. I get how people have to truly have some free time in order to let loose. You can fill in your own blanks for what I mean with 'let loose'. I don't want it sound like my answer is "Gonna stop thinking tonight and go clubbing!" I'm not into clubbing. If that's another person's answer, fair enough. If they want to sit down and read a long book, fair enough. Just don't sticking a topic like this on the back burner and forgetting about it. I've seen this when it concerns other issues in my life, I can't just stick my head up my ass and thinking everything will go away once I come out for fresh air. Those ignored problems don't just magically vanish into thin air. They usually tend to multiply many times over.

       There’s a lot that is kept from us on this planet.--No argument there.
      </p>

       I’m not sure it isn’t manipulated to be like this by certain covert influences.--Or on this either.

       Yep. You’re exactly right. And most people don’t really have free time. Most people are working and have jobs, and have to pay bills and rent and mortgage, etc. TPTB like it like this because it keeps people from looking into what’s really going on in this world too much.--Hamster running around the hamster wheel practically 24/7.  Or the life struggle of trying to keep my head above water and it's getting harder with each passing day. I should've worded that other a bit differently. That life struggle of trying to keep your head above water is what eats up the majority of the time, absolutely agree it's all by design. But I can see where a person wouldn't want to keep their nose to the grindstone and research topics like this during any time they do have free time--even if it's an hour a day. Attitude might be "Life's hard enough on its own. Do I really need to research something that's gonna be what pulls me down completely into the water?"***
      </p>
      <p>
       ***I really want to comment on that last part. I know you haven't said anything of the sort, I just want to say this to anybody that's reading these threads and thinking "This is such a hopeless theory to talk about. It just drives fear into you and you get this 'stuck' feeling. Hell, you might be talking in a manner that makes people want to go throw themselves off the nearest bridge." I realize the shit going on is horrifying. I'm somebody that has a lot of anxieties when it concerns my personal life. And you would think this would be a topic I'd avoid like the plague because it'd make things worse. And I don't think of it like that. I feel empowered when I research this topic and talk about it. I feel like a flame's being lit under me. I want to keep moving ahead when it concerns researching, thinking and talking about this topic. I want to know as much as I can. I want to be prepared in order to be ready to defend when the time comes. This isn't something that makes me want to grab all the boxes of kleenex in the house, crawl under the bed, shiver and cry for the rest of my life. Example might be silly, this topic makes me feel like David Banner 'hulking out'. So I really do want to highlight the feeling of being empowered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep. Agreed. I feel the same way. I’m trying to find out as much as I can about what’s really going on here regardless of who else thinks whatever.--Same here. The spark's just too under me to turn away from this kind of topic.

Far better to be aware of the truth that you’re living in a shit hole because at that point you can possibly do something to get out of it, rather than to be brainwashed into thinking that the shit hole is some great utopia.  If you think that, then you’re a LOT less likely to ever get out of that shit hole.

       No.  It doesn’t make things worse, actually.

This is looking at everything with clear eyes that are wide open and seeing the fucked up things in this very fucked up world. And like I was saying earlier, I'm not gonna lie to myself.

There was no distrust in me, no fire to ask questions, no thought about the possibility of voicing my doubt if I felt like I was being fed bullshit, no desire to fight for my life with whatever they threw at me. I have those qualities now. And I also have looked outside my own door and saw all the pain and suffering others go through.

       I understand this, but know that the identity we have when we’re young, or even throughout our entire physical life, isn’t necessarily the identity of the soul that is animating the body.  What this means is that if you were to die at, say, seven years old, your soul/spiritual identity wouldn’t necessarily remain a seven year old child after you cross over to the other side.  This is a quite complicated topic, and I’ve already posted a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of information here, so I don’t want to bog things down with even more walls of text, but know that the identity that you have during your physical life isn’t necessarily the same as or the totality of your complete spiritual identity.

        Sometimes you're dealing with shit and it is a case of "I fucked up and I hurt myself." And other times you have people that will create the pain and make others suffer.

He decides to get behind the wheel and drive home instead of asking somebody to take him home or calling a cab. He gets into an accident and doesn't have a scratch on him. The other driver was killed on impact." What if that other driver had a family that he or she left behind? Not only was the other driver impacted by a stupid decision, that other driver's family will have to spend the rest of their lives without the person they loved being in their life.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This might sound harsh, but it’s possible that the person he killed actually agreed to experience that prior to that life, and that person’s entire family also agreed to experience what it was like to have to deal with the loss as well.  Sounds totally backward, yes, but most of us humans in this world are kept entirely in the dark about what’s really going on spiritually and multidimensionally - the lessons that might be involved - and the truth is a bit more complicated than many of us might think.

      <p>
       The “Bill Bixby vs the elites” example is a very good one as it pertains to karma.  If one doesn’t know anything about karma or past lives or the eternality of the soul, then the things that happen in any particular life might seem completely unfair.  However, when you understand that karma is based upon
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the lives that a soul has lived, then one begins to understand that you might not experience the repercussions of what you did in, say, “Life A” - which might have happened a hundred lifetimes ago in 1422 - until
       <em>
        this very life right now
       </em>
       in 2018.  It just really all depends.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one doesn’t understand karma, then a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of the things that happen to us and to everyone else seem more and more unfair.  It’s very difficult to have a real knowledge of karma, however, because, again, we are
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       very kept in the dark in this world and in this civilization.  We live very short lifespans, and the majority of the time we’re here, we’re largely ignorant of anything but the most superficially physical things.  The vast majority of what really happens, however, takes place in the non-physical world.  If one is ignorant about the laws in the non-physical realm and how those laws effect our physical lives, then almost everything that happens to us physically seems random and often unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are kept ignorant and in the dark by TPTB on this planet because it makes it far easier to debilitate and control us that way.  We are a slave population on a prison planet…but this is a different conversation, so I’ll move away from that for the moment.

        hand shoots up in the air like the question was "Who wants cookies?!
       </em>
       Not to mention how it casts light on the one that did the killing. Should he be punished if this is all a set up? "We agreed you'd be killed, you all would mourn, and you're gonna be the one that kills him." Not to mention it also seems like a pendulum swinging back and forth and we're all going in a loop. You be the victim in this life and the next life you can be the one making the victims suffer, you're the victim again, now you're the one making the victims suffer, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       then one begins to understand that you might not experience the repercussions of what you did in, say, “Life A” - which might have happened a hundred lifetimes ago in 1422 - until this very life right now in 2018. It just really all depends.--And that doesn't seem right to me. I've said on other threads and sites that I'd compare that to somebody that killed a lot of people, you get punished and get the jail sentence in this life. You die before the sentence is completed. Still got a sentence to complete. Gonna track who this person reincarnated as and go arrest a newborn. Still got that sentence to complete and you'll do it whether it take you 10 lifetimes to do it. Still seems like a ball and chain dragging behind you. You'll never break free because everybody's gonna fuck something up. Have I killed a person? No. But I'm sure as hell scared of cockroaches and I've killed plenty of those. Gonna be treated the same as somebody that killed people? "You still took lives away from roaches and that makes you a cockroach serial killer. You will pay the price for killing so many."

       We are kept ignorant and in the dark by TPTB on this planet because it makes it far easier to debilitate and control us that way. We are a slave population on a prison planet…but this is a different conversation, so I’ll move away from that for the moment.--Might be a different conversation but I'd agree with what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want a possible answer to that, then here. Read this right here (including the link in the response).--Gonna click on it and read it. Might be tomorrow night before I can reply to what's on that link if there's anything that pops out at me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’ll take another lifetime or two before things arrive at the “new normal” of a better civilization.--But has it ever been better? The past isn't all that great either. I think of slavery or segregation and it pains me anybody had to go through that shit. I sure as hell can't sit here and say "Aw, that wasn't that bad." Or even sweep it under the rug. "Shit, that was in the past. Why talk about it or even think about it today?" Different horror shows all throughout history imo.

       If above so below then: what this theory claims is that we are slaves in a metaphysical sense, which would mean that in a more important level of consciousness we are prisoners of evil, this evil is the supreme force that rules us, free consciousness. The problem with this is that for evil to exist there must be good. Darkness vs. light. If you as a flawed human yet are capable of being more conscious and thrive for kindness, why assume that higher intelligences are only bound to evil?. Demiurge or not, evil/chaos cannot reign supreme in a metaphysical sense, because chaos and order exist as contrasts  that  serve as guidelines in which we exercise our free will. the fact that you are aware of this proves it. Now imagine the power you have against an ant. An ant can see you but does not react, you can pick one up and do what you will..crush it or let it go. The ant is not as aware of it's own reality but you are and you get to CHOOSE to be evil to it or not, same with animals. In other words, if there are archangels/archons they still are bound to the same universal rules of light and dark. Now what's beyond them if we are like ants to them? Something even higher: the source. Now if this source is a conscious God or not, it's hard to tell but I would guess at some point there a higher consciousness that transcends the good-evil duality and IF that force is the source of all that means that it is a creative (love) force which we can at least suppose this is in fact true since we exist and everything exists. Therefore the ruling force is a creative one not a destructive one, it has to be in order for everything to BE. And another points: 1) Evil as bad as it is, it also serves a porpoise: to be used as contrast and point us to be conscious of it's other side which is compassion, love, etc in other words if everything was great and there was no evil we would not be aware that live even exists. 2) If we are all slaves bound to these forces forever, why make so much as creating a whole world with tools that could make us transcend them? Why the people that have discovered this haven't disappeared? Or died? What even makes you believe that you could escape this by saying a magical phrase such as: I resign to the reincarnation process etc..if your answer is: because I own my consciousness, I am a sovereign soul. Then you are already agreeing that you believe in a higher force that is creative and transcends these beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is this: worst case scenario what you say it's true...some evil higher consciousness rules us all In a 'they live' kind of scenario. If this is the case then why think that there is no higher loving consciousness above them? If, after all, these beings have been granted with the gift of life (construction) and free will (which itself gives you the choice between good and evil).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, maybe they are tricksters and could disguise as good entities, influence weak people, tempt mankind with a huge advantage...sure, it's very possible.. but to say that evil is the be all - end all..don't think it's the case. If we as "lowly" humans are able to see the beauty and power of love and life, I don't think higher consciousness beings are incapable of doing the same.

       <em>

       That’s a good quality to have.  It seems that you don’t see too much about this life that’s too positive, however.  I wouldn’t disagree too much with this, to be honest with you.  It’s certainly very tough here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Maybe I've got people I like in the class with me. Or a more shallow note, maybe there's somebody I had a crush on in the class. That made it more tolerable. As for positive experiences in this existence, I see them and see they're gonna turn to negatives.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Just like the positives that you just talked about in an actual class that you can use to help you see the class in a “more tolerable” light, there haven’t been any positive experiences you’ve had in the actual “class of life itself” to help you see things in a more positive light?
      </p>
      <p>
       And just so you know, I can be
       <em>

      <p>
       The opposite to this, however, is to have them remain alive forever on this planet…but haven’t you said that the elite on this planet are pretty horrible and manipulative?  It would seem that the last thing anyone would want on a planet like this then is to continue living on forever.  If it’s as bad as you say (and as I often myself think it is), then the sooner you die, the better, no?
      </p>

      <p>
       Well, again, learning how to keep yourself from continuing to get fed upon
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a life lesson.  I’d say it’s one of the most important life lessons, as a matter of fact.  If you don’t know what you have to do in order to keep yourself from getting fed upon, then you’re simply not evolved and developed enough to keep yourself from continuing to get sent back to this planet over and over again.  When we evolve enough to learn to keep ourselves from continuing to get fed upon, we will presumably graduate and no longer have to keep reincarnating here.

        the Hidden Hand link I sent you in my previous response

      </p>
      <p>
       What does a strict, disciplinarian school teacher get out of giving her students difficult tests that many of them often flunk, for example?

       It can be said that she is preparing her students as best as possible for the difficulties they will face as they continue forth on their scholastic journeys.

      <p>
       According to the Hidden Hand information, the elite have superiors above them to answer to as well, and their actions are not without consequence.

      <p>
       It certainly does sound cruel on a certain level.  Yes.  A child getting a spanking from a parent who is disciplining them might sound (and actually be) cruel as well - but it can also serve as a valuable lesson and learning tool as well.

      <p>
       Yeah.  It is indeed pretty horrific.  Agreed.  I personally can understand a parallel, however, between the difficulties presented to us in this world on one end, and the difficulties we face growing up and getting, for example, disciplined by tough but loving parents on the other.

      <p>
       As far as the law of karma is concerned, there actually kind of
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       no punishment per se.  Again, there is only balance.  The victim and the punisher in this life, for example, switch places in the next life until both develop a better and better understanding of the grand scheme of things, of the rules of actions-and-consequences, and of the manner in which all things are connected.

       good observation.  Very good point.

      <p>
       In many ways, it
       <em>

       a loop.  It is a “ground hog day” type of event over and over again.  These lives we lead can be looked upon as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, it’s simply like a math class.  You’re not going to get the 2+2=4 lesson immediately when you first start.  You have to go through it over and over again sometimes until you finally get the lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get tests, you fail, you study, you do better, you get more tests, you fail less badly, study some more, get more tests, do better in them, and graduate to the next level of tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       These lives we live are just tests we get - over and over again - until we finally get the lessons we’re supposed to learn.

       Interesting that you say this because it actually seems

        entirely fair

       to me as far as I can assess it.  If one does a crime and there’s a certain punishment for it, then death should not be looked upon as any sort of “free ticket out” of your punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you did the crime, you should do the time regardless of whether you die or not.  That doesn’t seem unfair to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s how you learn to not do the crime again.

      <p>
       As far as I see it, it seems you absolutely will break free.  You come into every life with
       <em>
        feelings
       </em>
       as to what things you naturally like and gravitate to, and what things you don’t like, etc.  A lot of those proclivities, believe it or not, are said to have come from previous experiences in other lives you had.  Like, take me, for example.  I’m not a smoker or a drinker or a substance abuser of any sort.  Never have been even though I used to be in pretty heavy rock bands and everyone around me used to be the craziest substance abuser and I had all kinds of crazy stuff going on around me at all times…and yet I never felt even mildly interested in partaking in any of it.  I knew it was pointless and useless even though I didn’t have any long history of “knowing” about it in this life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t doubt that I might have experienced everything and gotten things like that out of my system in lives past so that it means nothing to me now and I see right through it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s how you learn.  Do I
       <em>
        specifically remember
       </em>
       any of those past lives?  No.  I don’t.  However, I do have very strong feelings about certain things to do and not do.  I emotionally have a deep understanding of
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7405j4/itzhac_bentov_on_drugs/">
        things like I explained here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that I don’t really have a sufficient amount of information from this life to account for my feelings about this, however, lets me know that those feelings were likely acquired in another manner - from some other experience independent of this life I’m living now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s my point in all this as it pertains to your “You’ll never break free because everybody’s gonna fuck something up” statement?  My point is that you likely won’t fuck
       <em>
        the same thing
       </em>
       up over and over again in life after life.  You learn from your experience.  The more you experience, the more you learn what to do and what
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to do…and the more you learn this, the more you evolve and become a being that is far better able to keep yourself from being taken advantage of in the future; the more you’re able to break out of whatever manipulation you might be under.

      <p>
       You wanna know something?  We actually
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       pay for being a cockroach serial killer.  However, the price won’t be as severe as if one was, say, a human serial killer.  And what would the punishment be?  Well, let me put it this way:  The type of mentality that a human would have to have to be a serial killer of other humans is also the type of mentality that would likely make one be pretty devolved in other areas of their life that would make them accrue pretty heavy negative karma - karma that would likely force them to come back and live life after life over and over again.  If one were a roach serial killer and that’s it, however? One will likely end up having to come back and be reborn again as well, but the lessons one would have to learn are
       <em>
        nowhere NEAR
       </em>
       as massive and as serious as a human serial killer would.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s kind of like the difference between getting an 85 on a test as the roach serial killer and a
       <em>
        40

       I see your point.  Definitely.  It also depends on what one’s state of development is, what needs to get done in order to evolve, and how willing or resistant one is to improving themselves.  For example, if one is a straight F student, has a very “fuck school” attitude and has fought with every nice teacher that’s ever tried to help, yet you still want to help that student pass their class, then there have been times when the best approach under these circumstances is to have “very tough love”.  There have been many individuals like this who have been put in very rough, take-no-shit reformatory programs who ended up getting “scared straight” by some extremely hard-nosed “prison teachers”, and were better off for the experience.

       Sometimes the only way to help an extremely incorrigible asshole student is to box their ears a bit in order to make them pay attention.

       In this case, it is humanity as a whole that is the “incorrigible asshole student” that needs its ears box a bit.

      <p>
       Yes.  I can understand this.  There is much negativity in this world.  Absolutely.  One good thing that you in particular can be said to be getting out of all the horror shows from the past and present, however, is that it reminds you of what you yourself must never be, must stay away from, should always strive to be better than.  It can serve as a consistent reminder to you of what you never want to move toward at all.

       Stockholm Syndrome happens if you end up wanting to
       <em>
        be like
       </em>
       your enslavers.  This is nothing like that, however.  The lesson is to never be like all the negativity you see in this world.  It’s good for you to be disgusted by it all.  You
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be.  It is in fact disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stockholm Syndrome would be loving the perpetrators and liking the harm they inflict.  Blach.  One should absolutely not do or want that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use what you see around you as examples of what you
       <em>
        don’t
       </em>
       want to be like - examples of what you want to stay away from.

       There is no Stockholm Syndrome that would ever occur in any perspective like that.

       So then stop looking at it - as much as you can anyway.  If you already

       it exists and know what you need to stay away from, then that’s enough.  Your lesson’s been learned.  Stay away from it and that should be that.

      <p>
       In your case, the lesson has already been learned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many others on this planet, unfortunately, don’t learn the lesson as effectively and end up getting themselves absolutely trapped in all the harms of this horrible planet
       <em>
        before

Perhaps because they had never before experience what they’re going through in the video.  If they keep going through in life after life the same thing they’re going through in the video, however, you don’t think that they’ll eventually wake up and

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The recent past in this civilization hasn’t.  True.  Recent as in the past few thousand years.  The concept of civilizational cycles influenced and dictated by this solar system’s progression around the galaxy, as well as its proximity with and orbit around the solar system of Sirius A (a solar system it’s been said
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       solar system is in orbit with - so both solar systems are orbiting around each other), dictate the energy level of each star.  The closer the stars are to one another, the higher the collective energies of each star, as well as each of the planets revolving around each star (and all the beings living on/in each of those planets).  The further apart each star is, the weaker each star is and their planets and beings on those planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stars were at their aphelion points (furthest away from one another) for quite a long time, so they and their planets and inhabitants were at their lowest, weakest, most ignorant, devolved points.  They just rounded the corner and are beginning to move closer to one another now, however, so their collective energies are rising.

       Then you can still break out of it - just like African slaves did years ago.  Shit, horrible, corrupt system they were in during slavery times, but even though it can be said that African American culture is still quite debilitated today, they’ve been able to accomplish a lot of freedom nonetheless from the horrible, corrupt system they’ve been in.  Are they completely out of it?  No.  However, they’re still not in the same place they were even only a century ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s my point?  My point is that just as in this life one can
       <em>
        fight
       </em>
       their way out of a corrupt system, one can also fight their way out of a corrupt system outside of this physical life as well.
