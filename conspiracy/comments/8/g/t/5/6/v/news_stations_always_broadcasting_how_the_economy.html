       Seattle also spends so much money on homeless that they could give everyone homeless 10000 bucks each and instead they pay the person in charge of handling the situation over 100000 a year to do nothing but move the camps around every month.

       SF Bay Area.  Tent cities all over the place in SF and Oakland.  I pass several, 2-8, per daily commute.  I pass a city-run "tiny home" lot with around 30 tiny homes, surrounded by barbed wire and flood lights, to house the homeless.  I see tent cities with painted fences, flags, and signage ("12th St Commons" or "Camp Ne'er Do Well" or "Home Street Home" for example).  Those are organized and have leadership/infrastructure from within.  Virtually every underpass is edge to edge tents.  Its strikingly weird when an underpass is cleared (and if so it means that underpass is used by pedestrians).  Some camps are spilling into the shoulders of roads, so there is no curb or other boundary between traffic and tent (I assume these are storage tents).  Virtually every patch of non-paved ground is taken.  Lil grass cut-outs between freeway off-ramps:  camp.  That circle in the middle of the big round on-ramps:  camp.  The strip of grass between off-ramp and industrial zone:  camp.  Any small city park:  camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a big ole city lot, empty, surrounded by freeway, a church, and industry.  There is a service entrance/maintenance access passage in the sound wall between freeway and neighborhood.  Thru this hole lives, I dunno, dozens.  They have fires every night and there is at least 2 cars parked here all the time.  Sometimes up to 8-10 cars.  I believe the people are working as cars are gone mid-day, lots at night/weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 2-5 RV and car campers on my block (they rotate around), so there is a whole other strata of homeless not in tents.  In industrial zones, the RV becomes the center of a camp, and they'll use the RV and nearby fencing to tie-up tarps, secure pallets-as-walls, and otherwise set up infrastructure.  One RV-centered camp has the RV, and then two pallet homes.  They take pallets, raft them together, attach wheels to the bottom, then build simple wooden boxes on the pallet-raft, complete with simple door and lock.  These are maybe 8' x 10' x 10'.  The wheels keep it over any puddle, and if the cops come, they can wheel the unit to a new spot.

       Interesting!  Hopefully a Sac resident will chime in.  I'm curious.  I wonder if the camps get bigger in Sac due to more space but less "approved" ground for the camps to exist on.

       I would assume so.  Did you see that robot the SPCA had to scare off the homeless in SF?

       Ha, yes. I used to own a small business blocks from SPCA, the employees would frequent my place.  I understood their situation but, lol at using a robot.

      <p>
       Half the campers are cool.  Half run a chop-shop for stolen bikes.  I kinda knew the chop-shop half would not allow the robot around for long.

       If you check ShadowStats you'll find the actual unemployment rate is  21%. The college graduates are underwater owing more than they earn. The retired have no savings, their interest on savings was stolen by the Federal Reserve right at the peak of the boomer curve. Pensions are in the shitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wealth continues to be extracted from the middle class absorbed by the .01% oligarchs. Speculators, flippers, consortiums are buying if you believe houses are actually selling. The latest charts show prices dropping. According to Charles Nenner it's going to be
       <em>
        way worse
       </em>
       and that will soon show in the sales, and the streets. Meanwhile our government pisses the wealth away on war-making.

       The real problem is the incredible insensitivity of society hating the homeless without realizing how close they themselves are to that fate. Sitting on the brink of bankruptcy, looking out the window of their cars, they clench their jaws and curse the homeless or simply turn away.

       In the burbs, yes.  In the urban environments this attitude wanes considerably (unless rich, in which case they are not close to the line).  The car/RV campers on my block are not harassed.  They access the trash and recycling cans on trash day with no hassle.
       <br/>
       The tent cities are fed by roving bands of volunteer punks, churches, and secular black community groups.  Almost daily I see a random car pull over to a tent city and take a trash bag.  I've seen/heard of neighbors hassling the City when they try and sweep a camp (this could be self-interest, a stable tent city is better than roving campers).

       So it's like Woodstock. Perhaps we should call it the
       <em>
        Homeless Lifestyle
       </em>
       . I know let's start a magazine "Homeless Stylz!" wherein we discuss homeless
       <em>
        choices
       </em>
       , you know, "Spam or Packaged Weiners?" or articles on getting rid of scabies with gasoline. I could write the article, "Where to piss near the Denny's at 70th street."

       It's like Woodstock, yea.  Homeless and the housed-but-poor kinda help each other out the way folks at a festival help each other out more than in normal life.

       Way more hip and groovy when you put it that way. Choices are endless being unencumbered with things and stuff. We can look at the police kicking us out of a canyon, or ditch, they deliver

       In Las Vegas around Fremont Street the cops will shue the homeless off the tourist streets so the homeless seem much more concentrated in those areas then in West or East Las Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just East of Fremont are dozens of bungalow motels that were built in the 50s and 60s that are boarded up and awaiting demolition.  From what I understand Amazon owns all that property since they bought Zappos

       Atlanta has the most polite homeless I've ever encountered.  Out West, they just ask for money or get mildly belligerent.  In Atl, they talk as if we're meeting for a beer, giving me the life story.  Like jeez dude, here is a dollar stop talking.

       I am in Chicago and on my way to work today, around 7 this am, the city rousted a large camp on Lower Randolph. It has been growing for a while and I cant make it the two blocks from work to 711 without encountering at least two or three people asking for money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prime wall where the original settlers live is a complex called Lakeshore East. Two bedroom rent is $4,200 a month plus, and condos sell for $650,000 plus. Across the river, on the north side, townhomes sell for $1.2 million or more.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the third time I have seen this since February, and each time the camp is larger. Housing prices continue to climb, so does crime.

       Central Florida chiming in.  Lots of foreclosures popping up on auction.com. Many more pan handlers and homeless people. It’s not so bad that there are a ton of camps. But there are some in Downtown Tampa and in Orlando .  Almost all of the churches offer hot meals on the weekend.  And there are lines of people. Maybe not homeless yet but hungry.

       San Diego Home of Comic-con and Hepatitis. I watched cops chasing homeless away from wherever they rest. They send crews through to take all their bedding and meager belongings. When faced with a hepatitis epidemic the put some temporary tents up, now gone. Instead of cleaning, manning public restrooms, the idiots in government
       <strong>
        closed them
       </strong>
       ! They hired an Arizona company to spray the streets with bleach. Now the homeless are shitting in buckets in canyons. The regularly clear brush so the cops can see them to roust them, now in the river bottoms, mosquito infested muddy shitholes and ramshackled cardboard shacks occasionally "swept" by a bunch of goons. Later, another out of state mafia port-a-potty company was brought in. They fucking set them up
       <em>
        outside of the locked public bathrooms
       </em>
       and proceeded to NOT MAINTAIN THEM. When that didn't work out, Mexican contractors came and hose them out leaving the outhouse standing in a pond of shit-water requiring one to soak their shoes to take a shit. Instead of cleaning, maintaining, stocking the original public restrooms, they rolled in trailers for "Community Policing" to watch the port-a-pottys in their pond of shit-water, and roust anyone who isn't obsequious enough. "America's Finest City" indeed.

       Southwest Florida. Rent and home prices have increased to pre 2007 levels in most areas, amd still climbing. I work with addresses and when looking at property appraisers sites I will see whole neighborhoods owned by corporations. Not as many actual home owners as my city touts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only jobs available are retail, and my area keeps touting these as career jobs. But these jobs are minimum wage and about 28 hrs a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices on some food items have increased as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in the epicenter of the collapse in 2007 &amp; 2008. So this is all feeling very familiar to me. Another one is coming.
