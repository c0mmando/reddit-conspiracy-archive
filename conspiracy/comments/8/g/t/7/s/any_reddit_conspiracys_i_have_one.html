    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s partially right. Nathan Filyk, who owns all of those accounts except for the two you mentioned and possibly DIGGISRUNBYTHEGOVT, does write for Alex Jones and he does receive payment for those articles. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s paid to direct traffic to prisonplanet but it is well known that Alex Jones is determined to use sites like Reddit and Digg to drive traffic and spread his propaganda. He&#39;s talked about it on his show and directed his listeners to &quot;attack&quot; these sites. Jones has even attacked me on the air for opposing the people posting his trash.</p>

<p>Is it possible that Nathan is being paid to do this? I suppose so but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that would indicate this. I think he&#39;s just an obsessed, mentally ill individual.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t pleasant at the time, but that&#39;s pretty awesome. My real question isn&#39;t why Nathan does it, it&#39;s why Alex Jones does it. I have my suspicions...</p>

<p>So what about the part about you guys getting banned from Digg? Is that true? You don&#39;t have to discuss it if you&#39;re not comfortable with it.</p>

If Jones was telling the truth and was confident that he was telling the truth he wouldn&#39;t need to be attacking those who post in opposition to him.

<p>Ed.</p>

<p>Maybe he has a secret reddit crush on you and is afraid to admit it. Kidding. But seriously, it&#39;s clear at this point that he really does thrive on the negative attention. The hard part for me is that I&#39;ve been playing Neverwinter Nights (D&amp;D) all day, and now it&#39;s hard to picture Nathan as anything but a large green monster who subsists on a diet of grubs and orcs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has, literally, been stalking me for over three years now. First it was on Digg and now it&#39;s here. He&#39;s obsessed with silencing anyone who disagrees with him. Have you seen his submissions? Just yesterday he posted no less than 12 different submissions all with the title, &quot;What Can Be Done To Curb Government Trolls Like Herkimer &amp; jcm267 in Reddit?&quot;</p>

<p>The only thing that I can figure is this guy knows that he&#39;s completely full of shit and, for whatever reason, he&#39;s determined to keep anyone from pointing that fact out. It&#39;s a sickness with him. People have been trying for years to get him to seek psychiatric help but he just refuses. The really scary part is that he&#39;s some sort of teacher. How would you like to have this psychotic asshole teaching your children?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. He&#39;s using me and jcm and others to try to convince people that the government is out to silence him. It&#39;s just the worst kind of pathological lying and self-delusion. Sometimes I worry that he actually believes the stuff he posts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not militantly against anything, I&#39;m just a skeptic. If you want to try to sell me a God or a conspiracy theory or anything else, you had better be able to back up your claim. Any theory that cannot be supported by numbers or sound scientific principles is simply guessing. Or, in Nathan&#39;s case, simply lying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not Peter_Pandemic, but you are a stooge and certainly you are duping other accounts, BoomptyMcBloog.</p>

<p>For the record, if you look at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Hopeformankind/comments/">my comment history</a>, you&#39;ll see that there were two messages before the last. So nice try at a conspiracy theory, but nobody&#39;s buying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like someone is stalking me right now. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s anyone who could be online at this moment that would be vindictive and spiteful enough to chase me all over reddit for one insignificant comment I made...yep, someone else commented on this thread right about the same time I wrote this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad that his ego is so fragile that any potentially critical comment is perceived as a traumatic blow to his sense of self-worth. I guess some people will never really be able to take care of themselves. Always looking for validation from anonymous strangers to support their unclear perception of reality. It&#39;s kind of pitiful, really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha I think he&#39;s stalking me again. What a tool. But seriously, if he is as mentally unbalanced as you say, why devote so much concern to him? He&#39;s going to be crazy whether you argue with him or not. Just downvote his bullshit and move on.</p>
