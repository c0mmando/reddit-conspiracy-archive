       For every post that defies convention. New one's appear accommodating an agenda. Let's talk crazy just for fun!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone here ever mess around with the occult/paranormal? What did you take away from the experience? Was the outcome something you expected?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone ever look into an empty sky and see a bright light centered in your view, only to look away and have it disappear?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do mirrors give you an uneasy feeling? ever day dream about phasing through glass?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just before falling asleep have you ever noticed two lights circling each other in the corner of the room?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you sometimes get the feeling that you've been living the same existence multiple times over. Like someone set the year on repeat?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you done the impossible? Solely reliant on reflex alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do spirals give you a strange feeling?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do other peoples emotions feel as though they emanate from within you? Have you ever encountered another empath and what was your consensus?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone feel as though they experience more instances of Dejavu than the average person? Can you recall when the overlap occurred?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do basic shapes have a resonating energy effect on you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do people call you an "old soul"? Have you ever entertained the thought of what that means?
      </p>
      <p>
       LOL I have more and so do all of you. Let's have some fun yeah?

       In high school (80s) I messed around with a Ouija board with some girl friends at a sleepover. I didn't have my hands on the little thing, but everyone else did. I asked it a question that NOBODY would have known the answer to - only I knew the answer. I asked it, "What did my Grandpa call me?" My Grandpa was Armenian and called me Little Lamb, but in Armenian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody at the sleepover knew my Grandpa because he had died in the late 70s. And he said the name in Armenian, so nobody would have known what he was saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, that Ouija board spelled out LAMB!
      </p>
      <p>
       I left immediately. Still freaks me out remembering it.

       I understand your feeling. These instances are extremely disconcerting. Your three friends manifested something unexplained beyond your control.. or did you manifest something beyond their control? Could it be possible you moved the planchet using your friends as the conduit.. If that is too outlandish. Would it be so bad that the residual energy of your grandfather "spoke" to you? Without fearing the unknown would you ever attempt this again?

       I didn't get the impression that this was residual energy of my grandfather speaking to me. If I had felt it was him, I would have been fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what made the Ouija board know. But whatever is was, it didn't give me a good feeling. So that is why I left the sleepover immediately. Left in the middle of the night. I didn't care what the other girls thought either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would I attempt this again? No. Ever since this happened, I have stayed away from Ouija boards.

       I'm a deja vu guy, I get them often and sometimes ultra vivid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll never forget one at work when some woman came over and it kicked in and as she was asking a question to someone else word for word I spoke along with her (quietly) because I knew what she was going to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that's stood out and I don't know if I'm imagining the connection or it's real is that when I start vuing they seem to remind me of certain lucid style dreams I've had rather than a 'I've been here before' feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also yes I know the association of dejavu and epilepsy and I've checked it out many times I just don't feel I match any of the other symptoms.

       And your recollection of these events does not diminish with time? The lucid dream state feels like your looking at an overlapped image? Seeing both instances at the same time. The feeling of a dejavu always takes over your frontal lobe, but feels like it comes from the base of your spine. And when they occur you get the freeze moment yes?

       No it's weird like usually you experience something then a week later if you recall it and relive the emotions, atmosphere etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I dejavu it's like that but in reverse so I feel like I'm living the moment I had previously only imagined, it's always pretty boring random stuff and lasts for 5 seconds maybe.

       Yes, 2 occasions were intentional, 2 were not. The first two answered questions, the last 2 made me question more.

       Nah, then again... I hate the day time (for some reason). I prefer the night. Always have.  I've seen strange shit in the night sky, though!

       Not really, I cover my eyes when I sleep. I do notice certain lights and patterns in the darkness though. They morph in and out of pictures. If that makes sense?

       So much of this! I could say so much, but, that would be getting way to personal for my liking. Yes, my life is on repeat, and I keep "bouncing back and forth - many with one person". It's curious.

       Yes, but... it's usually me keeping to the calm head in a sticky situation.  Not so much physical, but, yea... I can talk anyone into something or out of something.

      <p>
       Yes, I feel people's emotions way too much. I know people, even though "I don't know them". Certain people gravitate towards me. If you can break through the shell, that is... lol. With this ability, you also have a major bullshit detector, others just do not understand. Which is why many of us Empaths are quiet and keep to ourselves. We test people.

       All the time. Some people do not know where the fuck I come up with the advice I come up with for them (neither do I - but, I'm shit with with following my own advice). I'm not old, mind you ( I'm mid thirties - soul wise I feel way older).

       I saw a ghost once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I stayed with a Macumbero on his farm in Brazil for 5 days. He told me things about myself he would have no way of knowing, and he had a shed full of writhing snakes and I watched as he talked to them and they formed a perfect path for him as he walked through them, and then when he was in the middle of the shack they formed a perfect circle around him. He explained he was a 200 year old being, explained the concepts behind macumba....he was illiterate, but I noted some of the ideas he was talking about were from Hegel, Steven Hawking, Aristotle/Plato, etc. He also blessed some rose-water and him and his 'house' did a little ceremony with it and had me strip naked and poured it on me. I felt like I was on MDMA when I stood up.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day, no explanation for what I witnessed (ghost, macumba shit), except that there is some other esoteric side to life that others can tap into that we're ignorant of.

       we thought this way for thousands of years until Newton and other discovered the future could be predicted with a mechanical worldview. Now the result is flying machines, heart transplants and cell phones that communicate across distance.
The irony is how magical and successful this worldview is, when we threw away magical  supernatural thinking, only then did we aquire the capacity to do things and real hidden knowledge that every occultist can only fantasize about

       What if you could be persuaded to see the functionality of the "magic" formula? Is it not belief that drives the functional basis for the world economy's and governments? Newton did the best he could with what he had.. But did not find the truth. Others came close. All progressed humanity to it's present state. As i too utilize a device in relaying this message. This **is to being magical as 8dot3 is to your ntfs gui; kinda nice if you know how to use it. However i don't associate this technology with being as beneficial as you would have people believe. Ps. You won't begin to learn of "real" secrets until you lose your fear.

       Maybe  letting go of fear is letting go of human centric interpretations of the universe, the ego fears its nothing special in a cosmic sense, beyond its own braincase, or maybe the ego fears no after-life.

       Or maybe the universe is eternal energy, and all energy is consious. What if it's the universe that is dis-satisified by man? A few rotten apple's spoil the whole bunch. You are so close i bet even you felt the connection when that knowledge came to you. Let go and listen to the flow of energy around you. You are special, never stop seeking

       the universe  does expresses its dissatisfaction by Natural Selection and weeding out bad genes. 
You are so close , just let go of what you exspect  to see and just see the answers have been  literaly front of our faces the whole time. No romantic anti-natural thinking required.
