    <div class="md"><p>In high school (80s) I messed around with a Ouija board with some girl friends at a sleepover. I didn&#39;t have my hands on the little thing, but everyone else did. I asked it a question that NOBODY would have known the answer to - only I knew the answer. I asked it, &quot;What did my Grandpa call me?&quot; My Grandpa was Armenian and called me Little Lamb, but in Armenian.</p>

<p>Nobody at the sleepover knew my Grandpa because he had died in the late 70s. And he said the name in Armenian, so nobody would have known what he was saying.</p>

<p>Well, that Ouija board spelled out LAMB!</p>

<p>I left immediately. Still freaks me out remembering it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your feeling. These instances are extremely disconcerting. Your three friends manifested something unexplained beyond your control.. or did you manifest something beyond their control? Could it be possible you moved the planchet using your friends as the conduit.. If that is too outlandish. Would it be so bad that the residual energy of your grandfather &quot;spoke&quot; to you? Without fearing the unknown would you ever attempt this again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t get the impression that this was residual energy of my grandfather speaking to me. If I had felt it was him, I would have been fine.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what made the Ouija board know. But whatever is was, it didn&#39;t give me a good feeling. So that is why I left the sleepover immediately. Left in the middle of the night. I didn&#39;t care what the other girls thought either.</p>

<p>Would I attempt this again? No. Ever since this happened, I have stayed away from Ouija boards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a deja vu guy, I get them often and sometimes ultra vivid.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll never forget one at work when some woman came over and it kicked in and as she was asking a question to someone else word for word I spoke along with her (quietly) because I knew what she was going to say.</p>

<p>One thing that&#39;s stood out and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m imagining the connection or it&#39;s real is that when I start vuing they seem to remind me of certain lucid style dreams I&#39;ve had rather than a &#39;I&#39;ve been here before&#39; feeling.</p>

<p>Also yes I know the association of dejavu and epilepsy and I&#39;ve checked it out many times I just don&#39;t feel I match any of the other symptoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And your recollection of these events does not diminish with time? The lucid dream state feels like your looking at an overlapped image? Seeing both instances at the same time. The feeling of a dejavu always takes over your frontal lobe, but feels like it comes from the base of your spine. And when they occur you get the freeze moment yes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s weird like usually you experience something then a week later if you recall it and relive the emotions, atmosphere etc.</p>

<p>When I dejavu it&#39;s like that but in reverse so I feel like I&#39;m living the moment I had previously only imagined, it&#39;s always pretty boring random stuff and lasts for 5 seconds maybe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone here ever mess around with the occult/paranormal? What did you take away from the experience? Was the outcome something you expected?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, 2 occasions were intentional, 2 were not. The first two answered questions, the last 2 made me question more. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone ever look into an empty sky and see a bright light centered in your view, only to look away and have it disappear?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, then again... I hate the day time (for some reason). I prefer the night. Always have.  I&#39;ve seen strange shit in the night sky, though!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do mirrors give you an uneasy feeling? ever day dream about phasing through glass?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but... I refuse to take pictures. I believe they steal a part of your Soul Being.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just before falling asleep have you ever noticed two lights circling each other in the corner of the room?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, I cover my eyes when I sleep. I do notice certain lights and patterns in the darkness though. They morph in and out of pictures. If that makes sense?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you sometimes get the feeling that you&#39;ve been living the same existence multiple times over. Like someone set the year on repeat? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much of this! I could say so much, but, that would be getting way to personal for my liking. Yes, my life is on repeat, and I keep &quot;bouncing back and forth - many with one person&quot;. It&#39;s curious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you done the impossible? Solely reliant on reflex alone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but... it&#39;s usually me keeping to the calm head in a sticky situation.  Not so much physical, but, yea... I can talk anyone into something or out of something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do spirals give you a strange feeling?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, no. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do other peoples emotions feel as though they emanate from within you? Have you ever encountered another empath and what was your consensus?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I feel people&#39;s emotions way too much. I know people, even though &quot;I don&#39;t know them&quot;. Certain people gravitate towards me. If you can break through the shell, that is... lol. With this ability, you also have a major bullshit detector, others just do not understand. Which is why many of us Empaths are quiet and keep to ourselves. We test people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone feel as though they experience more instances of Dejavu than the average person? Can you recall when the overlap occurred?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get Deja Vu constantly, always have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do basic shapes have a resonating energy effect on you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really? That said, certain shapes do fascinate me. Hard to explain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do people call you an &quot;old soul&quot;? Have you ever entertained the thought of what that means?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the time. Some people do not know where the fuck I come up with the advice I come up with for them (neither do I - but, I&#39;m shit with with following my own advice). I&#39;m not old, mind you ( I&#39;m mid thirties - soul wise I feel way older). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a ghost once.</p>

<p>Also, I stayed with a Macumbero on his farm in Brazil for 5 days. He told me things about myself he would have no way of knowing, and he had a shed full of writhing snakes and I watched as he talked to them and they formed a perfect path for him as he walked through them, and then when he was in the middle of the shack they formed a perfect circle around him. He explained he was a 200 year old being, explained the concepts behind macumba....he was illiterate, but I noted some of the ideas he was talking about were from Hegel, Steven Hawking, Aristotle/Plato, etc. He also blessed some rose-water and him and his &#39;house&#39; did a little ceremony with it and had me strip naked and poured it on me. I felt like I was on MDMA when I stood up.</p>

<p>To this day, no explanation for what I witnessed (ghost, macumba shit), except that there is some other esoteric side to life that others can tap into that we&#39;re ignorant of. </p>
