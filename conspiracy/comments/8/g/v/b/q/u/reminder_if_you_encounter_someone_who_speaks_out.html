        Correct the Record is the organization that Clinton paid to stop people from exercising freedom of speech online.
       </a>
       CTR, formed by David Brock, taught Cambridge Analytica everything they know about public relations and the manipulation of public opinion. That's why CA sucks at it so badly - they were taught by a complete shitshow of a human being.
       <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2017/01/27/with-allies-comparing-him-to-mugatu-david-brock-compares-his-website-to-breitbart-news/">
        Seriously, check out some comments made about the mental stability of David Brock
       </a>
       .

       Don't forget - David Brock dated the man who founded Comet Ping-Pong, James Alefantis.

       So you have an alleged fucking lunatic paid 7 figures by a presidential candidate to stop us from saying negative things about the candidate and that's hardly mentioned in major media (and never in a negative way), but Cambridge Analytica doing the exact same public opinion manipulation is somehow getting 24/7 media coverage?
      </p>
      <p>
       I call bullshit. Both organizations are wrong, both need to be stopped and both parties are neck-deep in filthy politics. It's time someone establishes some laws regarding full disclosure of political activities online for BOTH PARTIES.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I've been working with an attorney in my home state to bring suit against CTR for violating my states anti-cyberbullying statutes. Many other states have similar laws. I'm not interested in winning, I'm interested in bringing this issue to light. Unfortunately, this takes FOREVER - but in the meantime, remember that both parties can be shit and currently, both are. Don't fall for the partisan divisive distractions.

       One question I have is what is distinctly "Russian shilling propaganda" or talking points? I get something like Skripal defense, but it really seems like a lot of things get labeled "Russian" and I'm not sure what the demarcation is. Could you give me some examples?

       Agreed.

       Some old examples would be when Russia invaded Ukraine, and there was tons of accounts that were coming out and trying to spin it, defend it, or deny it. It was mostly isolated to the worldnews sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the politics sub, it shows up as new accounts that try to act like extremes on both sides, with calling for actions of violence against the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also highly suspicious of people that either constantly praise or defend Putin or Russian interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say though, that I'm all for searching for truth, no matter where it points to. I'm skeptical of the MSM narratives surrounding Syria and I'm skeptical about the MSM narratives surrounding Skripal. Doesn't mean that I trust what Russia is saying either.

       Those are all straightforward examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that the term "Russian" has become a pejorative though? Am I the only person that feels like it's a little odd to single out another country as universally horrible? I grew up in the 80s and I saw the wall come down. Maybe I have a different feeling about the country than many millennials. I think very similar to Iran, and at times the US, the people in charge are making decisions that the populous may not agree with but doesn't have a whole lot of say in the end either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term is also used widely when not discussing issues related to Russia also. Constitutional amendments for hundreds of years are suddenly Russian talking points and I'm trying to understand the nuance of what gets labeled vs. what doesn't and why.

       Sure they do. You're talking to one of many that have been running analytics on this sub and related artifacts for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a number of obvious and persistent entities that keep this sub in their crosshairs. Russians really aren't much of a factor here that I've seen. JDIF, Monsanto, Fukishima topics really do have professionals interacting in the threads (and an honorable mention for the PG apologists), but I just don't believe enough people care about Russian interests in this thread for them to expend too much effort.

       I disagree with you how much of a presence they have. I would think it odd that every major super power would have some type of shill presence, but Russia would not, especially when you have some accounts that spread around a lot of Russian propaganda links and talking points. But, I won't get into specifics of examples of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said before, I'm just skeptical of people who will say that CTR/Shareblue or American propagandists shills exist (I acknowledge they do), but somehow Russia doesn't get involved with online social media propaganda shilling efforts.

       That's not really the reverse though. These are three separate issues. I know that Media Matters and Cambridge Analytica are major players in the social manipulation game, but I'm highly skeptical of the scope and purpose of efforts by Russian groups and the degree of their affiliation with the Russian government. Surely there are Russian groups all over social media, but for me it looked more like gaming the political division to siphon ad revenue with click-bait blogs as much as anything else.

       I'm not saying they didn't, I just don't see the evidence jumping out at me. If they did, they didn't do a very good job. Why bother throwing matches at a raging dumpster fire? I think they watched as Hillary Clinton mentally prepped the nation for open hostility with Russia and decided their efforts were better spent updating their nuclear arsenal to evade our increasingly sophisticated missile defense systems.

       People have been talking about a lot of shit but there's no legitimate connection between CA and the Russian government. Mueller pointed the finger at the Internet Research Agency, which is not affiliated with CA. Shills and blowhards connected the London-based CA to Russia via Russian-national witch-hunting in their corporate structure.

       People link CA to Russia, because people say that CA could have possibly gave their data to Russia, so that they would know who to target with their shilling and propaganda.

       In principal, yes of course, I see the potential for hypocrisy. However, based on a decade of watching political debate on Reddit and the admitted tactics of Media Matters, it's pretty damn obvious what's going on. With the Russia shit, it's not nearly as clear cut. Furthermore, instigating war is one of the main purposes of propaganda.

       And instigating war could be a purpose for propaganda, or it can be used for many other things. Such as causing social division and mistrust among the American people by Russians pretending to be American accounts.

       What I continue to be confused about is how these guys did anything different than David Brock? Do you think there is some good old boy that changed his mind because of something Brock did? Do you think there is a NYC liberal that changed their mind due to something Cambridge Analytica did? No, of course not. This is a game of slim numbers.

       Okay cool. I don't disagree with any of that, as I started, it exists on both sides up and down. From Brock to Cambridge to Scott Foval to whoever it is that does that shit for the RNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm really just trying to understand what non-Russian talking points are continuously labeled Russian and why "Russian" has become a pejorative as I mentioned in my first response.

       I’m curious about this. Why do I keep seeing mention of “all sides do it”? Was there ever some implication that only one side is guilty, or is the implication otherwise that this is a problem limited to one side?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what does any of this have to do with Russia indeed, why bring that up? Unless I’m missing some reference to Russia in the OP, that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sorry if these are stupid questions, but I can’t figure out why I keep seeing these same little lines repeated, almost always in reference to something bad the right did and almost always essentially saying “the left did it too”.

       Read these two articles, the letter in byline and the capabilities of SCL years ago. They will have only gotten better since then.
The combination of decades of British establishment propaganda (world war winning), being on the winning side of every election, using protonmail, having the Facebook data was only a minor detail tbh. They've been doing military psyops for years, MoD, DoD, foreign countries too.
Faking a chemical lab leak was their advertised capability in 2005. 13 years later, what more could they stage?
      </p>
      <p>
       The scariest bit is that this isn't even too controversial. The Russians learned their online side from a UK company! They've infused it with their decades of disinformation and you've got a government paralyzing mixture.
Instead of looking in the mirror after greed from 1974 (when productivity outgrew wages: rise of management and investors always winning), they want to build a boogie man so we don't look up at the crooks sat at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the real secret behind it all, that's why they're clutching at Russian disinformation, they don't want people to wake up to the decades of lies.

       I don't think there's any debate that Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, Google, the DNC and the RNC all are collecting and abusing your data like it's their jobs (because it is).

       Do read those articles in full, but then go read about Russian disinformation too. China, Israel, India, European nations, are all partaking. I think China's approach of spreading cute baby photos is my more favourite technique (idea being deacdes of "yellow peril" can be beaten in a few years of cute kids, they're doing well too), but it's a full spectrum war.
Advertisers are players too, again their only doing it to make money, but they can't be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is definitely Russian disinformation about, it's just that it's also a convenient tool to cover-up awkward truths.
As I've said before, Russia or not, the DNC hack was about the
       <em>
        contents
       </em>
       of the emails (showing the dodgy relationships and collusion against Sanders), the hack was secondary. It would have been a good target, but if Clinton had better principles, she might have won.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a good tool to use against anyone against the neoliberal consensus, see the smears of Jeremy Corybn and Jill Stien, I doubt either are
       <em>
        Russian bots
       </em>
       but don't worry, they'll try either getting that across anyhow.

       If you look at the graph carefully, you will see there was some scattering of the two lines in the late 1970's, but the clear and permanent change in the trajectory of the wage graph versus the productivity graph came in 1982 after the Ronald Reagan tax cuts.

       I think it's more about relevancy. CTR had a budget of $22,000 last year. I wouldn't be suprised most of that is legal fees. Cambridge Analytica was operating until just recently.

       They most definitely could and probably did. The only reason we know about CTR is because they made thier operations public. I wouldn't be suprised if there exist hundreds of operations like them not publicly announced.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the OP specifically compares Cambridge Analytica to CTR. I am simply stating why the focus is on CA more dominantly over CTR, the time of thier activities.

       Well remember that CTR morphed into other entities including ShareBlue which is still active and appears well-funded. CTR was too tarnished in the primaries to continue with that brand, but the people that brought it to us haven't gone anywhere.

       Shareblue had previously been a more legit news site called Blue Nation Review. But Brock's company bought it and transformed it into a propaganda machine after they already had CTR in full swing. I remember because I participated in a lot of Sanders groups at the time - it was a constant topic of conversation.

       Republican partisan think tanks came of age in the 1960's. Democratic counterparts only started arriving in the 80's and 90's. Democratic propaganda is far behind and much smaller than Republican propaganda, and Republicans spend far more than Democrats because
       <em>
        Republicans want to deregulate the money machine and make money=speech

       CTR is defunct.  They shut down their website on 12/31/2016.  It was part of

        David Brock's
       </a>
       media empire and only existed to help push pro Hillary propaganda on the internet.  Hillary lost so CTR shut down.  But Brock has plenty of organizations to take it's place; American Bridge 21st Century, CREW, Shareblue, Priorities USA Action, Media Matters, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sure that there are other organizations doing the same things, and have nothing to do with Brock.  CTR is often just a catch-all term for any left wing astroturfing.

       You're right, but it's well understood that ShareBlue is the spiritual successor of CTR. They are colloquially synonymous.

       Well remember that CTR morphed into other entities including ShareBlue which is still active and appears well-funded. CTR was too tarnished in the primaries to continue with that brand, but the people that brought it to us haven't gone anywhere.

       And I'll say that if you can quantify it than I would like to discuss ML models with you. But you won't articulate an answer to my question I've rephrased several times now; what topics other than those related to Russia are labeled as "Russian talking points" and how do you identify them?

       Shareblue had previously been a more legit news site called Blue Nation Review. But Brock's company bought it and transformed it into a propaganda machine after they already had CTR in full swing. I remember because I participated in a lot of Sanders groups at the time - it was a constant topic of conversation.

       Republican partisan think tanks came of age in the 1960's. Democratic counterparts only started arriving in the 80's and 90's. Democratic propaganda is far behind and much smaller than Republican propaganda, and Republicans spend far more than Democrats because
       <em>
        Republicans want to deregulate the money machine and make money=speech
       </em>
       . They are not doing this for some ideological or altruistic reason. They are doing this because in the long run, they have more money and want to take advantage.

       CTR is defunct.  They shut down their website on 12/31/2016.  It was part of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brock">
        David Brock's
       </a>
       media empire and only existed to help push pro Hillary propaganda on the internet.  Hillary lost so CTR shut down.  But Brock has plenty of organizations to take it's place; American Bridge 21st Century, CREW, Shareblue, Priorities USA Action, Media Matters, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sure that there are other organizations doing the same things, and have nothing to do with Brock.  CTR is often just a catch-all term for any left wing astroturfing.

       This is HIGHLY misleading. Media Matters shifted their efforts from CTR to ShareBlue, which now has an even larger budget than CTR did during the election.
