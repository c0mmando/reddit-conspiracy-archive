    <div class="md"><p>It;s also wise to examine your own beliefs and how you acquired them. Many are simply ones we were fed as children, like trusting any recognised authority, teachers, police, political leaders, etc. etc. since we were young and naïve and unable to defend ourselves. Beliefs that we never &quot;unlearned&quot; and changed when we became adults ourselves even though we became aware of our own shortcomings and idiosyncrasies and those of other people around us.</p>

<p>Bottom line, remain skeptical and believe no more than you absolutely have to and keep that as much as possible to what you have learned or can confirm from your own most direct experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to read up on what Marshall McLuhan had to say about &quot;the medium&quot; being &quot;the message&quot; and the different effects any message has depending on what medium it&#39;s communicated through. </p>

<p>He considered television to  be a cold, passive medium that induces detachment and a passive state in viewers. Radio, on the other hand, was a &quot;hot one&quot; and very capable of agitating and firing-up the listeners to act or deliberately restrain them by the manner of the delivery and its verbal cues and nuances.</p>

<p>If you watch TV and don&#39;t want to fall under it&#39;s spell you don&#39;t simply pay attention but actively and verbally talk back to it and remain critical of whatever you&#39;re being and look for all the &quot;what-a-bouts&quot; they aren&#39;t telling you and voice them aloud. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s radio you do the opposite, you stay calm and detached and pay strict attention to the nuances and ways they try to lead you on and in both cases remember that the information is always secondary to the effect that they want it have on you.</p>

<p>Another good source are the works of Vance Packard, author of the &quot; The Hidden Persuaders&quot; and other critiques of subliminal conditioning.</p>

<p>Those works were among the first salvos fired against the growing number of ways the MSM at the time was controlling the narrative for other and different reasons than simply informing the public. Methods that they spent vast sums on consulting experts in human psychology and perfecting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its all connected. Hollywood was aware someone would eventually figure out that they were being brainwashed, so they included an extra level of manipulation, making you believe you are actually aware of being tricked, and the means by which it happens. You think you&#39;re being manipulated, this makes you think you can resist them and keep watching, instead of simply turning of the TV.
This is how they keep everyone watching even those who detect their secret. You might not be affected but you&#39;re still watching, which is all that counts. They already won</p>

<p>I will offer my best.... even being consciously aware, I do not believe is enough..... we have been dumbed down from the minute we are born..... our air is poisoned, our food and water is poisoned, soaps, toothpaste..... pretty much anything we put on or in our body is poison.... and if you were breastfed, your mother had been induced longe before you and is physically passing it down...... That makes the media propoganda easier to infiltrate into our brains.... You can stop watchin TV, reading magazines, listening to radio....etc but there are still symbols and other pieces of propoganda all around you being absorbed by your unconscious mind... which is defining your filter. You truly have to leave everything.... go far away from 1st world society as you can, build a cabin in the damn woods...... cold turkey is the only way..... makes me feel bad I did not continue down that path, pulled back in honoring obligations.... power to the people</p>
