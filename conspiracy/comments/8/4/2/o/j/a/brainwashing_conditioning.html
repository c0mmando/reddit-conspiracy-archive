       I think there maybe a conspiracy involving  media propaganda to invade the mind. Public education , Hollywood , tv , billboards , logos , ads on basically every social media platform . My question is do you think you make yourself less susceptible to the programming if one is aware the program exist ?

       SS : I’m thinking on like a subliminal level or esoteric level ; like for the last hundred years they really started studying the mind and our psyche ( yay science ) so I’m thinking that they figured out a way to keep us all in line through our minds via everything mentioned in OP

       It's a well documented fact, not a "maybe."
      </p>
      <p>
       And just tune down the noise, turn off the TV, log off facebook.. Don't engage in their programs and stand fast, be vigilant to your beliefs..
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, don't forget to educate others around you about the propaganda.

       It;s also wise to examine your own beliefs and how you acquired them. Many are simply ones we were fed as children, like trusting any recognised authority, teachers, police, political leaders, etc. etc. since we were young and naïve and unable to defend ourselves. Beliefs that we never "unlearned" and changed when we became adults ourselves even though we became aware of our own shortcomings and idiosyncrasies and those of other people around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line, remain skeptical and believe no more than you absolutely have to and keep that as much as possible to what you have learned or can confirm from your own most direct experience.

       They want you to watch brain dead entertainment so you never have the chance to cause social change. It’s paternalism. They want to put you to sleep, cuz they know what’s best for society.

       Knowledge is power. When you understand what they're putting out into the world, they no longer hold power over you.

       Also, mute adverts wherever you can. Be it on TV, online or radio.

       Well the trick is that you can't be
       <em>
        made
       </em>
       to believe certain things or have certain viewpoints. That's why some think the brainwashing is necessary; to "educate" people about the truth, using whatever means necessary. It's not a criminal conspiracy but it is unethical and common.

       You might want to read up on what Marshall McLuhan had to say about "the medium" being "the message" and the different effects any message has depending on what medium it's communicated through.
      </p>
      <p>
       He considered television to  be a cold, passive medium that induces detachment and a passive state in viewers. Radio, on the other hand, was a "hot one" and very capable of agitating and firing-up the listeners to act or deliberately restrain them by the manner of the delivery and its verbal cues and nuances.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watch TV and don't want to fall under it's spell you don't simply pay attention but actively and verbally talk back to it and remain critical of whatever you're being and look for all the "what-a-bouts" they aren't telling you and voice them aloud.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's radio you do the opposite, you stay calm and detached and pay strict attention to the nuances and ways they try to lead you on and in both cases remember that the information is always secondary to the effect that they want it have on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another good source are the works of Vance Packard, author of the " The Hidden Persuaders" and other critiques of subliminal conditioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those works were among the first salvos fired against the growing number of ways the MSM at the time was controlling the narrative for other and different reasons than simply informing the public. Methods that they spent vast sums on consulting experts in human psychology and perfecting.

       I used to have a good number of 'woke' friends.  Unfortunately, they all continued to watch TV, thinking they could pick out the propaganda and it wouldn't affect them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they are all pro-CIA and raging about the racist neonazis running the country.  Back to sleep little children.

       Knowing that there is an attempt to brainwash you, or to just trick you, immediately raises the guard. It absolutely makes you less susceptible.

       But not always.

       Sometimes, thinking youre smart enough to recognize and avoid its effects results in you putting your defenses down.

       For me, when I see 'the news' or any MSM it's extremely obvious what they are trying to push. The pictures they choose to use - an angry frowning face for 'the bad guy' that is slightly grey is a really common and obvious one, for example.

       Its all connected. Hollywood was aware someone would eventually figure out that they were being brainwashed, so they included an extra level of manipulation, making you believe you are actually aware of being tricked, and the means by which it happens. You think you're being manipulated, this makes you think you can resist them and keep watching, instead of simply turning of the TV.
This is how they keep everyone watching even those who detect their secret. You might not be affected but you're still watching, which is all that counts. They already won

       I don't know if anyone truly knows the answer to this my friend.... so tread carefully through the opinions and theories.....
      </p>
      <p>
       I will offer my best.... even being consciously aware, I do not believe is enough..... we have been dumbed down from the minute we are born..... our air is poisoned, our food and water is poisoned, soaps, toothpaste..... pretty much anything we put on or in our body is poison.... and if you were breastfed, your mother had been induced longe before you and is physically passing it down...... That makes the media propoganda easier to infiltrate into our brains.... You can stop watchin TV, reading magazines, listening to radio....etc but there are still symbols and other pieces of propoganda all around you being absorbed by your unconscious mind... which is defining your filter. You truly have to leave everything.... go far away from 1st world society as you can, build a cabin in the damn woods...... cold turkey is the only way..... makes me feel bad I did not continue down that path, pulled back in honoring obligations.... power to the people

       The most famous "priming" experiment I know of is the one where subjects were given a list of words and the group exposed to the "old people" words tended to subconsciously walk and behave more slowly.  Now, According to this Discovery magazine article from2012,  the factor that mattered most wasn't "knowing if the program existed on the part of the subject" but "knowing the program existed ON THE PART OF THE ADMINS"...

       ...
This is a very interesting wrinkle to the classic example because it puts intent and also empathy-with-other's-intent as significant factors.
