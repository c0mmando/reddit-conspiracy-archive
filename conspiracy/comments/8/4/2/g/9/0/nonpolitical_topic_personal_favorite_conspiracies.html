       Do you guys have any conspiracies that you hear get passed around, but just can't seem to get with or that you would find incredibly mind-boggling IF it could somehow resonate with you? With everyone's different POV, it would be interesting to see why others do or do not believe in the things you do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether for a lack of evidence or a lack of connection, what are the conspiracies that you love but don't believe?

       Flat Earth and the Moon Landing
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth bc although I try not to judge what people want to put effort into believing, Flat Earth has so many holes in it like the fact they believe other planets to still be spheres or how everything showing a curved horizon is CGI. IMO it honestly seems like a mass disinformation campaign to subconsciously correlate the idea of a conspiracy theorist to an idiot, hence the fact that many C-List celebrities are randomly getting behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the moon landing, idk. Like I know for a fact there’s definitely some obvious fakery in press pictures and stuff, but I guess the little kid inside me amazed when finding out we went to the moon is fighting back, and wants to believe we really did, we just had to fake some of the pics because the real ones couldn’t survive in space and we needed some proof our team of “American” ex-Nazi rocket scientists was better than Russia’s space program. I’m probably wrong though :/

       Chemtrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is just ludicrous. Just the fact that there wouldn't even be room in the planes for 1000s of liters of 'chemicals'. Also it seems like every single contrail is supposedly a 'chemtrail'... really? 1000s and more 1000s of planes worldwide, ALL pumping out chemicals? where is all this infrastructure that would be needed to manufacture and distribute all these chemicals?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of course there is some impact of actual
       <em>
        contrails
       </em>
       , which do sometimes fan out and provide a thin layer of cloud that can cover large areas. These thin clouds do have some environmental impact because they reflect the sunlight. But that's it, they're not 'chemical'.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Yes I know it is possible to seed clouds with particles, that doesn't mean all the worlds airliners are doing it).

       A pressurized aerosol is a liquid. What's your point? It still takes up a lot of space. Or do you think since it's an aerosol it is lighter than air or something? lol.

       Lol it's a gas that is pressurized into a liquid. Not sure what your point  is. It's entirely possible to carry significant amounts of aerosols in an airplane. You are totally speculating on this one.

       Aerosol/liquid it doesn't matter, it takes up space ok? Where in the plane exactly? In the wings are all the fuel, in the hold are suitcases and workers are there so they would spill the beans if they saw any large tanks there. Elsewhere is seats and people. What about the trucks coming to reload the plane with these aerosols/liquids? have you ever seen any? all I have ever seen are fuel trucks. But regardless, who produces the aerosols and distributes it all around the world to airports all over. Have you any idea how many flights take place all the time? it's 1000s, have you done the numbers on the liquids?

       Also, that climate change is a hoax. Climate change seems to go against corporate interests and the oil industry so who would be pushing that hoax and why?

       You clearly don’t know anything about me, or you wouldn’t make such a provably false bullshit statement like that. That’s the biggest problem with the left right now; anyone who disagrees with me is clearly all contained nicely in this one singular group we can demonize. How convenient!

       The Bush family drug dealing conspiracy. I don't think they're smart enough to have pulled all that off. Not that there wasn't CIA drug smuggling under Bush Sr., but I don't believe the sons were "made" governors of the two biggest smuggling states and so forth.

       Holographic moon and the existence of devils/evil spirits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the moon one for how completely out there it is and how grossly unwieldy the sheer extent of the conspiracy would have to be. It's not only a daily conspiracy necessitating controlling/deluding absolutely every single organization capable of properly studying the moon, it requires a complete revision of our history and scientific body for to be either no space at all, no moon at all, or a moon that's been replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think demonology is a interesting subject and living in a more "magic" cosmos, even a horrific one populated by evil entities, is a fascinating thought. Still, we've got a majority religious planet with innumerable organizations and individuals with vested interests in getting the truth out there, yet there's not a shred of actual material out there that can't be revealed to be either lies, mental disease, or a gross case of wishful thinking/ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a clip out there somewhere of a supposed "saved satanist" who wanders about talking about how he used to be this serial-killing slave to demons, but was eventually saved by the glory of God. At some point he's in some local store, pointing at various icons and statuettes (a black/african mother mary, I think), saying how this and that is demon worship - that
       <strong>
        the entire store
       </strong>
       is a demonic front - and how he as a saved believer could bring down the whole place (physically) by invoking the name of God:
       <strong>
        AND THEN HE JUST FUCKING DOESN'T
       </strong>
       .  The meandering-ass clip just trundles on down elsewhere, glossing over that shit like it'd not be a profound and well-warranted display for the entire planet.
