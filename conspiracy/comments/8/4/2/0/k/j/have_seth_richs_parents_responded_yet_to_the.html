    <div class="md"><p>Bro, this article is about the Podesta email, not the DNC hack.</p>

<p>From what I have seen, DNC hack was much larger in scope and the download speeds suggest an internal download onto a flash disk,  too fast for a remote hack and not simply an email grab.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah that story. It conflates several different happenings. It&#39;s widely believed - based on information from the DNC itself - that their email systems were directly accessed and files copied, either by ridiculously fast Internet or local network. This is separate from phishing schemes which caught Podesta and others, and don&#39;t really amount to hacking so much as as scamming. AP would like to bundle it all together in a neat little Scooby Doo mystery, but such is not life. </p>

<p>The primary DNC leaks are likely not the result of phishing and could be from Seth Rich (as Assange has intimated) or from others. Craig Murray - who reportedly handed the docs to WL has also said definitively that the source was a disgruntled DNC employee. So the two witnesses closest to the case contend it was a person with direct access to DNC servers. DNC and Crowdstrike have said that it was a person with direct access to the servers - whether remote or local. So it stands to reason phishing is not the source.</p>

<p>Of course the DNC could help solve this mystery if they&#39;d allow the FBI to actually investigate the machine that was said to be the source of the hack. It&#39;s telling that they won&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;speeds were too fast&quot; has been debunked. 22 megabytes might be too fast for a household, not nearly too fast at all for a big company or a government operation. </p>

<p>The FBI didn&#39;t need to physically look at the server. They didn&#39;t need to dust it off for dinger prints. All they needed was the forensics. I don&#39;t understand this obsession with the idea that they physically needed to hold the stuff in their hands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hardly been debunked. I said it was possible to be either remote or local. Local hasn&#39;t been ruled out by any means, and the main point is that you don&#39;t get access to a remote or local systems via SSH by phishing for email credentials.</p>

<p>Where I stand on this is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. It&#39;s irresponsible for our media and intelligence to be alleging proof of Russian guilt when all they&#39;ve done is string together a bunch of loosely related circumstances. There are Russian phishing campaigns happening all the time to all kinds of organizations. There are Siberians doing this, Chinese, Turkish, on and on. I see it constantly in my day job. The US also does this - both neckbeard wannabe hackers in basements and gov&#39;t sponsored operations. It&#39;s too easy to fake this stuff or setup others to take the fall, which is the position Russia could be in. Consider that we have a group of hackers (that we know of) employed by the US, operating secretly from Mexico.</p>

<p>I remain skeptical, and not because I&#39;m a fan of Trump (I&#39;m most certainly not) but because I&#39;m wary of our imperial government&#39;s aspirations. The MIC and intel groups have the most to gain from all of this, and are the most able to orchestrate it.</p>

<p>In response the Forensicators claims abo it the speed being impossibly fast -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That reads like a semi-cogent paragraph, but it&#39;s largely nonsense. 22.7 megabytes per second (MB/s) sounds impossibly fast if you don&#39;t know any better. But if you do the simple conversion from megabytes per second to megabits per second necessary to determine the actual speed of the connection used, you get a fairly reasonable 180 megabits per second (Mbps). While the report proclaims that &quot;no internet service provider&quot; can provide such speeds, ISPs around the world routinely offer speeds far, far faster -- from 500 Mbps to even 1 Gbps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal, the CIA and the FBI aren&#39;t going to tell you or me or anyone exactly how they figured out the Russians did this. Because if they did, the Russians would find out how they got caught. And they would do things differently in the future. So you can assume that literally anybody except for Russia did this if you want. But the only thing you&#39;re basing it off is &quot;well I don&#39;t believe those guys.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that proves nothing except that it was possible for it to be done either remotely (via Internet connection) or locally via LAN. Either is possible. There are witnesses alleging it was the latter - at most we say we can&#39;t know the truth UNLESS machine and network logs are carefully analyzed, if they even exist.</p>

<p>You seem like a logical person, and I&#39;d hazard to guess we agree on a majority of political/social issues. But I have a problem with statements like this: </p>

<p>I watched Gulf War I happen in the 90s because of bullshit from intelligence and gov&#39;t operatives that we know about now. I was gung fucking ho on that war because I was an idiot kid who was a military brat. I watch a number of actions then occur under a Dem president Clinton who I actually voted for. Fast forward to Gulf War 2, Libya, Syria, Yemen, RUSSIA. The runup to these confrontations - in my now 45 years of experience - have always been bullshit. Why would it be any different now?</p>

<p>I&#39;m supposed to believe that our intelligence agencies and our cynical mono-party system care about &quot;the vote?&quot; No - they don&#39;t care. If they cared, we&#39;d have dug deep in the Florida Bush v. Gore vote. If they cared, we&#39;d have looked at the Dem primaries in 2016. They don&#39;t care. So I&#39;m left to deduce - based on my experience and the inconclusive nature of the evidence we&#39;re being shown, that this is one more dog and pony show to funnel money and our civil rights into a toilet.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents - but I appreciate the civil back and forth with you. Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire point of that Forensicator report was to try and prove that the download speeds were too fast to be done remotely. Since that&#39;s not true, that report falls apart. I understand scepticism of the intelligence community. But I don&#39;t understand why people assume just because they say something, the opposite must be true. The argument I see constantly is we don&#39;t know who hacked the DNC, but we know Russia didn&#39;t do it because the intelligence community says they did. That doesn&#39;t seem like a strong argument to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying the Forensicator report is valid - I&#39;m not arguing in favor of that at all. I agree that conclusive evidence of a local download doesn&#39;t exist. I&#39;m saying that the fact that it <em>could</em> have been downloaded remotely doesn&#39;t preclude the possibility that it could have been download locally. Either option is possible in the absence of evidence. Assange and a close ally associated with the data handover both indicate it was a DNC employee. So I&#39;m inclined to believe that it was a disgruntled employee - maybe Seth Rich. I&#39;m willing to have my mind changed.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t claim to <em>know</em> that Russia didn&#39;t hack the election - but I&#39;m very reluctant to accept evidence from groups that have burned us over and over and over. These people start wars like that.</p>

<p>Fool me once shame on you - fool me twice - well the point is - can&#39;t get fooled again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solid Bush moment. I just don&#39;t see any evidence at all that the DNC hack was actually a leak. Assange never reveals his sources. So there are two options here. Either he doesn&#39;t actually care about that rule, or he&#39;s pointing a finger at Seth to throw people off the actual source. We know he was in touch with Trumps campaign. We know he wanted Trump to win. We also know it wouldn&#39;t look good for Trump if Wikileaks source was Russia. </p>

<p>So it would make perfect sense for him to blame it on Seth Rich. On top of that, there is absolutely nothing about Seth that sets off alarms other than the fact that he merely worked at the DNC. If Assange is going to out his source, he might as well show us the proof that it was indeed Seth. He already suggested someone who was murdered was his source. So he clearly doesn&#39;t care about dissuading future whistleblowers. Because he just told everyone his maybe source, wink, wink, was killed for giving him the info. </p>

<p>I think it adds more credibility to Russia being behind it because the guys that Trump picked himself are saying it. You&#39;d think his own guys would have his back on this but they don&#39;t. So this would mean that basically everyone in the world is lying except for Putin, Assange, and Trump. And I don&#39;t trust those guys at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They made it clear that efforts independent of the police department were not welcome or helpful. “Our request is that anyone with information about Seth’s murder share such information with the MPD, which is the law enforcement agency authorized by law to perform this investigation,” the statement continued. “<strong>And while we recognize the futility of this request, we make it anyway: please cease using Seth as a political football in predetermined partisan narratives</strong>.”</p>
