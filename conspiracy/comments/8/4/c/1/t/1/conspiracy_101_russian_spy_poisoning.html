<p>Deliberately using a known Russian chemical weapon for the attack, helping the UK identify said chemical weapon and encouraging the need for actions against Russia.</p>

<p>Russia threatens the UK with their nuclear power and state that any actions will be met with an equal response.  </p>

<p>America steps in to &#39;protect&#39; the UK. Trump nukes Russia. </p>

<p>There is no motive for Russia. He was exchanged by Russia, and if he still had any intelligence value to Britain he would not have been given up. They had him in jail, why not kill him then and be done with it. </p>

<p>The only countries the benefit from this are the UK, US and their allies who can point the finger at Russia before their election/World Cup. </p>

<p>And with the advanced nuclear weapons Russia revealed last week, and their advanced air defence systems, they would not come off worse than the US in the event of a nuclear exchange. </p>

Georgia Guide Stones could be relevant too.</p>

<p>Now all this means nothing to most, but old r/conspiracy would understand that DIA murals depict war (nuclear/chemical), and with the belief that there really does indeed exist an occult-belief based PTB, WW3 with WMDs is not impossible but inevitable for whatever reasons.

    <div class="md"><p>There are other reasons for the US or UK to do this, just like there are reasons for Putin not to have done it.</p>

<p>Force Trump into taking a stand against Putin thereby causing a rift between Trump and Putin which many have wanted since his election.  In fact, Trump is in a no-win situation.  If he asked for the evidence (a reasonable request) he would then be pilloried by the press for being Putin&#39;s Poodle.</p>

<p>Corbyn has already fell into the trap of asking for evidence, which  whoever did it knew he&#39;d ask for, which has already put him against many in his party, and also given the tabloids new ammunition for tomorrows headlines.  Great for the tories especially when you take into account Labour had a several point lead in the polls.</p>

<p>Add to the above it has raised anti-Russian feeling astronomically.</p>

<p>Now, why would Putin do something that would create worldwide revulsion, risk harming members of the public, police and emergency services.  Use something that is easily traced back to Russia.  When they could have did the bullet in the back of the head, or even a gentle push down some stairs.  Both of which would have caused anyone worried about being assassinated even more concern.</p>

<p>In fact, the only reason to use something so dangeorus, so publicly is to achieve what has been listed above.</p>
