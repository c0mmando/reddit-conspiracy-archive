       ... are they ALL crisis actors? Every single one going on strike / making speeches promoting gun control? That was the line around here a month ago. But now there is more than just a handful of students involved.
       <br/>
       Is it possible that there genuinely is a groundswell of youthful activism going on in USA schools against the insanity that is the USA's obsession with gun fetishism? Does this suggest that the Parkland students were, and are, genuine victims who spoke out against the (actual) Powers That Be, and were shamefully denounced as "crisis actors" by stupid, right-wing keyboard warriors?
       <br/>
       Or are they ALL crisis actors in the pocket of the Democrats, or whatever the fuck?

       No one is claiming the kids out today are crisis actors...if anything they're just useful idiots...that is assuming, of course, that they aren't using this simply as an excuse to skip class, or aren't just regurgitating their own parents beliefs.

       I'm someone on the Left and I believe in gun rights and feel it is necessary that a citizenry be armed...otherwise how else are we supposed to guarantee our government does what
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       want? How can I entrust them with National Healthcare or College/Trade education if I don't have the force of arms, along with millions of others, to ensure they do this?

       How exactly do you consider it a realistic option for you - to "rise up" with your guns against the military police that run your country? Do you seriously think you are anything other than piteously outgunned? Has that escaped your notice, somehow?
       <br/>
       The answer, obviously, is that you live in a democracy. You make changes by voting, not shooting.

       It is about the theoretical power- where does it lie? Does it lie with an armed citizenry, from whose sovereignty the country is drawn? Or does it lie only with an ephemeral Federal Power? An armed citizenry possesses the final check and balance of a Free Society.

       We live in a Representative Republic, dictated by Parties that represent class interests...and not the class interests of the common citizen. While the vote still does have power, it is essential that the ultimate power of violence rests with the People and the People alone. As I said- without arms, how else can I assure that my government actually distributes the Healthcare benefits and the Education? Force guarantees that We The People remain the source from which the Power of our government derives itself.

       Are you comparing the American Military Police State with the ruined, decrepit remains of what was once the Iraqi police force? I don't think they compare, and so I reiterate: the idea that the guns of your citizen could possibly have any impact on your police is, frankly, absurd.
       <br/>
       It's a fantasy. And the phrase "theoretical power" is an oxymoron.

       No...I'm highlighting the reality that the strongest army the world has ever seen
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       hasn't beaten an insurgency we've fought for 15 goddamn years...just like we never beat the Vietcong...despite the fact that both are/were armed, predominantly, with small arms...

       No, it's not. Where the power rests, even in theory, is essential. An armed citizenry means there is always the potential for revolt and opposition...it is absolutely integral to a True and Free Republic. Small arms ensure that a resistance movement can always be waged...as I have said, militarist movements throughout history prove this...

       Yup, I do vote, but we don't live in a Democracy, we live in a Representative Republic...which means we elect Representatives of our interests. I believe that the Citizenry must absolutely maintain small arms Rights so as to ensure that this "representative" government never takes absolute power. The ultimate Power rests with the citizenry...and this means we must, absolutely, be
       <em>
        armed

       I grow more and more skeptical everyday about the concept of a "Republic"...I find myself increasingly drawn towards Anarchism and its Leftist strains like Anarcho-Syndicalism or Libertarian Socialism...we need Radical Democracy at the local scale with power trickling
       <em>
        up
       </em>
       not down, and I think gun ownership is an important part of that...but I also believe that a citizen driven takeover of the current Parties is essential to foster this new Reality.

       I believe that there are certain sacrifices made with free access to weaponry that are necessary for a Free and Open society...I also am skeptical about the Reality of many of these initial "attacks".

       That's a really funny statement lol...how do I lack critical thinking just because I am able to critically analyze a YouTube video based on its merit and not on the credibility of who produced it (an average citizen)?

       I'm not going to link you anything because you will never believe it, and that's ok. We've had a good convo and there's really no point in derailing it. GLHF out there friend.

       well, I do appreciate your cool head and reasoned responses. I haven't shown you the same respect, for which I apologise. It is an emotive issue.
       <br/>
       The written word is the most concise way of articulating a point. Video essays are emotive and compromised by their nature, and also prohibitively time consuming. Just a flat out waste of time.

       Fighting rebels in foreign, war-torn territory is not the same thing as quelling local resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, power derives from legitimacy in the eyes of a (implicitly) consenting population. Invading forces tend to create just as many adversaries as they kill. Their actions are never seen as justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       The domestic "armed citizenry" in conflict at home is either one side of a "legitimate" claimant to the state (thus, in the case of the US - it will be well-armed and organized such as during the Civil War) or a small, fringe group with no significant support from the general populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghanistan et al. are bad comparisons due to power vacuums of failed states and the resulting ethnic/tribal basis of legitimacy.

       Look at the trouble our military, which is more free to act aggressively and less tied down by due process, has had with terror groups that seem to often start with rag tag groups using outdated, fucked up soviet beater guns and improvised devices.  I'm not saying where there might be a line that equates to it being time to rebel, but a scrappy insurgency does have a chance at being a thorn in the side of cops and or soldiers, where I think they'd be fucked is fighting the American propaganda machine, any militia you've seen get mainstream media attention has had its members smeared as radical, mentally unstable and racist.

       I wonder where this anti-gun brainwashing is occurring, exactly? Maybe it's a side effect of growing up in fear of death from their peers. Maybe it's less a case of brainwashing, and more of a clear, sensible reaction to the ridiculous state your country is in?

       It's been all over the news. I'm not going to link to all the celebrities that have tweeted anti-gun sentiments. There's too many to list. Get on Twitter for 2 seconds if you don't believe me. If you don't think teenagers are impressionable, you're kidding yourself. I respect your opinion and your right to share it with others, but encouraging kids to do the bidding of anti-gun lobbyists is just wrong.

       I honestly don't know. I've never seen any advertising for the NRA. I never hear of any so-called A-list celebrities; celebrities that appeal to teenagers, making pro 2A statements. Of course, they have every right to speak their minds, I just think it should be targeted at adults, not children. George Clooney and Jim Carrey have both encouraged these kids to walk-out. I'm going to respond to your other post, as well. I can understand why you might come to this sub, I've often thought about reaching out to people with different world views. I'm afraid it will just turn into un-read-able crap.

       The kids are emotional and idealistic kids, with ideas they think could help but generally don't have life experiences that promote gun ownership and probably have little understanding of gun functionality and gun law.  That makes them an easily used mouthpiece for gun control, but it doesn't make them actors.  I think they need to do research so they are talking from a position of knowledge and not JUST emotion, but since its important to them, they shouldn't be told to shut up (just be taken with a grain of salt)

       I think they've got a lot of life experiences of gun functionality and gun law - they see their peers dying, because America is arming itself to death. You couldn't possibly ask for a better "research" environment than a contemporary American school. To tar them for daring to get "emotional" about the potential for death by eduction is disengenuous - is there any political issue that is not tempered by emotions? Are they actually concentrating on emotional messages (like the NRA does) or are they in fact clearly articulating a political stance, in the midst of aggressive, emotionally laden criticism from the right wing gun stroking psychotics that maintain power?

       You're clearly planning on dismissing statements anywhere to the right of the kids calling for more controls, maybe we need some, but the timing of the calls is intentionally exploitative and in the case of Parkland missing the context of the incident, I wrote a little rant about other places we could be spending our energy,

       These kids are being used for political reasons and it's disgusting. These movements are not organic. My son's school tried to have one today. All but 17 kids chose not to participate.

       I've seen a little anti-Semitism on this sub, and I don't like it. Check my comments, I don't go for stuff like that. I'm on this sub almost every day and it is absolutely not "dedicated" to it. If you came here looking for a fight, you're not getting one from me. If you don't like this sub, why do you come here? I'm not trying to get you to leave, I'm just curious.

       I'm not sure why I come here. Originally it was because I find conspiracies very interesting generally. But this sub is not about conspiracies. I despise this sub, to be honest. It disgusts me consistently - the anti-Semitism, the idiotic Amercian right-wing patriotism, the virulent hatred of the left, to the point where shitting on victim children is a given... I guess I come here to poke the bear every once in a while, in the probably misguided hope that I might one day be able to get my point across. But I never do.

       Ignore OP, he isn't here to have discussion about conspiracies, he probably has no interest in conspiracy at all. He came here with the purpose of getting people all riled up and starting a couple of fights. He wanted to bait the few anti-Semitic people on this sub so he could screen cap it and run back to where ever he came from and say "Look how racist this sub is, it's TD 2.0, etc etc". He's only here to waste time and try to discredit actual users.

       Fair - except that I won't be making any screenshots or running to some other sub... I'm just trying to talk to the other side, as it were. I fully admit to being aggressively confrontational. I think this issue merits it.

       Let me explain something to you. Crazy conspiracy theorists who yell at people, call them names like sheep, etc will convince no one. It's the same as those overly religious people who scream at people that they will go to hell for being gay or sinning, people just look at them like they are crazy, because they are. The old saying "you'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar" is certainly still true today. I fully support your right to post about whatever conspiracy you'd like here, but you aren't going to win many people over being overly aggressive.

       Dude, it is beyond obvious why you are in this sub. You aren't here for sensible discussion. You're here to start a fight, and to impose the idea that this sub is filled with anti-Semitic nazi's. The person in this comment thread never mentioned or even remotely hinted at them pointing their finger at Jews, but here you are bringing it up.

       yeah, that's fair. But maybe in having a heated online fight, I can encourage someone from the opposite stance of politics to consider another perspective, so there could be some positivity in my presence here.
       <br/>
       The comments get reduced to anti-Semitism every time I come here. It always ends with it. My apologies for jumping the gun. But holy fuck this place is riddled with it. And it is truly vile.

       I'm here quite frequently and I've only seen it a handful of times. What I more commonly see is anti Zionism, which is a completely different thing that often gets labeled as anti-Semitic.

       Who cares if they are "actors", they're still programmed zombies, what's the dif?  And  protesting school shootings?  WHY?  WTF?  Why aren't they out protesting the 150+ KIDS that die from Opiod overdose EVERY SINGLE DAY?  You're telling me 17 deaths at a school brought this on, yet 150+deaths per day and not a peep?  Who's acting?  They're all brain dead zombies  being led by the ring on their noses.

       These kids are being manipulated. They're not getting the whole story. As I commented earlier, my Son's school tried to do a walk-out today, only 17 kids chose  to participate.

       Another thing, has any video evidence of Nikolas Cruz actually firing a shot been released yet? I'm not saying that he didn't do it, because I don't know, but there were a lot of cameras in that building, why the lack of video evidence? Is it a legal thing?
