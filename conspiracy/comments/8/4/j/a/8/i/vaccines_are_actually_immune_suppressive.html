       When I was pro-vax I used to hear anti-vaxxer parents say things like "my second kid is unvaccinated and never ever gets sick!" And I'd roll my eyes and be like "what does that have to do with anything? Getting a cold or flu has nothing to do with whether or not you got your polio shot." WRONG.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines take down the body's defenses while attempting to create antibodies for what was just injected.  This leaves you vulnerable to everything else around you. Ever notice how fully vaccinated kids are always getting bronchitis, ear infections, stuff like that, while these tree hugger hippy nonvaxxer kids are always healthy?
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't think this is a government conspiracy to kill everyone. I really just think the medical community is so entrenched in its
       <em>
        vaccines are safe and effective
       </em>
       mantra, that they can't ever go back. No amount of evidence showing their immunosuppressive effects and no amount of vaccine injury government payouts can make them turn back at this point.

       This is disturbing.  Thought there were supposedly no studies on multiple vaccines at once.  Apparently there is, and the test subjects had some serious issues.  They've known all along that vaccines can cause autoimmune disorders:

       Obviously anecdotal, but about 3 months after getting a tetanus shot following stepping on a rusty nail, I started getting bald spots in my beard. The cause: Alopecia areata - an autoimmune disorder. Never had it before....

       Let me guess, the doctor said no way possible it could have been the vaccine?
      </p>
      <p>
       No possible way that the cells in the shot (particularly the human ones they use to grow the pertussis portion of your TDaP shot) could have mimicked your own cells... And no possible way that the aluminum adjuvant, put there in order to force an immune response, could have caused your body to react to those cells. Nope. Vaccines are amazing. Nothing to see here!

What would be the alternative? Just not getting vaccinated, roll the dice and hope you don’t die from a disease that could have been prevented with vaccination?

       This is a fair thing to consider, but if that is a possible side-effect, we should be informed of it. I think the biggest issue with medicine is that we know that they are driven by profit and the regulatory agencies meant to protect us have been captured by the very industries that are meant to be regulated. It's difficult to trust that drugs are safe just because the government and massive corporations say so when the system has been so corrupted.

       There are literally thousands of diseases you could die of, and for which there are no “vaccines”. You could also get hit by a bus. You are “rolling the dice” everytime you choose to get up in the morning.

       If you reason in terms of individual probability, it is better to apply the
       <em>
        principle of precaution
       </em>
       and not to inject heavy metals in your circulatory system. It is also prudent not to trust government and multinational corporations, which you’d have to be particularly naive to think they have your best interest at heart.

       Yes, but for those diseases we can vaccinate against, I think we should do it. I think nobody needs another measles outbreak or something like that when we could prevent it.

       Why do you think measles is so dangerous? In first world countries where kids are well fed and not working in coal mines, it's really more of an inconvenience. Much like chickenpox was for my generation.

       Tetanus can only get into your body through a relatively deep cut or puncture wound caused by some sharp and dirty edged object, generally out of doors. The disease, (also known as Lock-jaw which is one it's more serious symptoms), takes a full three days to incubate so you have at least up to 48 hrs. to go and get a tetanus shot and no need to have one before you actually need it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you've have had one in the past few years the doctors will generally recommend another one anyway just to be on the safe side so you're really no farther ahead with whatever you do in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only exception I'd make to  that is for anyone living and working on a farm or that spends a fair amount of time working or living in remote locations where the likelihood of having such an injury and the nearest place to get a shot being overly far away makes it far more advisable to take the precaution.

       The nice thing about tetanus is it's not contagious, so if someone doesn't get vaccinated for that, you can't say they're screwing up "herd immunity". If you want a tetanus shot, by all means go and get one. It's personal protection only.

       The only reason I went then was because of family pressure. Aside from the tetnus shot, I haven't been to doctor in going on 20 years. Yeah, bald spots in the beard don't really bother me. What bothers me is that my immune system is attacking me - and It didn't used to.  I'm not even a hundred percent that the shot is the cause - but the timing seemed to much to overlook. The fact that onset usually occurs in children lends credence to the idea that the shot caused it - as childhood is when folks get the majority of their shots....

       Never to miss another opportunity to inject someone Big Pharma has concocted yet another one for Shingles that they're maintaining absolutely everyone should have as well and will no doubt be given to children and anyone that's unwilling to take their chances on getting it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the reliability and efficacy of that vaccine won't be known with any certainty for decades and if it's a failure well gosh and gee whizz that's really too bad after countless billions of dollars have already been spent and raked in off it by Big Pharma  over that time-frame.

       You know why old people are getting shingles more than they used to? Because back in the day, they would be exposed to their grandkids who had chickenpox, and it would act like a booster shot. Their immune system would remember that this is what varicela looks like, and they wouldn't get shingles. Now they're not getting exposed to kids with chickenpox, and therefore they get shingles.

       Do you know the reason why some diseases aren't as harmful now compared to the past? That's right, advances in medical technology.

      <p>
       Virus mutations happen all the time, it's not dependent on if we have inoculations, vaccines, or medical knowledge...

      <p>
       Even
       <em>

       Remove 3 million cases of illness and maybe cause 40 unverifiable side effects that may or may not be linked to vaccines. It's not even a discussion what everyone would choose. The NET benefits are enormous when vaccinations are applied.

       The reality is improved sanitation and nutrition reduced infant mortality, big pharma tried to falsely give vaccines the credit.  Even if is there was any king of good that vaccines did, the harm they cause would far outweigh it, causing epilepsy, asthma, peanut allergies, SIDS, MS, Diabetes Type 1 etc.  The human body comes with a ready made immune system, it knows what it is doing, leave it to do it’s job, interference is mostly for profit, not health.

       You're confusing mortality with morbidity. Only vaccines reduce morbidity to zero, not mortality. Mortality from polio dropped when we had iron lungs. Morbidity dropped when we had vaccination.

       Fair enough. Now tell me its a food idea to bundle the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination into one shot and give it to toddlers when big pharma could easily give them 3 separate inoculations instead. What could go wrong you say? Obviously we don't have much of a problem with the 3 previously mentioned diseases. We do have a problem with autism. There is a link between autism and rubella. Dope it out with a little logic and you see big pharma taking a big risk because it's so much more cost effective to bundle, especially now that the infrastructure is so well established. Just because things are better than they were in the dark ages, doesn't mean they can't still be better yet.

       That's pure unadulterated propaganda. You check the real statistics concerning the incidence and deaths rates for childhood diseases in the US and you'll find there's been no significant change from the already low point they were all at years before there any vaccines were created for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover those vaccines were peddled and promoted at that time to spare parents the inconvenience of their children being home and off school for a week or two to get over them, not that they presented any real danger to those children because everyone knew very well that they didn't back then. Some even held parties when a child came down with one of them that other parents would have their children attend in order to catch them and simply get them over with. That's how inconsequential it was.

       The post WWII "baby boomers" were the largest single generation ever known, comprising almost 30% of the entire population of North America and they all contracted measles, mumps and chicken pox because there were no vaccines against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by all rights and according to your understanding there should have been a very high and significant number of deaths right here in North America that we should all know about and be very well aware of and yet there weren't any at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover that generation has also been one of the healthiest on record. Far heathier than their own children and grandchildren who now have all kinds of unheard of allergies and health problems not the least of which is the one being called "autism" which isn't autism at all but actually being caused by the cumulative effects of the neurotoxins that are in vaccines and the extraordinary number of them now being administered to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A completely new problem that is unique to our times and whose growth to near epidemic proportions has a direct correspondence to the number of vaccines that have been introduced and administered that all happen to contain neurotoxins that will always cause some neurological damage in any amount. Neurotoxins that are being introduced directly into the bloodstream and bypassing all the normal defences the human body has against encountering them in any normal ways through accidental skin contact, inhalation or ingestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Autism was always known and 1 out of every 10,000 children was born with the neurological impairment of genetic origins that is believed to be responsible for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they are presently calling autism is the late onset of the kind of damage that the children with actual autism are already born with suddenly appearing in completely normal and properly developing children up to six years of age who quickly begin to regress and lose all the mental and physical skills they had already acquired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those minor childhood diseases are only dangerous to children who are already sick, extremely weak and unhealthy due to malnutrition, unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and no proper care or even medical care for them while they are ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of those conditions now apply anywhere in the western world and it's the world statistics that deaths among such children in the very poorest and most populous parts of the world that are being used to justify those vaccines and attempt to frighten people about how dangerous those diseases are.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't dangerous at all to any perfectly healthy children that catch them at all.

       You got that backwards. Chickenpox is worse in a situation where people aren't infected as young children. As an adult it's a serious infection, and if you want to say shingles isn't a big deal I doubt you've heard of it before.

       No. Microbe colonization does not happen in a vacuum. If you delete one microbe from the natural microbiome, it will be replaced, often with something worse. Then you're playing "wack-a-mole", creating new vaccines to try to fix the problem each time.

       Did you not know that the diagnostic criteria for polio changed after the vaccine came out? We now call it transverse myelitis, acute flaccid paralysis, etc. Maybe you should learn to the other side of the story before you scoff at it.

       No, has nothing to do with the vaccine. Just a simple fact of herpes viruses and their relationship with the host. And, no, I didn't get chickenpox.

      <p>
       We aren't colonized with H. influenzae. It's a pathogen. Vaccination, again, provides immunity. You get immunity from getting the disease as well. You're either arguing that immunity makes people immune. Did you forget how that works again?

       Perhaps I wasn't clear enough. If you get chicken pox as a kid, you have long-term immunity. But because of the vaccine, you don't get chickenpox, and when the shorter-lived vaccine immunity wears off, you are now prone to chicken pox. If everyone got it as a child, like was the norm up to the 90's, they wouldn't have to worry about getting it as an adult. Does that make sense to you now?

       My point is, poliomyelitis was being over-diagnosed. They changed the diagnostic criteria to require a spinal tap, and suddenly the rates went down. Again, it looks like you have a lot to learn about the other side of the story before you criticize.

       You're clear, you're just wrong. 1st world countries, by virtue of being more hygienic, lead to later and later herpes infections. This is best illustrated with Eppstein-Barr where 'mono' isn't even a 3rd world country observed phenomenon hardly, yet is pretty common in the US. Same goes for varicella. And you've also got it twisted. Herpes rely on a particular balance that is lost with age, hence shingles. Innocuous VZV infections are going to still be bad with shingles, even if acquired as a young child. Plus, the vaccine is a
       <em>
        live virus
       </em>
       vaccine. It's 'waning immunity' isn't waning any more than waning against the actual pathogen, hence why shingles vaccines have been around just as long as chickenpox vaccines even though old people have not had the vaccine.

       since you won't listen to anything I say based on your incorrect presumptions of my education level. 
If you're anything like the other brainwashed provaxxers I've talked to, you'll outright refuse to watch/listen to this. Learning the new information is tedious and boring, so everyone convinces themselves there can't possibly be anything new they'd learn from the video. Or they'll spend 20 minutes googling the lecturer, and deciding based on the Google result that listening to what this doctor says is not worth their time. So anyway, here you go. She'll tell you all about haemophilus influenzae if you want to learn something. Start a couple minutes in to skip the intro

Come back when you have research for me to read, not shitty phone recorded lectures. I don't have time for child's play seeing as I have an actual relevant education in this arena and know when someone is spouting laughable bullshit.

       <li>
        <p>
         You don't know that the shingles vaccine was given to people who never received the chicken pox vaccine because age--not VZV shedders--is, like with other herpes infections, the biggest factor of breakthrough infections.

       Not ever mentioned much but, the over-vaccination that often happens to an ever growing number of pet dogs is known to cause all kinds of immunological disorders and health problems that can shorten the already too short lives of our four-legged and very best friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few of the oldest breeds of dogs are actually allergic to some of the mandatory vaccines which can actually kill them if their owners and their vets aren't aware of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a vet that knows and recognises that, you can avoid giving your dog any unnecessary shots by having a sample of their blood periodically subjected to what is known as a "titer test" which measures the amount of the antibodies and the strength of their immune system against the diseases they are routinely and repeatedly inoculated against whether they in fact need it or not and by and large most of them don't in many if not most of those instances.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you might want to ask yourself why isn't this routinely done with children instead of subjecting them to a roster of repeat and booster shots that they very probably don't need?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or why aren't there any preliminary tests to ensure that a child isn't allergic to any shot that they've never had before instead of simply assuming they won't have any adverse reactions to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       In short why are so many so overly concerned about taking precautions against diseases, especially all the relatively harmless childhood ones that in fact actually provide a life-long natural immunity against those in addition to others that are biologically related to them, once they've had them, but so blindly willing to take a chance with something like that happening which can do far more damage and life-long harm to them than having those diseases themselves ever would? Another very good question is why are people who've been vaccinated against certain diseases still catching them? Or having a longer and more difficult time in recovering from it than someone who was never vaccinated at all that also happened to get it?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are but a few very simple common sense questions among numerous others that I'd like to see some genuine answers to instead of seeing them being constantly ignored or simply brushed off.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I lack confidence in both the methods and the system that precisely is why I do and I am quite sure that a great number of others that do as well would all be far less inclined to be that way by having those answers provided instead of being treated like irrational know-nothings by people who really are irrational know nothings that not only haven't bothered but won't even bother to find and provide some real answers to those.

       <em>
        the
       </em>
       medical community. Consider how big the medical community is
 and how vaccinations are common practice all over the world. Does the American medical community control Chinese or Russian researchers? I'm pretty sure they all agree on the benefits.

       People love to work against their own interests because they don’t see how life actually used to be. We’ve progressed medically and technologically so far so quickly that it’s impossible to consider a time when a significant percentage of the population suffered from the diseases that vaccines have made a rarity.

       I remember a situation in japan a few decades ago where they had a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       decrease vaccinations for whooping cough and the number of cases per year jumped from sub-500 to like 13 or 14 thousand in only 5 years

       They've known all along that vaccines can cause autoimmune disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gullian Barre Syndrome is an example of this,imo.
Somehow,the swine flu vaccine was causing the immune system to also attack the nervous system.

       Clearly you haven't had both of them or you'd never say that. I have and I'd take the measles over the ear infection that makes you far sicker and even more uncomfortable, hands down.

       I've also had the mumps and chickenpox as a child just like most of my generation did and I can assure you they were no big deal.

       yeah, but you can only get shingles if youve had the chicken pox. And shingles is pretty bad

       Excellent work, thanks for posting. But I have to point out that most people are not convinced logically, but rather emotionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stories such as this are likely more effective with most people:

      <ul>

         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsdFU8CnoSI">

      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose the trick is to find the best blend of logic and emotion for a given target audience.

       Seems like the authors kinda disagree with you on that one. What's the point of using this as a citation? It's literally the first one.
