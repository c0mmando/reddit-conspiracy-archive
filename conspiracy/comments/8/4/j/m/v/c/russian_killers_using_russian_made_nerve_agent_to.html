        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Have any of you actually fallen for this?  Why the hell would an assassin use a nerve agent that can be directly linked back to Russia to kill another Russian?  Oh, and more to the point, why would Putin say &#39;that sounds like a great idea, go ahead&#39;?</p>

<p>Anyone who wants to assassinate someone in the UK would just use the weapons that street criminals in that country use.  They&#39;d just walk up and stab him to death, steal his wallet and run off.  Make it look like a standard street crime, the kind of thing that happens every day.  </p>

<p>I have a bad feeling about all of this.  Remember before the election when Hillary was pumped for a full on war with Russia, even Sanders admitted to standing naked in a mirror and masturbating hard over a war with Russia.  Well, it looks like that war was just stalled out for a few months and now it&#39;s back on the table.</p>

<p>Luckily it&#39;s Britainistan and their leader Mullah May who are going to start it, and with it being such a tiny Islamic country the Russians only need drop two medium sized nukes onto two nuclear power stations and that spec of world misery will be uninhabitable for 50,000 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the obvious question is if they wanted to get caught why? Putin doesn&#39;t do things for no reason so IF hes behind this whats the end game?</p>

<p>more sanctions, problems at the UNSC, getting their diplomats kicked out? i mean there are no positives for russia in doing this. the guy has squeeled every secret he possibly knew already so what is the point of killing him?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire argument relies on the assumption that Trump is Putin’s puppet, so therefore Russia would suffer no US consequences. Positives (argued) have been breaking the will of NATO by attacking Britain with no fear of recourse from the US and intimidating any potential flipped spies into silence.</p>

<p>Trump has now said that Russia likely responsible. New sanctions were announced and imposed against Russia today related to the troll farm indictment, Mnuchin said more sanctions are to follow soon.</p>

<p>I’m sure this will all somehow indicate Trump is a puppet, but that’s the latest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That depends on how this fits into a larger plan.  Considering he&#39;s at war on the western front in the Donetsk region and in Syria, and considering all the Psyops that bear and dragon are running, this would be but a small part of the overall scheme.</p>

<p>For example, suppose hypothetically that he is planning some huge move, like taking from Syria to eastern Turkey.  Then this would be a time when it is especially vulnerable for him if staff choose to defect with that infkrmation.  That could justify the huge deterrent motivation.</p>

<p>Or, suppose he has some hopes that Britain&#39;s weak response, in combination with Brexit, will reduce Britain&#39;s influence and power.  That would reduce the Five Eyes power, and help the Russian ally China break Australia and NZ out of Five Eyes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if any of that is true.  My point is that when you make up various arguments such as &quot;is that worth the cost?&quot; you should consider that it depends on a larger goal, which you may not even know about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well that is the thing i am always looking at the large picture.</p>

<p>so he kills a former spy, whos completely out of the loop to scare a bunch of people supposedly in the loop.</p>

<ul>
<li>what that does is actually encourages people thinking of defecting to do it asap, and share what they know in exchange for protection.</li>
<li>it knee caps russian trade (end of the gas to london, sanctions from the EU)</li>
<li>it links them to chemical weapons use, something they have been working to avoid for several years working in syria.</li>
<li>turns the UNSC against them, just when they need them to be onside to wrap up the war in syria and navigate conflicts with turkey.</li>
<li>fallout that will harm the oil/gas pipelines they are trying to back in syria and through the black sea. not to mention could lead to more EU countries blocking russian gas (something ukraine has some serious reasons to fuck with)</li>
</ul>

<p>now i cant really come up with russian gains that would off set all of those negatives.</p>

<p>cover to invade ukraine? not really, if anything UK would be all in supporting kiev if it were to happen right now.</p>

<p>cover in syria? well they are and have been winning for quite some time already, and if anything this has created more support for a US intervention in the UNSC and harms russias goals there (israel has all the reason needed since russia has given syria the tools to defend against the Israeli airforce, and now iraq,iran egypt are all trying to buy those systems)</p>

<p>australia and NZ are up to their eyeballs in the 5eyes network the chances of them ever leaving it are completely absurd, if anything australia has been more hostile to russia than the rest (recall the former primeminister threating to chest bump putin at the g20/g8?)</p>

<p>the whole invade ukraine narrative is also just hilarious, most of east ukraine is just bombed out no mans land now, why would russia even want it? its just a money pit and has no real resources that russia doesnt already have in droves and would likely be under sanctions for the next 50 years if they did seize it anyway.</p>

<p>people seem to be just throwing logic and reason out the window these days, beleiving the most absurd theories fuelled by feelings and assumptions.</p>

<p>i honestly didn&#39;t think we as a species could be this stupid and naive but here we are buying it hook line and sinker.</p>

<p>Judging from the suspicious manner of the poisoning incident, the timing, and the concerted blaming on Russia who is incidentally the “defender” arms supplier of Syria and Iran, which Israel has been plotting to exterminate for ages, we have reasons to believe the ultimate purpose behind the “Spy Poisoning” is a plot to link and to frame Russia to chemical weapons in Syria, and to use the excuse in order to launch an all out war to wipe Iran off the map once and for all.</p>

<p>It appears the whole campaigned is initiated by Israel and their “Globalist” ilks... <a href="http://goodizen.com/blaming-russia-over-spy-poisoning-is-a-part-of-the-conspiracy-to-attack-iran-militarily/">More Here</a></p>
