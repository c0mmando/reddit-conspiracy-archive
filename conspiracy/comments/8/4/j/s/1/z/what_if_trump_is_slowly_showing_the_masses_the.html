       another thread about Trump. I know, I’m sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we know, Trump appointed a scientist (I don’t remember the position he was appointed to)who didn’t really believe in global warming, and I remember the outrage and comments from my family upon the appointment, how could he be so stupid? Etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But recently I’ve been looking more into Agenda 21 and global warming, as well as watching videos by Richard Hall. A video he made struck me, in that we haven’t really got any solid proof. For example, there has been atmospheric changes on Saturn, where there is no human life.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the appointment of Sam Clovis (I believe that’s his name) is his way of showing the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not looking for an argument, this was just a question I found I was asking myself.

       I personally believe that Climate Change is real and that the conspiracy is to convince us that it isn't...it's not that hard to understand honestly. Imagine your car in a closed garage...if you turn your car on, are you going to sit inside that closed garage? No...you will most definitely die from the toxic gasses that accumulate...same goes for the climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is real, and I think that we already possess the technology to fix it, but that this is being kept secret so that at the height of the Climate crises the elites will step forward with the "answer", and people will just gobble it up wholesale...

       The Republic is a very real thing my friend...and it exists independently of the idea of "America". The Republic is the current means by which the American People currently organize themselves...but that is fickle and could always change. Republics
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       tend to die to thundering applause...just look at Augustus and Actium.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, Lucas had his own political agenda to push at the time, and the Romans followed Augustus because he restored
       <em>
        stability
       </em>
       after nearly 3 decades of Civil War.

       Lucas always had a political agenda. And numerous other ones too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree with your republic sentiment. The republic is based on the ideas and values our fou being father brought forth. I would look at the Bill of Rights and Declaration of I dependence for that. Those are the building blocks of our society

       Climate change has happened before and it will happen again. What do you think the numerous ice ages we have gone through are? The earth ebbs and flows. Have humans played a part in speeding it up? Undoubetdly. But this isn't the first or last time mother Gaia will go through this.

       Personally I would love to see far more sweeping efforts than this. I want to see a sort of Green "New Deal", and a concerted, honest effort to transition to a Green economy. I don't think a carbon tax punishes Corporate wrongdoers enough nor does it shift societal conditions enough.

       Personally, I think the carbon tax is a scam. I also believe that if TPTB wanted to...they could easily accomplish a green energy future for the whole world. I just don't believe they want to at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the technologies that are available at present..wind/water turbines, solar and considering the trend of those technologies improving over time, it's easy to see this as a doable thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jobs created by a "truly noble, honest" effort to accomplish it would also go a long ways to solving some problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sadly, as we've seen, the green energy movement was quickly co-opted by some less than noble entities that were just in it for government subsidies and fell far short of what they should have been capable of doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sometimes wonder if this was done on purpose to dissuade the majority from accomplishing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at it this way. If they do impose the carbon tax, do you believe they will spend that money on green energy systems that benefit all mankind in an effort to supply everyone with very cheap renewable energy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you think they would use the money frivolously or even worse, use the money to create a more Orwellian reality that none of us want.

       Yup. Unless this is lead by the Direct Action of the People then it will be corrupted and no real change will come...there is simply too much "built in" inertia to the current system, unfortunately.

       it is possible that Trump might be showing the truth very slowly.. you can consider it just by comparing how the media showed him just as a "celebrity" when he had his tv show, but all of a sudden just by running for president they did a complete turn, i know he may be what some consider not very "presidential like" but that makes him seem more like a human being.. (i have no political affiliation at all but just seeing how the media covers him and i know he is not up to the standard of what a president should be but due to the constant shit they put out on him, he may be on some kind of right path.)

       It is pretty well established that carbon dioxide (and other emissions) strongly absorbs IR light.  It is also widely accepted that humans are taking billions of years worth of accumulated organic matter and converting them into carbon dioxide (and other emissions) in the course of only a few decades.  It seems pretty open and shut that this will have a huge impact on not just climate but all life as we know it.

       Our consumption of fossil fuels and our overproduction of livestock has skyrocketed our levels of CO2 &amp; methane in our Earth’s atmosphere. There has been proof of this for YEARS. 
Climate change debunkers are just as bad as flat earthers, google may be censored but it will provide evidence for both of those things being false.
