       How convenient and timely this spy murder is ....
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump / Russia collusion is completely dead by Mueller. "Russia is evil" narative must continue. Use other one of "5 eyes".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump geting grips on the world events. Gaining traction. This will complicate stuff for him.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Large human trafficking uncovered in UK / ignored by their MSM. Look the other way.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russia organizes FIFA '18 in couple of months. Possible good PR for Russia will be stopped.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         UK internal official narative on various issues (brexit, bbc, human trafficking, strong orwelian censorship) is faling apart - distraction needed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This will also benefit UK in EU (and NATO) position ... regaining leadership.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Same ol' shit that Iraq and Syria was accused of (chemical shit), and destroyed afterward. Will we believe it again?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Finally, Russia has elections in 4 days.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       How convenient is this timely spy murder ???  And in reality , who cares about life of double spy scum of the earth ?  He knew what he signed for as a spy. Oh, UK is so much about human rights - just when it suits them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should we ask ourselves - who benefits from this (murder , response) ???
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we going to fall for this same old story , yet again ??
      </p>
      <p>
       Good work, NWO , You are winning bigly! Bring more shit , more threat of war to this world! We chilled for two days, it was enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       United Nations Insecurity Council continues to make great decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Must continue living in fear.

       Why are you purposely ignoring all the other evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       All Trump needs to do if he's innocent is actually presidential and let himself be exonerated but he's already admitted to obstruction of justice and he definitely doesn't act like a guy who is innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you're right though. I'll be the first to admit you are if it's true, but if you're going out of your way to dismiss all the credible evidence of something going on then you're not seeking the truth. You're just looking to validate your preconceived version of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the pieces fall. I'll never understand why people vehemently defend this guy. He has lawyers for a reason.

       well the "evidence" thats been shown so far doesnt prove anything, that is why i take issue with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       the narrative has been trump works for Putin, and Putin put him in power to destroy the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       so far the closest they have come to that via evidence is trump knew russia was shitting in the pool by spamming a few facebook ads and the "russian trolls" basically trolled the whole american system and trumps campaign basically played along with it.

       so far ive seen nothing showing them working together other than maybe asking to see dirt they had on clinton. (meanwhile clintons campaign paid foreigners for a dossier to be made...)
      </p>
      <p>
       the trolls have been traced to some people with russian last names, again zero links to putin shown, other than they are russian people and ffs i have been being called a russian bot/troll for 3 fucking years.
      </p>
      <p>
       now there is a slim chance trump really is Putins boy, im not saying its impossible, but given how its all played out its pretty fucking unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       frankly i wonder why Putin would have supported Trump now that we know he paid a shit ton of money for bill clinton to give that speech and hilary ushering the uranium deal through shortly afterwards.   now Putin had already bought clinton, so why back trump instead? i mean why back the loose canon, when you've already bought clinton? seems kinda out of character for Vlad.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't get me wrong im a pretty big fan of old Vladmir, i think hes a stellar example of leader who puts his country above all else. the closest american analogue imho was teddy rosevelt.
      </p>
      <p>
       i've followed him since his early rise and for some one known to be such a strategic person, these sort of hamfisted moves are quite outside of his normal approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       at the end of the day this is all just too sloppy to be attributed to Putin, and the continued escalations are antithetical to his usual self. if this attack was Putin it marks a very serious departure from the norm, usually for a shift this big in some one strategy it would be in response to a major shift, one im simply not seeing a reason for on the russian side.
      </p>
      <p>
       the last thing russia wants right now is escalation of tensions, so why then would they do something so blatant and public that would serve to do nothing but seriously escalate those tensions?
      </p>
      <p>
       so the investigator in me has to fall back to "if it isn't russia, then who would benefit from this" and well that list is a lot longer than the ways russia would benefit from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       russia gets to take out an old double agent who would theoretically have already told the allies everything he knew if he was being allowed to hide out in the UK. so its not like they stopped a fresh spy from leaking active info.
      </p>
      <p>
       meanwhile May gets to divert attention and create a boogeyman, the US gets to boost their bullshit excuses for trump winning, and the rest of NATO gets to use it to justify more military spending, while diverting attention from their own scandals.
      </p>
      <p>
       people have been throwing around a lot of legalese they have just been parroting. things like obstruction have a pretty high threshold and don't really mean a lot, but they sound good and give headlines impact. the problem i have with taking the medias claims seriously is how hard they've tried to spin this in to a big thing when they have so little to support it, and rely on a chorus of trump haters who will cheer for anything negative about him.

       You've made your mind up, no sense in proceeding further. However, It's pretty hilarious that you "respect Putin" and compare him to Teddy. Did Teddy murder dissidents and journalists? Did Teddy loot the coffers of his own people and give it out to his cronies? Was Teddy an agent of a communist regime doing who knows what? If that's an example of someone who "puts his country above all else" well you have a warped view of love for one's country.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder you're willing to fall all over yourself to defend Trump, it's clear you have a thing for wannabe strong men. I have nothing but love for the Russian people, but their government is ran by a robber baron and his cronies. All you'd have to do is some light research to learn that Putin is a murdering thief wrapped in the flag of Russia.

       Youre employing double speak.

       You had a majority congress and senate investigate her 8 times and nothing happened. Why do you think that is?

       From lack of effort or from lack of evidence?

       you mean when they tried to derail it and claimed the whole thing was a protest over a youtube film for weeks before finally admitting it was a planned attack immediately? and then the FBI at the time headed by the same mueller "investigated" and found no problems?
      </p>

       Russia have asked for samples of the substance used in the attempt to aid in the investigation. The UK ignored them instead and have not shared with anyone. Not saying this means anything but it seems pretty convenient that no-one else got to investigate.

       well the "evidence" thats been shown so far doesnt prove anything, that is why i take issue with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       the narrative has been trump works for Putin, and Putin put him in power to destroy the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       so far the closest they have come to that via evidence is trump knew russia was shitting in the pool by spamming a few facebook ads and the "russian trolls" basically trolled the whole american system and trumps campaign basically played along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       so far ive seen nothing showing them working together other than maybe asking to see dirt they had on clinton. (meanwhile clintons campaign paid foreigners for a dossier to be made...)
      </p>
      <p>
       the trolls have been traced to some people with russian last names, again zero links to putin shown, other than they are russian people and ffs i have been being called a russian bot/troll for 3 fucking years.
      </p>
      <p>
       now there is a slim chance trump really is Putins boy, im not saying its impossible, but given how its all played out its pretty fucking unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       frankly i wonder why Putin would have supported Trump now that we know he paid a shit ton of money for bill clinton to give that speech and hilary ushering the uranium deal through shortly afterwards.   now Putin had already bought clinton, so why back trump instead? i mean why back the loose canon, when you've already bought clinton? seems kinda out of character for Vlad.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't get me wrong im a pretty big fan of old Vladmir, i think hes a stellar example of leader who puts his country above all else. the closest american analogue imho was teddy rosevelt.
      </p>
      <p>
       i've followed him since his early rise and for some one known to be such a strategic person, these sort of hamfisted moves are quite outside of his normal approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       at the end of the day this is all just too sloppy to be attributed to Putin, and the continued escalations are antithetical to his usual self. if this attack was Putin it marks a very serious departure from the norm, usually for a shift this big in some one strategy it would be in response to a major shift, one im simply not seeing a reason for on the russian side.
      </p>
      <p>
       the last thing russia wants right now is escalation of tensions, so why then would they do something so blatant and public that would serve to do nothing but seriously escalate those tensions?
      </p>
      <p>
       so the investigator in me has to fall back to "if it isn't russia, then who would benefit from this" and well that list is a lot longer than the ways russia would benefit from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       russia gets to take out an old double agent who would theoretically have already told the allies everything he knew if he was being allowed to hide out in the UK. so its not like they stopped a fresh spy from leaking active info.
      </p>
      <p>
       meanwhile May gets to divert attention and create a boogeyman, the US gets to boost their bullshit excuses for trump winning, and the rest of NATO gets to use it to justify more military spending, while diverting attention from their own scandals.
      </p>
      <p>
       people have been throwing around a lot of legalese they have just been parroting. things like obstruction have a pretty high threshold and don't really mean a lot, but they sound good and give headlines impact. the problem i have with taking the medias claims seriously is how hard they've tried to spin this in to a big thing when they have so little to support it, and rely on a chorus of trump haters who will cheer for anything negative about him.

       clintons got decades of legal problems, i thought she was scum before shes was whispering in Bill ear and creating the future mass incarceration problems were now dealing with, and unlike this situation there was actual evidence showing she was involved.

       you mean when they tried to derail it and claimed the whole thing was a protest over a youtube film for weeks before finally admitting it was a planned attack immediately? and then the FBI at the time headed by the same mueller "investigated" and found no problems?
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean do you want to open the door to Muelllers handling of that situation? or the fact that shes actually admitted responsibility for that whole situation?(

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       so there you have it not only was it proven shes was responsible for it, she flat out admitted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       the Dems tried to prevent the investigation from even fucking occuring trying to paint the whole thing as a reaction to a youtube video ffs.
