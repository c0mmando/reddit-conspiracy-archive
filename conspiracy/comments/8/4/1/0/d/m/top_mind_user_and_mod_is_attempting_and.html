    <div class="md"><p>I honestly hate when shit like this happens, foremost for the sake of the users targeted, second because I&#39;ve bizarrely ended up on good terms with that particular user, as well as another TMOR user (NJFS), both initially by accident and because of my easy-going nature (especially when drunk and/or high), and general tendency to get along with others having diametrically opposing viewpoints. </p>

<p>It puts me in an incredibly awkward position, as I detest seeing users here being trolled as I have been in the past, yet continue to get along with certain TMOR users I&#39;ve gotten to know somewhat over time in spite of it. If the allegations of doxxing are legitimate, I support any action taken by the admins if necessary. So far, and objectively, I haven&#39;t seen any examples of actual doxxing, as in personally identifiable information being posted, rather posting alleged alt accounts of active users and mods here. I&#39;m not sure that would count as actual doxxing. It might, or might not. Either way, I oppose any form of harassment, TMOR activity included and in particular. On the other hand, as I said prior I can and more than likely will continue to get along with certain users there regardless, as I will continue to remain active in this sub and hold the mods and users here I&#39;ve gotten to know over time in high regard.</p>

<p>In short, I&#39;m not taking sides either, and find the bickering between the two groups unfortunate to say the least, although objectively the majority is not necessarily bickering but ridicule and harassment from the other sub. A word of advice: try not to take any of it personally, and whatever you do, do not let it get to you or affect your conduct here or elsewhere. The moment you do, they (whether trolls or alleged shills) will win. It&#39;s better to simply brush it off or have a laugh with them or at them in return, ignore it foremost, and report any brigading or violations of reddit&#39;s ToS as necessary, etc. To put it simply: DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS. You&#39;re only giving them more ammunition to work with the moment you even acknowledge them and what they do, the only exception being violations of reddit&#39;s ToS, threats, actual doxxing, brigading, etc, which should be reported to the admins or exposed accordingly. Furthermore, remember this is the Internet, that shenanigans, trolling, and meta-drama is inevitably going to happen and shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously. That doesn&#39;t excuse it or make it right, but should be emphasized when encountered and disregarded as such. And as you know, there are also a handful of legitimate shills, professional trolls and astroturf accounts from both sides of the aisle that some of may encounter, which should for the most be treated the same as one would regard a troll as taking them seriously only serves to reinforce their behavior and in their view shows their tactics are working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s going on here? They&#39;re leaking non-personally identifiable information from a private subreddit? That&#39;s shitty, but I&#39;m not surprised such a thing would happen. There isn&#39;t really anything in that sub anyway, I&#39;m sure everyone there knew that this was a possibility. It&#39;s not like everyone&#39;s legal names are posted in there or something. </p>

<p>Are they also talking about doxxing somewhere? I don&#39;t see that here, but I honestly am not going to waste my time reading through this asshole&#39;s history. If they did, you should document evidence of this and present it to the admins. Maybe they&#39;d refuse to do anything given their political allegiances, but it&#39;s worth trying if that&#39;s a legitimate concern here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you&#39;re concern trolling. What does &quot;attemping to doxx&quot; mean? What kind of personally identifiable information is there? How did they get it? You say many users are being targeted? Who? How can I find out who? I couldn&#39;t find this user saying anything about personally identifiable information, it looks like they&#39;re just enjoying leaking meaningless shit from a private subreddit. </p>

<p>I appreciate you calling public attention to the infiltration of private subreddits, but if you&#39;re going to allege that doxxing is going on, you should be able to produce evidence of this. If you cannot, then you&#39;re just being sensational. </p>
