       Not to mention that even mainstream political discourse right now is an ongoing fight over which
       <em>
        literal conspiracy theories
       </em>
       are true and which are "just conspiracy theories". Actually seems pretty natural that in this climate,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       would become super politicized.

       But there is far more non-conspiracy political content now and the moderators don't seem to be interested in keeping a lid on non-conspiracy content. Especially when the top mod posts political crap that has no conspiracy content.

       Exactly. People come in here and say "Where's the conspiracy? This is politics!" Yeah, CIA is politics, the MIC is politics, government coverups are politics, the drug war is politics. Conspiracies are fucking political, I don't even want to know what kind of shit you think should be talked about in conspiracy communities if not those kinds of things.

       The 2016 election happened. I used to love this sub, I don't come here anymore because it's not the nonpartisan sub it used to be. You used to be able to equally call out both parties, but now when you call out one side (that dominates this place) and you're called a shill. It gets old really fucking fast when people with 5 day old throwaways downvote you to hell and call you a shill because you don't agree with their heavily right-winged views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck to the OGs who may have been able to stick through it. I couldn't and I haven't found a good alternative.

       Pritzker spent $63 million for the Democrat primary. Bruce Rauner has spent ~58million so far as incumbent. If they pooled that money together they've already spent enough to take everyone in Illinois out to Bennigans. The crazy part is this is largely coming out of the candidates pockets on both sides.

       I don't get why people downvoted comments in this sub. If you want it to be partisan, I always figured that any comment giving their view should only be criticized with another comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we got comments getting removed for things that could
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       be
       <em>
        perceived
       </em>
       as a "personal attack," which includes naming funny subreddits when people say something funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were you, I'd look for other sites than Reddit that post good conspiracy content, especially if you want politics involved. This sub is decaying.

       Honestly, the only times I've seen someone on this sub call someone else a shill was when the person being called out had no post history, yet a heavy amount of karma --- or like...two posts, a new account, and a lot of karma. Both of which, to me, are pretty suspicious...

       First of all, I have you marked as a friend, but I am wondering if you should maybe try making it through a day without the benefit (some would say crutch) of describing yourself and your viewpoints with labels.  I mean, what good are they, really?  If you don't put labels on yourself then others won't be able to put labels on you, and people will have to deal strictly with what you think and write about issues.

       Honestly, I think you're not identifying the problem. Its fine when there are political conspiracies involving Trump, Podesta, or whoever. But there is a large group of shills (with votebots) who took over r/politics and other subs, and have been trying to take over this sub for some time now. They are intentionally making political conspiracies (at least those they see as attacking "their team") into a shit show. They've also clearly been trying to divide the sub into partisan teams, and it works for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not for them, I don't think there would really be any major problems with political conspiracies in this sub. For my part, I've blocked probably ~90% of these shills and the sub has largely gone back to normal.

       It's funny how all the comments calling this place right wing, T_D 2.0 or talking about Russian trolls are heavily upvoted yet any comments calling out shareblue and
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       are heavily downvotes.
      </p>

       Fair enough. It just irks me when people call out the political bias in the sub and how much of an issue it is while only referencing one side and not including the other, since they are both cancer.

       The Aliens left a long time ago, at least.. 4000 years.  Anything you're seeing in the skies today is us.   At least..  the discs, the cigars, and the triangles.. those are us..  I hope the huge spheres and the several kilometer long tubes are us as well.  Bigfoot.. go look in Russia, certainly around the Ural Mountains, they had lots of Neaderthals still turning up at the end of the 19th Century, some local lord iun russia captured a female specimen and in typical 19th century mindset turned her into a sextoy.   You can see ghosts in Infra red light, they appear as pulsating globes, but you cant tell if they are close or far away.. You get loads floating around at rituals.. especially violent painful ones.. they seem to be attracted to suffering.

       There's this alternative universe that reveals itself once you escape from Plato's liberal echoey cave. But don't go back to the cave once you've seen the outside, or the liberals will dox your parents and send you death threats once you tell them that the world outside of the social media mob isn't real.

       Conspiracy: He was abducted by aliens... missing time/memory all that.... they implanted a HAARP implant into the "third-eye" (aka pineal gland), the aliens work with the government to install these chips. The gov then uses the three HAARP stations to broadcast signals telling u/ridestraight to continue to post content to distract the population with his titillating wit (and awesome russian dialect).

       You're complaining about liberals painting conservatives with a broad brush, while doing the same about liberals? Oy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it comes as a surprise, but people with liberal views are capable of having nuanced perspectives when it comes to conservatives. People who actually bother to get informed understand that conservative covers a wide range of views and opinions. And conservative doesn't mean holding only conservative views. Someone can be say, fiscally conservative while at the same time being more liberal on social issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to put it in personal terms, all that stuff you posted are stereotypes. Some of them are based in reality, for example some Christian fundamentalists are against things like same sex marriage. Some are less rooted in reality (AKA dumb stereotypes). I'm just as guilty as the next person when it comes to broad brushing, but I do make the effort to not do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also feel compelled to point out that liberal also covers a wide range of perspectives and ideas. Being liberal doesn't mean someone agrees with all liberal ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side point:  I really don't have any issues with conservatives, because real conservatives are generally reasonable people who may have different ideas that I do. I do however have a huge problem with the GOP's brand of "conservatism".

       I was gonna say some snark shit but you look actually interested in a discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP, or any of the likes brand of anything is not indicative of the people by any stretch of the imagination. The neo conservatives in Washington or on the way to Washington aren't in touch with reality in the slightest, let alone examples of the attitudes of conservatives who tend to be anti government individualists who look to the bill of rights for reference before analyzing their stance on an immediate issue. Neo liberals also aren't indicative of the average liberal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both neo conservatives and neo liberals are essentially the same. Both are war mongering two faced opportunists with no steady philosophy of politics and in place of a political philosophy use straight up mind control techniques that have been developed over the years by professionals in advertising and social psychology. The laws they accept depend on their stamp of conservative or liberal, which is dependent simply on who is determined to be a better logistical choice to prey upon for support.
      </p>
      <p>
       The liberals I'm talking about are the average people. Even without neo liberal politicians, liberalism as it's evolved to today is no longer liberal in the classical sense, which was freedom to self empowerment to choose your own life. It's now the antithesis of liberalism that stole the name for appearances. Every aspect of it, from the solutions that demand all investigators to stay within the boundaries of simple morality that prevent accounting for other important amoral technical factors, to the twisted entitlement that comes with the assumed moral superiority of being on the progressive side that has the theoretical potential (but no results whatsoever) of being
       <em>
        infinitely
       </em>
       correct both technically and morally, liberalism has been designed by the people for the people who want to take the fight out of everybody, especially if it costs freedom that can hurt someone else, not taking the context who is attacking and being hurt into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberalism dominates America at the moment and at the basis of it is setting people up to be unable to fight or do as they choose, all in the name of useless safety and enforcing a moral stance dictated by somebody elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all this seems too abstract to have practical hate towards liberalism, consider the methods of liberals, and then consider what they claimed their method was. What you'll see all too often is that they claim they're doing something out of the goodness of their heart, when in reality they're striving for a political victory, the charity simply a tool to get support from people with a conscience, since good people are more likely to be tricked into never fighting for themselves than bad people. And when you've swindled someone into not fighting for themselves and fighting for a group's idea, they're a small step away from giving up fighting for the people they love and their own values as well.

       We should put in place some kind of tag e.g. [NP] for non political. Then we could just filter based off of it.

       I think that's a good idea, but maybe just [politics] and [non-political] to keep it simple? That would be great actually. Sometimes I am interested and want to catch up, other times I just don't even want to look at the shit.

       I think the issue people are having is that they feel this used to be much more of a place for "out there" conspiracy theories like aliens and weird shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the political stuff should be stopped cause they fit the conspiracy bill, but I do like the idea of tagging so you can filter if you don't want to see one or the other.

       It used to be conspiracy about "something bad is happening", with no clear motives from the poster, except maybe "the government can't keep hiding the truth".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's mostly "Political group A is bad, and here are unsubstantiated(bullshit) reason why they are bad." by a poster clearly from another political party, who doesn't like group A.
       <br/>
       And also, people took some issues, like, let's say pedophilia, and started defending it, because, politically, some of "their people" look bad when that information comes out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big difference is that there is a clear motive that the conspiracies are not about finding obscure truths, like it used to be, but is now just political shit slinging, for the purpose of slinging shit.

       The problem is that td kind of died and so an exodus of trump supporters came in

       Wich meant it got on shareblues radar
      </p>
      <p>
       So then a wave of shareblue came in (you know theyre shareblue Because they disparage everything as a  "conspiracy theory")
      </p>
      <p>
       Now its trump supporters fighting shareblue with a mix of some legitimate people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i think the mods sided with shareblue and purged trump supporters from the mod team

       Yeah, but, not more than needed, be as inactive

       Was negotiating at a car dealership this weekend and had my son with me.  After the salesman trying to snow me by just presenting what the loan payments would look like and nothing else on the sale price.  I told him pretend you are in school and you need to "show your work."  My 16 year old son leaned over and said "you do know you are being kind of a dick." Definitely a proud father moment.  Yes son, I was being a dick.

       I completely disagree. The SS rule has absolutely help cut down on the shit posting when browsing the New category. And no stricter on deleting anything, racist or not. If something is racist, then let the shittiness of it be determined by the community. No censorship.

       100% agree there‚Äôs way to much of that going on in here. The neo Nazis seem to feel pretty welcome here and I‚Äôm astounded by how well there sickening comments are received. I agree Israel is a pretty bad apple but thst doesn‚Äôt reflect on Jews. Nationality and religion are completely separate imo.

       I think you have to word the post so that one of the political botnets would pick it up and upvote it. We need to try to game the system they gave us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you get a decent post to the front page, the discussion will be diverted with shitty jokes and people bitching about Trump, Clinton, Communism, capitalism, etc. In this thread, the top discussion is about some salesman that has nothing to do with conspiracies. We shouldn't accept that.

       It was the lead up to the 2016election.

      <p>
       It went the way of
       <em>
        reports of people conspiring

       over larger theories of supernatural stuff.

       It is nice because it's less quackery and more proven stuff (Saudi involvement in 9/11) but if would be nice to see some crazy Bigfoot stuff every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       That stuff is fun because it allows you to kind of analyze people's neurotic fears.

       My point was if you want to see and engage in good topics, then submit them to the sub,
       <em>
        be the change you want to be

       and all that.

       I submit content to this sub fairly regularly and don't see a reason to keep a reddit account for longer than a few months because I don't mod an subreddit, if the government are going to spy on me then I am not going to make it easy for them to keep track of me.

       No the narrative is stop pushing your partisan bullshit. Compare conspiracy to 2 years ago when it was about UFO‚Äôs, etc. to what it is now ‚ÄúHillary Clinton eats children in pizza parlors ZOMG!!!‚Äù and it‚Äôs pretty fucking obvious what happened. Funny how it‚Äôs never conspiracies on the right only the left.

       During the primary elections. A lot of people were calling foul of both races. The media seemed stacked against Trump and the DNC seemed to have rigged the race against Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the crackdowns started happening. The Sanders subreddit was shut down and the politics subreddit was taken over by a pro-Hillary super PAC. Meanwhile Trump's sub basically became a fan club where no one could question his proposed policies.  You could get banned from both the Trump and Politics subreddits if you didn't push the party line.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then this place became the place for debate and political conspiracy.

       I dislike the over-politicization of all parts of Reddit as much as the next guy, and I've seen scores of my favorite subreddits turn into little more than battlegrounds for shills on opposing sides, but I would caution you against holding up the Boston bombing as Reddit's crowing achievement. In fact much of the vile behavior that has begun to push me away from reddit these days had already begun to surface during that incident. 
The day of the bombing the front page was riddled with images of random attendees of the marathon, searching desperately for somewhere to place blame. The hive mind selected a target, a vaguely ethnic young man who had disappeared a a few days before the attack. So reddit doxed his family, sending death threats and hate filled sentiment. 
This witch hunt pushed the FBI to release information extremely early in the investigation, in an attempt to stave off the misplaced attacks, which threatened the real bombers, who were closely watching the news seeking information. They ended up fleeing their chosen hiding spot, and killing a college security officer in the process. 
The innocent man that Reddit had placed blame on during the investigation was discovered some time later, having committed suicide. Reddit's only real contribution was to send disgusting, unwarranted hate to a now grieving family. 
Curiosity, and a desire to uncover the truth is a natural human instinct. I support everybody's right to try to further their understanding, even if that means seeking unorthodox viewpoints and opinions. That being said, merely possessing this curiosity doesn't make anybody on this sub or this website a qualified investigator, or expert in deduction. The Boston bombing is more akin to pizzagate than to Reddit's Reichenbach fall.
Sorry about formatting, on mobile.

       "wrongthink" and "racism"? Uncensorednews had Nazi symbols as flairs for mods as well as on the sub banner. That's full blown racism, don't pretend it was some sort of misrepresented dream land, it was a place for neo Nazis to hangout and talk about minorities.

       That's not free speech, that's an example of a business discriminating against a group of people. Same reason why if I run over a kid with my car it's not protected by my right to free speech, I may have been expressing an opinion on road safety, but I still broke the laws we have in place to protect people.

       I wouldn't know where to start! The 'mental health crisis', big pharma, government mind control, brexit, the food industry, windmills, secret bases, our existence in the universe.

       I kinda just assumed people ran out of the "normal" conspiracies aliens/moon landong/JFK/flat earth etc so started grabbing at more obscure ones, that just kinda tumbles into it being political ones because there's always lies and hidden facts in politics.

       I find that not necessarily a bad thing. There aren‚Äôt new conspiracy discoveries every single day.

       Reminds me of how Alex Jones went from small time, serious discourse, to full time talk show host with many hours to fill with content and all of a sudden EVERYTHING became a conspiracy. Thus became a laughing stock.

       There are still just as much non-political conspiracy subject matter as before, its just also joined with political topics that have dominated everyone's lives since the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally, political discussions die out after a few months after election, but this was no normal election.

       There is a ton of conspiracy material to work with in politics but the discussions seem to get sidetracked either by design or mistake.

       It happened right before Trump got elected. Around the time reddit was getting over run with all kinds of shills. They started running over this sub too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now every time a conspiracy is mentioned. You will quickly get downvoted, and made fun of for not believing the official story. Conspiracy theroizing is heavily suppressed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have found better conspiracy subs, with more intelligent people, and basically consider this sub dead. Until they make propaganda illegal again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't wanna say names, but if you look when a certain president made it legal to use propaganda on it's people. You will see a strong coronation with when the site started to get overrun.

       Politics is, has, and will ever be where the conspiracies exist. Seriously, when has politics not been involved and what are you asking for? Sasquatch is not a conspiracy unless you think a group knows of and is hiding it's existence. I see posters about this ALL the time but I've been riding the theorist train on the internet since implementation and politics has always been the focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Conspiracy" is when a group of people do shady shit in secret. Happens all the time, especially in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Esoteric" refers to hidden knowledge and while we are more likely to have and be open to esoteric themed items here doesn't mean that we should exclude commonly percieved reality from the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what you are percieving is that many of the posters who focus on the unexplained or esoteric have realized there is enough interest in the subjects to split off and start their own sub communities.

       So a few years ago I wanted to do something about it. I saw the decline in progress, and I wanted to take steps to make it better.  But long story short I ran into strong opposition among the other mods and ended up giving up my mod position instead. I loved this sub. Now I barely ever come here. It‚Äôs sad really. Something that I loved so much is now a shell it‚Äôs former self.

       The conspiracies in politics are the only real conspiracies, and are some of the most important one's in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that people disagree, I understand that people would like the simple conspiracies only, but that is why this place has been taken over.  Filled with garbage postings and constantly being fed posts, even such as this one that call it out only as another politics post.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the heart of things, conspiracies like 9/11 and OKC, JFK and the like have always been political at heart.  Once this understanding is arrived at, I don't think many people can go back to anything else.  They will always land at a political ending.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you think back to the trump campaign and shilary pusing out bernie and Donna Brazile messing around with the process, pizzagate coming out, there is not very much else that you need to understand why this place, and reddit in general, has been turned on its nose and used more to fuck with people.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the legalization of propaganda, don't pretend this isn't a concerted effort to keep you ignorant and misinformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, consider this not as a bad thing.  I'm almost glad that things here can get so shitty in one sense that people see how bizarre things are so that they can arrive at a quicker understanding that the tool that is reddit is exactly that...a tool to use on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sooner this place goes the way of digg.com, the better off we will all be.  The conversations will continue and another site will come up and we will be able to talk again always.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the fight never ends, they will always seek you out and your conspiracy chats and basically, like Cass Sunstein said, should be infiltrated and manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an effort to make you shy away from this place, and if you do, just make sure you do it for the right reasons, not because you've lost all hope and don't want to participate anymore.  Do it because this place is garbage and they want to corrupt the conversation.  Bring your A game to any place you can in the mean time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's up to all of us, not on whether r/conspiracy lives as this beacon of whatever.  Everything has its golden years and maybe this one's time has come.

       Report each and every post that doesn't comply with sub rules.  If you think mods aren't enforcing rules, you should make a post to bring that to the attention of the rest of us.  There are a lot of political conspiracy theories going around right now tho.  You might find RES helpful in blocking words in post titles you might want to avoid (like "Trump" or "Clinton").  With RES, you can also keep up with how much you've downvoted a particular user by color coding.  The color gets a darker red with each downvote you give them.  When I get a user I have downvoted several times, I check their post history.  If it looks like they continually post stuff I don't want to see, I use RES to ignore all future posts and comments from that user.  I find it works well to help curate the sub into more of what you want to see... and less of what you don't.

       It became that way when people like Steve Bannon, Assange, Roger Stone, Alex Jones and foreign intelligence agencies all had an extremely large presence in the election. This is 100% why I say that QAnon is one of those people listed above. And is why conspiracy's have been hijacked by politics. They
       <em>
        wanted
       </em>
       conspiracy's to be a major part of the narrative to distract, blame, attach negativity, etc... That way, no one knew where the fiction began or ended. Foreign intelligence services had a goldmine laid in their laps to sow discord within the American population because of all of this too. I see people in here with massive agenda's daily. My problem is; who am I to say they aren't just some guy who believes what he says or someone trying to give me a line of BS I will run with to everyone else to cause confusion? It sucks how it has ruined the landscape of the internet

       To be honest, most conspiracies are based on politics or at least have something to do with people associated with politics.

       Can't blame anyone.

       Agreed. It's not that the Trump/Hillary stuff isn't interesting, it is, but there are other subs dedicated to that. I laugh at the political posters getting butt hurt if not everyone aligns with them politically, calling this sub in general pro-government or pro-Clinton. As if people interested in conspiracy theories are all supporters of one US political party...a lot of people in here probably don't even hold a vote in the US like myself.

       Putin helping Trump get elected with the ultimate aim of repealing sanctions for his fellow oligarchs, if true, would be THE conspiracy of our time. Dismissing it as ho-hum political stuff says more about you than this sub. And before you tell me that since it's not yet 100% established fact therefore it's silly to keep bringing up... Seth rich, pizza gate, big foot, ufos are all fueled by not 100% confirmed fact aswell. Got a problem with those? If not why not
      </p>

       On a related note, why are people so incredulous when it comes to Trump but then will tell you breathlessly that Jews did 9/11, 9/12, 9/13 ad infinitum,while citing physics demonstrations published by the Race War Now Institute?

       Half the country thinks that the Russian government conspired with the sitting president to steal Democratic emails and selectively leak them to help his campaign in exchange for favorable policy treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other half thinks there's a "deep state" shadow government of unelected bureaucrats abusing their power to hamstring the president and make it look like he committed crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whichever theory you believe in, they're both truly massive conspiracies with consequences that will be talked about for decades to come. And at least one of them must be true.

       Because the lie of Donald Trump is the biggest conspiracy going on right now. Donald Trump, aided and abetted by Russian trolls and bot farms/Alex Jones/Infowars/Breitbart/right wing racism and bigotry has convinced hundreds of thousands of people that whatever Trump does is a constant 5D Parcheesi spin on actual reality, which is a conspiracy on a grand scale, the likes of which we have never seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have hijacked our movement for truth and those we used to turn to for information (Infowars, as an example) have sold us out, ceased to attack the old corrupt establishment and become machines of racism, bigotry and misinformation for the new corrupt establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a real world emergency. Not to shit on people‚Äôs views and their enjoyment of conspiracy conjecture, but this is way more important than Moon Landing theories, more important than 9/11 discussion, not that 9/11 will ever be not important but priority dictates that we discuss current threats over past crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump and all those who put him where he is tapped into the genuine concern of the ‚Äútruth movement‚Äù, hijacked their thinking and programmed them to be fascists without them ever realizing it. I would assume they have the same ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on the path of the righteous‚Äù thinking that ordinary German‚Äôs were tricked into in 1930‚Äôs Germany. I would also assume that Nixon had his hardcore contingent of followers who refused to see him for what he was, a crook.
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire Donald Trump saga looks and smells like fascism pretending to be a truth movement and it absolutely is.

       There's this alternative universe that reveals itself once you escape from Plato's liberal echoey cave. But don't go back to the cave once you've seen the outside, or the liberals will dox your parents and send you death threats once you tell them that the world outside of the social media mob isn't real.

       Pritzker spent $63 million for the Democrat primary. Bruce Rauner has spent ~58million so far as incumbent. If they pooled that money together they've already spent enough to take everyone in Illinois out to Bennigans. The crazy part is this is largely coming out of the candidates pockets on both sides.
