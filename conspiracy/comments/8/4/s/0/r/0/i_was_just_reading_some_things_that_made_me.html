       I'm asking because I was just reading an askreddit thread where people are talking about child beauty pageants, and those saying they are wrong or weird are being down voted. and people getting up voted for saying that they are just like sports, or that the children want to do them. I found it disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I forgot the whole reason I'm posting to this sub, why do you think this is happening? The normalizing. I've noticed it for a while but I don't know why it is happening or who would gain from it.

       Funny how you’re so hung up on not normalizing pedophilia, but you openly bragged about losing your virginity in front of two other people...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now unless all four of you were over 18, it seems some people might consider THAT a form of pedophilia.  So you gonna get off your high horse yet?

       I don't think you know what that word means, if it's a bunch of teenagers of similar age, and no adults, please explain how that is a form of pedophilia? that's just teenagers having sex which is normal.. And thinking pedophilia is wrong is being on a high horse now? wow things are worse than I thought. Thanks for proving my point.

       No one proved your half-ass bullshit point, and legally, yes, some states consider what you did pedophilia.  Do I have to spell it out to you or does your dumb-ass-backwoods-redneck even remotely understand what pedophilia is?   Child beauty pageants aren’t pedophilia.  Again, you need to do your research and stop watching tv shows that sensationalize the glamour pageants-which are different than most child pageants.   Maybe if you got off reddit long enough to learn something you would understand the difference AND know how to make a valid point.
       <br/>
       And for fucks sake-learn how to write a semi-literate paragraph with appropriate capitalization and punctuation.
       <br/>
       Actually, you know what?  You can’t form a decent cohesive sentence so why on earth am I wasting my time asking you to form an EDUCATED opinion?

       It is strange that my post about pedophilia made you so angry, I wonder why? teenagers have sex with each other, you go ahead and tell yourself that that somehow makes me a pervert. you're right about my writing skills, I've actually done a lot with my life and some of those things caused a few traumatic brain injuries that cause me to forget things sometimes. It's funny, I'm sure you wrote that from your mom's basement. I can't tell you why you're talking to me, I'd rather you didn't. Like I said it's very telling that you are so upset over this subject.

       Is this a thing? like are those produced? I really don't want to google it. Even if it was legal why would a company make them? It also bothers me that things like this aren't bigger news.

       In the 2000’s the conservatives argued legalizing gay marriage would be a slippery slope. Well, they weren’t wrong. Also if polygamy is one day legalized, it’s pretty much Game over for that society, it’s historically been proven you deny young men access to women they become highly violent and destructive. A CEO has 12 wives that’s 11 men-half a small classroom-  without hope of any type of marriage unless it’s gay. Instead of going gay, they become extremely agitated and restless.

       Actually, I expect that polygamy will be pushed on the lower classes. By increaing household population density, there will be more disposable income for the wealthy to extract. To date, they rich have dramatically reduced the middle class by targeting wages, savings, corporate competition, and pensions. This is the next logical progression.

       Kids "want" to do this because of a diseased society and diseased parents who worship beauty over the mind and spirit.  They worship the material...tangible.  Fulfillment is primarily intangible.  Oh well.

       I wouldn’t say the 17 year old boy/adult man relationship in Call Me By Your Name is pedophilia, but it is definitely an attempt to normalize whatever that type of relationship would be called, so it’s a small step in that direction.

       Why just lately? Have you ever studied?

       Literally, pedophilia is as old as recorded history. From ancient Greece, the Old Testament, Mohammad's wife, save trade across all continents, even in ancient cultures like Aboriginal Australians where young girls were married to elders.

       Yes I know, it has always been a thing. I just meant that lately is when I noticed people defending it so much, I'm sure part of that is my being oblivious, and part of it is the anonymity of the internet. just in my experience it seems that there is a recent push to make it look okay, but I could absolutely be wrong.

       I think all the incest shit you see on pornsites is a sort of normalization.
Once you understand a lot of times pedophiles fuck their own children, it makes that stuff seem more sinister.

       It is strange that my post about pedophilia made you so angry, I wonder why? teenagers have sex with each other, you go ahead and tell yourself that that somehow makes me a pervert. you're right about my writing skills, I've actually done a lot with my life and some of those things caused a few traumatic brain injuries that cause me to forget things sometimes. It's funny, I'm sure you wrote that from your mom's basement. I can't tell you why you're talking to me, I'd rather you didn't. Like I said it's very telling that you are so upset over this subject.
