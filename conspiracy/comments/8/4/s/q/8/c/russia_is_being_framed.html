<p>What if some group within Russia that is not affiliated with Putin is carrying out the cyber attacks and USA election meddling and shit in an attempt to get Putin into enough hot water that other world powers pressure him out of office and lead to some kind of pseudo Russian revolution? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel theres two possibilities:
1. Russia is being framed as a flase flag and they really didnt do it.</p>

<p>2: they did do it and it was a waening to other countries that not only are we nuclear where also chemical. </p>

<p>Its a scary situation either way. I also feel that Putins declaratiin to go to the moon is a way for him to gwt us to out more money amd resources into another project while he focuses on gaining more territory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia&#39;s goal is to incite chaos and uncertainty. This type of infighting is exactly what they want. Don&#39;t forget that Putin worked for the KGB.  This kind of mental power play is directly out if their playbook and Putin knows it well.</p>

<p>Putin is using MAD to his advantage - Even if every country were to join together and enact a world embargo against Russia, they can just go North Korea and beg for supplies with their finger on the button.  But he knows the West will fold much quicker than that. The annexation of Ukraine proved that. Now he&#39;s brazenly giving the world the finger because he knows he&#39;s untouchable.</p>

<p>This is Russia were talking about. Psyops is their thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell me... if Russia was so afraid of this guy that they concocted an elaborate scheme to murder him with an easily identifiable nerve agent... why did they let him out of prison? Why did they let him move to the UK as part of a &quot;spy swap&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In December 2004, he was arrested by Russia&#39;s Federal Security Service (FSB) and later tried, convicted of high treason, and imprisoned. He settled in the UK in 2010 following the Illegals Program spy swap.</p>

<p>This story is utter bullshit. They guy would never have made it out of prison alive if the Russians really feared him enough to do what they are accused of doing.</p>

<p>But his death sure has helped sell the anti-Russian agenda.</p>

<p>Qui Bono?</p>

<p>How in the world can you come to this conclusion? It is really mind-boggling.</p>

<p>Who has instigated the wars and conflicts against Russia? Was it Russia or NATO/US?</p>

<p><em>We</em> certainly don&#39;t want war, but the international bankers and the US MIC sure do. That, and Russia is directly in the way of completely burning the M.E to the ground, and they can&#39;t have that. It was thanks to Russia and Iran intervening that they lost the chance to topple Assad. </p>

<p>Using an &quot;obvious&quot; (not even obvious, since any equipped lab can make small amounts of Novichuk) neurotoxin is like Assad using &quot;sarin&quot; gas at a time he was actively winning against the jihadist rebels. <em>It doesn&#39;t make any sense.</em> The only people who benefit from such an action are the Western powers. Russia gains <em>absolutely nothing,</em> and it is piss poor logic that you think they would do this to &quot;send a message&quot; when doing so would cross a red line, guarantee more sanctions, and increase tensions (so they would be losing out on millions potentially). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok let&#39;s examine the claim. A nation state conducted a chemical attack on another Nation state and killed a citizen, a double agent spy. This is a huge accusation, stating it was a Russian nerve agent does not translate to it being a sanctioned attack from the Russian government. Western intelligence has been after Russia, both the UK and US. Many claims they have made have been debunked. It isn;t about believing Putin or UK intelligence. It&#39;s about knowing how they came to the conclusion that it was a state sanctioned attack. If the method of the attack is the only evidence to the claim, then I find that evidence severely lacking considering the magnitude of the claim being presented.</p>

<p>So we have a chemical weapons facility situated in Sailsbury that is know to have used nerve agents in Sailsbury perviously, and what are  we doing?

    <div class="md"><p>That is piss poor logic.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor is a thought experiment. It is completely useless when you factor in the human element and geopolitics.</p>

<p>These groups immediately convicted Russia with no evidence, and are actively bypassing international bodies that are in place to investigate shit like this. That&#39;s why Russia said &quot;give us a damn sample.&quot;</p>

<p>False flags have been used extensively (Operation Gladio) to push agendas and wars. Russia has been fighting back against NATO aggression and have been trying to lessen sanctions, but we are led to believe they risked millions of dollars to murder an old man and his daughter with a neuro toxin to &quot;send a message.&quot;</p>

<p>That kind of reasoning is akin to a 5 year old&#39;s which completely ignores history and the current geopolitical situation. &quot;Russia bad. Britain good. NATO good.&quot; It also closely resembles the MO of the  &quot;sarin&quot; gas attacks. Assad, who was winning the war, did the <em>only thing</em> which would guarantee his downfall, and gassed <em>non-vital military targets</em>, literally random civilians.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even have to give it to Russia. They can have the OPCW come in and take samples.</p>

<p>More piss poor logic. &quot;They&#39;ve done it before so therefore it&#39;s Russia!&quot; Which ignores the geopolitical climate and the last 20 years of history.</p>

<p>Considering Russia is NATO&#39;s primary threat, enacting sanctions that would cripple Russia&#39;s economy would prevent them from keeping the peace in, say, Syria. </p>

<p>The Russian government has deployed thousands of armored vehicles and troops into Ukraine to support separatist rebels in the war-torn country&#39;s eastern region, <strong>Ukraine&#39;s top defense official says, despite *repeated assertions from Moscow of minimal military involvement there</strong>*.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read it? You are right that Russia has denied large scale deployment of troops, because:  separatist leader in 2014 dismissed reports of Russian soldiers operating there in 2014 as simply off-duty troops on vacation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed I did. You said </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;for anyone doubting, that is actually what Russia says is happening: &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the article said the opposite. I mean, I could copy-paste the entire article if that makes you happy, but I figured simply pulling the relevant quotes would be adequate.</p>

<p>And yes, there are Russians fighting. But AFAIK they aren&#39;t state-sponsored, as you imply. Their defending their brothers, sisters, families from US/EU-backed foreign invaders, many of them non-Ukrainian mercenaries.</p>

<p>You are aware that up until the &#39;90s, Russia and (formerly-called) <strong>The</strong> Ukraine were in the same country -- the USSR, yes? Lots of Russian-speaking folks live in formerly east Ukraine, but declared independence after the anti-Russian coup in Kiev took place. And Kiev won&#39;t let them go, because this area has most of Ukraine&#39;s natural resources</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes by seperatosts who are against the illegal goverment of ukraine.</p>

<p>If your country was taken over illegaly against your conatitution. Would you follow the new goverment or fight.</p>

<p>Plus do you know anything about the conflict?</p>

<p>Eastern ukraine is rich in minerals. It sends all its money to kiev who then makes decisions with the money. The seperatists wanted to have the ability to govern their finances like we have provinces in canada. </p>

<p>But ukraine wouldn&#39;t allow that because they make lots of money and kiev wants it all and they sont share.</p>

<p>Easter ukraine are ukraniane patriots against a illegal goverment. That same illegal goverment shoots artillery at them... killing women and children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why Novichok nerve agents would be used, regardless of who used them, is pretty simple.  We don&#39;t know what the components are and we don&#39;t know the delivery method.  That makes it easier to move around.  We also know that a very small dose was used since the targets survived, and the agent is supposed to be extremely potent.  Those things together imply that something very small was used in an attempt to kill these two.  We can also assume that the attack was either not done professionally, or failed in some way.</p>

<p>It is unusual that someone would expose their country to protect their own identity.  That being the case, I&#39;d agree that this probably wasn&#39;t sanctioned by Russia.  The only options that point to Russia are a direct attempt to antagonize, an attempt to confuse, or the assassin is an important spy whose identity is more valuable than implicating Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean that&#39;s kinda out there to compare taking over land for strategic/romantic purposes, versus killing a spy for literally no reason. I mean one is worth the risk the other is just silly.</p>

<p>Also the job was freaking messy, why use an easily traceable chemical if they could&#39;ve just used a bullet. Someone&#39;s trying to frame someone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure this sort of behaviour only makes most Russians support Putin even more, and Putin knows this. Even when he isn&#39;t responsible for the things he is accused of he doesn&#39;t deny the accusations, because having this air of mystery, this persona of being in control of world events makes him look very strong. Putin is first and foremost a master of manipulating his own public image.</p>
