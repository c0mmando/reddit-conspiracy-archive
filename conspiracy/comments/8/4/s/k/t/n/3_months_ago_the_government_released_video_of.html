<p>Also, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/most-people-believe-intelligent-aliens-exist-377965">polls show</a> that a majority of people believe that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists. The media loves to make common behaviors and beliefs appear to be fringe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well believing theoretically that alien life exists and believing that UFOs have visited earth are different. </p>

<p>But to draw the conclusion that most people in the world believe in UFOs because in one survey of 1000 people just over half said they believe in intelligent alien life....seems like a long bow to draw. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Blue Beam psyops absolutely will be the meat grinder for thousands of people in my prediction. You think Blue Beam will be just flying saucers and holograms and smoke and mirrors? They would need to put the fear of God into the populace, or it would worthless for them, which means killing many people in terrible ways (incinerating? vaporizing?). When have they (TPTB) ever shied away from killing? It could also double as a mass sacrifice for their occult purposes and be lots of fun for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because People dont care as much as yall thought they would. The only thing that would actually rock the world in any meaningful way would be a contact of the third kind (Face to [insert equivilance of face] meeting)</p>

<p>Then it would be in the news for a week until President Shitforbrains said some weird shit again.</p>

<p>also to nitpick, it wasnt the government that released the video. It was a Private Group with commercial interest. They sit on that one video cut it up and release 10 seconds here, 30 seconds there. While claiming at the same time that they will &quot;Totally&quot; be able to reverse engineer thee Alien technology...if they just had enough money. </p>

<p>I personally dont think they are very genuine. Considering that if you knew enough about the technology, you wouldnt need alot of money to create a proof of concept. </p>

<p>The only counter I&#39;ve heard that makes semi sense is that they are taking people and we can&#39;t do anything about it so it might cause panic.</p>

<p>But for example what about shark attacks? People still go swimming in the ocean with no fucks. I could come up with a list of similar examples.</p>

<p>All of it leads me to believe all of the UFO&#39;s are made by humans. Whether a break away civilization or advanced military programs for me is up to debate.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people aren&#39;t nearly as moved by the amazing, miraculous, and world-shaking as we might think they are. There&#39;s a hundred mind-bending facts most of us take for granted on any given day.</p>

<p>We are all made of the integral fabrics of the universe, forged in the heart of stars. A billion years of cosmological, planetary, and biological evolution - with untold deaths of stars and lifeforms - eventually lead to our existence. We&#39;re gestalt lifeforms consisting of innumerable infinitesimal cells working dependently to create a perceived singular &quot;I&quot;. The mathematical odds of any one individual of us coming into existence ranks up their in sheer numbers with the trillions of stars composing the hundreds of billion of galaxies that we can observe. The list goes on and on and on, and that&#39;s just the <strong>readily proven and accepted</strong> stuff.</p>

<p>People believe the cosmos was created as a test for them and that infinite pleasures - and infinite pains - await them depending on their actions in the nonsense interval between eternity. People believe acts of will and desire reshape the literal form of the cosmos they inhabit; that deeds in this cycle impact themselves and others for trillions of years and rebirths to come. Angels and demons and spirits of every fabric are believed to spy down on us to protect, beguile, and confound us.</p>

<p>By all rights we should be on our knees in endless ecstatic awe; but at the end of the day you&#39;ve got most of us chortling at the rerun of &quot;that show what we like&quot; or engrossed in the hijinks of A-to-Z grade celebrities.</p>

<p>Unless the footage shows entities out to fuck shit up for people - and on a very personal level at that, none of this &quot;over in Whogivesashitistan, people died&quot;-crap - UFO are going to get thrown on the pile, absorbed into the general experience of life, and functionally forgotten about. </p>
