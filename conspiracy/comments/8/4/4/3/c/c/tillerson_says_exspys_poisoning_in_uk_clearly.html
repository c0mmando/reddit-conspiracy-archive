       Not sure it's a defense of Tillerson as much as it's a healthy skepticism of Trump and his reasoning. Don't forget, these people work for Americans. We deserve to understand why the president fired the SoS over Twitter, mere months after saying it was "fake news" that he would fire Tillerson.

       And I highly doubt this is the case..I think the CIA is about to get alot of people transferred to State Dept. And I think they're going to really start stirring shit up wherever they can.

       Yes - it's a very troubling appointment. Given the number of intelligence officers running in primaries across the countries, it's clear the MIC and intelligence apparatus has decided to take more ground while they still can. Tillerson was still awful.

       I can totally see this happening as word was Tillerson had not staffed the state department in the slightest, was described as a "ghost town" recently. Pretty fertile soil to fill with CIA alumni.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw Trump and Tillerson disagree on numerous issues at the same time ("let's take out Qatar cause Israel/The Saudis"/"we have bases in Qatar, they're our ally" is one example). Never on the same page. I wonder if that's ultimately a good thing, as Tillerson always seemed to take the more nuanced positions.

       Yeah, this combined with the State Dept hiring freeze is very troubling. Believe me, it's exactly what I was thinking about when I wrote the comment.

       I'll be watching for the MSM reaction to new State Dept. hirings. You can bet Afghanistan/Iraq/Lebanon/Egypt are going to be at the top of the list when it happens...I'm betting they're about to get a shit ton of new "State Dept" employees...oh and half of Africa too.

       I'm pretty worried about Africa tbh. You see that leaked "training game" scenario about war expansion into West Africa? Was featured in an Intercept article a few months back.

       Not that the state dept. hasn't always been a chasm of deep state fuckery, though.

       Man - the downvotes here. I feel like I'm in the fucking Twilight Zone. Tillerson was a total piece of shit and we still have zero evidence that this poisoning was anything more than spycraft to point the finger yet again at Russia. Sigh. I can't believe I've been reduced to defending Trump - lol.

       Agreed. I'm sure you've seen the report on how many people we have running for congress with intelligence backgrounds. I can only imagine that's a concerted effort to go all in on cold war propaganda. If they have a larger voice in Congress, we might get a full declaration of war. There's no telling what the end goal is.

       When the Fake Left Deep State launched this Russian collusion gaslight psyop it seemed pretty apparent this investigation was fishing expedition born out of the bitter emotion of unexpected defeat more than any shred of evidence of "collusion".

       The investigation is a conspiracy.

       The American Empire wants to rule the world - full spectrum dominance in their words. Russia (and China) won't let them. That makes Russia and China the "enemy". It has been this way for over one hundred years. You need to read this for a more in depth answer.

       The most recent sanctions where passed by both parties. Yet Trump won't implement them.

       Russia has never been a real partner. They hold fake elections and kill or jail anyone who doesn't agree with Putin.

       That's why the US has sanctions against them to begin with...

       I'm kinda iffy on that argument. Not enforcing the sanctions makes sense if he has a genuine belief that they're misguided.

       Funny how every other president has found a nice middle ground between kissing the ass of dictator and starting world war 3 .... maybe hiring the guy with no experience in anything political was a dumb ass move

       I am not a defender of Trump, I think very little of him but that does not mean I will join the chorus of partisan howler monkeys parroting every sick theory and weak psy-op to promote the opposition as virtuous.

       The fact that you characterize anything happening currently as "kissing the ass of a dictator" just demonstrates your subjective partisanship myopia.

       Well I've not been jumping to conclusions based solely off of the opinion of MSM so you could say I've already been leading for a while. Stop forming your opinions based off of what you see on TV and from mainstream sources, question the mainstream narrative, cross-reference it with multiple sources until you have only facts and no bias and then realize that you still probably don't have all the facts straight, but at least you did the diligence to inform yourself and are enabling yourself to be able recognize when others are hopping on another bandwagon.

       I said nothing of your sources, so you are jumping to conclusions in this case. I also never said you were jumping to conclusion. When I said "Stop forming your opinions..." I was speaking about how I operate and how I would suggest anyone operate, not how you explicitly operate.

       You asked about leading by example, the example I would lead by is - Stop forming your opinions based off of what you see on TV and from mainstream sources, question the mainstream narrative, cross-reference it with multiple sources until you have only facts and no bias and then realize that you still probably don't have all the facts straight, but at least you did the diligence to inform yourself and are enabling yourself to be able recognize when others are hopping on another bandwagon.

       Obama never set tone of hysterical victimhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       That only came after Hillary's surprise defeat and Podesta's need to make his emails disappear.

       A leader complementing another leader - scandalous!

       Putin is an effective leader who has brought his country up from utter ruin. That is just fact like him or not.

       Trump has yet to say a bad word about Putin not one single bad word, no one would give a shit about the tone at this stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note most of my links are before the email scandel so unless you believe on top of the child pornography ring she now has a time machine. Also shes not the president please hop off her dick and let her fade away into retirment

       Should Trump talk shit just to Russia so Americans can feel good? 
What is the point of that?

      <p>
       I never said shit about a "child pornography ring".
I mentioned John Podesta's creepy coded emails.
Conflating that with something else is all you.

       Don't even talk about Syria. 
The USA and Israel support Al Qaeda and ISIS proxy armies while Russia is there at the invitation of the government trying to drive out the terrorist proxy armies.

       I'm sure it isn't easy to become the president of Russia when you aren't hand-picked by the CIA and CFR the way Boris Yeltsin was.

       They don't go for the post-modernist PC shit in Russia so I'm sure to a progressive American snowflake the "toxic masculinity" is too much to take.

American virtue signalling about gay rights in Russia are a selective group with their energy and outrage.

       Canadians would not believe some of the shit their government has done. Luckily the Canadian media is more worried about promoting American/Canadian propaganda than it is about holding governments to account for anything but petty partisan dramas.

       The alleged "concentration camps for gays" would be appalling if not a planted piece of vilification propaganda.
See what non-western controlled news sources are reporting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, do you think Russian culture embraces gays once that mean ogre Putin is gone? 
All societies change and grow but the Russians ain't us and why the hell should they be?

       If you do not see how the corporate media steers narratives and drives emotions to further goals and steer public opinion then I think you might be a brigade tourist in this sub.
It is a societal issue that our disingenuous media has lain at the feet of Putin.
 The Russian people support this sort of crap.

Then unless you are in a country proximate to Russia ask yourself why you are constantly fed negative stories about a country that will not affect your life in anyway unless you are looking for natural resources, pipelines or trying to balkanize Syria?

        Lack of good stories about Putin
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I said good stories about Russia not Putin. 
Despite the Western Media mission to vilify at all costs Russia is a big country and not all Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't see positive stories because they do not fit the mandated narrative of creating a cartoon villain for Western military industrial complexes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your view of Russia is lop-sided but that is no accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all of the world leaders Putin is definitely not a "nutter".
That's just being non-partisan objective.

Your question is neither potent nor legitimate and it makes you sound like a screeching pod person.

       There is no "try" the sanctions are political bullshit because Putin pushed back against a CIA colour revolution in Ukraine.

       It is petty American politics to punish those who resist predatory American MIC operations.

       Where, on twitter? The American media seems to be uniformly interested in giving voice exclusively to his detractors.

       Do you think the "Russian Troll" charges are the smoking gun that validates all of this hysteria?

Likely.

       I wouldn’t be surprised if this whole nerve agent thing is a play to control the narrative. Smart to wait for proof. Foolish to follow the instinctive reaction. This whole thing wreaks of geopolitical manipulation. Anyone with a few drops of this nerve agent could initiative this strategy of tension for any number of reasons. Plus, how retarded is it that RUS would use nerve agent capable of affectiNG UK public, with their signature, to kill one spy? Someone, including the majority of Reddit is getting played. Keep eyes open and keep thinking critical.

       Those are cute talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't hold much water though when you consider russia was already sanctioned for the crimea stuff ( that was a us provocation) and the newer round of sanctions was based on rushed, flawed intel that left anybody not falling for it openly stating that they have no actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is proven.  So, you either want them to prove it, like a sane, rational person.  Or you call for provoking a nuclear power with allegations we can't prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt tillerson ouster has anything to do with this.  It's known that russia has previously used poison to kill adversaries... nothing new here.

       Russia was sanctioned multiple times because they continue to do bad shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latest Russia sanctions passed 419-3 in the house and 98-2 in the senate last summer. Trump won't implement them because Russia has the goods on him.

       No, we didn't "hold them accountable for having WMDs," because holding them accountable would have involved them taking action against us first. Sorry bud, but your strawman doesn't hold up here.

       It's only obvious to you. Stop waving the United States flag. In an all out nuclear war everyone loses. That includes you. You clearly haven't seen the movie "War Games". The

       You don't seem to understand. It doesn't matter which army is better. In a nuclear war there won't be anyone around to celebrate. The whole of the human race will be dead. As in planet killer 101. This isn't World War II. This is World War
       <strong>
        III
       </strong>
       . A completely different situation. By the way, If the US military is so great then tell me, which "war" have they "won" - other than that little tiff in Grenada?

       You’re dreaming. You have to be some kind of special to think a nuclear war between the worlds top superpowers would leave a “winner”. The only “winners” will be underground.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, there’s been a witch hunt over Russia for last few years... why? Because they have always been used as the boogeyman for North America, on top of that the globalists wanted/want Syria, pipeline and oil is what they want, and Russia stood by Assad and Syria, so yes, let’s demonize him so that when we go into Syria and provoke Russia the American population won’t say a word because Russia bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if Trump knows this, and wants good relations between our countries, then he won’t allow tactless and factless accusations to just be made like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, read up on what happened last week with Russia and how Putin announced they have new and top of the line antiballistic missiles that destroy/intercept anything American, to which the pentagon replied “yea we knew about that” then the next day announced they are putting more of our tax dollars towards military improvement. To which Putin replied he’s not joining another arms race and will instead be building up their infrastructure etc. maybe just a show before the elections, but you need to realize one thing, no one wins in a nuclear war.

       Is that what you call your double standard? I think Ive got your logic figured out though, its more partisan rules dont apply nonsense

       Im just pointing out that Clinton has been cleared to a higher level (8 times) than Trump has once on this.

       I honestly didn't follow Benghazi that closely.  All I know is that they were apparently hoping for the whole thing to be seen as some kind of success for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't recall if they got into alleged weapons transfers to al qaeda, or hill dog lying about the reason for teh attack, and now that we've seen the slave trade open back up I don't think anybody could possibly claim what was done in Libya was either right, or smart.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's a totally different situation from Trump being accused of working with russia in order to beat hillary who anybody who knows anything knows was a terrible candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, put all other things aside for a second.  What would happen if Trump passed out and got chucked in a van like a side of beef on the campaign trail?  It would END.  BOOM, over, 100%.  Media would seize on that, and you would not hear anything other than "trump serious health issues, unfit for office!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The email scandal too... sure, they didn't charge her.  But it was made clear her and people around her committed felony level crimes regarding storing and transferring classified material.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could you give a person like that keys to the nukes?  Both were terrible options but the idea that Trump needed help to win is fucking retarded and people are retarded for falling into that trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary was a fucking time bomb and didn't need anybody's help losing.  Russiagate serves only to cover up for the DNC email debacle that proved they fucked over Bernie and undermined democracy.

       If Russia nerve gasses one of it's own or an undesirable from another country to send a message.  No person weilding political power has the right to say: "This will trigger a response".  Those are inflammatory words that should result in him being fired.

       I didn’t say she was declaring war, I said she was saber rattling. Her threatening Russia with an ultimatum despite having no conclusive evidence as to their participation fits that description.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t appreciate Trump threatening war with anyone, nor do I support his military parades as it is similar to saber rattling. That being said NoKo’s hostile actions can’t go without punishment, which is why I approve of heavy sanctions. One of the main differences is that we clearly know NoKo is testing ICBMs and nuclear bombs underground, and they admit to it and flaunt it. Still don’t see any solid evidence that the poisoning was a state-sponsored act of aggression from Russia, which is what makes May’s statements completely ridiculous.

       Ms. May's words there. I thought her statement was rational and level-headed. Everyone on the planet knows that none of the measures the UK will be considering will be militant. Sabre rattling has a specific definition and it involves the threat of military force. She didn't invoke military force and you and I know that neither she nor the house of commons has any intention of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UK is not sabre rattling in my opinion.

       A long time ago. I've been in this sub for 9+ years and in all that time there has always war hawks. The average IQ of people (including this sub) is between 90 and 100. The government knows, and counts on, this. So when the government (or their mouth piece the MSM) spews out lies and propaganda most of the people just go "Rah Rah" without wondering why.

       Yeah, you probably should include the relevant facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       First is the erroneous comparison to Litvinenko.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://truepublica.org.uk/united-kingdom/not-told-russian-spy-sergei-skripal/">
        http://truepublica.org.uk/united-kingdom/not-told-russian-spy-sergei-skripal/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is a major difference between Alexander Litvinenko and Sergei Skripal, which is not being reflected in the media. Litvinenko was a good man who attempted to expose abuses of power within Russia, in defence of the rights of Russians. Skripal is a traitor who sold the identities of Russian agents abroad to the UK, in exchange for hard cash. This may very well have caused the deaths of some of those Russian agents operating in conflict zones. If this is indeed a poisoning, there are a great many people who may want Mr Skripal dead – nor in this murky world should we overlook the fact that he must have known interesting things about his MI6 handlers. “Litvinenko II” is rather too pat and obvious, and could be a false flag set-up.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In addition, there was a British government chemical weapons research facility 8 miles from the scene of the crime:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nerve agents including Sarin and VX are manufactured by the British Government in Porton Down, just 8 miles from where Sergei Skripal was attacked. The official British government story is that these nerve agents are only manufactured “To help develop effective medical countermeasures and to test systems”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The UK media universally accepted that the production of polonium by Russia was conclusive evidence that Vladimir Putin was personally responsible for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. In the case of Skripal, po-faced articles like this hilarious one in the Guardian speculate about where the nerve agent could possibly have come from – while totally failing to mention the fact that incident took place only eight miles from the largest stock of nerve agent in western Europe.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Skripal was also pardoned by the Kremlin and was part of an exchange with the US. Why did Russia then decide to use an obviously Russian-originiating neurotoxin to murder a retired spy who they allowed to leave?
      </p>
      <p>
       This reeks just like the repeated Sarin gas attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Looks like the nerve agent  wasn't even exclusively Russian.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The existence of these chemical agents was disclosed in 1992. Russia joined the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction in 1997. It has since (unlike the U.S.) destroyed all left over stocks from the Soviet Union's chemical weapon program. It does not produce chemical weapons.
       </p>
       <p>
        These agents and their formulas are not an exclusively Russian knowledge or product:
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the key manufacturing sites was the Soviet State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology (GosNIIOKhT) in Nukus, Uzbekistan. Small, experimental batches of the weapons may have been tested on the nearby Ustyurt plateau. It may also have been tested in a research centre in Krasnoarmeysk near Moscow. Since its independence in 1991, Uzbekistan has been working with the government of the United States to dismantle and decontaminate the sites where the Novichok agents and other chemical weapons were tested and developed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The formulas for the various Novichok agents are not a Russian secret. The U.S. and the UK surely know how to make these. The agents are said to be made from simply components used in civil industrial processes. (To qualify any agent as "military grade" is by the way nonsense. Many chemical agents used in civil process are also incredibly deadly.) The Porton Down chemical weapon laboratory of the British military is only some 8 miles away from Salisbury where the Skripals were allegedly poisoned.  The British government claims that Porton Down identified the agent allegedly used on the Skripals. The laboratory is surely also capable of producing such stuff, just like similar laboratories in other countries are able to do.

       Yep. This looks like it is taken out of an Operation Gladio playbook. And like the sarin gas attacks in Syria where it is known the rebels have such munitions and they occur near rebel strongholds, the biggest chemical "research" lab in the UK is a few miles down.

       Nope Crimea was annexed after the CIA revolution threw the country into chaos.

       Look into the history of Crimea and what is located there.
Do you think any government would have allowed that to fall into the hands of the American sponsored neo-nazis?

       American soldiers are currently illegally occupying Syria in support of their Al Qaeda proxy army and Israel.

       You're defending the fact that Trump fired Tillerson very shortly after he made negative comments towards Russia.

       You are then claiming that behaviour that is extremely common for the Russian government should actually be attributed to the UK because reasons.

       You really think killing an Russian ex-spy would be good for the UK? Yeah... he would have no useful information for them at all.

       Boy, here comes the Crimea talking point yet again from useful idiots. Crimea VOTED to join Russia after Ukraine got absolutely fucked by the Western-backed revolutions, which included arming and training neo Nazi militias. I guess you just forgot that

       Yes, the US-backed coup in Kiev that led to violence and Nazis being put into government was good. The peaceful referendum in Crimea was bad. Got it. Orwellian.
      </p>
      <p>
       All people are told is how evil Putin is. Meanwhile the Kiev Nazis were slaughtering civilians and conducting ethnic cleansing. Nothing said about that. According the MSM it was all Putin's fault and the Ukraine army and pro-Kiev Nazi militias were heroes. It is sick. These Nazi fucks chased civilians into a building in Odessa and set them on fire. Those not killed by fire were shot dead.

       Their deaths were celebrated. Western media was blind again despite there being plenty of evidence and footage of the war crime.

      <p>
       Much of the rest of the known case against Russia comes from claims made by the Ukrainian regime, which emerged from the unconstitutional coup d’etat against elected President Viktor Yanukovych on Feb. 22. His overthrow followed months of mass protests, but the actual coup was spearheaded by neo-Nazi militias that overran government buildings and forced Yanukovych’s officials to flee.
      </p>
      <p>
       In recognition of the key role played by the neo-Nazis, who are ideological descendants of Ukrainian militias that collaborated with the Nazi SS in World War II, the new regime gave these far-right nationalists control of several ministries, including the office of national security which is under the command of longtime neo-Nazi activist Andriy Parubiy. See Consortiumnews.com’s “Ukraine, Through the US Looking Glass.”

       Crimea is not under occupation. It was not taken by force. No blood was spilled. There was a referendum held and the people voted to join Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh but the votes were faked! Only the West has trust-worthy voting," I hear you shriek.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         According to the Gallup's survey performed on 21–27 April, 82.8% of Crimean people consider the referendum results reflecting most Crimeans’ views
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         73.9% of Crimeans say Crimea’s becoming part of Russia will make life better for themselves and their families, just 5.5% disagree
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         According to survey carried out by Pew Research Center in April 2014, majority of Crimean residents say the referendum was free and fair (91%) and that the government in Kyiv ought to recognize the results of the vote (88%).
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          A poll of the Crimean public was taken by the Ukrainian branch of Germany's biggest market research organization, GfK, on 16–22 January 2015. According to its results: "Eighty-two percent of those polled said they fully supported Crimea's inclusion in Russia, and another 11 percent expressed partial support. Only 4 percent spoke out against it. ... Fifty-one percent reported their well-being had improved in the past year."
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bloomberg's Leonid Bershidsky noted that "The calls were made on Jan. 16-22 to people living in towns with a population of 20,000 or more, which probably led to the peninsula's native population, the Tatars, being underrepresented because many of them live in small villages. On the other hand, no calls were placed in Sevastopol, the most pro-Russian city in Crimea. Even with these limitations, it was the most representative independent poll taken on the peninsula since its annexation."

       you're an idiot. check out the dunning-kruger effect, the less people know the more they think they have a handle on things. Enjoy being in your "special knowledge club" but if you ever want to climb out of your self-induced stupidity, you could start by reading up on the common character traits conspiracy nuts tend to have. See what boxes you check off?

       Let me guess, by "real news" you mean sources like WaPo and NYT.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sources I linked are far more reliable than those trash heaps. But who am I kidding - you repeat talking points like a well-trained parrot. No use trying to reason with someone who doesn't use it in the first place.

       Skripal also accused Putin of paedophilia and rumoured to be a source for Steele. There were an unusual amount of accidents befalling Russian diplomats that were rumoured to be sources for Steele around late 2016 and early 2017. Maybe another loose end? Or maybe Putin is getting older and losing his fucking mind.

       The U.S. could have done this to set up a convenient political situation for combating Russia, but what proof do we have that the U.S. owns any of the nerve agent and that it was planted by the U.S. I'm fine with speculation of this nature, but we need evidence to take the conversation further in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, does anyone really believe that The 5Is don't have access to such a strategically important substance for espionage? The conclusion put forward here is that no other nation could have carried this out unless Russia lost control of its exclusive ownership of the nerve agent. Yeah, that's incredibly likely. We probably got it and distributed it to all of our allied intelligence agencies for their use, seeing as we had a whistleblowing spy that had directly worked with the stuff. I'm sure one of the first things the CIA did was begin work on acquiring the intelligence needed to either create the stuff of to obtain some of it for study.

       A mainstream media conspiracy pushed by the same media who announced last fall that Tillerson was about to be fired but wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pick one, mainstream media:
      </p>
      <p>
       —The State Department is being gutted and Tillerson isn't doing his job and officials are leaving in droves. He has no government experience and was only picked by Trump because Tillerson knows Putin and did business with Putin through ExxonMobile. He isn't the man for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       —Tillerson was the sole sane, reasonable one in the administration and State Department. Trump is only firing him because Putin told him to and because Tillerson said the ex spy in the UK was probably poisoned by Russia.

       Why is the comments section suddenly so overwhelmingly anti-Russia? 'Russiagate' skeptics get downvoted into oblivion while those supporting the mythical Russian collusion narrative get big upvotes. What gives? It's not normal for members of this side to bandwagon onto one side of a political issue. This doesn't seem organic at all.

       I'm going to apply occom's razor here. Trump has been tied to Russia for a long time. It gave him very bad publicity since he took office. What Tillerson said makes Trump look worse because of the implication of collusion mixed with an assassination. I'm more inclined to believe that Trump fired Tillerson over bad publicity more so than collusion with Russia.

       Flood of comments in support of Tillerson’s, and thus May’s, unsubstantiated claim that Russia committed an act of terror on British soil. At minimum this is extreme saber rattling, which is what warhawks do.

       Those are cute talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't hold much water though when you consider russia was already sanctioned for the crimea stuff ( that was a us provocation) and the newer round of sanctions was based on rushed, flawed intel that left anybody not falling for it openly stating that they have no actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is proven.  So, you either want them to prove it, like a sane, rational person.  Or you call for provoking a nuclear power with allegations we can't prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt tillerson ouster has anything to do with this.  It's known that russia has previously used poison to kill adversaries... nothing new here.

       Ms. May's words there. I thought her statement was rational and level-headed. Everyone on the planet knows that none of the measures the UK will be considering will be militant. Sabre rattling has a specific definition and it involves the threat of military force. She didn't invoke military force and you and I know that neither she nor the house of commons has any intention of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UK is not sabre rattling in my opinion.
