       For too long we have had to live with religious violence: car bombings, the assassination of abortion doctors, planes being flown into buildings. Enough is enough.
       <strong>
        The right to religious freedom was dreamed up almost 250 years ago by a bunch of old, white, slave-owning men, and it really has no place in today's world
       </strong>
       . With modern technology and government safety nets, we have our basic needs taken care of, and the outdated right to religious freedom is simply holding us back. Politicians may be afraid to speak out against religious freedom, but it's time we took a stand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The numbers speak for themselves. Compare China, where there is little to no freedom of religion or religious violence, to the Middle East, where Jews and Muslims kill each other on a daily basis. Limiting religious freedom works, plain and simple. I'd like to see all religion banned in America eventually, but in the meantime we need to at least adopt some common sense restrictions. For starters, let's
       <strong>
        ban high capacity churches
       </strong>
       . There's absolutely no reason to be preaching to hundreds or even thousands of people at a time in modern society. Soap boxes or, as I like to call them,
       <strong>
        assault podiums
       </strong>
       , need to be banned as well. These dangerous devices let just about anyone set up and preach religion right on our public streets. I see no problem with
       <strong>
        raising the age to practice religious freedom to 21
       </strong>
       , and we should also place
       <strong>
        a special tax on religious people
       </strong>
       to fund an education program about religious violence. Lastly, and this is something I think both sides can agree on, we should have
       <strong>
        mental health exams for anyone who wants to practice religious freedom
       </strong>
       . Religious people claim that they are mostly law-abiding citizens, but they all have the potential to become radicalized terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sick and tired of having to endure religious violence because of religious freedom advocates clinging to their gods to make up for their own insecurities. And I'm sick of condescending religious freedom advocates
       <em>
        godsplaining
       </em>
       their beliefs to me and acting like I don't get a voice just because I don't know the technical difference between a Sunni and a Sufi. It's more than enough to know that they basically all worship cows and put their gods' laws before the laws of man.
       <strong>
        The founding fathers could never have imagined the religious diversity that we have today in America
       </strong>
       . If they had they would have never written the first amendment, because we can clearly see that mixing all these different ideologies together is a recipe for disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religious freedom might exist as a right for now, but we also have a right to feel safe from religious violence.
       <strong>
        If placing restrictions on religious freedom saves even one life, then it's worth it
       </strong>
       .

       Not all rights are equal in their importance or in their danger. No right is without reasonable regulation. Even the first amendment has reasonable regulations like you can't run into a crowded theater and yell fire. Similarly, it's not unreasonable to ask that individuals who wish to own a instrument of death be of sound mind and well-trained beforehand.

       One size does not fit all. They are destroying the First Amendment by
       <em>
        expanding
       </em>
       rights to a specific type of property -- stock certificates. Stock Certificates now have both the free speech rights and the religious rights of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't need to ban speech. They only need to fill up most of the speech space with money=speech corporate oligarchy propaganda. This way no one actual human person can fully escape the stream of oligarchy advertising.

       That supreme court case was overturned more than 40 years ago.  Yes it was bad, but it was fixed.  It is now perfectly legal to tell Fire! in a theater, although if you do so when there is no fire and somebody gets hurt then you might (rightfully) be liable for damages.

       I know that case was partially overturned, leaving the Espionage Act mostly intact, but it is the most famous case and the place where speech was first determined to be restricted.
      </p>
      <p>
       My overall point, that free speech is restricted stands.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, in 2010, on the very last day of the same term where the 5-4
       <em>
        Citizens United
       </em>
       decision came down, a 6-3 Republicans-Democrats decision came down making it a fe3deral crime to try to counsel so-called terrorists to give up terror.

       OK, let's pretend for a moment that it is totally illegal to yell "Fire!" in a crowded theater.  Let us suppose this case was never overturned in any way.

       Well, of course not. That's not the point of my initial comment, nor was it my point that the exact and particular details of the original theater fire case were fully intact exactly as they appeared nearly 100 years ago.

       You are just looking to argue reflexively against someone who merely points out that the First Amendment is in fact heavily damaged, a point that the submission appears to reject.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not claim that the "fire" case was fully intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not claim that the case was not partially overturned. You did, and you overstated the situation.

       I merely claimed that the First Amendment has been restricted, and partially in a different way than might be expected.

       I did not say that one restriction justifies another.

       By mentioning that you’re concerned about gun-control advocates? What’s the conspiracy? You said your post was to show them how ridiculous their arguments are when applied to a different right. Are you admitting your arguments are ridiculous? It didn’t sound like it with your bit about “if placing restrictions on religious freedom saves just one life, then it’s worth it...” and “it’s time we take a stand.” Sounded more like propaganda

       Or maybe there's no conspiracy, and a large portion of the American population (including myself) just disagree with you and want to see additional regulation (not an outright ban) of dangerous weapons.

       The narrative is pushing *gun-control. OP said he’s worried about the concerted effort to attack our right to own guns. The same people that want to protect the second amendment want to protect the first too. A lot of gun-control advocates are socialists that also attack our right to free speech. This makes no sense

       Tough concealed carry laws do not equal an attack on the second amendment. If you can't get a permit in your state and it's that important to you move or take action to change the law. Simple.

       You can carry, you just need to pass the needed requirements. If you can't pass the requirements then you still have the right to bear arms, on your property.

       Not true. Personally, I'm fine with taking a gun safety course to get a CCW (although that could be abused as well). But that's not what's going on in a lot of places. In some cities, including the one I live in, you cannot get a CCW except under extremely limited circumstances. One of the "needed requirements" is getting special permission from the local sheriff.

       Pick a major city in many blue states and you'll find restrictions like this. New York, New Jersey, Chicago, San Francisco, etc... and don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing left-leaning places in general, I just think this is one topic that establishment liberals are on the wrong side of.

       I guess I just don't really see the correlation between strict ccw laws and not being allowed to defend yourself and your property with your guns. You can defend yourself and your property anywhere in this country. Just because you can't carry everywhere isn't that big of a deal to me. Obviously others disagree.

       This is decent work of satire. However, the founding fathers wanted freedom FROM religion. The way it works is citizens have freedom of religion so that the govt. has freedom FROM religion. SEPARATION OF CHURCH and state is one of the most important pillars of our nation. But religious zealots, almost exclusively christians, have tryed to bring prayer into school and make laws based on the Bible. You are obviously a shrewd thinker. And a more than capable writer, but your comparison is a false and harmful one.

        Hailed as "the Oxford English Dictionary of American constitutional history," the print edition of The Founders' Constitution has proved since its publication in 1986 to be an invaluable aid to all those seeking a deeper understanding of one of our nation's most important legal documents.

        These rich and varied materials are arranged, first, according to broad themes or problems to which the Constitution of 1787 has made a significant and lasting contribution. Then they are arranged by article, section, and clause of the U.S. Constitution, from the Preamble through Article Seven and continuing through the first twelve Amendments.

       Don’t ban religion, just tax it. Seems like that could solve a lot of problems. Orrrrr the government would just piss away the extra tax revenue. Fucked either way I guess.

       Let's not limit it to religion, either. That entire first amendment needs to go.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For too long we have had to live with harmful words: Swearing, offensive content, unpopular opinions, inciting violence. Enough is enough. The right to speak was dreamed up almost 250 years ago by a bunch of old, white, slave-owning men, and it really has no place in today's world. With modern technology and government safety nets, we have our basic needs taken care of, and the outdated right to speak or petition the government is simply holding us back. Politicians may be afraid to speak out against free speech, but it's time we took a stand.
       </p>
       <p>
        The numbers speak for themselves. Compare China, where there is little to no freedom of speech or protests, to United States, where people who have opinions kill each other on a daily basis. Limiting the public's right to speak out or petition the government works, plain and simple. I'd like to see all dissent banned in America eventually, but in the meantime we need to at least adopt some common sense restrictions. For starters, let's ban Nazis and pedophiles. There's absolutely no reason to be agreeing with evil people in modern society. Soap boxes or, as I like to call them, assault podiums, need to be banned as well. These dangerous devices let just about anyone set up and speak right on our public streets. I see no problem with raising the age to speak out to 21, and we should also place a special tax on licenses to rent out public spaces to fund an education program about disagreeing with the majority. Lastly, and this is something I think both sides can agree on, we should have mental health exams for anyone who wants to express an opinion. People who try to express their beliefs claim that they are mostly law-abiding citizens, but they all have the potential to become radicalized terrorists.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm sick and tired of having to endure hearing people I disagree with because of free speech advocates clinging to their words to make up for their own insecurities. And I'm sick of condescending speakers explaining their beliefs to me. The founding fathers could never have imagined the diversity that we have today in America. If they had they would have never written the first amendment, because we can clearly see that mixing all these different ideologies together is a recipe for disaster.
       </p>
       <p>
        Freedom of speech might exist as a right for now, but we also have a right to feel safe from things we find offensive or disagree with. If placing restrictions on speech saves even one life, then it's worth it.

       Lol You’ve described a totalitarian dystopia. Also I’m pretty sure nazis and pedophiles are already banned. You seem very confused. The insecure don’t speak out. The insecure are tired of having to endure people they disagree with speak out. I disagree with you but I have absolutely no issue with you expressing your opinion. More diversity means more disagreement which is why free speech is so crucial. We need to agree to disagree, not agree to strip the rights of anyone we disagree with. We all disagree on some level because we’re all different. We each belong to multiple identity groups which is why collectivism just doesn’t work. Now let’s have a discussion instead of a down-voting war

       People have already given up rights that the founding fathers thought so basic they never thought they needed to spell them out.  Like the freedom to move, the freedom to grow what ever crop will help you feed your family.

       And religion is not the real problem.  It's people.  Idle young men even more so, but lets not single anyone out.
