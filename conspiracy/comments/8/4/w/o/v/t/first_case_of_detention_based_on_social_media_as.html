      <p>
       In the wake of the alleged Florida shooting, much discussion has occurred surrounding preemptive detention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff Israel has received much media coverage for his calls for police to have authority to make mental health diagnoses necessitating detention and treatment,
       <em>
        instead of
       </em>
       mental health professionals, as is currently the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also calls for power of preemptive detention based on "disturbing" social media posts, which will be determined at police discretion, but which he has mentioned may specifically include imagery or mention of "guns", rifles", "bombs", or "blood".
      </p>
      <p>
       News story released yesterday:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/15/593799322/sister-of-charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-arrested-after-menacing-social-media-po">
        Sister Of Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Arrested After Menacing Social Media Post
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Dylann Roof's sister, Morgan Roof, was arrested based on a social media post criticizing the student walkout, wishing violence upon the participants.
      </p>
      <p>
       However notably, as stated by the school principal, the post was "hateful" and "inappropriate", but "
       <em>
        not a threat
       </em>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the post, she was arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her belongings were then searched, to reveal pepper spray, a knife, and pot. She was charged with possession of weapons on school property.
      </p>
      <p>
       The governor has stated that a "potential tragedy was avoided".
      </p>
      <p>
       This story very neatly justifies the recent calls for detention based on non-threatening, but "disturbing" social media posts.

       I’m not gonna argue that it’s not an inflammatory comment made by the girl, but saying you hope something happens is a far cry from any threat or saying that a potential tragedy was  avoided. Weird.

       The article specifically states that she was arrested
       <em>
        based on
       </em>
       the social media post.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>

       her belongings were searched and the knife was found.

       What is more relevant is that this is in support of a broader media narrative being pushed in order to change laws that would take away basic civil rights for everyone.

       There's certainly a role for schools to play in the social development of students, if a student is known to be exhibiting "hateful" or "inappropriate" behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       However there's a big difference between being sent to the principal's office and being arrested.

       The point is the timeline i.e. precedent of probable cause being demonstrated in regards to police action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disturbing/hateful/inappropriate social media post = probable cause for arrest =&gt; subsequently used as probable cause for search.

       Man, even as recently as my father’s time in high school people were allowed to have guns, though it was usually only in their vehicles (because why do you need it?).  Nearly everyone had a knife in their pocket.  Now, a knife and pepper-spray is an issue?   What if she had been bullied?  What if she’d been threatened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, yeah.  Kids are supposed to trust their elders to handle those kinds of situations (because they’re always around, available, trustworthy, and sincerely concerned about someone else’s kid but, more so, going to an adult never causes more issues than it fixes.) /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids, bring a knife everywhere.  Bring a gun where you can.  It may just save your life one day.

       A school is free to make rules about whether weapons are allowed on its premises. A school also has the right to talk to or punish a student for "hateful" or "inappropriate" behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is not okay, is the abolition of probable cause
       <em>
        by police
       </em>
       as described in this case - which coincidentally police in Florida have been demanding since the Parkland event.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hateful" or "inappropriate" social media posts do not warrant arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or they
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       not, but they likely will soon if the laws being demanded by police in the wake of Parkland are passed.

       Yeah grew up in midwest 90-20xxs and we all had guns in trucks and knives in pockets and still do. Nothing major ever happened. Few kids got shot at parties and few more traffic accidents.

       Yeah, her brother killed 9 people and she made a comment like that? Regarding a protest about gun control. I see your point, i do, and if she fought this in court she would probably win (assuming the law was handled correctly). However, i think she kind asked for this by making those comments. She is next level stupid.

       Those are all "hateful" thoughts. Are they wrong? You're free to think so. And someone else should be free to think them. Legislating what is and is not acceptable to "hate" has no place in free society.

       Idk if it's different rules but I've been told by an ohio sheriff that a person can openly boast about selling drugs and even if there's proof they are selling drugs on social media it can't be used as means to arrest? I might still have the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is Facebook different by state? Is ohio just lazy? I'm confused bc we had a group of people complaining about a fetanyl dealer who was posting about it online,even videos meeting people and selling that later died.. but told there's nothing they can do through social media...

       Sure, it makes sense that that type of social media post cannot be used for arrest. Unless it is a sting caught on camera, there is no way for police to claim that actual drugs were actually being sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       legal for police to detain someone if they express immediate threat of harm. Which is reasonable. If someone says "I'm going to go shoot up a school", police should be able to take action and they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       take action.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, what police are pushing for now, is to be able to detain
       <em>
        without any threat of harm
       </em>
       . If by their own discretion they find something "disturbing" or "inappropriate", they want the authority to preemptively detain you.
      </p>
      <p>
       This story is just a textbook example of exactly the power they want, with a perfect "tragedy averted" ending to justify that power.
