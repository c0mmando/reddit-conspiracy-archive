       I didn't gain much spending thousands of hours on Google or on YouTube or thinking about them, etc. I'm not happier or richer which I think are 2 of the things I value the most in life especially happiness/good feelings. I don't know much more than the people who took the blue pill or who are asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part I think I regret letting my curiosity get the best of me. It can be addictive or interesting to think you know the truth or think you will eventually know it if you just keep going, keep investigating. There's so much I don't know and there's stuff I don't know I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should've just realized that people can't be trusted, the government certainly can't be trusted, the media, etc. There's evil people in the world with agendas, there's alot of deception and lies in this world. I should just be happy and enjoy life.Why couldn't I have realized this sooner. I think I wasted my time honestly.

       And sometimes that dark path is very long with a lot of turns and dead ends. And even as much as we desire the light and the truth the journey to get there cannot be dismissed. It takes tremendous strengh to be able to stare into the darkness and see beyond it all.

       Being awake is so much better than being asleep. I don't fall for the divide and conquer anymore because I've broken free of their programming. There is no red and blue pill, only the truth. And everyone should be aware of it.

       I'd say that all depends on each individuals coping skills.

       I truly feel that those who lack coping skills will inevitably do some bad shit to the wrong people when they come to understand our reality we are living.

       You can be happy and enjoy life and still love investigating conspiracy theories. Stick to the information that's factual. There's a lot of dark bullshit in the conspiracy world and that's the stuff that can bring you down if you invest too much emotion into falsehoods.

       This is a rather odd concern. I mean yes, you're right, it would be much easier to skip the whole journey of discovery by simply realizing before you start it what you will eventually realize at the end. Unfortunately that's not really possible, due to various intricacies of the human brain and the entropic gradient of our universe.

       Don't stop. If you already have the little bug planted in you to find your own truth then keep going. I've spent countless hours reading watching and thinking. Some days I regret having curiosity because you are able to see how things really are and how much the suck, but I'm hoping to possible create something new or think up something new that could change my own world, and hopefully others as well. I think it's a gift you are even able to see that we are being lied to. I think we are all programmed or brainwashed to live the lives we are living, I am able to step back and see all the bullshit. In the long run its good to know what you are being lied about. I'm sure I'll have critics about this, and to those people, I'm sorry the truth is very hard to swallow. You may not get rich or happy, but you know the truth or your own truth and it will set you free.

       Its a waste of time if you read and then believe everything you hear and then spread disinfo making yourself look wacko and the community in general.  Being aware of some of the real conspiracies and the ways we are tricked should give you an edge in life, but when you have gone too far down a hole it can be a miserable experience and can definitely cause some mental issues and depression.  The more we realize that we are on a ride that you cannot get off of and just enjoy it for what it is, the better off you will be.  Just be the best person you can be and try to plant seeds of good along the way, that way you will have not lived in vain and may cause some change down the line that may save us from all this nasty stuff in the world.  You sound like you have the right mind frame already so good luck.  Regards!

       There's always a little truth hiding in a sea of complete bullshit, and even at it's worst, it's extremely entertaining to read people's take on reality's "Canon".   So, to paraphrase, time you enjoy is not time that you waste.  Thanks for your opinion, though.

       And that is the ultimate conspiracy. The average person is satisfied with a small fraction of real world understanding and then just accepts everything else without question or investigation. Don't focus only on conspiracies. Just expand your knowledge every day and in every way.  Let one thread push you towards learning a connected but inherently unrelated field of knowledge.

       If you value harmony and positivity in your life, it certainly is a waste of time. The soundbites and predigested mantras delivered by the media companies are easily memorised and then you can participate in the shallow mindless office chatter about current events and everyone will think you're agreeable, normal and an all-around great guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you are genuinely curious about the world, intellectually honest and you value truth no matter how uncomfortable, getting into 'conspiracy theories' can be the beginning of an incredibly illuminating journey. For me, it's changed my life dramatically and has made me a truly spiritual person. Something I could never have imagined myself becoming being raised an atheist, science-minded, sci-fi, dinosaurs and nasa loving kid.

       There does come a point when things start making sense, when the pieces 'click' together and you conceive a model of the world that is so infinitely clearer, more logical, and leaves less things unanswered than any conformist bullshit narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's a lonely road. Nobody likes being lectured and you'll quickly become 'that guy' who knows everything and tries to explain everything to everyone. Nobody likes that guy. So you gotta be cool with that.

       I think of it like a hobby. I loved reading true crime before I really started chasing conspiracies around. As a hobby, rarely do you get anything other than personal satisfaction out of it. I’m sure many folks have a drive to unearth the truth and share it. I just wanna know shit.

       Depends.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're talking corruption and the plotting of real-life extant groupings, it absolutely isn't. If anything it's the requirement of any society to keep its elites in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're talking immortal pedophile bloodlines, shapeshifting reptilians, octagonal earths, and other conspiracies that require conspirators with literally omnipotent resources and omnipresent involvement: absolutely. 
They're by all likelihood (and by all evidence) bullshit, so getting embroiled is nonsense; and if it's indeed true, the conspiracy is necessarily so absurdly powerful that you're awareness of it wouldn't be that much help to begin with.

       I like knowing things more than not knowing things. But I think there is a point where it stops being the pursuit of truth, and just turns into another passive form of entertainment like watching TV or scrolling through social media. It can be just another way to feed our screen addictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it is a waste of time inherently. I've gotten a lot out of conspiracy research and it leads me to be more mindful about the way I live my life. I make more informed decisions now. Its all about balance, yanno? I much prefer delving into a conspiracy topic more than binge watching tv. But you still gotta focus on what will

       Of course it is a waste of Time.  Doing real uncovering of facts yourself is the worthy goal.  For most this speaks to entertainment. Otherwise what are we doing? Shaking our fists in impotent outrage that someone somewhere is doing awful crap?
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, it can be a lot of fun to discover what is going on or what others think is going on in the world. There has been no call to arms.  What are any of us doing other than shouting into each others echo boxes hoping to gain insight?

       Depends on what you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can just let go of the darkness of our world and focus on the positive then you are better off doing that expecially if young.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't then it's good to know how the world gets done so you can understand as soon as possible you have no role into the greater order of things and think about your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, your role after is the same you got before, chop woods carry water etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you cracked the veil and can see the darkness perhaps it's best to look into it for a bit so you can atleast regain empathy for your fellows because when you understand what the average citizen is up against and you see how little you are you can atleast relate to others well once again.
