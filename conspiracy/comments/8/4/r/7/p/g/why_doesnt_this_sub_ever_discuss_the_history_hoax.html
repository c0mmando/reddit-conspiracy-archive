        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s look at some premises. Tell me where you disagree:</p>

<p>1) Most of us have not seen/read books more than 200 years old. I don&#39;t mean copies of books, I mean the age of the physical book itself.</p>

<p>2) None of us have read <strong>primary sources</strong> from historical figures like Plato (because they are not extant).</p>

<p>3) All of us know that history can be rewritten, and authority is not to be trusted.</p>

<p>4) Most of us <em>still believe</em> in &#39;Ancient Egypt&#39; and &#39;Ancient Greece&#39;.</p>

<p>Something doesn&#39;t add up here. Why are we so trusting of the stories about &#39;ancient history&#39;? Is it because most of us do not understand the significance of <strong>primary sources</strong>? Is it an intentional failing of the education system? Is it a result of consuming copious programming via TV and movies?</p>

<p>You have realised that every source has a different story, and rather than identify that this is a red flag in and of itself, you want to just ignore it?</p>

<p>But <strong>not anywhere near 2,000 years</strong>, I am willing to bet. And yet look how many people take &#39;ancient history&#39; on faith, as though the mere suggestion that it might be fabricated is blasphemous.</p>

<p>Personally, I believe we are just starting to uncover all of this, and a lot of early human history and our development of agriculture was us trying to reboot society with some of the knowledge we managed to save.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I&#39;m familiar with the claim. For arguments sake we&#39;ll say King Tut&#39;s life story is completely fabricated. Does that mean the other thousands of years of generally agreed upon history over 30 whatever dynasties  gets discredited too? </p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying that the famous story of George Washington cutting down a cherry tree actually never happened (it didn&#39;t), it was made up to sell a book. So now let&#39;s throw out all of the USA&#39;s history as well. None of it is credible anymore. </p>

<p>Obviously that would be ridiculous. Everyone knows history is roughly pieced together and the 100% true version is impossible to tell, especially going back thousands of years. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t understand what OP is getting at. Thanks for the reply though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work as an archaeologist. There are many techniques used to date artifacts. For example we can use </p>

<p>-radiocarbon dating (more exact)</p>

<p>-dendrochronology( older dating strategy using tree rings)</p>

<p>-looking at stratigraphy ( gives you more of a ballpark time estimate) </p>

<p>I’m aware that people have issues with various dating methods but we can cross analyze with historic documents and texts as a way of fact checking. </p>

<p>With this being said, a vast majority of human history happened before written history. We are talking tens of thousands of years where most of what we know come from stone tool artifacts and the human remains themselves.  The stupid caveman narrative is becoming increasingly more, well, stupid because we are starting to figure out the migrations of ancient people were a lot more complex than previously thought. </p>

<p>For example, I learned and probably most of you learned in grade school that people first came to North America through a land bridge across the Bering straight. Archaeology as well as genetics proved that correct, however current excavations and studies are proving that there were already people here when that happened and that those people likely came across the fucking Pacific Ocean from Asia many thousands of years before people came over on the land bridge. Let that sink in. </p>

<p>My point is prehistory theory is where it’s at if your looking to ask “what the fuck was going on”. We don’t need to worry so much about fraudulent old books that the elites are tricking us with. </p>

<p>What do you use to <strong>calibrate</strong> your radiometric dating method?</p>

<p>By that I mean, how do you know that your method is accurate?</p>

<p>Consider the speedometer of a car. It can be calibrated by having a person drive the car over a set distance at a static speed and timing how long it takes the car to travel that distance. Simple math then tells us the speed of the car, which we can compare with the speedometer, to arrive at a comparison and hence perform a calibration.</p>

<p>In this example, the instrument (the speedometer) is giving us information about a physical thing which can be tested independently.</p>

<p>Now how on earth can we calibrate radiometric dating? We do not know any rocks or other material to be x years old. It is like not knowing the length of track we are using to measure the car speed. How can we know the speedometer is right without an independent measure? We can&#39;t. How can we know your radiometric dating is accurate? We cannot.</p>

<p>It is all entirely <em>circular.</em></p>

<p>Do you understand the point I am making?</p>

<p>And we shout down those who ask honest questions? And attack them with juvenile ad hominems? </p>

<p>This is the behaviour I expect of normies when challenged about their evidence that Osama did 9/11.</p>

<p>Maybe this is not mere coincidence. Cognitive dissonance explains so many things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>History is definitely written by the victor. </p>

<p>It’s hard to learn about actual history when it’s truth and lies all mixed together. </p>

<p>Who’s to say our history even exists? I believe we are most likely in a ancestor simulation. Think about video games, for example. Pong, developed by Atari, came out in 1972. Fast forward 46 years and virtual reality games are being commercialized at a very fast rate. </p>

<p>It’s a scary thought/theory, forsure. That everything we are and ever will be, our feelings, actions and thoughts are all predetermined and that none of this is even real. </p>

<p>I think, therefore I am. Some would say perception is reality, and I would agree to an extent. </p>

<p>But what is actual reality?
Is it things we can see? Feel? Hear? We use our senses to perceive to world and reality around us, but what if our senses were complex algorithms and our consciousness is nothing but fabricated? </p>

<p>Back to ancestor simulations. I believe it is very likely that we are in on, because we will get to a point in technology where we will be able to create our own ancestor simulations. </p>

<p>There are three scenarios:
1)We go extinct before we can run one
2)We choose not to run ancestor simulations
3)We are living in a simulation. </p>

<p>I believe at the rate that technology is accelerating and how popular virtual reality is getting. scenario number 2) is very unlikely. So there’s 1) and 3). Elon Musk believes that it’s very unlikely we are in scenario 1) or 2). 
Philosopher, Nick Bostrom wrote <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">Are you living in a computer simulation?</a> and believes it is a 20% chance we are in a simulation. Nick also stated that if we are in a simulation, there is a sort of “God” or “Higher Being” but it’s some version of us. </p>

<p>Back to your original question, I wouldn’t say this sub never discusses it. It is a less posted topic though. I think the reason is because a majority people will subconsciously accept history as fact without ever looking into what actually happened in the past; which is fine. It is difficult to learn about actual history because everything important or factual is locked up. </p>

<p>History is either 1) truth mixed with lies 2) doesn’t exist and we’re in an ancestor simulation 3) is entirely different from what we’ve been told. </p>

<p>What are your thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We already have the ability to produce simulations. They aren&#39;t very good ones compared to our reality, but to their own inhabitants they are just as real as the reality you and I perceive.</p>

<p>Take Super Mario for example. To us, his 8 bit 2D world seems primitive, cartoony. But if Mario was self-aware, his world would look completely natural to him, and he would not even be able to imagine the world that runs the simulation he is living in.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, if we are living in a simulation, consider what the reality is like in which our simulation runs. It would be nothing that we can possibly fully imagine, but like Super Mario&#39;s world, there would be some similarities. Perhaps there is gravity in the container-verse, which our gravity is a primitive approximation of just as Super Mario&#39;s gravity is a primitive approximation of ours. Maybe our world&#39;s state can be &#39;saved&#39; and the machine on which it runs rebooted periodically and the state restored. Or maybe sometimes the save gets corrupted and we have to be restored to the last known good save from 2 weeks ago. Would we notice if that happened? Does Mario notice when you flick the reset button?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One problem is that when and where religion controls the population, history had to be written to fit the beliefs. </p>

<p>Another problem is the tradition that the victor&#39;s write the history, with the notable exception of the fall or literate Rome to the illiterate northern and still barbarian tribes, a long period of illiteracy accompained by Christianity&#39;s spreading meant, </p>

<p>religion influenced and reworked history to fit that belief system and that continues to hold back scholarship in looking and being honest about what technology has us to learn about ancient human history.   It is changing, and there was some change during the twentieth century. </p>

<p>You&#39;re basically saying that we can&#39;t believe anything that&#39;s not a primary source, correct? </p>

<p>And you seem to be saying that because we can&#39;t track down a primary source of something hundreds or thousands of years old, then it must be a hoax. Is that a correct understanding of what you just said above? </p>

<p>A simple yes/no is all I&#39;d like to know. I hope that&#39;s easy enough for you to understand, instead of avoiding answering any questions again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find history fascinating, but honestly it&#39;s mostly entertainment. I doubt any event that has ever happened has been recorded completely factually. Think of it this way... people rarely accurately depict events that happened <em>yesterday</em> in <em>their own lives</em> without some embellishments or personal bias. Also, history is built on <em>historical figures</em>. This really comes down to the philosophical question of &quot;does truth exist?&quot;. Not so sure. It&#39;s all dependent upon perspective. No matter what you believe someone somewhere believes the opposite, and has reasons to believe so, you can be sure.</p>
