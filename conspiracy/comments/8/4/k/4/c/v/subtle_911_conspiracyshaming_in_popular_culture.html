I&#39;ve noticed the same phenomenon on this particular show before, and it does seem to me like an entertainment media conspiracy to cause people to immediately discredit people speaking about that subject. And...it makes me sad, because it&#39;s otherwise a really good show! Anyone else bummed out about the influence gov-corp interests have on otherwise good entertainment? Have you noticed similar truth-shaming bits in places you didn&#39;t expect to see them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of Netflix in general...House of Cards was a massive limited hangout...it&#39;s depiction of power-politics and the cold, calculating reasoning behind them is dead on...of course Kevin Spacey was only good at showcasing such a thing because he was <em>actually</em> a monstrous child abuser and power hungry megalomaniac...but alas...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha. I never got into that series because I have tended to realize that everything from major sources like Netflix is going to be tainted, particularly political stuff. Like how The Queen gives such a nice, healthy sheen to Elizabeth, when the reality is probably quite different. But...Love! Come on! Ha. Once you&#39;ve seen the real truth about 9-11, it&#39;s hard not to see that kind of stuff everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God, I know. I spent a number of years outside of the US, which I think is the reason I was able to wake up to the dark realities of power. I feel particularly butt-hurt about the whole thing because 9-11 basically made me have a nervous breakdown during the first week of what should have been an amazing freshman year of college. Are these people really getting away with this kind of murder? Ugh...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>House of Cards is really fantastic mainly for the two reasons u/bradok stated.  It paints an accurate illustration of the all-encompassing blanket of corruption covering every facet of DC, from state representatives and staffers all the way into the oval office.</p>

<p>But my guilty pleasure is watching Kevin Spacey basically play himself.  The mother fucker can act (&quot;act&quot;).  Knowing the things we do about him now makes his performance absolutely chilling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought it was a limited hangout from another perspective. Underwood is essentially cast as a person who dictates his own path. Sure, he has to work the Congress and the electorate, and there&#39;s a few scenes of him begging donors for money, but for the most part, he decides what he wants to do and does it. He&#39;s literally the chief executive most Americans think the president is. </p>

<p>Where are the corporate lobbyists influencing decisions? Where is the CIA, CFR, AIPAC, etc.? They did throw us part of a bone with the Bohemian Grove reference, but even that was seemed a bit off. It essentially reenforces the notion that yes, our politicians are corrupt, but they&#39;re only out for their own interests, and only have to deal with other elected representatives and the electorate to get done what they want to get done, which in Underwood&#39;s case is what, just more of some nebulous concept of &quot;power&quot;?</p>

<p>In general, I do think it gets the mentality right, but really misses the mark on where the real power lies, that something would be fundamentally different if that other guy won the selection.</p>

<p>A show that flies in the face of a hundred years of re-written history and group-think programming would never get funded.  And if it somehow did, there&#39;s a thousand different ways the owners would ruin its credibility.</p>

<p>I agree completely...I think S5 tried to show that more...you had the different advisers (whose names I forget atm) representing the MIC etc; but it really didn&#39;t go too deep. I agree with your analysis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be, for sure. But I guess I don&#39;t buy it; I have an intuition that it&#39;s a little bit more than that. I imagine that the people who perpetrated 9-11 had at least a 20 year plan, with contingencies, so this phase of the cover-up plan might just be another layer on the cake. It&#39;s interesting to think about anyway.</p>
