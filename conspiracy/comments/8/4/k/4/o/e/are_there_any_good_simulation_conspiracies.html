    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt they view it differently, but functionally it&#39;s somewhat the same. If we take a relatively mainstream conception of Christianity, our existence here on earth is a literally infinitesimal slice of existence compared to the eternity that awaits us. In that respect, this existence is not <em>real</em>, but a test of sorts to determine our fate in the real experience of heaven or hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As if theology and simulation theory aren&#39;t?</p>

<p>But I kid. The fundamental premise of both is that our reality does not truly <em>exist</em> in its own right in the original meaning of the word, <em>ex</em> + <em>sisto</em>, to &quot;stand apart, or out of&quot;. Rather, our existence owes itself to and is completely dependent on some outside agency, either a God or a Simulator. We are not truly our own, but live these lives purely at the discretion of some entity who may do with us as it/He pleases. </p>

<p>In some Christian theologies, it is said that we live in the &quot;mind of God.&quot; How is that fundamentally different from living in the simulation of a simulator? In either case, that being can change the rules at their whim, can intercede with this reality, and can determine what, if anything, happens to our consciousnesses after we die/leave the simulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s was just a recent post on r/space that discovered all galaxies no matter the size take 1 billion light years to rotate 360 degrees. So all galaxies are turning at this consistent rate. Really neat thing just discovered and is huge right now over there. Also Niel Degrasse Tyson speaking how we can never reach the speed of light as if we’re under a speed limit was very cool to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that post right after I made this post and it made me think too. What if every rotation of the Galaxy is like a rotation on a disk drive or something like that. A billion years here could be a fraction of a second to them. The big bang is when they started the simulation and that is why the universe seems to be always expanding because it is still not done booting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is real? You&#39;re not pulling our legs?</p>

<p>That&#39;s very interesting. Regardless of size. Hmmmm. That definitely has to signify a very consistent force at work. Man, this could get really cool really quick.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, I would think it points to a force that&#39;s acting on/from the center and not the periphery considering it&#39;s regardless of size.</p>

<p>So, if a black hole exists at the center of every galaxy, then I would think there&#39;s a rotational force emanating from the black hole. A very predictable rotational force. Maybe it&#39;s operating on/through dark matter?</p>

There&#39;s restrictions set in place; much like an NPC might think it has a free will but simply follows a set of rules that are hardcoded. Here&#39;s where the &quot;Nature World Order&quot; comes into place I suppose... But the thing about simulation and the theory is really that it&#39;s also somewhat filosofical. It&#39;s a case of Shrodingers cat.. We can&#39;t rule out it&#39;s not a simulation, since we can perceive ourselves hosting such simulations within a few generations. Which in turn makes one wonder if it&#39;s the first time that has happened; odds are there&#39;s more simulations due to this simple fact. Given enough generations every household could be hosting The Sims: Universe type of game in the original universe, which create other simulations... </p>

<p>At some future point our civilization will have developed enough compute power to create a perfect simulation of reality and populate it with virtual humans. And that would be done to simulate past world events, for whatever reason. It could be as banal as a child&#39;s history project.</p>

<p>At some future point there will be one real universe and one simulated one, and then one real and two simulated, and then all the way up to who knows how many simulated universes.
