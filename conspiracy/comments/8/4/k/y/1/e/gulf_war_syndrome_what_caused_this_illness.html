        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What are your thoughts on what caused Gulf war syndrome? Ive been digging into it here and there ever since I had met someone who was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis after serving in the gulf war. They said the symptoms had begun while they were there and have progressed during the last few decades.</p>

<p>Some say it was nerve gas, others insecticides or uranium, but if so, then why hasnt this been documented before? With 1 in 3 out of the 700,000 coming back with symptoms, youd think there would be some deep investigation into this phenomenon but it appears as if many are stonewalling the route to the truth as to prevent incriminations and class action lawsuits.</p>

<p>So what do you, the reader, think happened in the gulf? Something had to have been in the air, IMO. The areas the soldiers were deployed have some of the highest %s of MS and neurological disorders in the world, so whatever was their exposed a lot of people and affected them very quickly and severely.</p>

<p>Id say nerve gas but how could it affect such a broad scope of people? Were it centralized to a few specific locations that had been attacked prior I could see the possibility of some odd unfortunate duck getting mixed up, but a 1/3 of the entire deployed population is just too damn much for whatever to have happened to be an elaborate and deliberate scheme, be it through our own government testing (soldiers receive a lot of placebos and shots containing unknown concoctions (slight conjecture from the veteran who served in the gulf war and also from what Ive heard other people who served say.)</p>

<p>Let me know what you think and thanks for taking the time to read, I hope to hear many of your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The absolute best information I&#39;ve found on this subject came from a 1998 article wrtten for Project Censored.  Pasting entire article because this needs visibilty:</p>

<p>Gulf War-related illnesses are rampant among American war veterans. One suggestion as to the cause of the illnesses has surfaced with new blood tests on the most seriously ill victims. <strong>A synthetic substance, squalene, banned for use in humans, has been found in blood tests of hundreds of sick Gulf War veterans, some of whom never left U.S. soil. Complicating the issue is the U.S. Department of Defense’s “loss” of over 700,000 service-related immunization records, which might provide a clue as to why squalene is showing up in Gulf War veterans’ blood samples</strong>.</p>

<p>Analysis of the blood samples has shown antibody levels of the experimental adjuvant compound known as squalene. This compound, not approved for internal human use other than in highly controlled experiments, has been studied on animals and humans as a promising tool that might help boost the body immune systems against influenza, herpes simplex, and HIV. Only government agencies are involved in human experimental tests using adjuvants (including squalene) yet the government has denied that experimental HIV immunization tests were ever expanded to the general population of sick people or military personnel.</p>

<p>The military has rejected any claim that immunizations administered to Gulf War military personnel prior to leaving for the war contained any adjuvants, but actual immunization records for the period have either been lost or destroyed. This has led to speculation in several circles that the government used military personnel to test experimental immunizations.</p>

<p>Military samples of blood drawn from the vets showed positive reactions for squalene antibodies. Samples of test subjects involved in federal experimental HIV studies also show positive reactions for squalene. It should be noted the medication administered to those involved in this HIV study contained the adjuvant squalene. These test subjects have never served in the military.</p>

<p>A military lab researcher interviewed by Insight was quoted as saying, “We have found soldiers who are not sick that do not have the antibodies, and we found soldiers who never left the United States, but who got shots (administered by the military) who are sick—and they have squalene in their systems. We found people who served overseas in various parts of the desert that are sick who have squalene. And we found people who served in the desert but were civilians who never got the shots, who are not sick and do not have squalene.”</p>

<p>Many people believe that there is probably no single cause for Gulf War Syndrome. Due to the disappearance of the inoculation records, even the most elementary checks cannot occur.</p>

<p>UPDATE BY AUTHOR PAUL M. RODRIGUEZ: “Since publication, none of the so-called mainstream press has followed up on the original story (or subsequent reports) by Insight. This may be due to the controversial nature of the issue and/or obstruction by military and politicos who alternatively have denied, rejected, or brushed aside the story.</p>

<p>“The Insight stories were (and are) based on preliminary and ongoing medical tests by one of the country’s most prestigious laboratories. This laboratory, which plans soon to seek ‘peer’ reviews, has initially confirmed the highly unusual discovery of antibodies to a polymer compound called squalene in the blood of sick Gulf War soldiers who served overseas as well as in the blood of those who never left the United States. In both camps, the sick soldiers received multiple inoculations and immunizations.</p>

<p>“At first, Defense Department and military/veterans’ officials denied they had such a substance, even experimentally. Then slowly over many months it was learned—and officials conceded—that squalene has been, in fact, tested extensively as a promising new ‘adjuvant’ compound in experimental drugs to protect troops against malaria, herpes, and potentially even HIV. However, to this day, the government denies it ever used squalene during the Gulf War period.</p>

<p>Squalene is used in beauty products and you can also buy squalene supplements. It&#39;s cheap and easy to find.</p>

<p>&quot;Squalane and Squalene are oily substances that are common components of other oils. Both Squalane and Squalene are natural components of human sebum, a mixture of lipids produced by glands in the skin. In cosmetics and personal care products, Squalane and Squalene are used in the formulation of a wide variety of products including bath oils, hair products, eye makeup, makeup foundations, lipstick, suntan and sunscreen products, body powders, nail products and in cleansing, moisturizing, and skin care products.
Squalene is found in large quantities in shark liver oil, and in smaller amounts in olive oil, wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, yeast, and in various other foodstuffs. Squalane is made by completely hydrogenating Squalene. The hydrogenation process can occur naturally in the human body.&quot;</p>

<p>This is what the WHO say:
&quot;A link between the health problems of Gulf-War veterans and possible presence of squalene in vaccines received by these soldiers has been suggested. One published report has suggested that some army veterans who received anthrax vaccines developed anti-squalene antibodies and that these antibodies caused disabilities. However, squalene was not added to the vaccines administered to these veterans, nor was it used in the manufacturing process. Various papers have been published outlining the technical deficiencies in that original report.</p>

<p>Most adults, particularly older ones, irrespective of their history of vaccination, have naturally occurring antibodies reacting with squalene. In a clinical trial, immunization with the licensed influenza vaccine containing squalene did not affect the frequency or titre of anti-squalene antibodies.</p>

<p>The Committee concurred that fears of squalene in vaccine-inducing pathological anti-squalene antibodies are unfounded. It did note, however, that the experience of squalene-containing vaccines has been primarily in older age-groups and recommended that as squalene-containing vaccines are introduced in other age-groups, careful post-marketing follow up to detect any vaccine-related adverse events needs to be performed.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I like to get sources from all sides of an argument to avoid confirmation bias.The original source you posted wasn&#39;t particularly strong as the article stated &quot;This compound, not approved for internal human use other than in highly controlled experiments&quot;, yet as you can see you can buy squalene supplements (which is internal use?)  here for example <a href="https://www.wellnessresources.com/supplements/squalene">https://www.wellnessresources.com/supplements/squalene</a></p>

<p>Also if you read the WHO article carefully (and yes I am well aware that they can&#39;t be trusted), you will see that they don&#39;t 100% rule out squalene as causing problems &quot;It did note, however, that the experience of squalene-containing vaccines has been primarily in older age-groups and recommended that as squalene-containing vaccines are introduced in other age-groups, careful post-marketing follow up to detect any vaccine-related adverse events needs to be performed.&quot; </p>

<p>Specifically &quot;post-marketing follow up to detect any vaccine-related adverse events needs to be performed&quot;. That statement from the WHO definitely makes me wary of it&#39;s use in vaccines.</p>

<p>Federal regulators approved a plan by biotechnology company, VaxGen to test its experimental anthrax vaccine on about 100 people. The human volunteers were injected with the experimental vaccine to see if it’s safe and produces the desired immune response. VaxGen was awarded a $13.6 million federal contract to begin work on the anthrax vaccine. The company is applied for two more anthrax vaccine contracts. The contracts were awarded for advanced testing and manufacturing of 25 million doses. In the last few years, a number of published studies have linked anthrax vaccination to the development of Gulf War Syndrome, among them a study in the British medical journal The Lancet. </p>

<p>Hundreds of soldiers have refused the shots after evidence emerged that the vaccinations are connected to a variety of illnesses.&quot;</p>

<p>Have no clue what caused it but do remember distinctly that:</p>

<p>-he was treated like crap by the Army after he came home disabled </p>

<p>-they said it was a coincidence and had nothing to do with him being deployed over there </p>

<p>-the doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong </p>

<p>-he left a big tough guy (stereotypical Army dude) &amp; came back skinny and weak </p>

<p>My entire family is VERY pro military - nearly every male member of my family is enlisted, mostly army but dad was Navy and 1/2 brother is Marines. .... so we aren’t the kind of family who typically thinks the military are the bad guys but clearly the Army didn’t have my neighbors best interest at heart. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many things that contribute to GWI/GWS but IMO the 3 most important things are:
- Pyridostigmine Bromide tablets
- Controlled detonation of the massive Kamisiyah Ammunition Storage Facility
- The burning oil fires</p>

<p>The PB tablets werent FDA approved.  The Ammo Dump sent chemicals sky high and they rained over everyone.  The oil fires did the same.  Even if troops were in full MOPP 4; all the vehicles and gear was covered in the chemicals and sent back to the states.</p>

<p>My father suffers greatly from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of most clear and concise article I&#39;ve ever read on all the causes and combination of Gulf War Syndrome.  People often try to search for <em>a</em> cause, but there isn&#39;t just one. There are 100&#39;s if not thousands.  It&#39;s also important to note that plenty of our veterans came home perfectly healthy (because that&#39;s how germ warfare works).</p>
