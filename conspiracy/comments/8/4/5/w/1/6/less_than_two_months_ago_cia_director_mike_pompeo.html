        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mike Pompeo, the Director of the CIA, has been selected to become the Secretary of State, by Donald Trump. </p>

<p>Pompeo met with Russian spy chiefs on U.S. soil in January.</p>

<p>One of the spy chiefs was sanctioned and banned from the United States. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/cia-director-mike-pompeo-met-russian-spy-chief-election-hacking-795983">http://www.newsweek.com/cia-director-mike-pompeo-met-russian-spy-chief-election-hacking-795983</a></p>

<p>He also met with top Russian spies last May in Moscow.</p>

<p><a href="http://ww.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-spy-chiefs-met-in-washington-with-cia-director-to-discuss-counterterrorism/2018/01/31/0b761976-068b-11e8-94e8-e8b8600ade23_story.html">http://ww.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-spy-chiefs-met-in-washington-with-cia-director-to-discuss-counterterrorism/2018/01/31/0b761976-068b-11e8-94e8-e8b8600ade23_story.html</a></p>

<p>Interestingly, Mike Pompeo patrolled the Iron Curtain prior to the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1991.
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/13/mike-pompeo-picked-as-trumps-new-secretary-state-what-to-know-about-him.html">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/13/mike-pompeo-picked-as-trumps-new-secretary-state-what-to-know-about-him.html</a></p>

<p>Not even considering the implications of putting the head of the deep state directly in control of foreign policy through the State Department, what else can we gather from this? Is Pompeo a Russian asset? Will this get down voted?</p>

<p>I&#39;m really curious about this.</p>

<p>To answer your other claim that I am misrepresenting information, from the article itself:</p>

<p>&quot;Meetings between U.S. and Russian spy chiefs are not unheard of <strong>and Pompeo himself met with some Russian intelligence officials when he visited Moscow last May</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>I chose mainstream links but this news can be found anywhere else from countless outlets. No sides involved in this one.</p>
