         it is under 2,000 sorties to destroy the Iranian nuclear capacity,”

        the Kansas Republican said in 2014. “This is not an insurmountable task for the coalition forces.”

       The "dogs" can be leashed, it
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only problem is that it won't be done unless and until the American people recognize who the
       <em>
        "leaders of the dog pack"
       </em>
       are, and deal with their treachery accordingly.
      </p>

       Unfortunately, calling out the "dogs" is taboo in according to the twisted, politically correct mindset that has overtaken the US and all of Western civilization.

       Good assessment.  Also, when you have people like Rachel Maddow now drumming for war, you are extra fucked.  The left

       It’s no worse than a lot of other countries and you are right. They are villains, just like the other countries. America’s main stream media likes to focus on certain atrocities, yet they conveniently avoid others on similar scale or worse. Everyone now a days must be constantly alert, propaganda comes from everywhere.

       It's not that Russia is a paragon of virtue in the world, but they are however the leader of the anti-imperialist movement, along with countries like Iran, China, North Korea, Syria and others. Countries who used to be a part of that are Iraq and Libya, though they now have been neutralized to a certain extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any country does enough shit to be painted as a villain. However, the MSM is targeting Russia and Muslims for a specific reason and that is, in my opinion, because the US/Israel/NATO coalition is now supporting Syrian insurrection with goals of controlling or destabilising Syria and then possibly Lebanon and Sudan. After that they can go after Iran, which is the only major enemy Israel has in it's neighborhood, the Sunni countries showing through their action that they support the imperialist agenda, even while they say the opposite and even if the Sunni population does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these countries are supported by Russia/China and other anti-imperialists.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the things you accuse Russia of, the US is more than guily of. Except for jailing opposition but that’s because there is no opposition, both parties serve corporate interests and both parties serve Israeli interests. In Russia you have actual division, pro-western and pro-independence/Eurasian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I don't believe the nerve gas attack was Russian but the important point is we don't have the facts yet in 24h we already have a culprit and the effects are being felt, with no confirmation of culpability.

       I agree and it depends on ones definition of "anytime soon" as far as that goes. I just get a little worried anytime this kind of stuff involving Iran is mentioned especially in regards to israels influence on the united states. Im no theologian but the regions described in that prophecy would be modern day Iran, Syria, parts or all of turkey and others in the region. Combine this with their allies in Russia and china and you don't have to use your imagination too much to start coming up with reasonable situations regarding world war 3. The reason I always think of that chapter is it freaks me out how accurate it potentially is and WHAT it's describing and Im a christian!

       I am on my phone and have to go to the free produce and grocery  place soon with my girlfriend so I can't give you a detailed response right now, I apologize. If you go to the table of nations in genesis and do a bit of digging online you can probably get a pretty good idea of where the area is and what their modern counterparts would be. There are opposing views on this just like pretty much everything else as to be expected. Im sorry I can't respond more at this time but hopefully this was some help. I am somewhat familiar with your families holy book but I wouldn't know what particular places to even start looking in that let alone anything specific. The structure of it is quite different from the bible which Im very familiar with. Take care.

       Always gotta be someone going in to a comment thread about the bible and bashing it. If it's not your cup of tea then why bother? Just never understood that, Seems to be primarily confined to dissing Christianity as well...kind of like the bible said would happen. Imagine that! Why can't I make a single comment on a topic that may be others would like without this happening, like, ever. Sorry it's just frustrating. It's not hurting you.

        9 People Donald Trump Might Fire Next

         <strong>
          Jeff Sessions
         </strong>
         : Trump has publicly attack the attorney general repeatedly -- calling him, among other things, "beleaguered" and "DISGRACEFUL." He has told not one but two news organizations that he would not have appointed Sessions as AG if he knew Sessions would recuse himself in the Russia investigation. He refers to Sessions as "Mr. Magoo" in private settings, according to the Washington Post. I mean....

          David Shulkin
         </strong>
         : Not only did VA Secertary Shulkin misuse taxpayer money on a trip to Europe last year, he is also weathering a scathing report from the inspector general regarding a veterans center in DC that has been plagued by poor management. Even worse? He got the dreaded vote of confidence from the White House earlier this week; White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Shulkin was doing a "great job."

          H.R. McMaster
         </strong>
         : Rumors of tension between the National Security Adviser and Trump have been rampant for months. There's even been chatter about how to move McMaster back into the military in order to get him out of the White House. With Trump jettisoning Tillerson, might he move on another member of the more globally-minded wing of his foreign policy team?

         <strong>
          Ryan Zinke
         </strong>
         : The Interior secretary was on the receiving end of a slew of negative press last week when word leaked out that the department had paid $139,000 to replace doors in his office space. Zinke pled ignorance and said he knew nothing of the expenditure, with his spokesperson pointing to a decision by career employees. Zinke is also facing a series of questions about whether his travel expenditures push the limits of legality. He was one of four Trump Cabinet officials -- Shulkin, HUD Secretary Ben Carson and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt were the others -- called to the White House in February for frank conversations about ethics.

         <strong>
          Scott Pruitt
         </strong>
         : The EPA administrator made news -- and not the good kind -- earlier this year when it was revealed he regularly flew first class and stayed in high end hotels, racking up expenses in excess of past people to hold his job. Pruitt said he flew 1st class because of the threats made against him. He has also faced scrutiny of late for allowing an EPA employee to pursue outside work as a media consultant. Not for nothing: Pruitt called Trump an "empty vessel" in 2016.

         <strong>
          Ben Carson
         </strong>
         : The Housing and Urban Development secretary purchased -- and then canceled -- a $31,000 dining set for his work office. Why isn't he higher on this list? Because Trump likes him -- and the two went through the political wars together in 2016. I think that counts for something -- maybe a lot -- in Trump's book.

         <strong>
          John Kelly
         </strong>
         : Reports are rampant that Kelly and Trump have fallen out, and that, as importantly, the White House chief of staff is in semi-open warfare with Javanka. Kelly's ham-handed handling of the Rob Porter debacle and the resultant news coverage clearly knocked him down several pegs in Trump's eyes. And, Kelly was reportedly part of a "suicide pact" with Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis -- that if one left or was fired, they would all leave. Working against the idea of Kelly being fired: Trump loves "his" generals.

          Betsy DeVos
         </strong>
         : The Education secretary has had a very rocky road. This weekend was the bumpiest bit yet as DeVos seemed totally out of her depth in an interview with "60 Minutes" Lesley Stahl. Trump hates negative headlines that he doesn't cause. But, it seems like he has more urgent firing priorities than DeVos.

         <strong>
          Jim Mattis
         </strong>
         : The "Mad Dog" is only on this list because of the aforementioned "suicide pact" with Tillerson and Kelly. That aside, he appears to be the Cabinet secretary who has clashed the least -- or the least publicly -- with Trump.
