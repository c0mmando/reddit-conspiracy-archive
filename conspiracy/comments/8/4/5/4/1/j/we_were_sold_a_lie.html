The swamp will never be drained, in fact its thriving. A CIA director just became one of the most important pieces of our federal government. A deputy director who was personally involved in torture and destruction of evidence now runs the largest spy organization both domestic and foreign. This forum has become nearly as bad as <a href="/r/thedonald">/r/thedonald</a> as of late. I know I’m gonna get downvoted. I know I’m gonna catch shit.

<p>that said there&#39;s been no evidence that the Russians changed a single vote.  I don&#39;t see why the DNC gets away with sabotaging Bernie Sanders&#39; primary campaign.  At the least thats outright fraud against anyone who donated money or significant time to either campaign under the impression that it was a fair contest.

    <div class="md"><p>Compared to what? Do I care if somebody gives me $5k? Of course I do, that&#39;s a lot of money. Do I care if that same person that gave me $5k gives $10 million dollars to the guy next to me that already has millions and millions of dollars? Well all of a sudden that $5k doesn&#39;t seem so great. </p>

<p>People on this sub rail against Big Pharma, media conglomerates, the military industrial complex, shady billionaires, etc... etc... Well, guess who benefits THE MOST out of everybody else from these tax cuts? I&#39;ll just go ahead and spell it out, it&#39;s Big Pharma, media conflomerates, the military industrial complex, shady billionaires, etc... etc... </p>

<p>There is no way to logically reconcile being AGAINST corporate control of our population and our country but FOR this tax cut. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your hypothesis only works if (1) each person starts with the same amount, (2) the overall pool is a set amount, and (3) A and B are the only two people in the equation. </p>

<p>Your model means nothing in a world of fiat money, interest, and other humans creating capital. So, your model is meaningless and still doesn&#39;t address the actual question. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re communist, just say it. Then we could have a relevant conversation, instead of pretending that we&#39;re talking about the same thing.</p>

<p>The question was: do you care about personal wealth? Your answer was: I only care about monetary wealth if everyone receives the same amount.</p>

<p>Just for clarification, if everyone has the same amount of personal wealth, do they really have &quot;wealth?&quot; Isn&#39;t what makes it &quot;wealth&quot; in the first place the fact that it&#39;s more than average?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldnt call it a fucking disaster.  It still provided coverage to millions of Americans who were priced out under the old system and it held insurance companies accountable.</p>

<p>We could have gone single payer, but it was a non starter.  Nobody else had any better plans to put on the table.  The fact remains the system was broken before Obamacare and while it had its faults, it still covered more Americans than ever before.</p>

<p>Healthcare costs have always been rising and outpacing inflation.  premiums had been escalating for years.  We actually saw rates decrease after Obamacare was implemented based on the percentages they had been rising before it was passed.  Our small business saw rates go down than what we had been paying before Obamacare, much of that a result of being able to shop rates side by side on the exchange.  The competition on exchanges caused insurance companies to lower rates to attract more customers.</p>

<p>Obamacare, while its had its problems and could use some tweeks, was a net benefit for American citizens who could no longer be denied coverage or care and left to die by the insurance companies.</p>

<p>The doublethink is believing the prior system was somehow superior when it left Americans to die in order to preserve profit.  We&#39;re the richest nation in the world and the only country that spends 3/4&#39;s of a trillion dollars on defense that thinks healthcare for our citizens will bankrupt us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re pretty much just reciting DNC propaganda. So it provided coverage to millions of Americans, perhaps, while making sure that millions more could never afford to go to the doctor. What good is it to have health insurance if you can&#39;t afford to use it? The only benefit is we get to point at a number and say how many more people now have health insurance. Even the language you are using, &quot;health coverage&quot;, is loaded to hide the fact that it doesn&#39;t really cover anything for the average person who was forced to buy into the system. There were only two small slices of the population that were helped by Obamacare: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>People with income just above the federal poverty level living in a state which chose not to expand Medicaid. These people were eligible for &quot;cost sharing reduction&quot; programs which made their premiums and deductibles affordable with mediocre coverage networks. This was a temporary bandaid intended only to sell Obamacare as palatable, helpful program.   </p></li>
<li><p>People with major, chronic health problems with costs that greatly exceed the maximum out of pocket limits and premium totals on any plans that existed prior to Obamacare. Many (not all) of these people have always been leeches on the system with health problems caused by lifestyle choices, and many of them previously relied entirely on emergency room care which they would very likely never pay back.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Other than that, every other person in the country ended up spending more and getting less from the healthcare industry. The healthcare industry became less personal and more bloated with expensive enforcement of regulation. Healthcare costs rose out of control as insurance companies were essentially bailed out on the losses that they took in negotiating prices with healthcare providers. Hospitals could always charge more because insurance companies would always pay it because ultimately the government would back them up on their losses. If some schmuck goes to collections on their coinsurance, no big deal because we already got  the lion&#39;s share of the supposed cost from the insurance company. Suddenly, there is no more incentive to price things at a realistic level.  </p>

<p>In the past, they would sell the debt off to collections agencies and write the loss off for tax purposes, but they still greatly preferred when people would pay their bill in full. There was a genuine pressure to keep costs to a realistic level so that people have a chance of paying what they actually owe. When you shove a $6,000+ bill in their face for a quick evaluation at the ER, suddenly it&#39;s a joke and people give up on paying. But if they have health insurance, guess what? They get that $5700 no matter what! So what do we do? Mandate health insurance!!! Absolute insanity that was destroying our country one day at a time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me a break.  Reciting propaganda because it actually did help?</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one with the propaganda with talking points to trash Obamacare.  You couldnt even begin to tell me how the prior system was better or what a better plan is.  Your argument is Obamacare sucks because costs but cant tell us what a better plan is.  I guess letting Americans die when its completely preventable over money is a better plan.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So basically it worked great for people that didnt live in republican states because those idiots decided not to expand medicare making the coverage unaffordable for the low income consituents in their state.</p></li>
<li><p>People with chronic illnesses have always been a drain on the system.  Either then went to the emergency room for care they couldnt pay for that ended up getting shifted to ratepayers, or they finally got insurance where the maximum out of pocket expenses were capped.  At least they finally had insurance and werent getting charged the non-insured rates that the insured public would assume in rate increases.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I dont know why you think that people ended up spending more and getting less.  We spent less and got a better plan with Obamacare.  Before our small business was paying more for an HMO.  Now we have a silver PPO we&#39;re paying $50 less for.  We even added dental insurance with the savings.  Rates went down again on our renewal.  Obamacare actually saved our small business money.  Healthcare costs were actually rising out of control before Obamacare, something you refuse to acknowledge that is reflected in all the data.</p>

<p>Ironically, the mandate for health insurance was a Republican idea.  The only reason Obamacare mandated insurance was to please Republicans because he knew they wouldnt bite on extending Medicare to all Americans, which would have been the moral and most economic solution to the problem.  The fact is Republicans had no plan that was better, all they did was trash Obamacare for 8 years.  They still cant tell us what their replacement plan is and you cant say with a straight face the prior system was somehow better.  You want to say I&#39;m regurgitating propaganda?  Look at you with all the same tired talking points and no solutions.</p>

<p>The fact is healthcare should be a human right.  If we can create the worlds most technologically advanced military on the taxpayers dime, we can do the same thing for healthcare.  We could save billions this very instant if we allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices as the single largest healthcare provider in the nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, healthcare should be a human right.  As someone who needs surgeries STILL for a degenerative joint disorder, I can&#39;t afford it thanks to Obamacare.  The fact that, because of my age and my marital status, I have to pay over $600 a month if I want coverage put me in the red every. single. month.  Why?  Because I didn&#39;t earn enough for breaks.  Let me repeat: I... did... NOT... earn... ENOUGH.</p>

<p>It got to a point that paying for the medical flat out was less expensive.</p>

<p>And I still haven&#39;t gotten my surgeries that I desperately need.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t you fucking talk about how good Obamacare is, because you are clearly one of the people who didn&#39;t actually need it.  Sit down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the worst point I&#39;ve encountered here tonight, but the two situations are qualitatively different. The provisions in the tax bill that you are referring to will automatically go up for a vote to renew before they expire. Unfortunately, opposition resulted in a weaker bill than I would have liked, but we finally have some essential reforms to the totally insane tax code. If a future Congress decides to make the unpopular move and vote against renewing those cuts while keeping an otherwise sound bill, then that will be on them.</p>

I would argue it is the job of the state to enforce both federal and state laws, since the states receive funding and support for the federal government. Whether federal laws should supercede state laws would have to be on a case by case basis depending on the content of laws, cause I believe there are certain powers afforded to the states by the constitution. </p>

There are a million and one horrible things about Trump’s administration, but CNN et al have focused on one thing: Russia. To a Trump supporter, it can look like Trunp is just the victim of unfair attacks. If the media was not so shamefully pro-corporate, they could, for instance, cover Trump’s budget proposal in depth, and expose to the American people how corrupt and fucked up his administrstion is. They could cover the corporate ties of all the people he has appointed. And so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>more than 90% of news regarding Trump are negative. Do Obama get 90% of negative news? During Obama era, how many corporate news outlets is sucking Obama&#39;s dick compare to how many news outlet is sucking Trump&#39;s dick. The only reason that I believe Trump might be the guy is because of all these negative news from corporate media and Hollywood opposing him. They love Trump when he just a reality star but hate Trump to the bone when he became the president of the United States.</p>

<p>It make you think why the media and Hollywood is on the war path to take down Trump. Is it because Trump is not their guy?</p>

<p>since this sub reddit is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Do you guys even think about why so many media is giving free blow job to Obama but Trump is not &quot;presidential&quot; because Trump say shits that you don&#39;t like?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Trump supporter and didn&#39;t vote for either but it really make me think why Trump is so hated after he won and the hate is all generated by the media.</p>

<p>The Trump Administration is fantastic for wealthy Americans and American corporations. Since it&#39;s the wealthy who control the flow of information in the media, they use media outlets such as Fox News and Breitbart to convince poor voters that the Trump Administration is fighting <em>for them.</em>  </p>

<p>Also, the economy <em>is</em> doing well. When it stops doing so well.. Well, there&#39;ll be a reckoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump lies pretty much every time he speaks. They may be smaller lies, or lies by omission of context, but they&#39;re lies nonetheless.</p>

<p>To expect any kind of honesty after he lies about so many provable and trivial things is absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He started right off the bat with his inauguration claims. Then the constant boasting that the electoral college is rigged against republicans. Those are the glaring examples off the top of my head, because they were proven false and yet he continues to repeat them.</p>

<p>He lied about his contacts/investments with Russia during the campaign, which is a pretty big deal.</p>

<p>He lied about releasing his tax returns after winning the election.</p>

<p>He lied about his role in the release of the basketball players that were caught shoplifting in China.</p>

<p>He lied about hiring, &quot;The best people&quot; - his staff turnover is historically high.</p>

<p>He lied about having a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare (on day one).</p>

<p>The lies are constant, even if they&#39;re small, like using over-exaggeration and hyperbole, like today&#39;s tweet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>California’s sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous &amp; violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies, set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP!</p>

<p>If we don’t have a wall system, we’re not going to have a country. Congress must fund the BORDER WALL &amp; prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country &amp; the people of our country. We must enforce our laws &amp; protect our people! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean this shit is ridiculous coming from the sitting president. There&#39;s a reason politicians have to be careful with their words, or at least there <em>used to be</em>.</p>

<p>Most of the time his dishonesty is just him spouting his hyperbolic opinion, which he uses to rile up his base and divide the country. He&#39;s doing so using the office the President, so we must hold his statements to the highest standard. Sadly, this makes it seem like people are nitpicking and picking on him, but in reality it&#39;s just holding him to the same standard as any other politician.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the hypocrisy - many of the things he criticized Obama for (on Twitter, so it&#39;s easy to prove), he&#39;s doing to a larger extent. His hypocrisy with golfing is glaring, and hypocrisy is a form of lying.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Even fucking Snopes can&#39;t call that one a lie, and you KNOW they would if they could prove it. They call it &quot;Unproven&quot; for like 50 different reasons. However, in reality, it&#39;s VERY LIKELY that more people watched his inauguration, both here and around the globe, simply because the internet is so much more widespread than it was four or eight years ago.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then the constant boasting that the electoral college is rigged against republicans.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, how is this a lie? He made an off-hand jest about how it&#39;s hard on Republicans when Democrats get such a big advantage with California. This is true. Republicans do have to win votes in a wider geographic area because most Democrats are concentrated in California and other major population centers like New York.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He lied about his contacts/investments with Russia during the campaign, which is a pretty big deal.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give me the specifics. I think you&#39;re getting mixed up on two things. One is that President-elect Trump rightfully and legally made contact with the Russians and many other foreign leaders during the transition period. The other is that there is no proof that Donald Trump was instructing communication or even aware that communication was happening, for example in the case of George Popadopoulos. Really, the devil is in the details, so let&#39;s see them. You can&#39;t claim a lie without providing details. Surely you know that.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He lied about releasing his tax returns after winning the election.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, he has complied with legal requirements on financial disclosures. Second of all, he may still release these tax returns. You may not like the way he is handling this, but once again it&#39;s false, or at best premature, to call this a lie.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He lied about his role in the release of the basketball players that were caught shoplifting in China.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you have an update on this story? Were they not facing up to ten years in jail under Chinese law?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He lied about hiring, &quot;The best people&quot; - his staff turnover is historically high.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, your opinions don&#39;t factor into whether or not something is a lie. How is having a high turnover rate a lie? He was upfront about this from the beginning! He always said that he was going to keep most Obama-era Federal employees on during the transition until a complete review could be done, and many of them were then replaced. This is what Donald Trump is famous for. Have you ever heard of The Apprentice? There is another layer to this as well, because he spoke and written about planning his administration in stages. He wants certain people for certain stages and then replaces them for the next stage. You may not <em>like</em> that, but how the fuck is that a lie?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He lied about having a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare (on day one).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally on day one, he signed an executive order explicitly instructing Federal employees to do everything in their power to mitigate penalties and burdens associated with Obamacare. His American Healthcare Act was ready to go almost immediately. It failed to pass by one vote. Again, <em>not a lie</em>.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lies are constant, even if they&#39;re small, like using over-exaggeration and hyperbole, like today&#39;s tweet:  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only part of that tweet that is possibly hyperbolic is the &quot;If we don&#39;t have a wall system, we&#39;re not going to have a country.&quot; However, not really a lie if he believes the underlying sentiment behind that hypothetical to be true.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the time his dishonesty is just him spouting his hyperbolic opinion, which he uses to rile up his base and divide the country. He&#39;s doing so using the office the President, so we must hold his statements to the highest standard. Sadly, this makes it seem like people are nitpicking and picking on him, but in reality it&#39;s just holding him to the same standard as any other politician.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is fair. Most of the nitpicking that I see appears to be intentional misrepresentation of reasonable statements. Like the gun control issue where people spread a lie that he said he wanted to take everyone&#39;s guns. I think the people calling him a liar are the ones who are not being careful. People are mistaking things they dislike about the President with factual lies.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then there&#39;s the hypocrisy - many of the things he criticized Obama for (on Twitter, so it&#39;s easy to prove), he&#39;s doing to a larger extent. His hypocrisy with golfing is glaring, and hypocrisy is a form of lying.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have to be careful here too. I was told he was a hypocrite for signing more Executive Orders than any previous administration. As it turns out, the vast majority of those were simply overturning past Executive Orders. Oops! No hypocrisy. Regarding golfing, it really comes down to a question of whether Trump he thinks he is doing a better job overall (obviously, he does think that). From his perspective, he could taunt Obama by calling him out for golfing when he was doing such a terrible job as President. Then he would take it a step further and wish that all he would do is golf rather than making terrible decisions as President. That&#39;s his opinion. On the other hand, Trump is working <em>extremely</em> hard as President, by all accounts, this much is fact. It&#39;s a matter of opinion whether or not you believe he is doing a better job. Even if he plays golf frequently, it is still very likely that he is putting more hours into the job than his predecessor. That&#39;s just the way Trump operates and always has. He&#39;s a workaholic and balances it out with golf as a recreation. However, it&#39;s not just a recreation for Trump, as we can see in countless pictures he is always out golfing with politicians and foreign visitors. Many people have said that the most important deals are made on the golf course. Having his &quot;second White House&quot; literally on a golf resort makes that particularly easy.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even care about the golf issue much. Maybe he was hypocritical, maybe he shouldn&#39;t have made such a fuss about golfing if he was going to golf a lot. Sure. I get that. But, in my estimation, the biggest lie of all is the notion that he lies constantly. It&#39;s really easy to read a list like yours and have a knee-jerk reaction, but if we&#39;re being honest the provable, factual lies are practically non-existent. </p>

<p>This is not what he said on the campaign, but i&#39;ll give that it&#39;s just another example of a politician making promises he can&#39;t keep. Too bad he was too arrogant about how he would easily find a solution for it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is why politicians are careful with their words - they are responsible for how reasonable people can interpret their words. It may be a &#39;misinterpretation&#39; to you, but all that matters is if a reasonable person could interpret his statement in a way. Trump seems to intentionally make statements that can be interpreted in many ways, some of them nefarious.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How is this a fact? Everything we&#39;ve heard about his schedule is amateur hour.</p>

<p>This is straight bullshit. I don&#39;t really care that much about golfing either, it&#39;s the hypocrisy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about the lie that Donald Trump is a billionaire?  He&#39;s not.  <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2017/12/29/donald-trump-russia-secret-deutsche-bank-753780.html">This article explains some of his dealings with Deutsche Bank, which prove his lack of solvency.</a>  Moreover, you should know, Deutsche Bank is not a bank that actual New York real estate tycoons do serious business with.  Those big players, the Bloombergs and the Dursts and such, they deal with bigger, much more established banks like Mellon and Merchants.  The big established banks in NY won&#39;t touch Donald Trump because his businesses lose too much money and Trump never pays it back, going bankrupt instead.  If someone loans you money, you promise to pay it back.  If you never intended to actually pay it back, you fucking lied.  If you borrowed 100 bucks from me, then you refuse to pay it back and when you borrowed it you hid the fact that you never could actually pay it back, you lied to me.  </p>

<p>Also, Trump University was a big fucking lie.  In fact, there&#39;s a legal term for that sort of lie, it&#39;s called fraud.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/us/trump-university-settlement.html">Why would you pay $25 million in settlements for fraud when you supposedly didnt lie?</a>  (Also, <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-says-i-dont-settle-but-we-found-13-times-he-did-3a7ae4678b22/">wasn&#39;t he the guy that said he never settled?  Another lie.</a>)</p>

<p>I&#39;m copying below some details on Trump&#39;s bankruptcies from WaPo.</p>

<p>Trump’s companies have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which means a company can remain in business while wiping away many of its debts. The bankruptcy court ultimately approves a corporate budget and a plan to repay remaining debts; often shareholders lose much of their equity.</p>

<p>Trump’s Taj Mahal opened in April 1990 in Atlantic City, but six months later, “defaulted on interest payments to bondholders as his finances went into a tailspin,” The Washington Post’s Robert O’Harrow found. In July 1991, Trump’s Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy. He could not keep up with debts on two other Atlantic City casinos, and those two properties declared bankruptcy in 1992. A fourth property, the Plaza Hotel in New York, declared bankruptcy in 1992 after amassing debt.</p>

<p>PolitiFact uncovered two more bankruptcies filed after 1992, totaling six. Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004, after accruing about $1.8 billion in debt. Trump Entertainment Resorts also declared bankruptcy in 2009, after being hit hard during the 2008 recession.</p>

<p>Why the discrepancy? Perhaps this will give us an idea: Trump told Washington Post reporters that he counted the first three bankruptcies as just one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s remarkable what is happening right now. How could I be programmed to disbelieve anything negative about Trump when almost all media is negative about Trump? Unless you mean it&#39;s because I see provably false attacks against him every single day. The natural consequence of that is to distrust further attacks against him, sure.  </p>

<p>Literally every single thing I have read in that list is bullshit, by the way, and it&#39;s not even hard to see if you set your bias aside for 2 seconds.  </p>

<ol>
<li>He was not for the Iraq war. Misrepresentation of his words. They attacked him about this during the debates and any thinking person could see the deceitful strategy at play.<br/></li>
<li>Sometimes he takes a guess about something which he doesn&#39;t remember precisely and he gets the details wrong. He probably should be careful not to do that kind of off-the-cuff thing, but it&#39;s just not the same thing as a lie. This comment applies to almost half of these &quot;lies&quot;. You can tell he&#39;s doing this because he always uses language like &quot;I guess&quot; or &quot;I think&quot;. He&#39;s actually being honest about the fact that he&#39;s not certain about what he&#39;s about to say. That&#39;s not how lies work.<br/></li>
<li>The jury is still out on illegal voting and voter fraud and the issue has been elevated to DHS because the state-level panel <em>did</em> find sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.<br/></li>
<li>Multiple situations where they say it&#39;s a lie because there is no evidence to support what he is saying when in fact there is also no evidence to suggest the he is lying. For example: no evidence of paid protesters. Give me a fucking break. That story will break soon enough. It&#39;s not a lie when you may still be proven right. An unproven claim is not a lie, no matter how much you think he is wrong.<br/></li>
<li>Multiple situations where the opinion of the writer differs from the opinion of the President and they call that a lie. Fuck this noise. You realize this is an opinion article, right?<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>I could go on and on. This is outright delusional. It&#39;s like people are losing their minds and just looking desperately for anything to back up their irrational hatred for Donald Trump.  </p>

<p>All I&#39;m asking you to do is keep an open mind. When the mainstream media works this hard to attack someone, you might want to consider the possibility that there is a good reason for it. If you think it&#39;s because they have journalistic integrity, then I don&#39;t think we can get anywhere in this conversation. </p>

<p>where he literally says &quot;I guess...&quot; </p>

<p>So is your argument that something is never a lie of you preface it with “I guess”? Is that really how far gone you are?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>off-the-cuff statements like that, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a press conference that he prepared talking points for.....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, in context, he was talking about Republican victories</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why did he only clarify that after being called out? </p>

<p>Regardless, in context, he wasn’t. Full paragraph:</p>

<p>I&#39;m here following through on what I pledged to do. That&#39;s all I&#39;m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn&#39;t supposed to get 222. They said there&#39;s no way to get 222. 230 is impossible. 270, which you need — that was laughable. We got 306. Because people came out and voted like they have never seen before. So that&#39;s how it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they are not happy about it for whatever reason</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/02/16/click-for-a-full-transcript-of-trumps-first-solo-press-conference.html">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/02/16/click-for-a-full-transcript-of-trumps-first-solo-press-conference.html</a></p>

<p>So would you admit that you just lied there? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>won&#39;t accuse that young reporter of lying by intentionally ignoring the context </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean staying verifiable facts? </p>

<p>And, again, he didn’t ignore context. Can you show me the context from the full transcript I provided? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, Trump overlooked H.W., that&#39;s a fact. Otherwise, what he said would have been correct. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you ignore reality he was correct? </p>

<p>Ok, from the same clip, he said the following:</p>

<p>“I&#39;m here following through on what I pledged to do. That&#39;s all I&#39;m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn&#39;t supposed to get 222. They said there&#39;s no way to get 222. 230 is impossible. 270, which you need — that was laughable. We got 306. “</p>

<p>He only had 304. So is that a big old mistake too or a lie? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>By virtue of intent, it was clearly an honest mistake. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you assuming his intent? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The missing context here is that he had similar recent discussions regarding the difficulty of a Republican electoral victory. &quot;They said...&quot; is referring to MSM analysis and commentary which incorrectly predicted his loss. The numbers he was throwing out were examples of what we&#39;re the best case scenario for him. You are correct that I made a mistake here as well (didn&#39;t I just say mistakes happen?). Around the same time he made similar boasts which were explicitly focused on the difficulties faced by Republicans due to the big electoral advantage of California. His point was that Republicans have to campaign in a much larger number of states. In this context, he was rather unclear, I agree. I have been posting from a phone this afternoon, so my apologies for not checking that more carefully. I appreciate your attention to detail; a welcome change from nearly everyone in this conversation.   </p>

<p>However, I stand by the fact that all of these inconsistencies were mistakes fueled by the excitement of the moment and his unexpected win. I base that off of the fact that the alternative is absolutely ludicrous. Nobody would intentionally lie about something so easy to verify. He was obviously thrown off for a moment and taken in excitement. The &quot;I guess...&quot; Is a clear sign that he is not speaking from a place of confidence. Mistakes happen. I won&#39;t discount that. He said &quot;Opama&quot; instead of &quot;Obama&quot; in his SOTU. Nobody is perfect, but I see no evidence that he is in the habit of telling lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s more than a bit weak. They basically couldn&#39;t figure out what he meant. Obviously the Democratic leadership of California isn&#39;t begging for the wall because they want to secure the Hispanic vote and perhaps they even want illegal immigrants to vote for them. They call it &quot;taco bowl engagement&quot; (language used by the DNC, not my own).  </p>

<p>However, California law enforcement, border patrol agents in particular, have a very different perspective on the matter. He spent the entire visit speaking directly to border patrol agents and officers asking what <em>they</em> need to secure the border and then makes your quoted statement in that context. It was incredibly easy to understand what he meant by his statement. The Democratic leadership and Politifact are &quot;mystified&quot; because Trump was not speaking to them. If anything he was taking a sarcastic jab at the leadership while relaying the message of the people putting their lives on the line every day.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but that wasn&#39;t a lie. It&#39;s called trolling. You&#39;re going to have to use your own critical thinking here. Whether or not Politifact says &quot;pants on fire&quot; is not a metric for whether or not something is a lie. </p>

<p>I see where you are coming from now, if that&#39;s what you think about border security. In the video I just linked to you moments ago, a 25 year veteran of US Border Patrol explained how dramatically they transformed the region by putting up a scrap metal wall. Both sides of the border became safer. He literally described it as a &quot;chaotic environment&quot; before the wall. People were afraid to live anywhere near the border until they put up a wall and &quot;reestablished law and order&quot;. This is a scrap metal wall that they can easily cut holes through and climb over, and still it is that important.  </p>

<p>Hang the fuck on. If we&#39;re going to quibble over details, then you should address the detail I just called <em>you</em> on. Did he claim 306 or get other electoral details wrong a year after the election, or not? The example you gave was from February 2017. Did he continue to make that mistake months later or not? You claimed that he did.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit that he fumbled the numbers pretty badly that day. We all have our stupid moments. That&#39;s perhaps the worst one I have seen from Trump&#39;s presidency. Still, not a lie, which was the premise of this entire thread.  </p>

<p>Actually my main attack was the fact that it is an opinion piece, which are not written by serious journalists or vetted by editors to the same level as a legitimate news piece. An opinion piece from any source is not very good evidence to bring to a discussion.  </p>

<p>Did Trump win 304 or 306 electoral votes? Trump won states (and one district in Maine) worth 306 electoral votes (this map). However, two Texas electors did not cast their actual ballots for him, so history will record Trump as winning 304 electoral votes. </p>

<p>Can’t claim an electoral vote if electoral delegates don’t vote for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s actually a perfectly reasonable distinction. He won 306 electoral votes in the election. I didn&#39;t say he got 306 electoral votes because he got 304 electoral votes. But he did win 306 electoral votes in the election. Every example of people saying 306 comes down to the highly unusual faithless electors. </p>

<p>He didn’t, because he did not get the votes. Nothing in our electoral process says the electoral college has to vote for the person that got the popular vote in that state, it’s the whole point of the electoral college. Come on, this is civics 101 and another example of you deploying mental gymnastics to defend trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From November 8th to December 19th, the number was 306. Everyone talked about 306. They are called &quot;pledged delegates&quot; and he won 306 pledged delegates. I know how the electoral college works. Many states do have laws preventing faithless electors, others do not. Regardless, it is highly unusual for delegates to go against the pledged votes won in their state.  </p>

<p>So yes, he won 306 electoral votes according to the will of the people. He received 304 due to a political stunt. Not a big deal. The point is there is an <strong>obvious reason</strong> for the confusion over that number. </p>

<p>By the same logic Clinton won the ejection due to the will of the people by getting the most votes. But that’s not how our process goes, so she didn’t and trump only received 304 electoral votes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he&#39;s clinging to those 2 extra votes because he had just spent more than a month being congratulated on his 306 pledged delegates. Obviously the result is what it is: 304. But it&#39;s a perfectly understandable thing to bring up 306 later on. That doesn&#39;t make it a lie. I could see an argument for petty, but I don&#39;t think he made a big fuss about it. Either way, it was not a lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess we could look back to 2012 and Grover Norquist&#39;s CPAC speech where he outlined what the GOP wanted from a leader; this was in reference to having bite the bullet and go for Romney, but as a line of thought it&#39;s easily applicable to the current incumbent, certainly in terms of getting <em>the Ryan budget</em> passed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All we have to do is replace Obama. ... We are not auditioning for fearless leader. We don&#39;t need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. We want the Ryan budget. ... We just need a president to sign this stuff. We don&#39;t need someone to think it up or design it. The leadership now for the modern conservative movement for the next 20 years will be coming out of the House and the Senate.</p>

<p>The requirement for president?</p>

<p>Pick a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen to become president of the United States. This is a change for Republicans: the House and Senate doing the work with the president signing bills. His job is to be captain of the team, to sign the legislation that has already been prepared.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Toughness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your idea of toughness is never taking advice and doing whatever the fuck you want, no matter how it screws you or the people you supposedly care about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>individuality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, putting on a red hat and blindly following the will of Dear Leader, ostracizing anyone who dares to speak up about one of his insane plans not being the best decision ever made is <em>super</em> individualistic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>free market</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The market is a ravenous wolf that wants to devour everything in its path. It was in the cage for a reason. You can be a bleeding heart hippie and let it out, but all it&#39;s going to do is <em>eat</em> your heart. This isn&#39;t really a Trump thing, though; if the past several decades haven&#39;t gotten it through everyone&#39;s heads that the much-lauded benefits of the &quot;free market&quot; are fucking fairytales, I suppose nothing will.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>limited government subservient to the citizens</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizens didn&#39;t even get the President they voted for. The party in control of all three branches of government and most states aren&#39;t even the fucking majority. They keep themselves in power through gerrymandering and voter suppression, and every passing year they do even more to consolidate their power and make it harder to vote them out. When they&#39;re done suppressing all the blacks or Hispanics or poors or liberals or whatever other fucking group they&#39;re targeting, they <em>will</em> move on to portioning up the white Christian male demographic in one form or another. That they are so gung-ho about voter suppression and media consolidation shows you which path the citizens can take to remove their politicians is most feared: it&#39;s not armed revolution, it&#39;s public outcry and voting. And the people who&#39;ve most trumpeted their willingness to revolt should things get &quot;out of hand&quot; are the guys now refusing to cry out.</p>

<p>Oh, and it&#39;s increasingly more beholden to big business interests. &quot;Drain the swamp&quot; in-fucking-deed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>respect for the limitations on government</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The administration is openly flouting ethics rules and actual laws and is cruising by on that without a care because Congress is complicit. When they move to get what they want, the Bill of Rights isn&#39;t going to stop them--and the same people now &quot;championing&quot; that collection of amendments are going to roll the fuck over and let it happen. Fess up; the Bill of Rights and the Constitution aren&#39;t values to these people, they&#39;re a fucking bludgeon to be wielded against &quot;the enemy&quot;, and ignored whenever it applies to them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>masculinity and femininity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A single view of each that was never truly representative of America as a whole from a specific time period that has been fantasized and fetishized to a ridiculous degree. Just as Trump is a poor man&#39;s idea of a rich man, he&#39;s a beta cuck&#39;s idea of an alpha male. He&#39;s a strongman, not a strong man; a raging idiot man-child who best appeals to basement-dwelling virgins who blame, paradoxically, their inability to get a date on every woman being a <em>slut</em>. Fucking pathetic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>open inquiry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus Christ, just try to get a straight answer out of anyone in this administration.</p>

<p>You live in Tumblr screenshots and think every woman has six piercings and neon hair and is just itching to kill the male gender or give them hormone therapy. I&#39;d say this is merely the opposite side of the coin as the truly nutzo &quot;SJWs&quot; who think all men are seeking a return to the days when women were chattel, but <em>they&#39;re more fucking right on that point than a bunch of 4chan incels who think baristas will turn every child gay</em>.</p>

<p>based on what? i mean i don&#39;t support clinton and didn&#39;t in the election, but you can&#39;t know that he is better by any metric. </p>

<p>also, your pessimism is understandable, and a feature of the system, not a bug. you (as in trump supporters not just you personally) were sold some kind of hope of change. and guess, was a conman is con. so here we are, a bunch of disillusioned people basing their politics not on any kind of collective hope or will, but petty grievances and drummed up vengeance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that people talking about changing the two party system do nothing for four years and then vote for Jill Stein or whatever Libertarian is running. If you believe the Greens or the Libertarians are better, you need to support them at local and state levels first. Build a national party from the ground up. When that party is established, you field national candidates and eventually get to the presidency. Voting third party every four years and doing dick for the rest of the time won&#39;t do anything. Political parties don&#39;t start from the top and work down. Problem is the Greens and Libertarians have no interest in this. Jill Stein ran to stoke her who. What&#39;s she doing now? Is she helping her party organize and raise money to field candidates in local and state elections? Nope. She&#39;ll just have another vanity run in 2020 and nothing at all will change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I voted 3rd party because I will never vote for a candidate I can&#39;t believe in. I&#39;m a pretty moderate though. I&#39;ve voted mostly R, but went for D in the 2004 because of 9/11. If the R&#39;s would support more civil rights in the future, I&#39;d be more likely to support them over the D&#39;s, yet they consistently vote against LGBT and women and I cannot support that. I will always vote for the person over the party. I am a firm believer that if we removed the letter after the candidates name, we would find ourselves voting for the best candidate rather than the party it represents.</p>

<p>No, there&#39;s not. Obama was a Neocon centrist Warmonger, just like Bush, just like HRC, just like Trump. You&#39;ve just fallen for a few bones like some toothless environmental legislation or Liz Warrens  committee which has also been rendered largely useless through Bipartisanship. There is. No. Difference. The Republic was fucked either way- HRC wanted a no-fly zone in Syria and escalation with Russia either way. War in the Middle East and Korea would still be on the table. </p>

<p>Not to mention the economics- Obama, HRC, Trump, all follow the Neoliberal way of Corporatism and deregulation disguised as toothless legislation. Wake up. There was no good option in &#39;16, HRC was bad, Trump was bad, Obama was bad...there were no good options. Don&#39;t pretend the Democrats and HRC are somehow &quot;better&quot;, otherwise you&#39;re obviously playing into the 2-Party trap. </p>

<p>Because they couldn&#39;t even stomach any sort of pretend regulations. They wanted to sell CDO&#39;s again, they wanted to get back to business as usual, and they wanted to make sure that it was known who had the power. Doesn&#39;t matter if it was toothless..they wanted it gone anyways.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want regulation repealed, nice straw man tho. I wanted real regulation in the first place. It took almost 70 years to repeal the last of the New Deal reforms and Dodd-Frank wasn&#39;t anything close to Glass-Steagall.</p>

<p>They are Big Tent organizations and currently the factions at the top are both Corporatist shills. HRC and Obama represented the Corporate side of the Party, with its agenda and donor base.

<p>The Democratic Party needs stormed from the ground up by the People. This is happening, slowly, with organizations formed in the wake of Bernies campaign like Our Revolution. 8 State Parties have been taken from the Corporatists, and Cali would have been too, if the Party hadn&#39;t literally stuffed ballots to keep Kimberly Ellis out.</p>

<p>No one deserves your vote because they are a Democrat, or because they won the Primaries. If their record shows that they are a Neoliberal/Neocon warmonger, they shouldn&#39;t be voted for, especially under the pathetic guise of &quot;lesser of two evils&quot;. It&#39;s time we start standing up for integrity again, and replace these centrist fools with real progressives.</p>

<p>We accomplish this, as I said, through the grassroots. The smallest organizational unit of the Democratic Party is the Precinct. Precinct Chairs vote for County Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National chairs. This is how we take the Party from the cold dead hands of the Corporatists like HRC or Obama. Until this is done, I will not be voting for a Dem unless they align with my beliefs. 8 State Parties is a good start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I think many people are losing sight of is that many votes to Trump weren&#39;t exactly &quot;FOR&quot; Trump it was more an &quot;AGAINST&quot; Hillary vote. My initial vote for Trump was because I wanted to do anything I could to ensure Hillary would not become President. Mission accomplished there. My support went from against Hillary, For Trump, and now....if I&#39;m being honest with myself.....I don&#39;t know what the heck is going on these days. I know (or at least believe) the Democrats/Liberals are horrible and ruining many facets of society (micro-aggressions and gender fluidity? really? fuck off) but the more I learn about Trump it&#39;s like what is going on man? Why is Kushner getting security revoked while up to his eyes in debt? Why are there always these odd/weird things going on in your White House? Why are so many people getting fired? I like to think &quot;hey at least he&#39;s transparent&quot; but at this point he&#39;s just this focal point to fixate on and keep us distracted (IMO). Example: the other day I&#39;m driving home from work listening to the radio and this lady chimes in out of nowhere she&#39;s like &quot;But what about Stormy Daniels? Like how crazy would it be if THAT&#39;S what took down Trump&quot; and my first thoughts were A) Clinton did it first IN OFFICE and B) how fucking retarded does one need to be to think an affair WELL before being in office have any grounds to impeach a President?  Well.....after driving a few miles I realized &quot;wait a minute......who the fuck cares about any of that? there has to be something more important to discuss?&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m in a weird place. My faith in the man I voted for has dwindled considerably. I still don&#39;t like liberals and I don&#39;t like even more that even as I type this and being open I should be smart enough to know the &quot;us v them&quot; strategy is actively working on me. Sucks man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your honesty is refreshing and I can sense your frustration with how things turned out once Trump got in. But I still don’t understand why anyone bought into his promises.</p>

<p>He was a raging psycho on his campaign trail. Unhinged, rude, lacking direction and morals so his presidency was never going to be anything other than carnage and confusion.</p>

<p>Also the excuse that people didn’t want to elect Hilary so voted for Trump is idiotic. The same thing happened in the UK over Brexit, many didn’t know what it would involve or the implications but voted as they wanted something different, now the UK is fucked. Why waste the vote if you don’t know what it’s about, the same applied to Trump!</p>

<p>I hope you your sake and as well as ours things get better but it does look bleak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t this he is necessarily dumb but he lacks the class and morals to hold that position in office. The United States get involved in so much world politics and trade but Trump throws all known processes out of the window and does what he wants.</p>

<p>This is no way to run office or a country. It’s unpredictable and at times dangerous.</p>

<p>This is without mentioning his xenophobic attitude towards non-white people, non-Americans, his view and treatment of women and a whole list of other issues. I wish for Trump and his whole family to be banished to the depths of hell. </p>

<p>But I think we’ll have to agree to disagree on some of these things. :)</p>

<p>I too am worried about foreign influence and was terribly concerned about the 10&#39;s of millions of dollars flowing into the Clinton Foundation from middle eastern governments.</p>

<p>I worry about escalating war, and took deadly serious her promise to establish a no fly zone over Syria....which was as likely to lead us to a shooting war with Russia as anything in history.</p>

<p>She is dishonest.  Her behavior is criminal.  I&#39;m not just talking about her total bullshit email scandal lies.  I&#39;m not talking about Whitewater (where both their business Partners and Bill Lt. Governor were convicted but we are expected to believe that they were squeaky clean).  All I need to know that I would never ever vote for her is the Marc Rich Pardon that Bill sold in exchange for a donation to Hillary&#39;s Senate campaign and only wasn&#39;t pursued because the republicans had the Starr investigation backfire on them so badly.  </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is totally unscrupulous and just as much of a liar as Trump is, although she is a bit smarter about it and get&#39;s a far bigger pass from the media.  She had no business on the Presidential ticket, and if the Democrats had run a decent candidate Trump would not be in office today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Hillary campaign asking their media pals to promote the extreme republicans so that they would have an easy oponent in the General certainly didn’t help...but no I certainly don’t absolve the Republicans of responsibility.  It just drives me crazy that the Democrats refuse to acknowledge they allowed their primary to be stolen by a candidate so bad that she couldn’t manage to beat a dishonest moron who was obviously out of his depth.  We democrats are burning all our energy in a pointless “resist” movement when we should be focusing on fixing the DNC and making sure that a good candidate that can win is up in 2020.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen to that. Trump supporters should feel ashamed. All the signs of Trump being a terrible Presidenti candidate were quite apparent during his campaign and even well before that.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, there is no time for feelings. We need to get this man out of office and start restoring our democratic institutions for the sake of country. We don&#39;t need to convince Trump supporters they are wrong, we just need to turn out and vote and speak up because there a lot more us than them in this country. The vast majority of them are a lost cause.</p>

<p>Instead of believing the &quot;fake news&quot; bullshit and Trump&#39;s asinine rhetoric, they could have done their own research and found that he has been completely full of shit his entire life. It wasn&#39;t hard to dig that info up before the election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive spent the time since I was awake this morning being critical of this garbage over at TD and I&#39;ve been getting fairly good responses. I was just watching a video earlier of trump talking about firing tillerson in part over Iran and I said to my girlfriend.&quot;Im not sure if Im still liking this guy...&quot; and sadly day by day it seems we both are starting to feel that way and we never, ever supported anyone from our so called government until trump came along. </p>

<p>People just gotta be honest with themselves and not make perpetual excuses for anyone regarding how much their own ego is obviously attached to it. 
Edit added a few things and corrected a few mistakes I hate this touch screen on this phone.</p>

<p>The people Trump has specifically selected have been corrupt. You don&#39;t get to blame people in general for the people he chose being scum. There are plenty of people who could head up NASA, but Trump has appointed nobody.</p>

He states that he made it up on the spot (something like that) and it spread like wildfire so we went with it. He then goes on to say it will have NO impact on his decisions and he does not really &#39;get it&#39;.

<p>No concern there for the people who are on the receiving end of American warmongering? The death toll in Iraq is around half a million people. Seems they&#39;re the ones making the sacrifices.</p>

<p>Also, to visit your other post...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>American hegemony</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, neoliberal capitalism, the war on drugs and mass surveillance pushed on other nations. Yeah, sounds great.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cheap consumer goods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason those goods are cheap is because people along the supply chain, from manufacturers to transporters to retail workers, are severely underpaid. Real wages have stagnated since the 70&#39;s, while the top 1% is seeing record gains in their wealth and income.</p>

<p>My country is a friend and an ally of America, and yet even here there are some visceral benefits to the USA&#39;s global decline in influence. I don&#39;t want to see a collapsed USA, but I do think a multipolar world, without any single entity dominating, is a fairer one.</p>

I think a lot of people just had hope that he would be different, that he might just possibly be different than the Washington elites that have been feeding us lies and false hopes for the last however many years. Id say one of the best things Trump being elected did is that it showed people an “outsider” had a chance. That we didn’t have to just vote for who’s turn it was next. Also dropped a lot of red pills and showed people how corrupt the system really has been for so long. Idk man I just wish there was something more we could do to take our country back and I think a lot of people felt the same way and thought trump was that ticket out. We’re gonna drain the swamp one way or another, trump might not be that ticket out but a lot of people woke up because of this election and showed people that’s what needs to be done. </p>

<p>Now, how a self proclaimed billionaire from NY who was a democrat 10 years ago and has gold crown molding on his Manhattan penthouse  convinced the poor and the working class that he is a &quot;Populist&quot; and totally one of them, I have to say, it&#39;s fucking amazing. </p>

<p>No thanks to COINTELPRO I suppose. Still, there is only so much supression one can do when material conditions are getting really bad. And they are almost there. The next depression might be the final nail in the coffin. People are already dying from poverty at a steady rate. Imagine how horrifying it will be when our current economix bubble pops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for touching on a point most people don’t seem to get. Democracy is extremely imperfect, obviously. But part of that is because popular majorities are dangerous. We have so many layers of government, some appointed and some elected, as not only a check on one another but also as a check on the will of the voters. The 17th amendment was probably a bad idea. So are primaries, at least for the President. </p>

<p>That is sweeping <em>so</em> much shit under the rug. He is so much worse than that. He&#39;s corrupt. He&#39;s almost certainly a rapist. He&#39;s a bigot. He&#39;s literally just fucking stupid. He&#39;s a narcissist. It&#39;s always been Trump first, not America first. And these were all things we knew before the election.</p>

<p>But if you say all that, you can&#39;t compare him to Hillary because now she looks like the second coming of Christ. So you saying &quot;douchebag millionaire&quot; is, once again, propagating this false equivalency that got him elected him the first place. Just fucking stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly and people are finally accepting or at least aware that the president can be all of those things and still be in the highest position of power. My hope is that people start questioning to find the precedent that allowed such abuses go unpunished. Trump and Hillary are both symptoms of a system that doesn&#39;t represent the people, but rather just the corporations. For the first time in my life, almost everyone agrees on that premise now. That corporations run our government. There is no doubt anymore with Trump.</p>

<p>Democracy dies in darkness. An aware population is our only chance at beating the corrupt actors that control our government. This is was real democracy looks like, an engaged citizenry holding the government&#39;s toes to the fire. We are all just used to living in a corporatocracy that would pacify everyone&#39;s concerns, that this reality seems strange to many. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Populism was spawned by the farmers of this nation after price ficiing and market manipulation in early America almost starved them out.  </p>

<p>Populism was a way and a movement that had Caravan&#39;s of farmers starting their own merchantiles and banking systems through a series of co-operatives, granges, and farmer backed financing instead of the vulturistic banks and railroads who wouldn&#39;t ship produce/fruits/meat if the farmers were to make a profit.</p>

<p>It had its up and downs, but if &quot;Populism&quot; is not a racket.  Its when the oppressed are so trodden down, so in despair the popular thing to do is anything but what isn&#39;t working. It means &quot;support for the ordinary people.&quot;</p>

<p>The populist movment during the early part of this nations history is a real struggle for folks, who often didn&#39;t make enough money each year until they died. Dying with nothing, and they bank every year taking a bit more land and adding more debt.  They controlled/colluded with the Banks/Railroads/Supply houses to make sure the farmers  couldn&#39;t sell at fair market values.  </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a racket, and populism is akin to poking a down person until they break.  They have tried to use the system, and at every door its slammed in their face year after year, until they have nothing, are losing their land, feel completely ignored, and they find great strength in numbers and camaraderie. Powerful stuff.</p>

Only once their racist shit rally ended up with one of their supporters killing someone and injurying another 19 people, did they decide it was time to delete everything and pretend like it never happened.</p>

<p>And before you say &quot;the subreddit didn&#39;t support it, someone made a post about it and when the mods saw it they deleted it!&quot; That is in fact not true! This was a stickied post at the top of the subreddit obviously meaning that a mod not only saw it, but believed it was worthy of making sure everyone on the subreddit got to see it as it was one of the two most important things in the subreddit. Only once their racist shit rally ended up with one of their supporters killing someone and injurying another 19 people, did they decide it was time to delete everything and pretend like it never happened.</p>

<p>did you even bother to read the material found at the first link? here is a representative quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what we must do. No more infighting, I don&#39;t agree with them, they likely hate me, but not as much as we hate the communist left and how much they hate us. We&#39;re all fascists to them anyway, doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re an Ancap - if they seize power you&#39;ll be put up against a wall just the same.</p>

<p>i trust that it&#39;s obvious that the person who wrote that is not a white supremacist.</p>

In fact, that shit sounds like a raving lunatic, fearful and paranoid, in the <em>fraying sanity</em> kinda way. &quot;...as we hate the communist left and how much they hate us. &quot;Let me ask a simple, <em>simple</em> question: What America are you living in that makes you afraid of <em>communists</em> such that you would <em>hate</em> them?</p>

<p>There is no &quot;communism&quot; here. This moment of this nation is an absolute pinnacle of rabid, unflinching consumer capitalism. This is not an accident, as the machine has ratcheted unerringly in that direction for half a century. The fact that you are so sweepingly, blissfully <em>unaware and ignorant</em> of <em>this reality</em>, of this blindly reckless acquisition of power that is modern America... </p>

<p>It&#39;s like you don&#39;t understand you already won. Can you not grasp the history of your supposed philosophy&#39;s victories? </p>

<p>You have nothing to be afraid of except yourself. Who is tearing you from the top of the mountain that you must kick and beat on those below? This is the concept, for ya&#39;ll and our president, that has yet to register.</p>

<p>while there are many errors in your post to which reply should (and most likely will) be made, i will begin by noting that you have erred in the apparent assumption that i am in favor of capitalism. to be clear: i consider both capitalism and communism to be serious intellectual and moral errors.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be perfectly clear with you guys that many of the people who will be there are National Socialist and Ethnostate sort of groups. I don’t endorse them. In this case, the pursuit of preserving without shame white culture, our goals happen to align. I’ll be there regardless of the questionable company because saving history is more important than our differences. This is probably why they named the event &#39;Unite the Right.&#39; Speaking for myself only, I won&#39;t be punching right. We need to save civilization first, we can argue about the exact details later.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aka &quot;I don&#39;t openly support white supremacists but we need to preserve white culture and white supremacists will help me preserve white culture. But I&#39;m totally not a white supremacist or racist despite me feeling that statues of Confederate leaders and traitors to the government of the United States somehow are an inherent and integral part of white culture.&quot;</p>

<p>Talk about a fucking dog whistle. Liberals are attacking white culture by wanting to remove the statues of literal traitors to the United States? Even if you ignore that they were traitors to the United States and that they reason they tried to leave the union was because they wanted to own slaves by just calling them Confederate leaders, what part of the Confederacy is ingrained in <strong>white</strong> culture? I&#39;m white and my family fought for the Union in the Civil War; the idea that Confederate leaders are a part of white culture is fucking insulting. How are Confederate leaders a part of white culture? Even Union leaders aren&#39;t part of white culture. I&#39;ll give you Confederate leaders could be a part of <strong>southern</strong> culture and history; there should be no argument about that the same way that there should be no argument that the Union would be a part of <strong>northern</strong> culture. Confederate leaders should not be celebrated, what they stood for <strong>is</strong> shameful. There should be no pride in what they fought for; hundreds of thousands of people died for their belief that they had a right to enslave fellow human beings. Tearing down statues of Nazi leaders isn&#39;t an attack on <strong>white</strong> culture; it&#39;s an attack on the shameful beliefs Nazi leaders stood for.</p>

<p>But that isn&#39;t what they said, they said <strong>white</strong> culture was under attack which is complete horseshit. They weren&#39;t defending <strong>southern</strong> culture (which is also a bullshit argument but a lot better than <strong>white</strong> culture) and white supremacists just happened to be unfortunate allies in defending <strong>southern</strong> culture and history. They were trying to gather people to defend the supposed attack on <strong>white</strong> culture and it was supposedly super unfortunate that a ton of white supremacists where going to show up to the march to defend <strong>white</strong> culture as well.</p>

<p>2016 was an election about reform, she should have never ran. She was vastly unpopular, huge swaths of the US would never vote for her in a million years. Thanks to her we got a President for negative change, instead of positive change. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m not the only person who realizes this. The only good thing that might come from Trump is that people will be even more desperate for reform after he and the GOP are done.</p>

<p>-Expanse of domestic drilling</p>

<p>-Foreign Steel Tariffs</p>

<p>-Bizarre capitulation by Kim Jong Un</p>

<p>-Crackdown on clearance in the administration</p>

<p>-Multiple &quot;warhawk&quot; statements about blood in Syria and backing the UK</p>

<p>-Gag orders in the last 24 hours placed on military personnel contact with all media</p>

<p>-New forms of biological weapons announced by Russia, including smallpox delivery</p>

<p>-CDC working on contract to stockpile smallpox vaccines until the end of the year</p>

<p>-Removal of Tillerson, his vocal support, and Trump&#39;s assistant over a security issue - replacing Tillerson with Pompoe (military engineer)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the firing was due to collusion of any type, it was to shut up the potential blabber-mouths about an upcoming military move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nonsense. They wouldnt choose to not use them because of morals, they would choose to not use them because of MAD. It would be perfectly possible for the US and Russia to wage a full scale conventional war against each other without either side using nukes, because MAD would always remain in effect. As long as neither side is actively seeking total destruction of the other side as the end goal for the war, it would never be worth it for either side to use nukes, because any nuclear strike would result in immediate total annihilation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With regards to who would come out on top in a conventional, non-nuclear war, I keep seeing this American arrogance that they could crush Russia. This isn’t so much the case though, and it’s a dangerous assumption to make.</p>

<p>If you read interviews with American generals, they don&#39;t fancy their chances in a hypothetical land war with Russia in Europe. </p>

<p>For the past 30-40 years now, America has geared its military for asymmetrical warfare - it simply isn&#39;t prepared to fight an enemy as well equipped as itself. America has spent the last fifteen years fighting brutal insurgency wars globally. America has to have the capacity to fight anywhere, anytime, for just about any reason.
Russia doesn’t operate like that. The only tactic Russia have ever had, militarily, is in an all-out land war. When it comes to that sort of conflict, their experience (dating from, at minimum, the Civil War to now) is unparalleled.
If they tried to run an extended counter-insurgency like America does, they’d do even worse than America. But they’re not. Russia only does one thing, and they do it <em>well</em>. And it’ll take some hefty reorganisation and restructuring until America is ready to engage them on their terms.
Russian tanks could simply roll over most of Europe and America would not be able to do much about it.</p>

<p>This is due to a) America&#39;s lack of precision guided munitions and the US Army&#39;s inability to sustain large troop presences overseas for extended periods of time (cf with erosion of ground combat capability in Afghanistan + Iraq deployments, and if NATO ran short on precision munitions during the Libyan conflict in 2011 (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/AF3O7ElD_story.html?utm_term=.4abfd12a20b3">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/AF3O7ElD_story.html?utm_term=.4abfd12a20b3</a>), imagine the issues it (America included) would have against Russia).
Furthermore, America&#39;s airpower isn&#39;t the same as it used to be 10/15 years ago. Many older aircraft are being retired, and the funds that were previously being used to maintain and upgrade them are increasingly being sidelined into the massively over budget, and arguably failing, F-35 program.
Also, in a war in Eastern Europe, Russia would presumably be fighting along its own border, and be therefore able to open up new fronts wherever it pleases, making it hard for America + Nato to fight sustained battles. Meanwhile, Russia&#39;s use of &quot;Hybrid Warfare&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_warfare">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_warfare</a>) further complicates things in comparison to fighting a traditional enemy with a traditional doctrine.
Four Star General Odierno has previously stated that the US would need 60 percent minimum of the Army ready to successfully engage Russia. The US isn&#39;t even close to that kind of readiness. The Pentagon estimates that by the end of 2020, the Army will have 33 percent ready.</p>

<p>Also, before you say numbers aren&#39;t everything. Well, up to a point... But, during the cold war there were a quarter of a million US troops stationed in Europe. These days, there are 31,000. This is roughly equivalent to the number stationed in South Korea. Is the failed state of North Korea really to be seen as an equivalent threat as Russia? And the US military (not just its garrisons) is ever continuing to shrink.</p>

<p>Sorry about the rambling nature of the comment. I copied it from a YouTube comment I made about a month ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve been were soft-pushing that Russia would influence the election before the election ever happened. Clinton was banging the war drum in the debates. It&#39;s been almost 20 years since 9/11 and most people in the U.S. are no longer gung-ho about the war on terror. They&#39;ve been grooming Russia as the next big enemy for the better part for like the last five years, it really started ramping up with the Syria/ISIS coverage. These are not novel strategies, it&#39;s just plain old pro-war propaganda. And, surprise surprise, people are <em>clamoring</em> for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What terrible logic. The isreal thing was officially an accident. There shouldve been more investigation to see if it really was one or not, but you cant declare them an enemy without establishing conclusively that it was a purposeful attack. Also, compensated both the families of the people who died and our government for the damage to the ship. Where is the compensation from Russia? The Russian attack was entirely purposeful, and nobody has even claimed that is wasnt. Are you so anti american that you would just assume that an attack against america was an accident, even when the perpetrator of the attack isnt claiming that it was accidental? Whens the last time you attacked an american military installation on accident? That isnt one of those &quot;whoops, mistakes happen&quot; kind of incidents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>incredibly destructive? in what way? theres no threat of nuclear war, which considering the circumstances would be relatively logical. just because hes bad doesnt mean it couldnt be a thousand times worse. he isnt the worst person on the planet, and dealing with an adversary you know is much easier than trying to guess what the new guy is going to do.  </p>

<p>id say the rhetoric you posit is foolish. foolish in the archetypal sense. walking off a cliff without knowing it. even saying that its better than knowing where the edge of cliff is. pretty foolish IMO    </p>

<p>and im not going to participate in two comment lines with you, so ill address the other one here: nobody is saying let them get away with it. just that if youre going to get all gung ho and put sanctions on people for such things, it seems a bit uneven. considering theres precedent for other allies attacking troops, with very little repercussions.</p>

<p>It doesnt matter how you want to frame them. They are our enemies. Wishing they werent wont change that. They are trying to destroy NATO.

    <div class="md"><p>thats fine dude, obviously i was referring to other countries, not russia. i still never called them allies, however when googling it, it seems that they are, or at least theres a reasonable argument to use that term.  </p>

<p>obviously anyone sanctioned by nato would want to circumvent that or tear it down. im suprised russia hasnt done more, or made more threats. however frothing at the mouth as if they are enemies isnt helping anything.   </p>

<p>you wanna talk like you know everything then why dont you go into politics and rectify this stuff by warring with the enemy? im saying its much more nuanced than how you describe it and isnt helping the citizens of russia, yknow the ones without any power to do anything. the premise of this conversation is that this type of extremist rhetoric only helps the people at the top and doesnt do anything for the poor, normal humans just living day to day.</p>

<p>If we merely present that steel jobs increase, we may logically conclude that the tariffs are good for workers in America. I replied to make sure people don&#39;t draw that conclusion. :)</p>

<p>That&#39;s all it takes though, one self-researched theory and you start to question other perceived truths. That same analysis is applied to conspiracies pushed by others. You have to weed through the bullshit by doing your own research, unfortunately there is no such thing as an objective conspiracy, because then it&#39;s a truth, right? Digest as much information as possible!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree - the worst thing that happened to the military industrial complex was the collapse of the USSR, because without them there really was no excuse for the huge military spending.</p>

<p>Now that Russia is back on its feet, they&#39;re happy to go back to playing the old paradigm - constant fear and hype to justify piping national funds into Lockheed-Martin &amp; friends.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything more than that, and I think everyone involved, including Russia, is pretty ok with this. Having a Great Evil abroad makes the domestic population much more compliant, which is a mutual benefit for all the governments involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend, you are late to this game. And unfortunately, there are some things you should be aware of. First, however, I want to tell you that you are right about war. I called it in 2000 with W. His objective was to take 7 countries that do not have a western controlled central bank (Imf, world Bank, Rothschild bank). He failed. Obama continued the work in terms of Libya and Syria. Remember, ghaddafi wanted to replace the petro dollar with gold to value the Libyan dinar. Of those seven, three still survive;n. Korea, Syria, and Iran. Syria is in shambles, n. Korea is preparing talks, and Iran is trying to help Syria. This, unlike wwi, will be the war to end all wars. The American people have failed to stop the corruption and as such have failed the world.</p>

<p>I, personally, welcome this war. I hope the petro dollar loses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, unfortunately, it&#39;s just a minority of r/conspiracy traffic that is the loudest and politics is just unavoidable as of the past two years. That&#39;s all anyone ever talks about anymore, and it&#39;s never about the real political issues. It&#39;s either Trump should be impeached or Hillary is crooked. That&#39;s it. Not saying either is wrong, but how about pointing out the the mainstream dems pulled a victory right out from under Sanders. How about discuss why the two party system is corrupt and broken. Talk about how we&#39;re actually in a monarchy where money is king?</p>

<p>That was Hillary. If the choice was between Sanders and Trump, I think people would have voted for Sanders. With the choice being Hillary or Trump, people hate Hillary so much they voted against Hillary (not so much for Trump).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who believes that the DNC had any measurable impact on Bernie&#39;s ability to win that primary is a sheep themselves. He lost by 3 million votes. He lost that primary on Super Tuesday. The only reason he was able to see the election through to the primary was because he was financed by small contributions, AKA people who couldn&#39;t see which way the wind was blowing. Corporate donors would have abandoned him when he dipped below a 200 pledged delegate deficit. That happened long before any of the alleged fuckery by the DNC.</p>

<p>Continuing to insist that Bernie lost the election for any other reason than the incompetence of his own campaign is doing nothing but setting up future progressives for failure. How about doing a legitimate post-mortem instead? Maybe look at the fact that Bernie failed utterly to garner support from minorities? Or how about the fact that the only contests he was able to consistently win were caucuses? Yeah, you&#39;re right though. It&#39;s all the DNC&#39;s fault. What a joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that it&#39;s not just Sanders. It&#39;s anyone who doesn&#39;t have money, and that&#39;s my point. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t own at least a few million dollars that you can put into your campaign (and turn heads of the major corporations, and pay off key people)...<em>and</em> as president, if you&#39;re not going to do your part to ensure the millionaires&#39; bank accounts are safe (ie cut medical industry costs, raise taxes on the rich, do stuff for the low man on the totem pole), you&#39;re never going to make it. It can be Sanders, it can be Paul from a decade ago, it can be Joe Schmo...the conspiracy here (and what I&#39;m fed up with) is that the system is rigged to keep the bigwigs in office because money is king.</p>

<p>But no, every average person in America: &quot;Donald Trump is the worst...Clinton would&#39;ve fixed everything.&quot; Nope. </p>

<p>Obama said a lot of things about helping the citizens, things didn&#39;t change that much. Whether it&#39;s at the presidential level or not, things all over the government are messed up. Obama even slammed expensive healthcare on people who couldn&#39;t afford it...that&#39;s not helping <em>anyone</em> financially except for the healthcare industry...go figure.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m going off topic. Sanders is just the latest and easiest example of the point I&#39;m trying to make: Good people won&#39;t get into office, even with tons more effort into the campaign. They need money that they just don&#39;t have, and they&#39;re constantly blocked by people who are simple-minded afraid to vote for anything other than democrats or republicans.</p>

<p>Yes, this is obvious to the point that it&#39;s not a conspiracy. No one seems to have a problem with Israel massively influencing US politics? Am I missing something here?</p>

<p>The Russians posted some stuff on social media. That&#39;s the big thing, right? They posted shitty memes on Twitter. Whoa dude. Just hack my elections up.</p>

<p>This thread has a completely different tone than this sub usually has. 100% being botted/invaded/whatever.</p>

<p>Apparently. The conspiracy is that Trump is trying to hide his connections to Russia, not that Russia is trying to influence the US.</p>

<p>&quot;Russia, find those emails plz?&quot; - Trump </p>

<p>&quot;No prob mate, here ya go&quot; -  Russia</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, this will distract nicely from the Billy Bush Bang Bus story&quot; - Trump</p>

<p>Secret meetings, money changing hands, favors going back and forth. This is Conspiracy101. </p>

<p>People protest, immediately assume a conspiracy where Soros is paying protesters. Trump asks for Russian help, has secret meetings, constantly lies about them, but no conspiracy.</p>

<p>Solid conspiracy consistency.</p>

<p>I am thinking the same thing.</p>

<p>The Russian &quot;hacking&quot;, &quot;meddling&quot;, &quot;meme warfare&quot;  narrative must not be catching onas well as they had hoped.</p>

<p>I honestly believe that all of this effort on part of the media and the DNC is to pin Trump&#39;s win on Russia. It is being done to avoid the cold haed truth which is that they fucked up. They don&#39;t want people pinning Clinton&#39;s loss on a rigged primary or on a media which continually them that she was the most qualified candidate in history and couldn&#39;t possibly lose to anyone.  Because that sort of truth would erode the public&#39;s trust in the DNC and the news media. It&#39;s even harder to admit that if Clinton hadn&#39;t essentially bought her nomination, that Sander&#39;s probably would have won. And since the media was complicit in downplaying him all through the primary, they don&#39;t want people to focus on that either.</p>

<p>So all they talk about is Trump and how he must be a Russian puppet who got a bunch of bots on twitter to help him win the election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I really don&#39;t get this. This sub, well before Trump, has always had low-effort posts with Fox News articles and slightly higher-effort posts with really unsavory racial stuff. It&#39;s like, ignore that and look for the good information. Parse through it and think critically, y&#39;know?</p>

<p>I see way more of these, &quot;This sub is totally compromised, TD2.0, bastion of the alt-right&quot; self-posts than the actual content they claim is filling up the sub, not to mention they always say something like, &quot;go ahead and downvote&quot; and they are rarely, if ever, not so highly voted that they don&#39;t make the front page. I&#39;d argue that these posts are actually counter-productive to the stated goal of getting people to see information from more diverse sources. Really just kinda creates a space for people to argue about nothing, or at most they argue about their perception, which is inherently subjective and therefore impossible to come to any sort of consensus on.</p>

<p>Which kind of gives me the vibe that actually discussing or researching anything isn&#39;t really the poster&#39;s intent...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what Trump supporters do. Deflect. This is how conversations go with them. This is word for word how it went the other day:</p>

<p>Me: What do you think about Stormy Daniels and the hush agreement? 
Them: Nothing compared to Hillary and Pizzagate. Her organization is directly responsible for child sex trafficking! 
Me: Wasn&#39;t the whole Comet Pizza thing mostly debunked? 
Them:  That&#39;s what the democrats will tell you. Wait. Are you a Democrat?
Me: No. I don&#39;t like either party. It polarizes people.
Them: Me neither! That&#39;s why I voted for Trump. He isn&#39;t a politician. 
Me: Well, he <em>is</em> the president. I think by definition that makes him a polit... 
Them: Not a normal one, though!
Me: Maybe not, but what do you think about Stormy Daniels, though?<br/>
Them: Who cares. That porn star slut just wants more money.<br/>
Me: Well doesn&#39;t Trump just want more money too? 
Them: He is the most charitable president we have ever had. 
Me: What charities does he donate to? 
Them: I don&#39;t know the names, but he does. You voted for Hillary didn&#39;t you?
Me: I didn&#39;t vote. They both seemed fairly awful.
Them: If you didn&#39;t vote then you can&#39;t talk about politics.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a personal choice. Who do I vote for when there is nobody I really can honestly endorse? Do I settle? That seems dishonest to me. Yes, I do believe voting is somewhat participatory, but if there was somebody I truly wanted to be president I would probably vote. I have voted for municipal elections and other ballots, but presidency is different. I don&#39;t even like the idea of somebody having that much power. I know this isn&#39;t a popular opinion. If American politics were different, maybe I would feel differently. The way I think about it is similiar to asexuality. Most everything on the planet has sex and humans can mostly agree that it feels good and everyone should do it. Then there are a select amount that don&#39;t like it. It isn&#39;t good for them. It doesn&#39;t make them feel good. That is how I feel about voting. I voted when I was 18 and never did again. I felt shitty about it. I felt like I lied to myself for the lesser of two evils. I didn&#39;t like feeling like that. I didn&#39;t feel good. I think about voting and I still feel that way. I would rather not feel that way and I reserve that right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but if you&#39;re not voting for the lesser of two evils, then you&#39;re essentially voting for the greater evil to win because you&#39;re increasing the odds of that by not voting for the lesser of two evils. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just me but I&#39;d feel more shitty letting a greater evil win when I could have done something to help stop it. Even if the &quot;lesser evil&quot; still isn&#39;t great, there&#39;s still less harm being done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can relate to what you are saying and do not disagree with your feelings on the subject. This is a conundrum. For me, it is a lose-lose situation. If both candidate&#39;s evil is quantifiable then there is no good choice. When everybody lies their way to the top and says whatever they need to in order to get elected, how are you supposed to know who is the lesser of two evils? By who lie is better or who is better at lying? How do we know that Hillary, if she would have been elected, wouldn&#39;t of thrown us off the deep end and we would be in equal or even more shit if she was in office than we are in now? I think that would be difficult to do, but she clearly wasn&#39;t a saint, either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re not sure, then you should look into it more and do more research. Something as important as who controls the United States should elicit you to care enough to become knowledgeable and vote for your conscience based on your research.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m of the opinion that Hillary is not nearly as bad as everyone claims she is, because I actually read up on her a lot and found out that she&#39;s actually a very good politician who has made some honest mistakes. You could say that it&#39;s a conspiracy itself that everyone makes Hillary out to be a demon worshipper after decades of propaganda focused on demonizing her. </p>

<p>Whereas literally every single thing I read about Trump or people who have done business with him, all pointed to him being a complete and total dickbag. I&#39;m not going to sugarcoat it. By all accounts he&#39;s just a straight up, grade A, shitty human being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey that&#39;s a very fair point! I won&#39;t deny it one bit. I wish I had a more positive outlook on American politics. I do have some problems trusting a lot of media and when the candidates are allowed to have their hands in the pockets of the media, it makes every source or headline feel suspect to me. I do research, watch all the debates, read whatever I can, etc. Maybe Hillary wasn&#39;t as bad as all of the propaganda claims.  That is very possible, but there is definitely some truth in all of the claims. The problem is you can&#39;t trust the candidates or the people reporting on them. The experts on the candidates have their own motives and self-interest in mind. They are paid to say the things they say. I <em>know</em> that I don&#39;t like Trump. He is misogynistic, obviously idiotic as you can see by his own speeches and using social media as a platform to voice his opinions in tweets. He lies so often he can&#39;t keep what he says straight. He is everything you don&#39;t want in a person with power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ooh you don&#39;t get it. Well for one Stormy and Trump care. Their lawyers probably care quite a bit. The American public should care because sleeping with a porn star while your wife is pregnant along with other mysoginistc behavior as in talking about grabbing girls by the pussy isn&#39;t very presidential behavior. Not to mention the irony of the Republican party always talking about how family values are important and their fearless leader is doing things like this. It&#39;s just locker room talk, though, right? Making tons of implications that you want to have sex with your own daughter. Just locker room talk. I would say a lot of people care about this behavior of our president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has both houses controlled by his party. If he wasn&#39;t an incompetent fuckwit with a racist, bigoted, and illegal agenda he could have gotten everything that the GOP has supposedly wanted since the Reagan days and he could have gotten it done in his first 100 days, no need for a full year.</p>

<p>Instead he couldn&#39;t even manage to work out a deal on Obamacare, which every republican agreed was the worst thing in history and it was going to bankrupt America. His massive tax reform became massive tax cuts for corporations, small cuts for everyone else with same old tax system, no REFORM at all. The wall isn&#39;t going past the planning stages, prototype all you want, but the funds for the full wall aren&#39;t happening. Infrastructure won&#39;t happen unless it involves selling it to corporations, there is no money for it after the tax cuts. </p>

<p>And of course “Take the guns first, go through due process second”.</p>

<p>For fucks sake, how deluded do you have to be to still believe Trump is going to fulfill his promises. He&#39;ll be lucky to finish out his term.</p>

<p>I tried searching but couldn&#39;t find any source of this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was his own version of President Truman&#39;s line. I guess we should back down and let death camp North Korea threaten to nuke us.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s pretty over the top and counter intuitive.</p>

<p>This is the problem with arguing with trump supporters. You can throw any number of direct, repeated quotes at them, and they still FEEL like Trump doesn&#39;t actually mean it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmmm that&#39;s a book worth of information but let me give some bullet points.</p>

<p>So it started in the 1840&#39;s when Carl Marx decided that everyone should be equal. The basic format of the idea was that the wealthy are evil. This pinned the idea that the poor should rise up against them. This worked well in Russia until the end of the Soviet union when the world found out that the ideology was being used to create dictatorships.</p>

<p>Then in the 1970&#39;s some French dudes figured they could still use the format, they just had to change it up a bit. So instead of rich verse poor it turned into oppressor vs oppressed. Identity politics were born. This ideology has been breeding throw academia since then and evolving over time.</p>

<p>Getting to the NWO they are having trouble taking control just through their propaganda. Mind you the end game is to have complete control. Yet their is too many people that don&#39;t fall for their shit so instead, the new plot is refugees. It&#39;s working well too. First they had to destabilize the middle East to get the ball rolling.</p>

<p>Now they are mass importing people from the third world. Then they are criminalizing criticism of this policies. In many European you can be jailed for saying the wrong thing on line now. This trend will only continue, the more 3rd world refugees they import the more wide spread crime will happen and thus the more freedoms they will have to take away in the name of protecting people. </p>

<p>It gets so much deeper into their attacks on Christianity, national identity, sexuality, marriage, masculinity... it&#39;s all in the name of taking complete control. </p>

<p>Are you following any of this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, he has said political correctness can fuck off through his blazen dialogue. Which is very damaging to the ploy. Then there is deregulation, a huge help. Believe climate change or not, the fact is that it is being used to restrict the means of production and to raise taxes. All in the name of saving the world from the evil CO2, power plants get shit down. Driving up power bills. Gas gets taxes, car registration. They all help to control the people.</p>

<p>When Trump told the Paris climate accord to fuck off, he protected us from that ploy. Then he restricted refugees. He cut corporate taxes to help companies grow and be more free. The new tariffs on steel and aluminum to help equal the play ground. He&#39;s undoing step by step all of the things put in place to fuck over America. If he is part of the swamp, he&#39;s doing a bad job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I share your view on political correctness, maybe not for the exact same reasons but thats beside the point. Taxes are also somewhat of a common ground. We differ drastically after that, however. Donald isn’t helping the energy industry whatsoever. Its not regulation that is crushing energy industries like coal- its the international market. The trend both domestic and foreign is towards natural gas. His focus should be on transitioning Appalachia towards natural gas and not back into a dying industry. His new tariffs are absolutely NOT effective in helping the American public. Short term they’re good for steel/aluminum industry but theyre likely to create a long term raise in the price of any metallic goods and loss of jobs in manufacturing sectors</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Trump&#39;s been a smooth talker that somehow folks believe. I wonder if he was the lesser of two evils or not. His gaining the nomination and ensuing presidency was like watching yet another bully getting ahead while everybody was standing around, afraid to intervene and prevent the beating. </p>

<p>I figure it&#39;s just a different group of folks filling their pockets this term. Either way, we are getting bent over and shafted. But then again, maybe it doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s sitting in that seat, we get bent over no matter what.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s been a smooth talker</p>

<p>I beg to differ. He just spoke small words to even smaller minded people</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart—you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I&#39;m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s true!—but when you&#39;re a conservative Republican they try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what&#39;s going to happen and he was right—who would have thought?), but when you look at what&#39;s going on with the four prisoners—now it used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and even now, I would have said it&#39;s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don&#39;t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.</p>

<p>We won the evangelicals. We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated</p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;m going against my instinct to gloat and make the op feel like crap for making a horrible decision, but that doesn&#39;t help anyone at this point. Dems who voted for Hillary instead of Bernie are just as much to blame in my personal opinion. Realistically we just need to stop picking &#39;teams&#39; and go after the larger problem which is the system that enables psychopaths and corporate government. 
At this point in the game we need as many people to wake against trump as we can. Yeah it&#39;s late, and yeah he never should&#39;ve voted trump, but I&#39;ll take a defector over a diehard, pride-blind supporter. This is a good sign, and I hope more can realize their mistake and learn from it. </p>

<p>HSBC Shuts Russia’s Hermitage as Browder Sued in London</p>

<p>Henry Meyer and Jason Corcoran
HSBC Holdings Plc is closing Hermitage Capital Management Ltd.’s flagship Russia fund just as its co-founder, William Browder, is being sued for libel in London and tried in absentia for tax evasion in Moscow.</p>

<p>“It was too small to continue as a viable concern,” Browder, 48, said by phone yesterday from London, where he’s based. Browder said the closing is “completely” in the hands of HSBC, which is the trustee and manager of the fund.</p>

<p>The Hermitage Fund, which Browder started in 1996 with the late billionaire Edmond Safra, was the largest foreign owner of Russian shares when it peaked at more than $4 billion in 2005, according to Browder. Russia that year barred Browder from the country without explanation, triggering years of legal conflict, including over the 2009 death of Hermitage adviser Sergei Magnitsky while he was in pretrial detention in Moscow.</p>

<p>“HSBC has decided to jettison him because Browder is considered radioactive in Russia,” Eric Kraus, a fixed-income manager at Rolnes Ltd. in Moscow, which oversees about $150 million, said in e-mailed comments. “He had one great competitive advance: he knew how to trade Russia like a Russian during the Yeltsin years -- a time when it was one of the world’s least transparent markets.”</p>

<p>Magnitsky’s Death</p>

<p>The decision to shutter the fund has angered at least one investor, Tim Enneking of Altima Asset Management in Moscow, who said HSBC units provoked the closing by freezing the fund in August to assess how much money to set aside for Hermitage’s legal battles. A former Russian investigator, Pavel Karpov, filed a libel suit against Browder and Hermitage Capital in the U.K. over allegations Karpov was involved in Magnitsky’s death.</p>

<p>In January, after redemption requests reached 65 percent of the frozen fund’s $45.6 million value, HSBC and Browder agreed to wind up the fund, Enneking said, citing a Jan. 24 letter from HSBC, which he provided to Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Enneking said HSBC vowed to update investors on the status of their assets by Feb. 28 and he’s still waiting for answers. Hermitage has achieved an annualized return of more than 17 percent since its inception in 1996, according to a performance factsheet issued in June. The fund has invested in companies such as OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas monopoly, OAO Lukoil, the second-biggest oil producer and Evraz Group SA, the steelmaker part-owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich.</p>

<p>Browder continues to invest through his global emerging markets fund, set up after he was exiled from Russia. He declined to say how much assets it had under management.</p>

<p>Sberbank, VTB</p>

<p>HSBC, Europe’s largest bank by market value, won’t comment on the fund’s closing, said Julia Molchanova, a spokeswoman for the bank in Moscow. Browder declined to comment on the libel case against him, citing his lawyers’ advice.</p>

<p>HSBC is one of 23 foreign and domestic banks Russia chose in 2010 to advise the government on its 1 trillion-ruble ($32 billion) privatization program. Since then, HSBC and other foreign lenders including Barclays Plc and Banco Santander SA have abandoned consumer banking in Russia as state-run OAO Sberbank and VTB Group gained market share.</p>

<p>The British lender is now focusing its Russian operations on debt sales, loan financing and export credits, Mark Stadler, HSBC’s country chief, said in an interview in October.</p>

<p>Browder, a U.S. native and British citizen, has been battling the Russian government with a campaign for legislation in the U.S., Europe and Canada to punish 60 Russian officials he says are responsible for Magnitsky’s death.</p>

<p>Diplomatic Row</p>

<p>Magnitsky, who died at 37, was arrested on tax-evasion charges after he and Browder accused Russian officials of using Hermitage documents to swindle $230 million from the national treasury, a charge the government denies. The case sparked a diplomatic row, with the U.S. imposing sanctions on the Russian officials and Russia retaliating by barring American citizens from adopting Russian orphans.</p>

<p>On March 22, a Moscow court put Browder and the deceased Magnitsky on trial, represented by court-appointed attorneys. They are accused of evading 522 million rubles of taxes. Browder has denied any wrongdoing by either him or Magnitsky, saying March 19 that Russia is “officially defending Magnitsky’s torturers and killers.”</p>

<p>‘Perfectly Legal’</p>

<p>The Interior Ministry this month opened a case against Browder for another alleged crime -- buying shares of state-run Gazprom before restrictions on foreign ownership of the world’s largest gas producer were lifted. Browder and “structures” he created caused at least 3 billion rubles of damage to the state by buying local Gazprom shares and seeking to influence the company in 1999 to 2004, the Interior Ministry said.</p>

<p>Browder said buying Gazprom shares through “derivative structures” was “perfectly legal” during that time.</p>

<p>Hermitage’s relationship with HSBC continues to cause headaches for the U.K. lender, according to Browder. Russian investigators are threatening to seize documents from HSBC’s Moscow offices unless HSBC hands over financial and other information about Hermitage dating back to 1996, Browder said in an e-mailed statement Feb. 15.</p>

<p>Andrei Pilipchuk, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Which is something the Chinese government has been doing purposely with things such as the cultural revolution, forcing tibetans to learn mandarin, simplified Chinese, etc.</p>

<p>Think about what that means with the internet being a major global shift in the way humans communicate including politically. We are seeing a radical global nationalism emerge rapidly emerge.</p>

<p>Times are gonna be tumultuous.</p>

<p>New energy sources (e.g. Petroleum) can also trigger massive change but we haven&#39;t really gotten started on the full impact of that yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how I think it went down. Trump ran for president hoping and expecting to lose because he’s a fake billionaire who owes a fuck load of money and the $millions in non-refundable campaign donations would’ve have dug him out of a hole and also put him on tv as a paid talking head every election season for the rest of his life. </p>

<p>At some point before this he takes his trip to Russia and gets filmed fucking prostitutes among other disgusting acts and this footage falls into the hands of Putin and the Russia intelligence services. The Russian’s instigate a massive online troll and bot campaign to make sure that Trump gets elected. They have their boy who they have incriminating evidence of exactly where they want him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump, a man from corporate construction circles uses racism and bigotry to convince those of low intelligence that we need to spend $billions of tax payer money building walls, Trump’s construction pals get the contracts for the work, the Republicans invest their money into whatever businesses will benefit from this useless wall building task, which explains why they will defend Trump to the end, their money is tied up in his fate.</p>

<p>This guy and his entire presidency has been a lie and a sham.</p>

<p>Right.  It doesn&#39;t apply to every counterexample.  You acted as if Trump was unusual for his finance and promo motivated run.  That is a perfectly normal thing to do in the political world.  The example of Mike Huckabee is germane to the topic, which is why it isn&#39;t whataboutism.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the reference, a Thanksgiving classic on the East coast:</p>

<p>&quot;And we was fined fifty dollars and had to pick up the garbage in the snow, but that&#39;s not what I came to tell you about.</p>

<p>Came to talk about the draft.</p>

<p>They got a building down in New York City, it&#39;s called Whitehall Street, where you walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected and selected. I went down to get my physical examination one day, and I walked in, I sat down, got good and drunk the night before, so I looked and felt my best when I went in that morning. &#39;Cause I wanted to look like the all-American kid from New York City, man I wanted, I wanted to feel like the all-, I wanted to be the all American kid from New York, and I walked in, sat down, I was hung down, brung down, hung up, and all kinds o&#39; mean nasty ugly things. And I waked in and sat down and they gave me a piece of paper, said, &quot;Kid, see the psychiatrist, room 604.&quot;</p>

<p>And I went up there, I said, &quot;Shrink, I want to kill. I mean, I wanna, I wanna kill. Kill. I wanna, I wanna see, I wanna see blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth. Eat dead burnt bodies. I mean kill, kill, kill, kill.&quot; And I started jumpin&#39; up and down yelling, &quot;Kill! Kill!&quot; and he started jumpin&#39; up and down with me and we was both jumping up and down yelling, &quot;Kill! Kill!&quot; And the Sargent came over, pinned a medal on me, sent me down the hall, said, &quot;You&#39;re our boy.&quot;</p>

<p>Contra trafficking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Wikipedia:
<em>A number of writers have alleged that the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in cocaine trafficking during the 1980s. These claims have led to investigations by the United States government, including hearings and reports by the United States House of Representatives, Senate, Department of Justice, and the CIA&#39;s Office of the Inspector General. The subject remains controversial.</em></p>

<p>My main concern is spying on citizens and weaponizing the CIA to thwart the political parties. CIA is not perfect. It&#39;s how we live in a wicked world...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why people always seem to forget that they voted for <em>the lesser of two evils</em> and that the person they&#39;ve elected may only be marginally better at best and may do no better than the one they didn&#39;t want elected. </p>

<p>It was a damned if you do, damned if don&#39;t, election, as I recall it. Two of the most unpopular contenders in the entire history of the country in what can only be called one of most absurd and bizarre presidential contests in the history of the country. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that plenty of people had to hold their nose when they voted for Trump but they weren&#39;t about to see Clinton walk away with the presidency considering her long list of lies, deceits, multiple violations of the law and outright vote-rigging to secure the nomination for herself. </p>

<p>Trump wasn&#39;t without past issues of his own either, but those were by no means as bad and didn&#39;t involve betraying the public trust as one of the country&#39;s highest ranking elected officials.</p>

<p>But just think for a moment, if Trump hadn&#39;t been elected there&#39;d have been no storm of &quot;fake news&quot; where the mainstream media completely destroyed it&#39;s own credibility and revealed the true role that they have been playing for decades. No &quot;censorship&quot; over it either that has exposed the degree to which Google, You-Tube, Facebook, and Twitter are also all complicit in controlling and spinning the official narrative and successfully swaying the public to go along with and never question it.</p>

<p>There&#39;d be no ongoing investigation into the politicization and corruption of the FBI and Department of Justice, or the international bribery and money laundering operation that&#39;s called the Clinton Foundation that would all have continued on as before unbeknownst to most and completely unchecked if Clinton had been elected, and that&#39;s just for openers.</p>

<p>In electing Trump the public basically threw a monkey-wrench into the works that has revealed the true nature and dark underside of both political parties and how Washington really operates and millions of people who were never aware of it before have seen all of that unravelling and exposing itself right before their very eyes in one way or another every day.</p>

<p>In chemistry there&#39;s something that&#39;s called &quot;a catalyst&quot; an element you add to two others to create a reaction that combines and changes them into something else that would never be possible without that catalyst being present and yet that catalyst doesn&#39;t actually become a part of the reaction it triggers or what results from it. It comes out the same way it went in, unchanged by the event.</p>

<p>That is basically how I see Trump who I never had any high expectations for when it came to anything he promised. He&#39;s only one man and he&#39;s disliked by more members of Congress and the Senate than do and who are being just as uncooperative as they possibly can with anything he wants to do. Something that was only to be expected given the reactions to both his nomination and ultimate win on both sides.</p>

<p>What has actually resulted simply by him being elected, however, has become vastly more important. From the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations there has been a steady growth of corruption and  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you really think that any President is going drain the cess pool that is Washington DC? Trump&#39;s utility is in the fact that he has caused the oligarchy to act overtly and consequently expose itself. Prior to Trump&#39;s candidacy, the Deep State was considered a crackpot conspiracy theory. The MSM has exposed itself as a propaganda machine, as opposed to an objective source of news. The public has become far more aware of the fact that Washington no longer represents them and that is a good thing. </p>

<p>from the article:
Haspel is a seasoned spymaster who has avoided the limelight during a 32-year career that has included stints running overseas “black sites” where dangerous terrorists were waterboarded.
While she has won praise from Washington insiders – including Obama Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director Michael Hayden – she will likely face questions on the Hill about her connection to sites where waterboarding took place.</p>

<p>They&#39;re painting it as if Russia is working directly with Trump or as if they have an interest in Republicans succeeding. Anyone who&#39;s watched a presentation by Yuri Bezmenov knows that Russian subversion works by encouraging dissent and in-fighting in a country no matter where it comes from.</p>

<p>While I believe you can find plenty of people with corrupt business practices(as you could with almost any person involved in international business dealings), you&#39;re unlikely to find any collusion between Donald Trump and Russia to make him some sort of Russian puppet.</p>

<p>Some people need to learn that just because your countrymen don&#39;t think the country should be run the same way you do, doesn&#39;t mean you should revert back to reds under the bed mentality.</p>

<p>Obviously Russia&#39;s attack was to undermine our elections.  It&#39;s also obvious they had a specific horse in this race.  And the trump campaign was receptive to working with them.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t even mentioned the reporting on Roger stone and his coordination with wiki leaks!  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a conspiracy here and trump lovers are ignoring it because it goes against their bias.  It&#39;s sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s all you got?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m merely pointing out the facts.  </p>

<p>Why are you ignoring all the facts that I pointed out?  The trump Jr. emails, the indictments, the reporting on Roger Stone and wikileaks?  </p>

<p>I mean, yeah, it&#39;s not mystery that I think trump is a POS.  But the reason I think that is, in large part, because of what his campaign has done.  </p>

<p>At this point, I can&#39;t directly point to trump directly conspiring with Russia.  But there are enough people that are very close to trump (Manafort, Kushner, Flynn, Donnie Jr.) that have all been directly tied to working with Russia in order to further the trump campaign.</p>

<p>How can you refute these facts?</p>

<p>The Russian attack on our elections was real.  And the NY Times, WaPO, WSJ, 60 Minutes, CNN, MSNBC and other main stream media that are reporting it doesn&#39;t make Mueller&#39;s indictments and investigations less credible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mueller is going after trump.</p>

<p>He&#39;s going after his campaign and has also indicted Flynn, Manafort (his campaign chair), Gates (his transition deputy), and Popadapolous....</p>

<p>Not only that, but there&#39;s reporting that Mueller is looking into trump&#39;s obstruction of Justice as well as his financial issues...</p>

<p>So...  Yeah, Mueller is going after trump via his campaign as well as his actions after winning, not to mention his financial ties.</p>

<p>Got anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultures differ from place to place, but what you describe, let&#39;s say crime and hatred and ignorance, isn&#39;t an inherited trait. It&#39;s a learned behavior. You can take a days old child from whatever country you&#39;re in, and raise it in, say Kansas, and it will grow up with all the learned behaviors of a Kansas person. They&#39;ll be (most probably) a republican, have a southern accent, view guns as a right, and believe in trickle down economics. Put that same baby in Palo Alto California and he/she&#39;ll grow up to be a liberal hippie who believes in free love, government regulation, gun control and will have hatred for the NRA. </p>

<p>I&#39;m understanding from your comment that your implication is that because of the fact that the people that surround you are bad people, that they are and will always inherently be bad people. You can correct me if I misunderstood you. </p>

<p>I guess that tells me all that I need to know about you. </p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;m not saying that you should believe that you live in a wonderful place or that you must be lying because all of Thailand is a beautiful country with morals and a culture for pacifism and intolerance of crime. I believe you when you say that you live in a place where the majority of people support either crime or corruption or whatever the major issue is over there. I also believe you when you say that the society you find yourself in is decadent. I&#39;ll even go a step further and agree with you that if you were to take a group of the bad people that you&#39;re surrounded by and place them all together somewhere in the US, that they might start some shit. </p>

<p>But the fact that you generalize and underestimate a human being and his or her intelligence solely on the place where they were born instead of the culture they were born into speaks volumes of who you are and your worldview. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating that all borders disappear all of the sudden. But I am saying that taking steps towards finding a common culture between humans would help eliminate a lot of conflict. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me repeat what I stated: No one encouraged Thailand to create an unfeasably corrupt bearucracy. They did that to themselves. They’ve created and perpetuated an immoral culture because they have a low average IQ. You cannot put blame on another country for magically generating bad behavior. You thus DO NOT UNDERSTAND BASIC PSYCHOLOGY AND HOW INFLUENTIAL THE LIMBIC SYSTEM IS ON A LOW IQ INDIVIDUAL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a brilliant move honestly, and one of the main components is often overlooked: your comment itself is an example of it.</p>

<p>The objective was destabilization of America, not getting Donald Trump elected. The goal wasn&#39;t to screw up America for 4 years, but for several generations. You do that by division. We&#39;re at the point now where the very topic of propaganda is a dividing topic, but not because some people believe and some people don&#39;t; but because <strong>to state that a person&#39;s following was even in part a product of propaganda is to state that a person&#39;s following is illegitimate</strong>. And so people hear that and think the speaker thinks their views are illegitimate, which makes them resent them and turn away even more.</p>

<p>Again it&#39;s a brilliant play, it&#39;s just sad that people don&#39;t realize its ingenuity even as they themselves enact it thinking they&#39;re countering it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When empires degerate it can be stalled, but not reversed.  Trump was never going to drain the swamp though.  He&#39;s never reformerer, hes a mogul.  He capitalizes on corruption.  Hes replacing the parasites with himself.  He&#39;s driven in the nails on the coffin of the economic collapse of the US even further, by cutting taxes.  I think his game plan is to stop the economic collapse by starting WW3 with Iran, Russia, and North Korea.  We&#39;ll see if the rest of the US and World are insane enough to let him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never forget that the after Tesla died the FBI moved in and confiscated all his papers.  These were sent to MIT, to one professor, who stated that there was nothing of relevance in any of those papers.  Many papers mysteriously vanished immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>That Professor was John G Trump.  The uncle of your beloved president.  The Trump family have always been the deepest of deep state.  Donald was sort of like the Paris Hilton of the family, a total prick, but still family.</p>

<p>Everything he said he&#39;d expose was shit that had already been exposed, he wasn&#39;t offering you anything new, just spouting stuff everyone was already fully aware of.  9/11 was probably an inside job (no shit Sherlock), Hillary did bad things in Haiti (again, already old news).  Then he gets in power and does precisely nothing.  Oh except maybe he&#39;ll build a pointless wall to keep the rednecks happy.</p>

<p>Every conspiracy theorist worth his salt that the voting machine are rigged.</p>

<p>Yet they cannot grasp that maybe, just maybe the election was <strong>rigged FOR Trump</strong>.</p>

<p>It makes logical sense right? They can elect anyone they like ergo they elected Trump.</p>

<p>Yet you hear not a pip from the mainstream media, even when they pretend to be against Trump, it&#39;s all Russia this, Russia that. Well Russia certainly couldn&#39;t rig the fucking voting machines.</p>

<p>Not a pip from the alternative media, Alex Jones what are you doing? You are now partisan are you? Why weren&#39;t you partisan when Bush was president?</p>

<p>In fact the whole world collectively seems to have forgotten that Bush was president. We got a clown president then, we got a clown president now. Republicans certainly are the party of Clown Puppets.</p>

<p>Of course the democrats aren&#39;t any better. The slick, intelligent party of cowards. All about the quintessential &quot;Compromise&quot;, whenever there is a crisis and the masses wants to be appeased call in the Democrats to ineffectively fix the problem. Even the bread and circuses they cheapen out and only leave a few crumbs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all one big theater right from the offices of intelligence and Hollywood. The best soap opera in the world since 1948.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would consider less conspiracies one of two possibilities:</p>

<p>1 - More have been solved/proven and this is a good thing
Or
2 - They&#39;re slowly silencing those who know too much (we have seen the deaths of journalists and bloggers in mysterious fashion) and this is a bad thing</p>

<p>Either way, you don&#39;t need a sub to let you know we feel it too. There&#39;s definitely something happening and in these last few years, conspiracies have been on the rise. Frankly, it&#39;s one good trait we have engrained into the new generation. The ability to ask questions, be curious, and learn how to figure out who to believe. Young theorists are everywhere now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m conspiracy theorist and I voted for Trump. But I&#39;ve never been a Trumper. I enjoy the enthusiasm of T_D sometimes, it&#39;s fun and they&#39;ll cover stories that don&#39;t get play elsewhere which is useful.</p>

<p>When Trump said he was going &quot;drain the swamp&quot; I thought ... yeah maybe, if he would even know how and if was even really interested in doing that. It&#39;s a great line it plays well. Give &#39;me hell Donny! But I never bought that. </p>

<p>What I do believe is that the established powers did not want him to win. Just seeing how the system has tried to reject the foreign object crammed down their throats has been an education. It forced them to operate a massive propaganda campaign more nakedly than they would prefer. The credibility of media outlets like NPR and NYT have been damaged significantly (to those who have their eyes open). </p>

<p>His presidency is still somewhat unpredictable. That&#39;s good. It has forced the country to take a harder look at itself than it would have if anyone else had won. That&#39;s good. It prevented Hillary from winning. That&#39;s fucking priceless. </p>

<p>At a social level I like the all out assault on SJW&#39;s that his presidency represents. </p>

<p>One thing that I will say for Trump himself is that he is not given enough credit. He is a very smart man and very accomplished. That should be obvious but incredibly people still act like the &quot;cheeto&quot; just stumbled into office.</p>

<p>But is he interested in valiantly crusading for all that is good and holding the forces of evil accountable? Please. He&#39;s exactly what he appears to be. He&#39;s a huckster par excellence. He&#39;s a self-aggrandizing blowhard with a genius for manipulating the media. He&#39;s got a massive set of balls. </p>

<p>It is unfortunate that this sub has become almost a sister-sub to T_D. But there&#39;s a natural overlap between the people who are willing to go against the grain and think about conspiracies and the people who go against the grain and support Trump. Both groups are also highly likely to view the Clintons as figureheads of the establishment and the natural adversaries of those who oppose that establishment. </p>

<p>Trump could give a fuck about the CIA and torture and all that shit. Trump is interested in what Trump likes. He likes the brand of USA that he grew up with. He&#39;s trying to work on that brand. He also likes golf and shiny gold things and large crowds and being a big swinging dick. I get all of that. None of it makes me starry eyed.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just remember that it took a lot of work to fend off Hillary. Let&#39;s keep listening and sharing important information and theories. Let&#39;s not get overly dramatic. Let&#39;s not be suckers. This is a marathon not a sprint. If the USA and the world is in a better place in 30 years and our grandchildren have something decent to look forward to then good. If not, well let&#39;s not let it be for a lack of fighting. We&#39;re all still in this thing. Keep it up brothers and sisters. Keep it up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except we can see from his businesses that he takes the cheapest possible labour and then screws them over as much as possible. </p>

<p>If you paid close attention to the bankruptcies you could see clear as day they were all structured in such a way that all he did was take a gamble with his name and at the slightest form of trouble he would just cut and run leaving all his contractors unpaid. </p>

<p>And bringing home the troops is a noble cause but you can&#39;t just magically wave a wand and boom all of your troops are now back in America unharmed and the mess America created is magically fixed. </p>

<p>In that regard we have been shouting from the rooftops for 2 years prior to the election that he is UNIQUELY UNQUALLIFIED for the job. </p>

<p>The debates should have made that more than clear enough, sure Clinton may be a neocon but she&#39;s a puppet master not a puppet. </p>

<p>6 months before the election anybody who was half awake could see that trumps strings were being pulled by Russia ( <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html</a> , there was an article which I read that goes into more damning detail back then but a 2 second google brings this up so it will have to suffice. ) </p>

<p>Sure he can run his mouth, but that&#39;s all he&#39;s really good for. At least with Clinton in power it would have been her pulling the strings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get a lot of news from YouTubers like Kyle Kulinski of Secular Talk, he just seems the most authentic news caster I&#39;ve ever seen, EVER. </p>

<p>That and I try and seek out people on the ground when possible. I&#39;m part of global Facebook groups that discuss Politics a lot and they can give me the ground floor scene perfectly and I don&#39;t need to rely on Corporations or Agenda based News Sources. </p>

<p>Through this I&#39;ve been in touch with Kurdish Freedom fighters, a gay man in Turkey, lots of people from London who tell me the &quot;white genocide&quot; in London is absolutely false in every way. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten so much great info this way that I think it&#39;s what keeps me well informed.</p>

<p>Although, it&#39;s ok to read/watch news with an ideological stance, because everyone has an ideology and trying to hide it only makes you look suspect. </p>

<p>Being against the system doesn&#39;t mean you have to vote for the other side, just because it is the only option.

    <div class="md"><p>Such focus on trump everywhere, and its from the same people, either a group of TMOR raiders, new accounts, or tourists from the political subs that don&#39;t see conspiracy falling in line. And as always they are right and everyone else is a Trump supporter whether they are or not.</p>

<p>The number of posts showing manipulation and vote brigading has been constant, and its obvious which side gets the upvotes, and if you don&#39;t then you&#39;re either new or so partisan its not worth trying to have a conversation.  The same side that accuses this sub of being Trump supporters using that gun widely as it is a favorite go-to, but while having that label gun is nice it is spreading false information which is probably going to have unintended consequences.</p>

<p>So yeah, lets suddenly get all fucking political because you have seen the light none of us have, pop off with knowledge which you&#39;ve gleaned as proof positive of whatever, and start another pointless thread.  If it is known this is all T_D supporters (from your detailed logs and character profiles tbs) and is true to any degree, how is this going to change someone&#39;s mind?  And what do you propose? Call our congressman? Write a strongly worded letter directed at...who?  Stage a localized work stoppage, global work stoppage?  I dunno, you tell me with all the right answers.  All I can say is that its not all black and white. There are good lumped in with the bad, and there is bad lumped in with the good. Maybe he is picking some good out of the bad as necessity. </p>

<p>The point is I don&#39;t know, and for sure you don&#39;t. And how all of a sudden new folks are suddenly politico experts and spout off it becoming really tiresome.</p>

<p>I want to know why we haven&#39;t been to the moon.  I want to know more about aliens, ancient civs, if Elon Musk is human, and cool interesting off the beaten path theories about things.</p>

<p>I really really really get that people don&#39;t like trump. I get it. Fuck!</p>

<p>But if you think about it, it&#39;s happened right in front of us. We comment on it and mostly agree with each other that it&#39;s bad and represents a new low. Then what?</p>

<p>Nothing. People basically go tsk, tsk online and life goes on like it&#39;s no big deal. We congratulate each other for &quot;being aware&quot; but nobody actually does anything.</p>

<p>Imo this is no different from Nazi Germany where the average German knew something was wrong but nobody did anything to make a difference. </p>

<p>He <em>just</em> said he is close to having his cabinet filled with the &quot;right&quot; people. He is talking exactly as I would expect if he was waiting until everything was in place before, you know, getting into office and on day 1 just slapping cuffs on Hillary only for her pizza party friends to bail her out the same day.</p>

<p>At best, no matter how much they want to actually fix the problems they claim they will indeed fix, there are simply things they don&#39;t know are obstacles until they are actually in their newly elected office and realize that their promise is not feasible. </p>

<p>At worst, they are pathological liars who say what you want to hear to get elected. For most, I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who believed Trump was going to do anything he said, when he he blatantly lied, nearly daily, throughout the campaign and, for nearly every tweet he made, you could find him saying the exact opposite, is a complete fool.</p>

<p>He proved himself everything we hate about politicians during the campaign and his life leading up to it. He lied, he flip-flopped, he pandered, he made ridiculous promises that he know he couldn&#39;t keep, and he is corrupt (based on how many lawsuits he has been forced to settle or has lost, his ties to the mafia, and how he was embedded in NYC politics). The only thing that made him different from other politicians is that he wasn&#39;t a politician at the time. So, basically, the only thing that made him different was not having any experience in any government position.</p>

<p>But this is a not a conspiracy. He didn&#39;t it openly, unabashedly. He exposed how foolish the American people are. That&#39;s all he has done.</p>

Believe climate change or not, the fact is that it is being used to restrict the means of production and to raise taxes. All in the name of saving the world from the evil CO2, power plants get shit down. Driving up power bills. Gas gets taxes, car registration. They all help to control the people.</p>

<p>When Trump told the Paris climate accord to fuck off, he protected us from that ploy. Then he restricted refugees. He cut corporate taxes to help companies grow and be more free. The new tariffs on steel and aluminum to help equal the play ground. He&#39;s undoing step by step all of the things put in place to fuck over America.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I just wish the trump talk would cease here unless there&#39;s legitimate conspiracy theory. People ITT pretending to be ex-trump supporters that actually believe the Trump-is-a-russian-puppet narrative causes me to believe that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is leaking, which means that the trump talk got so prevalent here that these people feel it necessary to turn this into another anti-trump shithole. Maybe it&#39;s time for a new conspiracy sub that doesn&#39;t breed the political talk. We already have subs whose whole purpose is for that kind of shit. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, I miss <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Not <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> versus <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, this is obvious to the point that it&#39;s not a conspiracy. No one seems to have a problem with Israel massively influencing US politics? Am I missing something here?</p>

<p>The Russians posted some stuff on social media. That&#39;s the big thing, right? They posted shitty memes on Twitter. Whoa dude. Just hack my elections up.</p>

<p>This thread has a completely different tone than this sub usually has. 100% being botted/invaded/whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a brilliant move honestly, and one of the main components is often overlooked: your comment itself is an example of it.</p>

<p>The objective was destabilization of America, not getting Donald Trump elected. The goal wasn&#39;t to screw up America for 4 years, but for several generations. You do that by division. We&#39;re at the point now where the very topic of propaganda is a dividing topic, but not because some people believe and some people don&#39;t; but because <strong>to state that a person&#39;s following was even in part a product of propaganda is to state that a person&#39;s following is illegitimate</strong>. And so people hear that and think the speaker thinks their views are illegitimate, which makes them resent them and turn away even more.</p>

<p>Again it&#39;s a brilliant play, it&#39;s just sad that people don&#39;t realize its ingenuity even as they themselves enact it thinking they&#39;re countering it.</p>

<p>You had an opportunity to make a real argument and then went off the deep end. Obviously state law enforcement agents speak on behalf of their state more so than dogwalkers or anesthesiologists.

They are the lowly nuts and bolts of the state, and the system would collapse without them. </p>

<p>Border patrol agents are federal so that&#39;s all wrong and wouldn&#39;t mean anything if it were right. It&#39;s still wrong to say &quot;the State.&quot; One profession is never &quot;the state&quot; that&#39;s an openly nonsensical statement.</p>

<p>You call me a slave while Donald Trump is the first politician I have ever seen take a strong public stand against the fascist mind control mainstream media. He doesn&#39;t get every detail right and he is an unapologetic troll, but the claim that he is some kind of fascist is hilariously unrealistic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure your favorite russian conspiracy blog told you that.</p>

<p>You are just imagining a boogie-man everywhere. </p>

<p>It would have been more accurate to say that&#39;s how you IMAGINE it went down based solely on the fairy-tales you read in partisan media. </p>

<p>What facts justify your claims or even your speculation?</p>

<p>Is Trump responsible for the last 20 years? No. I can&#39;t stop what already happened. If Trump invaded a new country it would be cause for <em>much,</em> <em>much</em> more concern than Stormy. In the meantime, I am focusing on the corruption and behavior unbecoming of a politician with hopes of impeachment before he can do something even more awful. We are talking about Trump, not the Bush or Obama administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s been a couple hours. Any proof? Have you actually seen proof? Or are you just parroting something someone else said. Cozzzzzz calling a man you’ve never met a rapist without proof is something that gets you called a fucking scumbag. Take a step back and look at what you’re doing. It’s fucking sick, like there’s something seriously wrong with you. I have no doubt Bill Clinton and his wife are as crooked as it gets, but if you don’t have actual proof to show me you need to put on your grown up pants and stop being a shitty person.</p>

<p>Falsely accusing someone of rape without proof, even a political crook like Bill Clinton, is fucking disgusting and you should feel ashamed of yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>incredibly destructive? in what way? theres no threat of nuclear war, which considering the circumstances would be relatively logical. just because hes bad doesnt mean it couldnt be a thousand times worse. he isnt the worst person on the planet, and dealing with an adversary you know is much easier than trying to guess what the new guy is going to do.  </p>

<p>id say the rhetoric you posit is foolish. foolish in the archetypal sense. walking off a cliff without knowing it. even saying that its better than knowing where the edge of cliff is. pretty foolish IMO    </p>

<p>and im not going to participate in two comment lines with you, so ill address the other one here: nobody is saying let them get away with it. just that if youre going to get all gung ho and put sanctions on people for such things, it seems a bit uneven. considering theres precedent for other allies attacking troops, with very little repercussions.</p>
