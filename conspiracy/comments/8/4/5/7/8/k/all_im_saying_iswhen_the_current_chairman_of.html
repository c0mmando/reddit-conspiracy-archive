<p>Corker separately told reporters on Capitol Hill that he&#39;d spoken with President Donald Trump and with Pompeo Tuesday morning and praised the decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Republican majority Senate has been fully behind Trump, minus one issue, tariffs. So how could you suggest they are his deep state opposition?  </p>

<p>PS does anyone here remember the doubts about Pompeo&#39;s loyalty to the U.S. back when he was made CIA Director. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes it fits better than others. In the case of Donald Trump, it&#39;s all about cronyism. That&#39;s why they trash lifelong Republicans and replace them with people who agree on pretty much everything.</p>

<p>Mike Pompeo was one of the major supporters of DJT in 2016 election, putting out fake investigative reports from his official position a few times a week during the election. That&#39;s pretty pure.</p>

<p>They both agree with George W. Bush and the PNAC agenda -- that one major part that was stopped in 2007 when Zbigniew Brzezinski warned the Senate about a false flag -- specifically a fog of war against Iran.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t mean that it isn&#39;t a perfect fit, just that i cant remember a time in my brief life of looking at politics that it wasn&#39;t  a potentially perfect description. i&#39;m starting to think that those who get the most upset are either young or have only just recently started paying attention. i still recall the outrage and accusations against Bush Senior and bill Clinton. Eventually you realize the world hasn&#39;t ended yet and this political theater is older than Julius Cesar. false flags have been a driving force in politics for so long that it&#39;s more of a passive curiosity. government abuse of power is government 101. etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alot of career CIA are opposed to Trump. Alot of career intelligence personnel are opposed to Trump.</p>

<p>Some would say that alot of our intelligence agencies have become politicized...</p>

<p>Others swear that&#39;s just not so.</p>

<p>My question regarding that is...if it&#39;s just not so...then why are the Democrats backing alot of ex-intelligence agency people for midterms..</p>

<p>And if they were not politicized...why are they now running for office?</p>

<p>Some things don&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be hanging on Brennan and Clappers every word when they explain to you why it&#39;s all a good thing.</p>

<p>As for Pompeo who was nominated by Trump...let&#39;s wait and see just how much trouble he has getting confirmed..I doubt it will be much.</p>

<p>So in the end...Trump&#39;s cabinet is filled with Generals and Intelligence agency officials...but no, the deep state doesn&#39;t control every President that gets elected.</p>
