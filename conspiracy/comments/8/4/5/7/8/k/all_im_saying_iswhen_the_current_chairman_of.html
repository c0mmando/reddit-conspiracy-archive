       "I had a very good conversation with Director Pompeo this morning and look forward to meeting with him soon," Corker said in a statement. "As I shared with the President, the committee will consider his nomination as expeditiously as possible."
      </p>
      <p>
       Corker separately told reporters on Capitol Hill that he'd spoken with President Donald Trump and with Pompeo Tuesday morning and praised the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm now going to call it the "Deep State Department"...if the shoe fits.

       That Republican majority Senate has been fully behind Trump, minus one issue, tariffs. So how could you suggest they are his deep state opposition?

       PS does anyone here remember the doubts about Pompeo's loyalty to the U.S. back when he was made CIA Director.

       Sometimes it fits better than others. In the case of Donald Trump, it's all about cronyism. That's why they trash lifelong Republicans and replace them with people who agree on pretty much everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mike Pompeo was one of the major supporters of DJT in 2016 election, putting out fake investigative reports from his official position a few times a week during the election. That's pretty pure.
      </p>
      <p>
       They both agree with George W. Bush and the PNAC agenda -- that one major part that was stopped in 2007 when Zbigniew Brzezinski warned the Senate about a false flag -- specifically a fog of war against Iran.

       i don't mean that it isn't a perfect fit, just that i cant remember a time in my brief life of looking at politics that it wasn't  a potentially perfect description. i'm starting to think that those who get the most upset are either young or have only just recently started paying attention. i still recall the outrage and accusations against Bush Senior and bill Clinton. Eventually you realize the world hasn't ended yet and this political theater is older than Julius Cesar. false flags have been a driving force in politics for so long that it's more of a passive curiosity. government abuse of power is government 101. etc.

       Alot of career CIA are opposed to Trump. Alot of career intelligence personnel are opposed to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some would say that alot of our intelligence agencies have become politicized...
      </p>
      <p>
       Others swear that's just not so.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question regarding that is...if it's just not so...then why are the Democrats backing alot of ex-intelligence agency people for midterms..
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they were not politicized...why are they now running for office?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some things don't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm sure you'll be hanging on Brennan and Clappers every word when they explain to you why it's all a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Pompeo who was nominated by Trump...let's wait and see just how much trouble he has getting confirmed..I doubt it will be much.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in the end...Trump's cabinet is filled with Generals and Intelligence agency officials...but no, the deep state doesn't control every President that gets elected.

       Who on earth keeps suggesting Trump is not as corrupt as any other politician?
      </p>
      <p>
       This keeps coming up - the small minority of this subreddit bought the Trump is going to drain the swamp meme - the whole system is the fucking problem.

       The replacement of Tillerson by Pompeo was in place months ago and was all the plan of Jesuit White House commander, general John F. Kelly. The nomonation of republican Pompeo for CIA director was approved by another former Jesuit CIA director, Leon Panetta who is a democrat. Political affiliations mean dick when it comes to the Jesuit Catholic intelligence network.

       Well...all I can say is the Jesuits helped do a fine job of distracting everyone from a big meeting regarding the future of Palestinians that was held in the White House today.

       Worth noting that pompeo is ex-military tea-party from kansas, and was only cia for just over a year/ appointed head of cia by trump just last january... Not your typical deep state cia normy...

       Alot of career CIA are opposed to Trump. Alot of career intelligence personnel are opposed to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some would say that alot of our intelligence agencies have become politicized...
      </p>
      <p>
       Others swear that's just not so.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question regarding that is...if it's just not so...then why are the Democrats backing alot of ex-intelligence agency people for midterms..
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they were not politicized...why are they now running for office?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some things don't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm sure you'll be hanging on Brennan and Clappers every word when they explain to you why it's all a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Pompeo who was nominated by Trump...let's wait and see just how much trouble he has getting confirmed..I doubt it will be much.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in the end...Trump's cabinet is filled with Generals and Intelligence agency officials...but no, the deep state doesn't control every President that gets elected.
