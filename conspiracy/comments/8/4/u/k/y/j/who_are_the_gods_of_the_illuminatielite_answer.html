<p>The monument sits in in front of Rockefeller building across from St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral. It is the largest sculpture at Rockefeller Center.</p>

<p>This huge bronze figure was created by sculptor Lee Lawrie with the help of Rene Paul Chambellan in 1937. Chambellan also created small Nereids and Dolphins on the fountain near Rockefeller center. </p>

<p>In Greek mythology Atlas is the titan of astronomy and navigation. He was a leader in the war between the Olympian Gods and the Titans.   After the war was lost, Atlas received the harshest punishment by King Zeus:  he had to hold up the heavens with bare hands and bear their weight on his shoulders forever. Atlas instructed the mankind in the art of astronomy.  A lost traveler can use the statue as a compass -the North-South axis of the sphere on Atlas&#39; shoulders points towards  the North Star as seen from New York City.</p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty was designed and built to the scale and design of the original Colossus of Rhodes (at least as it was believed to have looked at the time Liberty was constructed).
Colossus_of_Rhodes</p>

<p>Beginning work in 292 BC, it took Charles of Lindos and his designers nearly twelve years to complete the 110-foot statue, which was then erected on a 50-foot pedestal. The base was carved out of white marble and joined to the cast of feet at the ankles. The status was believed to be dedicated to the Greek God of Sun, Helios (or Apollo), whose blessings were supposedly the driving force for Rhodes’ victory Cyprus (305 BC).
The equipments of the vanquished enemy were sold off to finance the building of the statue. It stood for over half-a-century, by which time its fame reached scholars and visitors from far off lands, before a devastating earthquake in 226 BC demolished it. The dedication script on the statue, according to texts discovered later, spoke of a ‘statue leading to Olympus.’</p>

<p>While the representation of liberty and freedom isn’t entirely misplaced per se, it is mainly believed to be something of a modern metaphor about America being the ‘land of opportunity’ and freedom for immigrants.</p>

<p>Colosus and Liberty - georgitsis</p>

<p>(Left: The Colossus of Rhodes depicted in 1880; Right: Statue of Liberty)</p>

<p>However, being based on another statue which was once a renowned representation of ‘freedom’ for this world, the Status of Liberty certainly owes a major allegiance to the Colossus of Rhodes, both in architectural similarity and significance. Similar facial expression, seven beams of light in exact position with those in the Statue of Liberty and the same dimensions.</p>

<p>This is the original insignia of the Bavarian Illuminati. It pictures the owl of Minerva - symbolising wisdom - on top of an opened book. Minerva was the Roman goddess of wisdom, medicine, commerce, handicrafts, poetry, the arts in general, and later, war. In many ways similar to the Greek goddess Athena, she had important temples in Rome and was patron of the Quinquatras festival.</p>

<p>In the mystery cults of the highly syncretic Hellenistic era,[18] Pan is made cognate with Phanes/Protogonos, Zeus, Dionysus and Eros. </p>

<p>Accounts of Pan&#39;s genealogy are so varied that it must lie buried deep in mythic time. Like other nature spirits, Pan appears to be older than the Olympians, if it is true that he gave Artemis her hunting dogs and taught the secret of prophecy to Apollo. Pan is famous for his sexual powers, and is often depicted with a phallus. Diogenes of Sinope, speaking in jest, related a myth of Pan learning masturbation from his father, Hermes, and teaching the habit to shepherds.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pan_compilation.jpg">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pan_compilation.jpg</a></p>

<p>Representations of Pan on 4th century BC gold and silver Pantikapaion coins Athena, and Hephaestus are worshipped together. Athena as the Goddess of Wisdom, and War, and Hephaestus as the Creator of the great weapons of war for Gods, and Men. Hephaestus was the God of Fire and the Forge, the patron god of smiths, craftsmen, sculptors and artisans. He was the weapon maker of the Gods. In Greek mythology, Hephaestus was the son of Zeus and Hera, the king and queen of the gods. In another version, he was Hera&#39;s parthenogenous child, rejected by his mother because of his deformity and thrown off Mount Olympus and down to earth. As a smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus.</p>

<p>Screen shot from the video &quot;Inside The Bohemian Club.&quot;</p>

<p>As one can plainly see by the above comparison, the owl statue, situated within the library at the Bohemian Club headquarters in San Francisco, is an exact replica of the one at the Acropolis – thus, there is no doubt that the &quot;Bohos&quot; (by duplicating a famous statue located at the chief temple dedicated to Athena) are alluding to Athena/Minerva, or the goddess of wisdom. Furthermore, the statue in the Bohemian Club has a plaque on its front base, stating: &quot;Replica of Ancient Athenian Owl&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/bennettMinerva.jpg">http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/bennettMinerva.jpg</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s also the tale of Minerva and Arachne (Greek for spider). It concerns a weaving contest between Minerva – also known as the goddess of the arts, needle work and weaving – and Arachne. The latter was turned into a spider after losing the contest. &quot;Weaving Spiders Come Not Here,&quot; the motto on the seal of the Bohemian Club, may well be alluding to the myth; the mere fact that it is accompanied by the owl, which represents Minerva, is significant and noteworthy (and too semiotically sound as to have been a mere coincidence).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/illuminatiSeals.jpg">http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/illuminatiSeals.jpg</a></p>

<p>Minerval Seals of the Illuminati: two of three known to still exist. P.M.C.V. stands for Per Me Caeci Vident (Through me the blind become sighted). An owl holding an opened book (signifying learning), surrounded by a Laurel wreath (a symbol of learning or graduation); Per Me Caeci Vident was a reminder to the Superiors of the class, whose responsibility it was to properly instruct the Minervals. These medallions were worn around the necks of Minerval initiates.
The class of Minerval was a relatively low rank in the scheme of things. However, it was the soul of the Order, and functioned as a sort of assembly line for recruits.</p>

<p>The Jews believe the age of Saturn/Cronus was the golden age of man. Man lived side by side with cronus-saturn, and the earth gave forth fruit everywhere. It was an age of Bliss.</p>

<p>In the beginning was the Golden Age, when men of their own accord, without threat of punishment, without laws, maintained good faith and did what was right. . . . The earth itself, without compulsion, untouched by the hoe, unfurrowed by any share, produced all things spontaneously. . . . It was a season of everlasting spring. By extension &quot;Golden Age&quot; denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as &quot;guardians&quot;. Plato in Cratylus (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble. In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading</p>

<p>Titan Cronus.[3] In some version of the myth Astraea also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation Virgo, holding the scales of Justice, or Libra.
Cronus is locked in Tartarus, or the bottomless pit. They just worship him for two reasons. It was a golden age under his rule for man, and he is the god of time. They seek Immortality. When you have all the money, and power in the world all that is really left is to eat from the tree of Life. To taste the ambrosia</p>

<p>Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hereticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it ... So Masonry jealously conceals its secrets, and intentionally leads conceited interpreters away.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And frankly i still ask, what/who is being worshipped?</p>

<p>Half the shit we see from nasa is fake and this implies Saturn worship, which i myself have noticed over the years. I see the connections and i make the same ones you do. And still i feel nothings really been answered. Just connections... u/catsarenotreptilians makes a great point.. more connections. Where do we go from here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked?</p>

<p>persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</p>

<p>Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all ...</p>

<p>I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes</p>

<p>Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever &quot;--</p>

<p>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,</p>

<p>Samaritan pronunciation Jabe probably approaches the real sound of the Divine name closest; the other early writers transmit only abbreviations or corruptions of the sacred name. Inserting the vowels of Jabe into the original Hebrew consonant text, we obtain the form Jahveh (Yahweh), which has been generally accepted by modern scholars as the true pronunciation of the Divine name. It is not merely closely connected with the pronunciation of the ancient synagogue by means of the Samaritan tradition, but it also allows the legitimate derivation of all the abbreviations of the sacred name in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>The name Jahveh is of Indo-European origin. But the transition of the Sanscrit root, div—the Latin Jupiter-Jovis (Diovis), the Greek Zeus-Dios, the Indo-European Dyaus into the Hebrew form Jahveh has never been satisfactorily explained. Hitzig&#39;s contention (Vorlesungen über bibl. Theol., p. 38) that the Indo-Europeans furnished at least the idea contained in the name Jahveh, even if they did not originate the name itself. Dyēus (also *Dyḗus Ph2tḗr , alternatively spelled dyēws) is believed to have been the chief deity in the religious traditions of the prehistoric Proto-Indo-European societies.
Part of a larger pantheon, he was the god of the daylit sky, and his position may have mirrored the position of the patriarch or monarch in society. </p>

<p>This deity is not directly attested; rather, scholars have reconstructed this deity from the languages and cultures of later Indo-European peoples such as the Greeks, Latins, and Indo-Aryans. According to this scholarly reconstruction, Dyeus was addressed as Dyeu Ph2ter, literally &quot;sky father&quot; or &quot;shining father&quot;, as reflected in Latin Iūpiter, Diēspiter, possibly Dis Pater and deus pater, Greek Zeu pater, Sanskrit Dyàuṣpítaḥ. As the pantheons of the individual mythologies related to the Proto-Indo-European religion evolved, attributes of Dyeus seem to have been redistributed to other deities. In Greek and Roman mythology, Dyeus remained the chief god; however, in Vedic mythology, the etymological continuant of Dyeus became a very abstract god, and his original attributes and dominance over other gods appear to have been transferred to gods such as Agni or Indra.</p>

<p>You see, both gods trace their name back to the same title: *Dyēus ph2ter. With Jupiter, it is more obvious. We have some very old inscriptions where Jupiter gets a &lt; d &gt; in front of his name, Diespiter, for example, which alerts us that the Romans began dropping the /d/ sound. (It may help to mention that &lt; j &gt; in Latin has a sound like English &lt; y &gt; in &quot;yes&quot;, not like the &lt; j &gt; in &quot;judge&quot;). You can already see the merger of two older words, &quot;dies-&quot; and &quot;-piter.&quot; More interestingly, the &quot;dies-&quot; part is identical to Latin dies &quot;day.&quot; Could the two be related? Hint: Yes. Both words come from an older Indo-European word *dyēus meaning &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>With Zeus (Zεύς) it&#39;s a bit less apparent. While nearly all ancient Greek sources write Zeus with a &lt; z &gt;, the oldest of all written Greek is Mycenaean Greek, and they wrote the name with a &lt; d &gt;: Di-we. While the Mycenaeans used a very clunky and imprecise writing system, Linear B, the system is accurate enough to tell us that the &quot;Di&quot; is no accident. Adding to this, Zeus was frequently called Zeus Pater, &quot;father Zeus.&quot; So we can see that while the Latins began to use the words father and &quot;dies&quot; together so much that their identities became indistinguishable, the Greeks continued to treat the two words as distinct. Thus we discover that Zeus is cognate to the &quot;Ju-&quot; in Jupiter!</p>

<p>While the Greek and Roman examples are the most fun to look at, we can highlight a &quot;Ju-/Zeus Father&quot; in the other Indo-European tribes, and by extending our research, we know that the deity was literally &quot;Sky Father.&quot; We can make this extension by comparing all the Indo-European languages and finding a remarkable unity - a remarkable unity that tells us that the religious concept and name stretch back to a very ancient time.</p>

<p>English: Tiw (which is the first part of the word tuesday, lit. &quot;Tiw&#39;s Day&quot;) &lt; Proto-Germanic *Tē₂waz Sanskrit: Dyaus Pita (recorded in the Rigveda around 1700 BCE). In fact, when Dyaus is used apart from Pita, the word means &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;heaven,&quot; while Pita means &quot;father.&quot; So this is a big clue: ancient Hindu religion and language preserved the original name and definition) Lithuanian: Dievas &lt; Proto-Baltic *Deivas</p>

<p>Those are just some examples; a full list would be enormous. By comparing all the different sounds in each version, and by taking time and natural language change into account, we can reconstruct a &#39;proto&#39; form with relative accuracy. If you learn other Indo-European languages, you may had noticed sound correspondences with the word &#39;father.&#39; English father sounds a lot like Spanish padre which is a lot like Sanskrit pita and even a bit like Irish athair (note the dropped &lt; p &gt;). Now you know that the similarities are not by chance but by the slow, unstoppable evolution of language
You denounce God and wonder why your enemies are making you a slave. You merely believe in an interpretation. A conceited one at that</p>

<p>The father of Zeus was Cronus/Saturn . Prometheus the creator of mankind , and his confrontations with Zeus explain most. </p>

<p>The age of Saturn/Cronus was the golden age of man. Man lived side by side with cronus-saturn, and the earth gave forth fruit everywhere. It was an age of Bliss.
In the beginning was the Golden Age, when men of their own accord, without threat of punishment, without laws, maintained good faith and did what was right. . . . The earth itself, without compulsion, untouched by the hoe, unfurrowed by any share, produced all things spontaneously. . . . It was a season of everlasting spring.</p>

<p>By extension &quot;Golden Age&quot; denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as &quot;guardians&quot;.</p>

<p>Plato in Cratylus (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.
In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading Titan Cronus.[3] In some version of the myth Astraea also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation Virgo, holding the scales of Justice, or Libra.</p>

<p>Cronus is locked in Tartarus, or the bottomless pit. They just worship him for two reasons. It was a golden age under his rule for man, and he is the god of time. They seek Immortality. When you have all the money, and power in the world all that is really left is to eat from the tree of Life. To taste the ambrosia of the gods.</p>

<p>God is more of a &quot;system&quot;, but also has certain &quot;properties&quot; that manifest in our world, which is where all the symbols originate. Then those with knowledge of this system and its magical workings, use it to their advantage, while keeping others in the dark. </p>

<p>Now how that system operates and influences our world is the question, but I do believe it operates in a law of attraction/karma type way. I know I&#39;m not right but this is my current line of thinking. </p>

<p>The Olympian gods were not cast to the earth. </p>

<p>Angel in the Greek true meaning simply means messenger, nothing more. Who is the serpent in genesis to you? </p>

<p>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. Here the serpent is referenced to a beast of the field that god had made. </p>

<p>We know Satan if a fallen angel cast here is not of this earth, so neither a beast, or an earthly made creature. </p>

<p>The Devil (from Greek: διάβολος diábolos &quot;slanderer, accuser As a word, &#39;satan&#39; is an untranslated Hebrew word which means &#39;adversary&#39;, while &#39;devil&#39; is a translation of the Greek word &#39;diabolos&#39;, meaning a liar, an enemy or false accuser. </p>

<p>Dragon-Greek word δράκων, drakon (genitive drakontos, δράκοντος) &quot;serpent, giant seafish&quot; sepent-fidi or fidisio kormi. This is the Greek word for &quot;snake&quot;</p>

<p>Therefore is literally a snake like being.</p>

<p>Demon-Disembodied spirit, Not a fallen angel. To mate with the daughters of man, and have sex with them, and create children they care about, they would be physical beings. Daemon comes from the Ancient Greek word δαίμων, which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all.</p>

<p>Zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt, [855] he leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned. But when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honors with the Titans, they pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by Earth&#39;s prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Samaritan pronunciation Jabe probably approaches the real sound of the Divine name closest; the other early writers transmit only abbreviations or corruptions of the sacred name. Inserting the vowels of Jabe into the original Hebrew consonant text, we obtain the form Jahveh (Yahweh), which has been generally accepted by modern scholars as the true pronunciation of the Divine name. It is not merely closely connected with the pronunciation of the ancient synagogue by means of the Samaritan tradition, but it also allows the legitimate derivation of all the abbreviations of the sacred name in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>The name Jahveh is of Indo-European origin. But the transition of the Sanscrit root, div—the Latin Jupiter-Jovis (Diovis), the Greek Zeus-Dios, the Indo-European Dyaus into the Hebrew form Jahveh has never been satisfactorily explained. Hitzig&#39;s contention (Vorlesungen über bibl. Theol., p. 38) that the Indo-Europeans furnished at least the idea contained in the name Jahveh, even if they did not originate the name itself. Dyēus (also *Dyḗus Ph2tḗr , alternatively spelled dyēws) is believed to have been the chief deity in the religious traditions of the prehistoric Proto-Indo-European societies. </p>

<p>Part of a larger pantheon, he was the god of the daylit sky, and his position may have mirrored the position of the patriarch or monarch in society.
This deity is not directly attested; rather, scholars have reconstructed this deity from the languages and cultures of later Indo-European peoples such as the Greeks, Latins, and Indo-Aryans. According to this scholarly reconstruction, Dyeus was addressed as Dyeu Ph2ter, literally &quot;sky father&quot; or &quot;shining father&quot;, as reflected in Latin Iūpiter, Diēspiter, possibly Dis Pater and deus pater, Greek Zeu pater, Sanskrit Dyàuṣpítaḥ. As the pantheons of the individual mythologies related to the Proto-Indo-European religion evolved, attributes of Dyeus seem to have been redistributed to other deities. In Greek and Roman mythology, Dyeus remained the chief god; however, in Vedic mythology, the etymological continuant of Dyeus became a very abstract god, and his original attributes and dominance over other gods appear to have been transferred to gods such as Agni or Indra.</p>

<p>You see, both gods trace their name back to the same title: *Dyēus ph2ter. With Jupiter, it is more obvious. We have some very old inscriptions where Jupiter gets a &lt; d &gt; in front of his name, Diespiter, for example, which alerts us that the Romans began dropping the /d/ sound. (It may help to mention that &lt; j &gt; in Latin has a sound like English &lt; y &gt; in &quot;yes&quot;, not like the &lt; j &gt; in &quot;judge&quot;). You can already see the merger of two older words, &quot;dies-&quot; and &quot;-piter.&quot; More interestingly, the &quot;dies-&quot; part is identical to Latin dies &quot;day.&quot; Could the two be related? Hint: Yes. Both words come from an older Indo-European word *dyēus meaning &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>With Zeus (Zεύς) it&#39;s a bit less apparent. While nearly all ancient Greek sources write Zeus with a &lt; z &gt;, the oldest of all written Greek is Mycenaean Greek, and they wrote the name with a &lt; d &gt;: Di-we. While the Mycenaeans used a very clunky and imprecise writing system, Linear B, the system is accurate enough to tell us that the &quot;Di&quot; is no accident. Adding to this, Zeus was frequently called Zeus Pater, &quot;father Zeus.&quot; So we can see that while the Latins began to use the words father and &quot;dies&quot; together so much that their identities became indistinguishable, the Greeks continued to treat the two words as distinct. Thus we discover that Zeus is cognate to the &quot;Ju-&quot; in Jupiter!</p>

<p>While the Greek and Roman examples are the most fun to look at, we can highlight a &quot;Ju-/Zeus Father&quot; in the other Indo-European tribes, and by extending our research, we know that the deity was literally &quot;Sky Father.&quot; We can make this extension by comparing all the Indo-European languages and finding a remarkable unity - a remarkable unity that tells us that the religious concept and name stretch back to a very ancient time.</p>

<p>English: Tiw (which is the first part of the word tuesday, lit. &quot;Tiw&#39;s Day&quot;) &lt; Proto-Germanic *Tē₂waz Sanskrit: Dyaus Pita (recorded in the Rigveda around 1700 BCE). In fact, when Dyaus is used apart from Pita, the word means &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;heaven,&quot; while Pita means &quot;father.&quot; So this is a big clue: ancient Hindu religion and language preserved the original name and definition) Lithuanian: Dievas &lt; Proto-Baltic *Deivas</p>

<p>Those are just some examples; a full list would be enormous. By comparing all the different sounds in each version, and by taking time and natural language change into account, we can reconstruct a &#39;proto&#39; form with relative accuracy. If you learn other Indo-European languages, you may had noticed sound correspondences with the word &#39;father.&#39; English father sounds a lot like Spanish padre which is a lot like Sanskrit pita and even a bit like Irish athair (note the dropped &lt; p &gt;). Now you know that the similarities are not by chance but by the slow, unstoppable evolution of language</p>

<p>You denounce God and wonder why your enemies are making you a slave. You merely believe in an interpretation. A conceded one at that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!</p>

<p>13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:</p>

<p>14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.</p>

<p>15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.</p>

<p>This is the same as Prometheus fall. Son of the morning. Meaning one of the first created. </p>

<p>When the morning stars {e} sang together, and all the {f} sons of God shouted for joy?</p>

<p>Prometheus himself is an immortal god, the friend of the human race, the giver of fire, the inventor of the useful arts, an omniscient seer, an heroic sufferer, who is overcome by the superior power of Zeus, but will not bend his inflexible mind. Although he himself belonged to the Titans, he is nevertheless represented as having assisted Zeus against the Titans (Prom. 218), and he is further said to have opened the head of Zeus when the latter gave birth to Athena (Apollod. i. 3. § 6). But when Zeus succeeded to the kingdom of heaven, and wanted to extirpate the whole race of man, the place of which he proposed to give to quite a new race of beings, Prometheus prevented the execution of the scheme, and saved the human race from destruction (Prom. 228, 233). He deprived them of their knowledge of the future, and gave them hope instead (248, &amp;c.). He further taught them the use of fire, made them acquainted with architecture, astronomy, mathematics, the art of writing, the treatment of domestic animals, navigation, medicine, the art of prophecy, working in metal, and all the other arts (252, 445, &amp;c., 480, &amp;c.). But, as in all these things he had acted contrary to the will of Zeus, the latter ordered Hephaestus to chain him to a rock in Scythia, which was done in the presence of Cratos and Bia, two ministers of Zeus. In Scythia he was visited by the Oceanides; Io also came to him, and he foretold her the wanderings and sufferings which were yet in store for her, as well as her final relief (703, &amp;c.). Hermes then likewise appears, and desires him to make known a prophecy which was of great importance to Zeus, for Prometheus knew that by a certain woman Zeus would beget a son, who was to dethrone his father, and Zeus wanted to have a more accurate knowledge of this decree of fate. But Prometheus steadfastly refused to reveal the decree of fate, whereupon Zeus, by a thunderbolt, sent Prometheus, together with the rock to which he was chained, into Tartarus (Horat. Carm. ii. 18, 35). After the lapse of a long time, Prometheus returned to the upper world, to endure a fresh course of suffering, for he was now fastened to mount Caucasus, and tormented by an eagle, which every day, or every third day, devoured his liver, which was restored again in the night (Apollon. Rhod. ii. 1247, &amp;c. iii. 853; Strab. xv. p. 688 ; Philostr. Vit. Apoll. ii. 3; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 15; Aeschyl. Prom. 1015, &amp;c.). This state of suffering was to last until some other god, of his own accord, should take his place, and descend into Tartarus for him (Prom. 1025). This came to pass when Cheiron, who had been incurably wounded by an arrow of Heracles, desired to go into Hades; and Zeus allowed him to supply the place of Prometheus (Apollod. ii. 5. § 4; comp. Cheiron). According to others, however, Zeus himself delivered Prometheus, when at length the Titan was prevailed upon to reveal to Zeus the decree of fate, that, if he should become by Thetis the either of a son, that son should deprive him of the sovereignty. (Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vi. 42 ; Apollod. iii. 13. § 5; Hygin. Fab. 54; comp. Aeschyl. Prom. 167, &amp;c. 376.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two different groups of angels that rebelled against God. One group roams the earth, somewhat freely, and serve as principalities and rulers of different regions. One of these fallen angels, the most well known amongst all mankind, goes by many names, and was the leader of the first rebellion. You know him, and many of his names have appeared in this thread. He is the ultimate antithesis, the god everyone worships when they turn from the Almighty.</p>

<p>The second group of angels thought human women were beautiful, and decided to leave their duties to mate with them (mate is a loose term here, but you get the gist). This created the Nephilim, the giants and six digited half-breeds of old. These angels also taught humans many many things, writing, sorcery, etc. The angels were locked away in desolation for this, but the Nephilim, being horrifically evil hybrids, were cursed to disembodiment after death, and wander earth causing all the havoc they could in place of their parents. They serve as the legions in the fallen angels&#39; armies - mind you, many are worshipped as gods as well, just think of how many stories you now of half human, half god heroes/rulers you know of.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a starting point for you anyway.</p>

<p>Lucifer never says he fell now does he? He claims he is the light bringer, and if he does admit the existence of the Almighty, it is in a bad light. You&#39;re sidestepping our point - these gods you speak of are just derivatives of older gods.</p>

<p>15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.</p>

<p>The myth of Prometheus and fire, the Titan Prometheus in Greek Mythology stole fire, he was celebrated by the mortals and was cruelly punished by God</p>

<p>The Deucalion legend as told by the Bibliotheca has some similarity to other deluge myths such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the story of Noah&#39;s Ark. The Titan Prometheus advised his son Deucalion to build a chest. All other men perished except for a few who escaped to high mountains. The mountains in Thessaly were parted, and all the world beyond the Isthmus and Peloponnese was overwhelmed. Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha, after floating in the chest for nine days and nights, landed on Parnassus. An older version of the story told by Hellanicus has Deucalion&#39;s &quot;ark&quot; landing on Mount Othrys in Thessaly. Another account has him landing on a peak, probably Phouka, in Argolis, later called Nemea. When the rains ceased, he sacrificed to Zeus.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,</p>

<p>2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.</p>

<p>3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.</p>

<p>4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.</p>

<p>5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</p>

<p>6 And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.</p>

<p>7 And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.</p>

<p>&quot;There [in Achaea, i.e. Greece] is a land encircled by lofty mountains, rich in sheep and in pasture, where Prometheus, son of Iapetus, begat goodly Deucalion, who first founded cities and reared temples to the immortal gods, and first ruled over men. This land the neighbours who dwell around call Haemonia</p>

<p>The flood in the time of Deucalion was caused by the anger of Zeus, ignited by the hubris of the Pelasgians. So Zeus decided to put an end to the Bronze Age. According to this story, Lycaon, the king of Arcadia, had sacrificed a boy to Zeus, who was appalled by this savage offering. Zeus unleashed a deluge, so that the rivers ran in torrents and the sea flooded the coastal plain, engulfed the foothills with spray, and washed everything clean. Deucalion, with the aid of his father Prometheus, was saved from this deluge by building a chest.[10] Like the Biblical Noah and the Mesopotamian counterpart Utnapishtim, he uses his device to survive the deluge with his wife, Pyrrha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>short answer is - they worship idols and idolize any character in antiquity who has attacked a god like Prometheus , they do not worship Satan , they just see him as a rebel who tried to kill God and call him Lucifer , he who brought the light ( gave Eve the apple , gave man knowledge ) , they see God as a dictator who wanted to keep man in bondage and idolize this as they them selves see man as being made in Gods image .</p>

<p>this should shed some light on how they think and what you can do to fight them . </p>

<p>they see them selves as being in the likeness of God .. they love Satan ( Lucifer ) for attacking God ..</p>

<p>they love a rebel who will challenge their authority but because of how they set up the social construct of society .</p>

<p>it&#39;s a tale of 2 islands . first island is where they live and within their social construct they have a hierarchy , a council of family leaders and with in this group is a single leader who is given power by a higher authority ..</p>

<p>the second island is where common man lives , within his social construct he is ruled by governments .</p>

<p>a common misconception is that the world is ruled by secret societies .. they are in fact where the 2 islands meet ..</p>

<p>the search for ancient knowledge crosses a social barrier as the real rulers seek to keep man in a state of obedience..</p>

<p>man is almost at the point where he has the weapons and technology to take his world back and govern himself  ..</p>

<p>keep inventing ..</p>
