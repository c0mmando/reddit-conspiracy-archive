       On the opposite end of the spectrum, Russia performed the assassination attempt using chemicals that could easily be traced back to themselves to force the UK to take serious action. Having helped Trump into the white house he will refuse to back the UK, driving the US and UK apart.

        House Intel Republican contradicts panel, says Russia tried to help Trump in 2016
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Monday that "there is evidence" showing the Russians attempted to help Trump during the 2016 presidential election, contradicting a draft report from the panel.
       </p>
       <p>
        “I certainly think there is evidence of that. I don’t know that necessarily there was a full-fledged campaign to do everything that they could to help elect Donald Trump,” Rooney told host Erin Burnett on CNN's "OutFront." “I think that their goal was chaos.”

       You make it sound like they are allies, Putin may of backed trump, but think of it this way trump is a fuckin nutter and should have never won presidency, so if Russia backed him it would of been to weaken America as a nation not to back trump as a friend, on this basis trump as far as the news is coverage here in England had a far sterner view of the Russian involvement of world politics than the UK, also Russia isn't seen as the big enemy here also, so agents acting  on sovereign soil would bolster distrust

       Or not. England is already firmly on our side here. They didn't need an extra boost to get on our good side. We already agree on what Russia has been up to. There would be absolutely no good reason for them to do this.

       Pretty much. The victim could be a convenient target for other reasons through. MP Boris jumped on that accusation like flies on shit though, and May told the Kremlin they need to prove they
       <em>
        didn’t
       </em>
       do it. Sounds like a farce to me. "Hey Russia, we have no actual evidence, but since we hate the idea of you being sovereign, why don't you, ah, go ahead and prove a negative for us?"

       Borris is a tool he speaks before his brain engages, the official response from the kremlin last i heard was exactly this, it wasn't Russia as they have no reason to have killed him in such a public manner, the spokesperson actually pointed a finger at the UK and suggested it was a false flag op aimed at vilifying russia, also Russian embassies are warning Russian citizens who live in the UK that it is a dangerous place for them

       I understand where you are coming from, America has had media portraying Russians as the bad evil communist hater of freedom and raper of liberty since the cold war, so Russian distrust is deeply ingrained forcibly by one sided spin and propaganda in the American mind, any view that contradicts this zeitgeist would be considered 'blasphemy' so it would be taken for granted that the whole world feels the same way, this is not the case!
 here where i am it is a new phenomena and its easier for me to be sceptical!

       The anti-Russia and Russian threat narrative is central to NATO's existence and central to justifying all the military spending that takes place in all of the countries that are members of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Brits have their own major military and weapon systems manufacturers whose products the British government is also intent on selling to other members of the alliance and that Russian threat narrative and all the fear mongering is simply good for business and jacking up the amount of the taxpayers money that is dedicated to it, even if it means cuts to essential services.

       I think false flag is a likely explanation too. It seems like people are desperately pushing to assign blame haphazardly, specifically doing so to provide a response. Even though the seriousness of the allegations means that proper investigation is even more important.

       Unfortunately my numerology skills are 0 but I did a little reading and besides doubling 33 and the implications of 666, in Gematria the numerical value of the hebrew word "Binak" (Intelligence), dead ("mort") and to curse ("maudir") equal 66.  So maybe they used the "death" of an "intelligence" agent to "curse" Russia?   May be nothing as well.

       The Russian nerve agent used was from the Novichok group developed in the 70's -80's, the novichok group of nerve agents are by design completely untraceable by nato chem labs as well as designed to bypass nato chem suits
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent
       </a>
       So if it was novichek 5 as some have stated a, how did the UK gov't decide it was this if it completely untraceable b, it is untraceable so how are Russia implicated, other than the tenuous link of it being a Russian design al those years ago
      </p>
      <p>
       This may be the reason the Russian foreign secretary Lahov is asking for a sample of the agent used, which Theresa May is refusing to comply with. Because i believe no sample of the novichok agent exists

       what, just because the 'attack' happened near the UK bio-wepons research facility with a history of usin sarin gas on it's own troops... it musta been the russians. just like anthrax was iraq and the 7/7 bombings that got the uk into the war was alquida 6_6
