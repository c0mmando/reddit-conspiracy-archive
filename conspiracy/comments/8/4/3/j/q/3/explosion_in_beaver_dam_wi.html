       Here's a fun one, I'm usually a lurker in this sub, but I think there's something fishy going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in Beaver Dam, WI for work and i guess there was an apartment explosion last week. They had to evacuate the whole complex, hundreds displaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local authorities go in and take pictures, and inform the feds of what they found. Feds freaked out, said don't touch, don't look at it, you can't even clean up the body.  Feds make them do a second controlled detonation. All while still not releasing any info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that they had the controlled detonation, they were guna get crews in and fix the Building. Nope, feds say burn it to the ground, people can't even get their belongings out. So it burns Wednesday  morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they are not giving any Id of the guy making bombs in his apartment, no affiliations. Not releasing the chemicals he had, but they were dangerous enough to not be handled at all. Now they are burning it all to the ground. Now i can give them the benefit of the doubt, small town, explosion. I get it. The kicker is, the judge sealed the search warrants, so we may not ever know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if that kind of rambled, I'm in a shitty hotel in beaver dam on my phone. But I though it warranted some interest. Google it, loads of articles and videos pop up

       It was reported that the explosive was TATP which I guess is notorious for accidentally going off. Assuming that's true I wouldn't bother trying to move it either lol.

       That would really suck if I wasn't able to get my crypto wallet or something like that.

       Find it very interesting though. I wonder if the chemicals that were used are super dangerous. First thing comes to mind someone making a bomb, cooking drugs, or making chemical weapon of some kind.

       Yea this seems pretty interesting to say the least. I wonder what his intention was for that and how bad the chemicals are to have to burn down the entire place without letting people go into get some stuff.

       I'ld say, he was making a free energy device. Maybe he made a mistake and it blew up, but it was probably sabotaged by some mini insect-sized government drone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course no one should look at, or even make a picture of the devices remains. Free energy is still one of the best kept secrets. Probably only certain kinds of sorcery are deemed as more valuable secrets.

       Meth lab explosion in a motel in the suburb I grew up in. Man was hospitalized/arrested, they cleaned up and it continued operation as a motel. People staying the night weren't even evacuated. They certainly didn't blow up the motel to cover it.

        Sounds like a large meth lab exploded and immediately became a crisis level bio hazard.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That sounds unlikely. What kind of "bio hazard" would warrant Federal agents step in ordering demolition and burning the whole complex to the ground? Can anyone point to other cases where "meth labs" were handled this way?
      </p>
      <p>
       What, are they making meth with Sarin or other nerve agents or fucking plutonium these days?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why would a judge seal the warrants, etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like the Feds were aware of some serious fuckery afoot, and they stepped in to make sure that all evidence was destroyed.

       Home-made bio lab?  Chances are it was relatively benign or just home-brew experimental.  But if any of the equip was on the pricey side, feds would've looked at chem/lab equip in a residential apt. complex and Lost. Their. Ish.  Or, possibly components to chemical nerve agents.  IIRC, nerve agents aren't really stable.

       They are saying unstable chemicals. You'd think if it was bio or nerve, they wouldn't do a controlled detonation and risk spreading. No background, names or affiliations are being named and they sealed the search warrants.

       I read somewhere that they believed the explosive material had become embedded in parts of the building, like the attic/insulation. There was also another explosion after the controlled detonation they performed. I'd presume that between those two things, there is no way to guarantee anyone's safety if they were to enter the building. As far as the burning, my theory is that at least one of the chemicals found was acetone peroxide, which denatures/deactivates when exposed to heat. All speculation, of course...

        Officials stress that such disposal will meet all state and federal environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act. Incinerators must achieve a "destruction and removal efficiency" of 99.9999 percent, meaning that no more than 0.0001 percent of the chemical agents can leave the incinerator stack. The National Center for Environmental Health, a federal agency under the US Department of Health and Human Services, says this is "well below levels considered safe for the community."

       They are definitelty warning people.
The local police facebook page is posting info about whats going on in regards to the burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like the local media is,too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theyre saying that whatever it  is thats  in the place is to dangerous to move, but theyre not saying what is in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this had been a meth lab, I would think they would say something to that effect. I would also think the EPA would be involved if that was the case,yet Im seeing no mention of them anywhere.

       If it was a meth lab, they would have reported it as so. Everyone knows there's a large meth issue and are used to seeing lab explosions. No one would have blinked an eye at a meth lab, ppl are used to it

       i'd imagine that this structure fire emitted a smidge over 0.0001% of any chemical in that house. i wonder if they consider the case where the chemical will react and almost completely react and break down into constituent parts. this would disperse a smaller amount/lower concentration of 'the chemical'

       I think it sounds more biological than chemical.  You wouldn't want to burn chemicals willy nilly.  You would want to burn biological as hot as you can, hence a second, better fire.  Can you get info from the hospitals for the next two weeks?

       This seems like burning to me. Am I understanding this wrong?
"'The plan at this time is to light the building at both ends and let it burn towards the middle. There will be no suppression efforts on the building that we are burning. We have been advised to let it burn as long and as hot as possible. It is heat that degrades the explosive material,' said Alan Mannel, Beaver Dam fire chief."

       One of the articles says the judge sealed the warrant so as to not tip off 'co actors'.
Thats an interesting way to put it.
 I wonder why some guy from wisconsin name Ben, and an unknown co actor, be making bombs.

       I agree. At first I was thinking maybe nitroglycerin, but something like TATP makes sense. I wouldn't be surprised if he blew himself up just dropping a container on the floor, or screwing a lid back on. I feel like there's some fuckery going on, but also any LE trained in explosives ain't getting anywhere near any homemade stuff like that.  I'm just curious what his plans were.

       Yeah I was thinking nitro as well, IIRC that shit is super finicky and goes off for no reason. Then the longer they wait the more it would degrade if not kept under optimal conditions. Look at that shit wrong and it goes off. But I don't think so because it probably would have gone off on him before he had 3 refrigerators' worth.

       Definitely not meth. Had it been a meth lab explosion the locals and state could have handled it. If they called the Feebs it was more than a meth lab. Obviously the Feebs didn't want any crime scene evidence which says they already had tabs on the person or persons that did it. They don't need any more department embarrassments so they told the locals to destroy all the evidence with another explosion which would taint the evidence from the first blast. Then they tell them to burn it all down.

       This also happened a couple weeks ago at an apartment complex in Madison, which is like an hour away. They didn't have to blow it up or anything though. Just evacuate because of chemicals. Super weird.

       Confirms my theory. TATP, aka acetone peroxide, is used in the Mother of Satan bomb, which is more likely to kill the creator than be unleashed on other people.

       I agree, though the videos are fairly irrelevant. You can find the recipe for TATP via a Google search in about 5 seconds, with precise &amp; implicit instructions. It's made with common items anyone can buy, so unless the feds start barring civilians from purchasing bleach, hydrogen peroxide and drain cleaner, it's going to be pretty tough to control.

       Are they releasing the names of the people inside and how many? Ethnicity? I mean if it's the fbi and cia just burning all the evidence to the ground there's most likely something behind it being hidden..it's a lot harder to solve a crime when you burn the scene down first then investigate..it's think but I'm no forensics expert.

        A key disadvantage is its high susceptibility to accidental detonation (and resulting "workplace accidents" in bomb-making shops), which has led to TATP being referred to as the "Mother of Satan."[41][38] TATP was found in the accidental explosion that preceded the 2017 terrorist attacks in Barcelona and surrounding areas.[42]

       I read somewhere that they believed the explosive material had become embedded in parts of the building, like the attic/insulation. There was also another explosion after the controlled detonation they performed. I'd presume that between those two things, there is no way to guarantee anyone's safety if they were to enter the building. As far as the burning, my theory is that at least one of the chemicals found was acetone peroxide, which denatures/deactivates when exposed to heat. All speculation, of course...
