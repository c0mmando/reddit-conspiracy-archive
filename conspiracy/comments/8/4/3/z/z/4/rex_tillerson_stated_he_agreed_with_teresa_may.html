       Stories seem conflicting at this point, but seems clear at least that he was blindsided by that the firing occurred this morning.  That leaves open the alternate possibility That Rex learned he was getting fired at some point soon, thought "fuck it, now I can speak my mind," and that prompted the rushed firing this morning.

       I kinda doubt he is/was a pedo, whilst he was friends. With the likes of Dennis Hastert and Jeffrey Epstein he allegedly banned him from his properties and pushed him out of his social circles when he was convicted while others like Bill Clinton remain good friends with Epstein  to this day.

       I wouldn't call it "fucking crazy".  You have the right against self incrimination and most lawyers would advise you to plead the fifth on a number of lines of questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the deposition:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see that he pleads the fifth a number of times, usually when questioned about his connections to other high profile people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an ELI5 on why pleading the fifth does not imply guilt:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that being said I still think Epstein is a piece of shit and a lot of people who socialized with him likely knew and were involved with his parties.

       It's probably as simple as Russians loaned him money so he wouldn't have to admit he was broke. Money is the only thing Trump cares about, his vanity is endless. He will do anything just for someone he respects to refer to him as a billionaire.

       Well..what needs to happen is mainstream media and the candidates running in the midterms need to start calling out the intelligence agencies...oh..wait..nevermind, they already thought of that.

       This country has lost its collective mind. I can't wait for Brennan and Clapper to tell me all the great things about the midterm candidates that worked for them...it's gonna be great.

       Sorry but this is way too obvious. Basically has a huge sign "Russia was here".  No way they secretly off someone using something complicated and hard to find that points directly at them.

       We should wait regardless for more facts to come out.
Spewing theories over everything will provide nothing but intellectual chaos over everything being a Russian invasion of some sorts. I do find it suspicious that he fired him, but that is due to not a lot of information coming out. He could have been planning to fire him forever and it was just finalized, new sites saying that it was 100% for this exact reason help no one. But hey, I could be wrong and it could be Russia after all, but we should wait for the facts to come out.

       Exactly, Putin is dangerous whatever these people want to think. Any leader who shuts down protests, assassinates rivals, and kills journalists should not be someone we are friendly towards. My government professor worked for the UN and she would always stress that Putin was not someone to be taken lightly.

       I just so obvious at this point. Trump won't say anything negative about Russia, and he'll fire anyone that does.

       1) Tillerson is extremely pro Putin. Back when he was nominated people said that’s just to appease Putin. Now firing him is a move to pander to Putin? Replacing him with the far more critical Pompeo isn’t beneficial for Russia.

       2) Tillerson was essentially fired months ago

       Koch Brothers own Pompeo and now Trump’s cabinet is almost 💯 % Koch-approved. Pompeo is also a fundamentalist Christian which neatly checks the Council for National Policy (CNP) box.

       I agree the timing is bad.. It does not have anything to do with Russia.
You want it to be Russia related since that is easy and requires little to no thought to point the finger at. However, that is not the case. 
It is all about Iran and differences Trump and Rex had/have on the subject. You will see that there is more to come in the coming months.

       Not before he boasted about it assuming he was some sort of lucky macho intelligent man who would go over there and get them to de-nuke. Too bad Republicans have amnesia about Obama wanting to go to north Korea. Yet again Trump does something stupid and is cheered on by right wingers even though they hated when a leftist did it.

       Dude. Come on. They literally never achieved anything, and now trump won't get to either. I'm not saying go all out, but I AM saying this is basically the most remorseful they've seemed and closest to denuking they've been, and now we have a manchild who very clearly cannot handle this.

      <p>
       But you just said Obama was right, now you're saying you disagree with what he did? What do you think happened??
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just going to throw this out there. This is mind numbing. Its amazing to me that, like religion, everyone believes their political views are definitely right and immediately think the person debating them must be an idiot. I'm almost positive this conversation is going nowhere. Let me describe to you what this feels like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two guys are at a junkyard, one novice and one enthusiast. The enthusiast is looking for a junky car to fix up together with the novice. The novice has all these ideas about what is good and practical, and the enthusiast can't help but see the whole line of logic falling apart due to experience. The novice can't understand why he would be wrong wanting to do what he does, he considers himself knowledgeable about cars. More so than most people. He won't listen to the enthusiasts. He makes his own mistakes. They eventually both become enthusiasts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where that analogy breaks down is, the novice learns from his mistake. He has palpable consequences for his poor logic. In politics? Nope. No consequences. People will vote away their benefits or health care. They will vote away their rights to privacy. They will do things against their interest, from the micro to the macro, and they will be none the wiser. Don't be like that.

       Yes, that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       US policy. But it differed with north Korea, and that's what I'm trying to tell you. Obama wanted to talk to Un, and tried, but was contested by Republicans. They gave every reason in the book why he should go in with more demands. The more republican demands that got tacked on, the more NK demands got tacked on, thus leaving us at a stalemate. We would've been able to discuss de nuking long ago had it not been for the republicans. Yet... When SK sets up a meeting for discussion about denuking, he's all for it with no negotiation and has to be told how bad of an idea it would be to even have the meeting after showboating about going as if it was of his own accord. So, yeah, you're a little right Mr novice, but Mr enthusiast was paying attention at that point in time. If you were, you'd have known everything I just said. But you didn't.

       To reiterate, he was bogged down by republicans. They made it very clear it was their way or the highway. What could he have done? They had the majority.

      <p>
       So you agree with Obamas policy and Trump's... Intentions? At least you clarified that for me. Too bad Trump won't be doing it, because it truly is a bad idea to go in with no negotiations. Besides, its not like Obama wanted to sit right down, but he had the policy of compromise, Trump's policy is to negotiate. Not the same thing at all. So, do you agree with both still?

       I never said you were a Trump supporter. I'd imagine you consider yourself centrist or right wing though, according to your views, so I figured clarifying who is really doing what would be beneficial to you.

       No, the issue here is assuming I'm assuming anything and not going off of context clues, as well as your inability to even comprehend the topic at hand. I'll say it plainly, I don't know your views, all I know is they are very undeveloped and I've had to type a hell of a lot more than you to keep you up to speed.

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       First off, I just want to say
       <strong>
        fucking thank you for conceding.
       </strong>
       My respect for you and faith in discussion just got a major bump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, to begin with, I'd like to highlight a few major positions, events, and key players. That is, if I don't get wildly off track trying to cover all of the bases, of which there are a LOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, positions. Trumps position was to go in without preconditions, but to do all of the "negotiating" ie compromising, but did so with a better foothold in what needed to be accomplished. THIS is actual 4d chess because it shows he won't discuss anything unless its person to person, and we all know who really wears the pants in that room. However, this methodology is too subtle for Republicans. They think 4d chess is firing Steve Bannon and tweeting mysteriously. Anyway, Ben Shapiro (yes, that guy) even went on to say that we* would have criticized Obama for doing the same thing. This substantiates that he AND other Republicans see an exact parallel in approaches to meeting with Un by Trump and Obama. Which is funny, because just looking back shows me there are hardly ANY similarities. Obama wanted to, in his first year, meet with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela (sorry Venezuela!), Cuba (ayy) and of course, North Korea, all in Washington. Trump, however, wanted to go to North fucking Korea. You can imagine how that scenario plays out in Trump's head vs how it actually would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, to address why, specifically, just sitting down and negotiating wouldn't be a good idea. For one, it establishes legitimacy on the geopolitical stage. They are not a legitimate government. They are an oppressive nuclear armed dictatorial regime allied with most of the world's objectively most immoral nations. If they de nuke, it means that liberation is IMPOSSIBLE, and war is INEVITABLE because they will, obviously, take at least a hundred years to be reformed, and that's with external military assistance. That's unfortunately best case scenario. To put it shortly, dealing with all problem nations at once is in the US like Obama wanted to is like the bullies of school being called into the principals office and getting detention. Trump's approach is the principal going to a single bullies house and not talking to his mom, but sitting the kid down and saying "I'm a big guy, I can beat you up you know!" Then taking his non functioning bb gun away.

       It was ended early, and the leftist info is still not refuted. That's why they're in panic mode. Besides, we are pretty happy with a few indictments and no knock raids.

       the VAST MAJORITY of people I debate that are right wing simply wholly deny facts, regardless of how many there are. But, if I go trolling and say outlandish things, they'll agree without question. It's so beyond mental gymnastics, it's a whole new reality these people live in riddled with fallacious cockamamie bullshit.

       No, not the same bunch. Don't group every person into the same group that doesn't agree with you. We don't say all right wingers are Nazis, and you people hate when it does happen here and there (whom we both disagree with), so why do the same to other people without seeing how fallacious it is?

       Nice preconceived notions. Totally doesn't show your inherent bias towards the topic. If you aren't outraged, you aren't paying attention. It's that simple. I'll provide whatever sources necessary to back up any claim, but this time around, I just went through each point and highlighted exactly why you're wrong.

       Look I’m not for Russia believe me. But show me fucking definitive proof. If their is any then I’m sorry for being ignorant. In any case do you want war with a nuclear super power?

       I’m pretty rational and you can tell me otherwise but that won’t change the fact of what I know. Your opinions will be acknowledged though just to make you feel better.

       That wasn't an attempt to attack you personally. I was respond to what you said. You said "And you’re a regular on t_d, that makes it worse." That's an Ad hominem fallacy. You responded to his claim by attacking his political position.

       And? It’s true: any t_d regular is cancer. So you can deal with it. It’s not an opinion, it’s an established fact. You failed to “embarrass” me that all there is to it. Deal with it.

       I never said that's false. What does t_d being cancer have to do with PM May covering up the pedo scandal? It's unrelated, and therefore an Ad hominem.

       Trump hasn't seen eye to eye with Tillerson from the day he was appointed, and both have gotten into some name calling over that so this may just be the last straw in their rocky relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       A the moment the swamp has one less crocodile in it. Who knows what shifting Pompeo out of the CIA into Tillerson's place might mean? Right now it seems to be the closest one to the door and it will be interesting to see who's going to fill Pompeo's shoes although no one has ever been given that portfolio that wasn't a covert asset or agent of their's if they weren't already known to be one.

       It was at the beginning of December. First article I saw was Dec 1. That's almost 4 months ago. To be clear, my
       <em>
        point
       </em>
       is that many, many things happen in that much time.

      <p>
       What is, according to you, the threshold of time passed that is necessary for something to be considered a legitimate change?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I told someone 4 months ago that I'm not going to replace my tires, because I didn't need to replace them, but then something happened and i needed to replace them 4 months later.... does that mean that I "lied" when I said I'm not going to replace them?

       It's closer to three months, which I'm not sure what you're arguing from my original statement where I said "mere months ago".

      <p>
       Swapping out your tires isn't the same as swapping out Secretary of State, but you know that right?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not a threshold as much as I'm tired of this president saying one thing and doing the opposite without acknowledging his hypocrisy. I assume you have this much compassion for politicians you disagree with? Or are your values flexible when it comes to the president?

       one story I just read said they waterboarded a guy 83 times in 30 days (approx numbers) and beat him so badly he lost an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       The report said he knew no useful intelligence.

       Yup, here's the full quote from the NY Times article I linked above:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The C.I.A.’s first overseas detention site was in Thailand. It was run by Ms. Haspel, who oversaw the brutal interrogations of two detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Zubaydah alone was waterboarded 83 times in a single month, had his head repeatedly slammed into walls and endured other harsh methods before interrogators decided he had no useful information to provide.

       I certainly know I would be taking up arms if a foreign power invaded my country, killed my neighbors, kidnapped my family, and brutally tortured them. Not saying the terrorists are right either, but at a certain point it is pretty obvious that we are creating more than we are killing.

       Exactly. I'm not pro-terrorist but understanding what makes someone turn to it is important. You ever seen "The Fog of War" with Robert McNamara? One of his points is that you should empathise with your enemy. Interesting film.

       Slight aside: If terrorists only went after military or political targets at least they are making a point. Going after soft civilian targets wont endear you to anyone.

       I read the book A Bright Shining Lie, which includes much about Robert McNamara and his term in Vietnam. It really opened my eyes to how we were propping up a very unpopular regime in a country that's fought off invaders and occupiers for centuries if not millennia; verses a fairly shitty but more befitting force that also wasn't pushing Christianity on a majority historically Buddhist population. How corrupt the Diem regime was, how unclear the Americans goals were and how much disagreement in the Pentagon was going on whether to bomb more or to actually get the population and therefore ARVN on our side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant but I felt it gave a glimpse into how McNamara had decent insight into how Vietnam worked, but many generals just wanted to bomb the fuck out of the place. At least we tried building schools and bullshit in Afghanistan/Iraq... But hard to force a culture to change

       Do you remember during the Afghan war whens someone suggested it would be cheaper and easier to buy off the enemy? Instead of bombing the shit out of a country, why not build hospitals and schools and all that instead. Maybe I am naive.

       I agree, building infrastructure is much better than rebuilding everything. Problem is, we overpay well connected contractors millions to build a school or what have you, then pay some other well connected contractors millions to protect them. Meanwhile we already have the army there, and should be paying people and companies in country to build their homeland up. Good intentions being warped into disgraceful acts due to greed, a damn shame. I still believe we did a better job, but there's not a lot of trust in us due to less than friendly regime changes the West has been apart of. The East does as well, but don't sugar coat it as much lol

       If you take all the money spend on the war in the middle east and use it to create jobs, educate, and give internet access you have a cultural victory in a generation or two at half price.

       But then the military-industrial complex could not profit for generations to come. Yes, generations. This shit is going nowhere and it will only get worse as the middle east turns into a bigger and bigger shithole due to global warming.

       Deputy Director Gina Haspel is filling his shoes.

Of all the people to put in charge of the CIA, this has to be one of the worst options.

       There's no fucking findings that Russia or some Russian agent poisoned him. No witnesses, no facts, no hard evidence besides some nameless poison that they've accused the Russians of using sometime in the very distant past. The whole thing could be a complete fraud and totally made-up by MI6 for all we know. He was actually working for them until his own side happened to figure that out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lighten up, unless you've got some agenda of your own here. I wasn't defending Trump btw. Merely speculating about the nature of that development and that there's plenty of negative history with Tillerson besides him publicly agreeing with May on this issue, no doubt without consulting Trump as to whether he should or shouldn't on the public record which exactly why there's been so much of a disparity between what they've each had say about the very same situations any number of times already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blaming it on Russia is strictly a supposition and another log to throw on that blame-game fire until it gets hot enough to really start something no one is prepared for or wants to see and don't ever kid yourself there are assholes in the Us government and military who'd like nothing better than a nuclear and don't give a tinker's damn for the consequences for all the ordinary people that would get fried to crisp in one.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Haspel, she's is the Deputy Director and next in line according to the protocol, not unlike McCabe who was complicit in the same kind of nefarious activities as Comey and stepping straight into his shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Haspel remains interim or actually given the nod, depends on whether or not Trump decides to appoint someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if I don't jump to conclusions as quickly as quickly as you might like especially when the circumstances seem so openly contrived to get people to do just that.

       No, that's what I'm saying: Trump did give her the nod to be the new Director of the CIA. It's in the article I linked above, and in the article linked within that article, and in Trump's actual tweet. I assume you didn't read any of them? He wants her as head of the CIA. It might have something to do with his statements approving of water boarding and torture. Or maybe he was planning this all along, since she was appointed as Deputy Director during his presidency. If he planned on making Pompeo the Secretary of State, this might have been him getting his replacement in position.

       This is how they work, they agree, then add on a generalized attack at another target, the target that could legitimize the first target's statements.

       just because less than 1 percent or so of the CIA has been caught trafficking drugs and doing illegal unethical things, does not mean that's what they are all about. We have the greatest intelligence agency in the world who has done a lot to ensure that we can live our lives. Have some damn respect.

       And not all government officials are corrupt, and not all priests are pedophiles, and not all cops are murderers. But what CIA officers were put in prison for bringing drugs to LA into predominantly black communities? What punishment do they receive for willfully targeting poor neighborhoods and then blaming those same people for doing crack? Then political figures and police lock them up for non violent offenses, take away their families, subjugate  them further and lastly participate in their deaths? And who pays? Of course not all of them are bad, but until some, or any, are punished for their illegal and immortal activities that harm so many then stop acting as if we all need to show them respect.

       <p>
        When the CIA was created, its purpose was to create a clearinghouse for foreign policy intelligence and analysis. Today its primary purpose is to collect, analyze, evaluate, and disseminate foreign intelligence, and to perform
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation">
         covert actions.

        (Be my guest and take a trip down the wikipedia rabbit hole)

       <p>
        According to its fiscal 2013 budget, the CIA has five priorities:[3]
       </p>
       <p>
        Counterterrorism, the top priority
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonproliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.

       Yeah. 1984 is too mild compared to what reality is. We are headed for a more "Brave New World"-esque society. This is especially true I think because Aldous Huxley said most of what he detailed in his book has come true on his deathbed.

       Pompeo has only been the CIA director for under a year and was appointed by Trump. He is def a Trump guy. weather that is a good thing I guess depends on what fictionally team you think you are on.

       Pompeo is a full supporter of the surveilance state saying "Congress should pass a law re-establishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database. Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed. That includes Presidential Policy Directive-28, which bestows privacy rights on foreigners and imposes burdensome requirements to justify data collection."

       Trump was never going to drain the swamp.  He's always been a liar and a crook. That was just one lie of many that he fed an increasingly idiotic and rabid fan-base.

      <p>
       He tapped into that underlying racism and fear of change after 8 years of a good man being President, who also happened to have the audacity to do this while being biracial.

       Throwing around blanket statements like that is part of why he won. People got tired of not being able to have an opinion that didn't align with the main stream and getting shit for it. Not only that but it's quite a ridiculous statement to make period. Of course they see the cracks (or in many cases the whole wall missing). There will always be some who refuse to see what in front of them but that has happened since forever. Posting stuff like this isn't doing any body any good and just causes even further divide.

       Maybe I biased living in California but trump being popular in the news was anything but mainstream. And it really doesn't matter either way. That comment didn't do anything but make the situation worse. It's just diving and already divided country. If anything try and understand why people still believe trump and go from there. Just because you don't understand why someone thinks the way they do doesn't mean you should belittle them. When people use to disagree they would say there peace and move on. Now you HAVE to get everyone to agree with your perspective. You will NEVER get everyone to agree on anything in this world. Its part of life.

       No, I'm saying there are many factors that led to Trump's victory, a very minor, albeit still very illegal, aspect to it is the willingness of a presidential candidate and others in his administration (one of which facing life in prison) willingly met and teamed up with a hostile foreign government in an effort to assist the election of their candidate. Nobody is saying that's what won the election, that's what you people are so confused about. You're all parroting a factually incorrect talking point because you people aren't fact checking appropriately.

       Nobody is infallible. That was my point. When I voted for Clinton I did so because I thought she was he best choice. I was wrong. I came to that conclusion by having the awareness to come to that conclusion and the willpower to change my ideas on the subject.

       Bullshit. I’m a conservative Trump “supporter” and I see exactly what’s going on. People tend to dismiss us for being ignorant when all we believed is that everything that is happening right now is better than what would have happened under another Clinton. That’s it.

       This is kind of off-topic but I have wanted to speak to a reasonable Trump supporter about this, especially if you were conservative before.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump's protectionist economic policies backfire or fail to do what he says, would you consider backing a more globalist candidate (like a Romney) over Trump in the primary?

       Absolutely. But, then again, I voted for Clinton in this last election because I bought into the idea that she was then”lesser of two evils” so I may not be the guy you want to talk to about that. I only officially embraced the conservative brand and Trump in general after watching the left implode in the aftermath. I already vehemently supported the 2nd amendment and the freedom to speak our minds.  I didn’t support all the “global” nonsense and was looking for a harder stance on
       <em>
        illegal
       </em>
       immigration. If a candidate emerges who could stand up for those things while also holding himself to presidential standards and communicating effectively AND stood a chance of winning against Trump AND the democrats, I’d
       <em>
        prefer
       </em>
       them.

       Thanks for the answer. I agree that the culture wars aspect to modern politics are grossly misrepresenting what our actual views are. It’s so strange to me that the small government crowd is so specifically aligned with the religious right and misses on huge issues that could potentially bring young people like you into the fold. The fact that you have to go libertarian before you find pro-choice republicans that support marijuana legalization makes no fucking sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even shit I agree with gets politicized to such a point that it’s hard to remember why we came to these points. Black Lives Matter is supposed to be about why it’s nearly impossible to convict a cop who shoots a defenseless person. We can have a false culture war that divides us into pro-police and pro-minority or we can maybe agree that the legal system has a systematic flaw in certain cases and we should find policy solutions we can both agree on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can find a shit ton of opinions about what to do about healthcare but I’m pretty sure nobody thinks a consumer should pay $5k per prescription out of pocket for a life-saving drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t want the government to fix every problem at once, I want us as a society to be able to look at problems and say ‘well hey, that’s fucking broken’ without devolving into tribal bullshit.

       There is a difference between somebody who voted for Trump and being somebody who continues to support Trump.  The people who continue to support him and defend everything he does as if he is infallible are the problems.  People who voted for him because they thought Hillary would be worse but now recognize that Trump is shit are less of a problem.

       Let's say your on a date. They "joke" about slipping something in your drink. Or that you're at a team lunch at work and your boss "jokes" about firing everyone. It's not funny. It's

       Theresa May is not “basically agreeing that Russian may be involved” she flat out declared it and the closest we got was Tillerson. And Trump fires him less than 24-hours later. So again, Trump sort of implies one thing and does the opposite.  But we are insane screechers for noting this.

       then maybe, just maybe, he should do something about it. I would bet my measly salary that trump will do nothing of substance to retaliate against russia in support of the UK. He will talk, and talk, and then in reality will let Russia do whatever it wants, because trump is a pushover to putin for some reason

       He was told he’d be fired last Friday.

       Saying he was fired because he criticized Putin is narrative writing.

       Seems it was shady now that you mention it, but the decision to fire him was made last Friday at any rate. Not hours after he criticized Putin.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The firing was reportedly prompted by a statement from Goldstein on Tuesday, responding to Tillerson's firing, in which Goldstein said Tillerson did not speak with Trump before his firing and is "unaware" of the reason behind his dismissal.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statement strongly suggested that Tillerson found out about his firing from Twitter — though it differs from published accounts of the decision that cited unnamed White House sources.
       </p>
       <p>
        Goldstein also said Tillerson had "every intention of staying" before his firing.

       Nope, Trump lied, and fired the guy who called him out on it.

       Yeah that’s fine, so they didn’t actually tell him he’d be fired, but my post was more specifically about that the decision had been made last Friday and it wasn’t the Putin criticism that got him fired.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The AP quoted two unnamed senior department officials as saying Tillerson “received a call from John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff, on Friday, but was only told that there might be a presidential tweet that would concern him. Kelly didn’t tell Tillerson what the tweet might say or when it might actually publish.”

       That’s the narrative writing I was referring to. It makes no sense that he’d just sit around and wait until he attacked Russia to fire him if he was already planning on firing him.

       Obviously I don't think he was waiting for him to comment on Russia Trump isn't a mind reader. I do think he was hedging on it otherwise why not fire him on Friday? Why make vague statements through Kelly?

       Or maybe the people who put it out to the media that it was in the work since Friday is doing the narrative writing to cover their arses.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they have decided to fire him since Friday, why not give Tillerson a heads up that there will be a firing announcement, that is how these things work. This is a really shitty way to do it.

       It's certainly a possibility. But there are other likely options as well. Perhaps they both have knowledge that it wasn't Russia. Thereby making Rex's statement an unnecessary provocation against Russia.

       If they have knowledge then not releasing that knowledge is provocation.

       I'm also tired of hearing that if at all reacting when attacked is "provocation." No, not reacting is provocation. They keep doing this because they see it as a win, having no downsides.

       It very well could be a brazen attack by Russia, but I can't believe everyone else is so willing to jump to that conclusion. All because Tillerson, who was just a big oil tycoon villain to them a month ago, says it was.

       What seems fishy?  Tillerson is a NWO globalist traitor.  Same with McMaster and the others that have been fired or resigned.  They want a one world government.  This means that the U.S. ceases to exist as a sovereign nation, and the U.S. Constitution get thrown out the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that there are a bunch of fascists and communists who post here, but they claim to be "liberal" or "progressives".  Perhaps you want a one world government.

       Trump does get to appoint the first woman CIA director thanks to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who agreed in an official capacity, without seeing this massive amount of evidence Teresa May claims to have, is unprofessional and dangerous. Her accusations are hugely questionable without any proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       This attack was obviously meant to be very visible and seen by everyone. If you wanted a quiet hit, you'd kill him in a fake mugging. This was an obvious setup designed to fool the dumbest of people to think it was Russians from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       You either have to believe that Russia ordered a brazen mob hit meant to send a worldwide message, or this whole thing is the most obvious setup ever. Governments don't play kiddy mobster games like you see in the movies.

       Combined with Russian state media response to this I think it is very much what they would do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something that is very public and obviously Russian, but without ever being able to flat out prove it. It sends a message to all the other ex/current double agents out there, and anybody else who may be thinking about defecting. That message being "There's no safe haven. We will find you".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like these chemicals are readily available, or the formulae are easy to acquire. The nerve agent can be positively traced specifically to official Russian operation. So either they made it, or they've managed to let it fall into the wrong hands. Either of those are serious problems.

       Yes, it fits that romantic evil Russian TV mobster ideology that people have been indoctrinated with perfectly. And yes, everyone has Russian versions of the chemicals just in case they need to frame someone. I'm sure it will trace back to Russian chemicals, but if you assumed that makes it done by Russians, you'd be quite naive.

       It's clear to me that there are users that run the gamut of the political spectrum here to discuss this, it's pretty big news. Some are here in bad faith and others are here organically (like myself). When users make comments that most everyone here with upvotes are shills or here to brigade it's rather insulting in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have to agree and more than likely won't, just please don't assume that everyone that comes here to discuss what is arguably the largest conspiracy of the past decade as being a shill. I've been a user of this sub for the past 4 years, I'm not a shill and despise them to be honest. I also understand that Trump is polarizing and with that comes polarizing opinions, not all of which are shills.

       I've stated that I'm aware or the obvious shilling when it's apparent. How else would you qualify shilling aside from upvotes and downvotes or comments that are obviously against the grain/derailing a thread. To me this is all implied in your previous comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comments against the grain in a free thinking forum are not a true indicator, especially so on a site that allows comment scoring. It's more often than not the vote totals that are the biggest indicator. These indicators are also what are most used to lament one side more than the other and epecially so by the mods of this sub. Do you disagree with this statement?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the ability to tag users but, I don't go to those lengths because I don't care about other users or "the battle" that much. I attempt to use proper amounts of discernment and let the users and their arguments speak for themselves.

       OP claimed Trump is a prolific liar, which is true. Your response is a little odd and off-topic. Even if you give Trump the benefit of the doubt on "grey area" statements, he still says a lot of things that are completely, verifiably false.

       Every other thing he says, is different from the last thing he has said about the same subjects so he is openly dishonest so much so that we may not know that the other politicians are lying if they are but trump lies about everything he says, or he says something different than what he's previously said and if that's not lying what is?

       No, he's saying you have to wait to see what he does, and that saying anything at this point about his intentions, or using random shit to infer his intentions, is going to paint you as a moron.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the real conspiracy here is that Russia has dropped the ball on the commies, and doesn't care, at all, about communism anymore. So, the one who still care (Chinese maybe?) are trying real hard to stick it to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       That attack is the same shit as the "election hacking" thing. There's no proof that it's Russia, they only say it's Russia because it looks like "Russia tactics" and "Russian gasses". Tactics and gasses which everyone know about, as being "Russian", because it's in everyone's playbook now, and, as such, can be done by anyone to "look Russian".
      </p>
      <p>
       My prediction is that this investigation will finish in about 8-10 months, when nobody cares, and it's going to be another group, which is not Russian at all.

       That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. "It looks exactly like a Russia attack, and they had a good reason for the attack, and theres this evidence suggesting it was Russia: so it must be one of their enemies trying to frame them!"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is straight out of Putin's playbook too. Whenever one of his enemies dies, he loves to suggest they killed themselves to make him look bad.

       This should be higher up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone was up in arms about the Tillerson nomination because it was obvious Tillerson was very close with the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Trump gets rid of Tillerson and everyone is up in arms because it’s a “pro-Russia” move. In what world does it make sense for a Russian puppet to get rid of one of the pro-Russia voices in his administration? It doesn’t. Furthermore it makes less sense to replace him with an anti-Russia SOS, if you’re trying to help Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       This move clearly has to do with the North Korea situation and Trump asked Tillerson to resign after his comments on North Korea, not about Russia. I don’t blame Trump either, if I was on the cusp of a historic peace agreement with NK, I wouldn’t want my SOS undermining the process either.

       It's not that complicated, Tillerson simply did not cowtow to Russia the way that Putin expected after having givin' him the Russian Medal of Friendship or whatever. In september of last year Putin condemned Tillerson by seeing he's "fallen in with the wrong crowd" and said he regretted giving Tillerson the award previously. Now Tillerson is gone.

       The way the Trump era works of course it will be hard to find out what really happened for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Tillerson NK remarks:
       <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/08/rex-tillerson-north-korea-nuclear-weapons-445617">
        https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/08/rex-tillerson-north-korea-nuclear-weapons-445617
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the next day Tillerson cancels all of his meetings and flies home.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for if in fact he was told he was fired before he flew home there is no proof yet, just various anonymous sources articles, tweet, etc.

       No it doesn't. Even if that was true and he was warned on Friday, it was because Exxon Mobile just killed the deal with Rosneft. With the deal dead, Tillerson was not needed anymore. Tillerson knew he was being fired by Putin, I mean Trump, and was able to unleash on Russia which sealed his fate.

       It has literally nothing to do with Russia or NK comments timing, but the fact some here think it does goes to show just how ineffective their critical thinking skills have become. No surprise BS Russia narrative and MSM widespread meltdowns get so much traction

       So is the fake news media actually writing real news and we can trust the other reports that Trump has dismissed? Is his entire attack on certain media outlets completely bogus, since you're sure that a) that article was accurate and b) trump lied about it?

       ITT: Broad generalizations of people who don't immediately deep throat the brand new (likely) false flag and attempted murder of a double agent. Lots "muh Trumpers" and "collusion confirmed!"
      </p>
      <p>
       God, you people are so obvious it's beyond pathetic. Let's take a more objective look at this new narrative shall we?
      </p>
      <p>
       First is the erroneous comparison to Litvonenko.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://truepublica.org.uk/united-kingdom/not-told-russian-spy-sergei-skripal/">
        http://truepublica.org.uk/united-kingdom/not-told-russian-spy-sergei-skripal/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is a major difference between Alexander Litvinenko and Sergei Skripal, which is not being reflected in the media. Litvinenko was a good man who attempted to expose abuses of power within Russia, in defence of the rights of Russians. Skripal is a traitor who sold the identities of Russian agents abroad to the UK, in exchange for hard cash. This may very well have caused the deaths of some of those Russian agents operating in conflict zones. If this is indeed a poisoning, there are a great many people who may want Mr Skripal dead – nor in this murky world should we overlook the fact that he must have known interesting things about his MI6 handlers. “Litvinenko II” is rather too pat and obvious, and could be a false flag set-up.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In addition, there was a British government chemical weapons research facility 8 miles from the scene of the crime:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nerve agents including Sarin and VX are manufactured by the British Government in Porton Down, just 8 miles from where Sergei Skripal was attacked. The official British government story is that these nerve agents are only manufactured “To help develop effective medical countermeasures and to test systems”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The UK media universally accepted that the production of polonium by Russia was conclusive evidence that Vladimir Putin was personally responsible for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. In the case of Skripal, po-faced articles like this hilarious one in the Guardian speculate about where the nerve agent could possibly have come from – while totally failing to mention the fact that incident took place only eight miles from the largest stock of nerve agent in western Europe.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Skripal was also pardoned by the Kremlin and was part of an exchange with the US. Why did Russia then decide to use an obviously Russian-originiating neurotoxin to murder a retired spy who they allowed to leave?

       As I've stated elsewhere. The Russians developed the weapon in the 70s. Several other countries have since developed the agent including Cuba and Uzbekistan. I'm not saying Russia didn't 100% do it, I'm only stating that there's no possible way the UK knows for sure they did after 10 days. It's far from a certainty and the anti-Russia response and rhetoric is dangerous. May (&amp; Trump) need a distraction it would seem, but from what?

       If there are random people running around Europe with Russian made advanced chemical weapons then Russia really fucked up and owes the world an explanation as to how their weapons were stolen, and what needs to be done to get them re-secured.

       I'd like to see a source for that. From what I read it was developed in the mid 80s and nobody knew it existed until a whistleblower disclosed it in the 90s. Never heard of Cuba or Uzbekistan having access

       Everyone was up in arms about the Tillerson nomination because it was obvious Tillerson was very close with the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Trump gets rid of Tillerson and everyone is up in arms because it’s a “pro-Russia” move. In what world does it make sense for a Russian puppet to get rid of one of the pro-Russia voices in his administration? It doesn’t. Furthermore it makes less sense to replace him with an anti-Russia SOS, if you’re trying to help Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       This move clearly has to do with the North Korea situation and Trump asked Tillerson to resign after his comments on North Korea, not about Russia. I don’t blame Trump either, if I was on the cusp of a historic peace agreement with NK, I wouldn’t want my SOS undermining the process either.

        It's not that complicated, Tillerson simply did not kowtow to Russia the way that Putin expected after having givin' him the Russian Medal of Friendship or whatever. In september of last year Putin condemned Tillerson by saying he's "fallen in with the wrong crowd" and said he regretted giving Tillerson the award previously. Now Tillerson is gone.

        The State Department said Tillerson only learned of his termination when he read Trump’s tweet on Tuesday morning. Two senior department officials said Tillerson received a call from John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff, on Friday, but was only told that there might be a presidential tweet that would concern him. Kelly didn’t tell Tillerson what the tweet might say or when it might actually publish, according to the official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.

       I can't think of a better way to reassure Un that the U.S. will deal honestly with him to reach a deal than to replace the SoS with the head spook from the CIA shortly before the meeting.

       And from our perspective, Pompeo is certainly the right guy for the job.  He lied about the intelligence community concluding that "no votes were changed".  They did no such thing.

       The homeless could all be given homes for about the price of one bomb, but instead they are kept around so that the single mothers who work 3 jobs do not feel like they are at the bottom of the pile

       That's good to know. From this perspective, it seems there are 2 groups that support Trump and Putin. There is your group, which simply wants America to fail. But then there is the second group that says they want to "make America great again." It is interesting that 2 groups want such totally different outcomes, yet support the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is important for the American people to distinctly see these two groups and appreciate how different they are, both in terms of goals but also basic ideology.

       I'm not sure who the "they" is it that sentence. The people who say they support Trump in order to "MAGA"?  1984 is a great book, but you'll have to flesh out your reasoning and help me see how it is relevant in our discussion.

       Interesting. So your theory is that entertainment media is the root cause of the world's problems? But even further, that the government in america is responsible? Sounds like a pretty shallow explanation. How does this theory explain similar past events when the institutions you claim are responsible were not even in existence?

       It is good to see parallels to the real world when reading fiction, but you shouldn't read 2 fictional books and then claim to be a sociologist.

       Look, all I know is that everyone is very shallow these days. Totally consumed with the mundane...

       Every day there is a new headline about how the US government screws people over, but nothing is ever done about it (a recent example would be lead, and we all know what lead does to  peoples brains)

       Well supposedly he was sacked before these Russia comments. If that’s true then it does have nothing to do with that. I suppose we’ll need to wait and see if that’s true. I’ve read Tillerson has spoken to Trump and asked him to clarify the events around him being sacked, so we’ll see what happened in the coming days.

       its not so much defending putin, its asking to look beyond the screech of "russia influenced the election" and detail what exactly happened. divisive memes making up of less than .01% of facebook ad sales and possibly being behind the DNC/podesta emails.
      </p>

       well what was so bad about those? was it all just talk about yoga and grandkids? oh no, it was a huge scandal that pissed off all the sanders supporters. did russia force the DNC to act this way?

       everyone knows russia is a corrupt oligarch state. they routinely poison and assinate people. Romney was ridiculed for mentioning russian aggression, but now the democrats get up in arms when "her turn" is thwarted by the DNC being exposed

       A state actor used fake news stories to influence the outcome of a US election. The right not only allowed this to happen they seem (as you do) happy for the help. The result? A real contender for the worst president of all time. Even

       Mostly it comes down to the reality unless Putin is voted out of office or the RF Constitution is not amended and he leaves after his term limit then he is someone our government needs to have a stable relationship with.  Russia has a lot of problems but it also has a lot of power and we have issues we can work on together.  People cannot treat international diplomacy like a pre-school sandbox and fight about everything or say I'm not going to play with you. I think Trump wants to cool our tensions between our countries.  We both have interfered with each other's elections and have each other's countrymen's blood on our hands.  This Hatfield McCoy nonsense needs to stop.

       I'm sorry but I'm failing to see any conspiracy in this story. This seems like pure politics.

      <p>
       Yeah, I get the whole Russia collusion or Trump's an agent of Russia bit. I've decided that Trump's nuts must be in the grips of several mobsters in Russia who he owes money to. Not really a conspiracy, right? Just dumb.

       Why the knee jerk reaction to Russia? Why not a real investigation to ensure this is not yet another ploy to outrage people to attack Russia? Why would Russia do something this overt and visible when everyone is on edge and the spotlight is on them?

       To incite the west to sanctions or hostile actions against Russia for their profits and or geopolitical aims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time the west sanctions Russia, the Saudis gain more money because of the European oil and gas energy demand. They either get it from the Russians or the Saudis.
      </p>
      <p>
       War bucks. Every notch of fear mongering or hostilities to intimidate Russia, billions are spent on missile programs and proxy wars. Billions are spent on "foreign aid" which mostly go into defense spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is then forced to respond in kind to defend against those actions, which make even more money for the arms industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how arms races and wars start out. Each side increasing actions and proxy actions with the arms and oil dealers making bank in the middle on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       This moves the
       <a href="https://thebulletin.org/timeline">
        doomsday clock closer to midnight.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing to de-escelate the entire game is to remove the motives and that is with Europe going green. Just take the gas and oil out of the equation. Europe must  become energy independent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia and the Saudis need to find a new line of business. Oil and gas have been the major motive behind most of the wars and hostile regime changes of the last 100 years.

       Is this a conspiracy theory sub? Bc theorists dont trust msm. 
Unsubbing.  This is like listening to never trumpers.
But I will leave you some food for thought. 
Russian poisoned connected to Steele? Dossier?
Tillerson visited kenya. Suddenly 2 leaders that hate each other are happy to work together? Kenyans shocked by this and excited?
Who may or may not have been born in kenya?  Owns property in kenya?  Would kenya extradite?  Would the 2 leaders being in sync be good or bad for him? 
Peace.

       A mainstream media conspiracy pushed by the same media who announced last fall that Tillerson was about to be fired but wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pick one, mainstream media:
      </p>
      <p>
       —The State Department is being gutted and Tillerson isn't doing his job and officials are leaving in droves. He has no government experience and was only picked by Trump because Tillerson knows Putin and did business with Putin through ExxonMobile. He isn't the man for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       —Tillerson was the sole sane, reasonable in the administration and State Department. Trump is only firing him because Putin told him too and because Tillerson said the ex spy in the UK was probably poisoned by Russia.

       My take away is that Trump really didn't make the decision to fire Tillerson, but was compelled to do so - or more likely, someone who has a functioning brain told him to, because Trump is dumb and can not into politics.  Has nothing to do with ZE RUSSIANS or any such horseshit - anyone who is paying attention should know by now that Trump is not the boss and never was.
      </p>
      <p>
       What gets me about this is that you have people incredulously saying "ZE RUSSIANS" and not making the basic connection that the neocons won everything from this, which even a child could make.  I guess the point of that particular propaganda is to test just how gullible people are, and to test just how much bullshit Americans are willing to swallow.

       Yeah. But was he fired because of what the Kremlin may have on Trump, or can we get very cynical in thought and say that MAYBE the CIA is responsible for the nerve agent attack. The Foreign Technology Procurement Office of the U.S. Army EODC (before its dissolution) did acquire stocks of ALL Soviet-era nerve agents, and in case you (everyone) didn't know, the CIA has access to ALL biological and chemical weapons and cannot be questioned (or even logged down) about their need to remove any from inventory.

      <p>
       Last night, I was taking in the major news stories of the day, and they led me to a very unhappy conclusion. Maybe I'm wrong. I really hope I'm wrong, but I fear that I'm right.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, there was the news that Mueller is reconsidering his pursuit of obstruction of justice charges against Trump. I find that odd, because so far that's the only thing he stands accused of that Trump has pretty clearly tried to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, comes the story that the House has closed its investigation, with the conclusion that there was no collusion. They're satisfied and done. Odd. Why is everyone suddenly and coincidentally ready to move on to other things?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, I read the story about Theresa May giving Putin a deadline to answer for the poisoning of the double agent, which she characterized as an attack on the entirety of the UK, even though there isn't clear evidence of who did the deed. She demands an answer, pronto. May then took it next level by advising all citizens of the country they should feel alarmed enough to wash all their clothing. Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Next up, the story that Rex Tillerson came forward to assert that Putin did poison that spy, no matter what Trump is going to say about it. Anyway, Trump's over in the corner focusing on his parade planning. A military parade is no longer a bad idea. Let's see that might on display, so it can fill our hearts with patriotic pride and bring about a sense of oneness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is no longer of interest or consequence to anyone else with power in Washington, no matter who gave them that power. He has been neutralized. The establishment is pushing him aside, forging ahead, and taking us to war just as they've always intended, and just as Hillary Clinton telegraphed during her campaign. When Trump makes the announcement, he'll feel out from under attack, important, and in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not pretend or kid ourselves. Every bit of this Russiagate maneuvering, and its attending propaganda, has always been about covering up the real 2016 conspiracies (involving the FBI, Clinton campaign, and Obama DoJ), and getting us here, to this point. It has always been about shutting dissidents down, building consensus, and gaining approval from American citizens to attack a people who have no desire for war with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're going to war. This is what the Allied empire does. It attacks people. It uses our innocent, unwitting young people to do the dirty work of feeding the military industrial complex. War in the Middle East is insufficient, dying down, and can no longer be justified. The empire needs fresh targets to support their lust. We go to war, the rich stay rich, their children stay home, ours fight the fight. That's the deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why will the majority of Americans be perfectly okay with going to war now? Because we're all mad as hell, and more divided than we've been in anyone's memory, and Russia's as good a culprit as any to pin the blame on. We've got large expanses of ocean on either side of us, large countries shielding us to the north and south. We feel pretty safe at home. Besides, a war buildup requires goods, which is great for the economy. Everyone's down for a robust economy and new jobs, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Screw truth, screw justice, and screw peace. We're Americans. This is how we roll. Why should we stop now?

       Actually I think the "anti-war" side is all on board with a war with Russia. Shows how easily manipulated public opinion is. I was thinking the other day about how if Hillary was president we would be beating the war drums would hard. And that how obviously using a Russian nerve agent seems like a false flag. It seems to obvious that this is a play to change the situation in Syria.

       The firing had absolutely nothing to do with Mr.Tillerson being Anti or Pro Russian. This firing had everything to do with Zionists interests preparing the board for conflict with Iran. Mr. Tillerson wasn't going to have anything to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had said for months that if the reports were true of Trump wanting Tillerson to resign were true, Mr. Tillerson would make Trump fire him. He did just that.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the conspiracy community underestimates the power of the Zionists. They have effectively infiltrated the nationalist resistance and actively playing both sides.

       Exactly the current people in power.  Similar to Bush/Cheney getting pushed aside, so it the Obama/Clinton narrative.  That shit is old news and in the past.  Are you not able to keep up?

       Given that even though Trump said that then (of course the WH has been fighting constant leaks) and wants to keep internal affairs internal, the reality is this exact thing just happened, and this article was proven accurate.

       So is the fake news media actually writing real news and we can trust the other reports that Trump has dismissed? Is his entire attack on certain media outlets completely bogus, since you're sure that a) that article was accurate and b) trump lied about it?

       It's certainly a possibility. But there are other likely options as well. Perhaps they both have knowledge that it wasn't Russia. Thereby making Rex's statement an unnecessary provocation against Russia.
