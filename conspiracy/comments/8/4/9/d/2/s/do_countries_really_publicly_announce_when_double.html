       No evidence this was carried out by Russian State has been presented.  This is completely outrageous, and for May, the incompetent war-mongering cow, to threaten cyber attacks against Russia in retaliation is completely beyond the Pale.  WTF!

       I just don’t understand what reason in 2018 Russia would have to kill a guy that they knew had flipped and swapped with the U.K. in 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skripal was known to Russia as a traitor (from Russia’s POV) 8 years ago. Why make an example of him now, 8 years later, at a time when the entire world is just begging for an excuse to levy more pain on Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why use a method that basically screams “It’s us. Russia. We murdered Skripal.”
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s like a robber goes into a house and then thinks “wait, I better take my gloves off so I leave my finger prints all over this place.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.K. and the international community is absolutely in the right to petition for answers, but to attribute blame immediately just seems short sighted.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess we are left to think that Russia is simultaneously a master of espionage but so sloppy that they leave obvious finger prints everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Russia did do it. The issue I have is that the concept that Russia did not do it is not even being entertained.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, fuck me for wanting a bunch of nations with nukes, run by sociopaths, to actually conduct an investigation before provoking each other.

       Sure they are, they’re a nuclear power and NATO member countries even excluding the US dwarf the military might of Russia.

       On either side they both have enough nuclear power to destroy the entire planet several times over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individually they can each destroy the world. After a certain point the number of nukes don’t matter, the fact that you have nukes (plural) does.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if number of nukes is all that matters then who the fuck cares what the US’ stance is? It’s irrelevant to the conversation if we’re just going on number of nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       100 nukes can kill the earth. The UK has 215. So the U.K. can destroy the entire earth twice and then some.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who cares who has more when each power can destroy the entire world by themselves?

       The SCO isn’t a formal military alliance. You’re making an assumption that the SCO would back Russia militarily in a direct confrontation. There is no formal requirement for them to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no, modern economists do not view war as beneficial for the economy. War being good for the economy is a fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could argue a proxy war being good for the economy maybe, but direct conflict on your own sovereign soil would be an economic disaster for any country in the modern age.
      </p>
      <p>
       If war is good for the economy then why isn’t Syria’s economy booming? Hint: Syria’s economy is completely fucked.

       Sure and the issue between U.K. and Russian dick measuring isn’t a proxy war. It’s direct military conflict. Between major world powers, NATO, and sure possibly SCO member states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Direct military conflict on that scale would be an economic disaster and every single one of those states know this.

       You're right. Doubtful there will be boots on the ground -- on the actor's own soil. But boots may be on the ground somewhere. Hence the reason Germany is shoring up more troops, etc.

       Agreed. And proxy wars are the MO for involvement in the Middle East.

       No this is stupid because after the nukes are done falling everyone is already dead and no military conflict in history has ever started with nukes launching first.

       What the other commenter neglects to mention is the SCO is not a formal military alliance like NATO. It is an organization for economic and strategic cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       China and Russia have repeatedly denied it’s ever even going to become a formal military alliance like NATO. So to assume every SCO member would back Russia militarily is an assumption since there’s not formal requirement for them to do so.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Telegraph reported that if the Kremlin believed Skripal helped compile the Trump dossier, it could provide a motive for the assassination attempt in Salisbury.
       </p>
       <p>
        A former Russian construction magnate told Channel 4 News Skripal was “working in cyber-security and every month going to the [Russian] embassy to meet military intelligence officers”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Telegraph said a “hit squad” was dispatched by the Kremlin to assassinate Skripal, to send a message that traitors were not tolerated.
       </p>
       <p>
        UK intelligence services suspect the attack was delayed by the snowstorm that enveloped Britain last week, which kept Skripal and his daughters indoors and made the assassination squad’s escape from the country more problematic.
       </p>
       <p>
        “By Sunday afternoon, with Miss Skripal on the brink of returning to Moscow, the assassination squad had little room for manoeuvre and were forced into action in broad daylight in the middle of a busy shopping precinct,” the Telegraph reported.

       I find it hard to believe Russia is masterful enough at espionage to puppeteer multiple major world powers, but dumb enough to leave loose ends with ties to Skripal in positions at the highest level of the Kremlin over 8 years later. Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don’t have to murder them. But contacts he had in 2010 most probably aren’t the individuals making high level Kremlin decisions no. That would require Russia to be very stupid, which if reporting is to be believed, they are actually quite good at this espionage thing.

       The guy was making a reference to former Russians turning up dead in England over the years. It’s not a tacit admission of guilt.

       And sure maybe that’s my mistake. I generally think powerful individuals act in their own self interest. Skripal’s assassination isn’t well timed for Putin.

       As someone who is neither Russian nor British and a conspiracy nutjob, my first question in mind was "who benefits?". Surely, Putin being the evil KGB agent would know that it's a lose-lose situation for him if he assassinated someone in foreign country? So who is actually benefiting? Are those the neocons who want war with Russia and Iran?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point I wanted to make is, recently there was news articles from UK about massive amount of girls being abused. This assassination has now covered most of the newspapers.

       On one hand, you have american freedom, democracy, and sustaining the american dream. Think Obama's message. This is what's advertised.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other you have the absolute truth that US Inc is a corporation, one that is maintaining its dominance like every other corporation who values profit as it's bottom line - PR. Except we're dealing with PR on a global stage. Pipelines, currencies, resources, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hey. Maybe we need to continue to intervene in the middle east. Maybe we need to start a new cold war. Maybe we need to continue the dominance of the petrodollar against any state that dares to own their resources and use the profit as they see fit without debt.
      </p>

       But don't you dare believe that the IC of the US is working for me and you.

       how does rex being fired by trump right after this fit into this paradigm then?
      </p>
      <p>
       making the story more legitimate, and using him as a patsy, whether he agreed with may or not, or trump resisting the narrative and firing him because he is fighting the narrative, or is to dumb or removed from it to know how to respond.

       Since when does exchanging captured spies with another country that's captured some of your own ever get publicised or reported? Clearly it's an embarrassment to both sides that they want to keep quiet not publicly admit they were even involved in much less caught in the act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover this spy was a Russian Intelligence official guilty of betraying agents of his own country for a $100,000 bribe and was caught and sentenced to 13 years for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's hardly a hero, merely a less than scrupulous character who's loyalty to his country and those who worked with him for that country could be bribed and bought-off by foreign agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for any PR value, the story has only been made public NOW not when it actually happened and he was quietly swapped for a captured Russian agent and given asylum since he's chosen to be an exile from his own country rather than serve out his sentence, not "amnesty" as you call it since he wasn't guilty of anything in the U.K.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all completely untrustworthy propaganda with MI6 getting some extra mileage out this former paid informer in order to conveniently blame the Russians for attempting to do him in.

       I agree. The desperate attempt to assign blame without due process is what makes me uneasy about this situation. I feel like they're using this person's murder as a mere prop for political theater to push for a retaliation against Russia. I don't understand why so many seem to desire direct war with Russia. It's either that they've forgotten about the basic idea of mutually assured destruction or they actually want mutually assured destruction.

       Last year was an amazingly profitable one for arms sales. There were hundreds of billions sold worldwide. The US has a good portion of that, though Russia does well for itself.  It's hard to keep that up if peace breaks out so I doubt most involved care about our demise. Or perhaps they're all playing us like fiddles and have no intention of using the big guns but do need those contracts so they spread some panic. It's a terrible game to play though as there are too many factors that could lead to the destruction of human kind. These people are corrupt and dangerous either way.

       I think this is very possible too. Putin was put into power by being #2 behind Boris Yeltsin. Putin was chosen by Yeltsin to follow him too. This is interesting because the US meddled in the 1996 election in Russia to put Yeltsin in power. Thinking of this, it's interesting to remember that Putin has been close with both the Bushes and the Clintons. Maybe all this anti-Russia hysteria is a completely manufactured scheme and Putin is actually in on it, so nothing will actually happen to the US.

       Countries can't respond to the killings in a measured way (with sanctions, etc.) without making them public. You can't convince people to pass sanctions, or other repercussions without laying the evidence out publicly.
      </p>

       Putin has been openly assassinating former spies since
       <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-19647226">
        at least 2006
       </a>
       . Of course there are simpler, less obviously connected to Russia methods of killing a person. That's not the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is to announce to the world, to every defector and would be defector, that there is nowhere in the world you can run. Putin will murder you, wherever you are, and he will get away with it.

       So who did this then? Both UK and EU are too busy with Brexit and refugee crisis to start a confrontation with Russia, US is ruled by Trump and they haven't pointed fingers at Russia so they probably didn't do it either.

       This doesn't quite work since one of the main reasons why the popularity of US is tanking across Europe is because of Trump and that opinion isn't going to be fixed with hating on Russia.

       Putin no longer want to play nice. He doesn't give a fuck about the international community, which is just Western Anglo-Saxon ganging together on him/"his" country. His propaganda campaign for Brexit and Trump has worked great to divide the UK-EU-US political alliance. With idiots arguing that he didn't take the Crimea, invade the Ukraine or shot down MH17, and that he couldn't possibly assassinate an ex-spy because it's too "obvious", he's enjoying himself thoroughly.

       Why would Vladimir Putin, in the midst of a presidential election, bother to knock off a minor traitor who has been living quietly in Britain for ten years and whose daughter visits him regularly from Moscow. Not only  that but leave all the traces for the British police to find?

       It is strange that there is a chemical weapons factory just 8 miles down the road from Salisbury. There are motives aplenty why the intelligence community in Britain wanted to have an inconvenient resident out of the way

       I find it hard to believe Russia is masterful enough at espionage to puppeteer multiple major world powers, but dumb enough to leave loose ends with ties to Skripal in positions at the highest level of the Kremlin over 8 years later. Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don’t have to murder them. But contacts he had in 2010 most probably aren’t the individuals making high level Kremlin decisions no. That would require Russia to be very stupid, which if reporting is to be believed, they are actually quite good at this espionage thing.

       The guy was making a reference to former Russians turning up dead in England over the years. It’s not a tacit admission of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       And sure maybe that’s my mistake. I generally think powerful individuals act in their own self interest. Skripal’s assassination isn’t well timed for Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Skripal may just live to tell his tale, so maybe we’ll get actual answers instead of conjecture.

       You're right. Doubtful there will be boots on the ground -- on the actor's own soil. But boots may be on the ground somewhere. Hence the reason Germany is shoring up more troops, etc.
