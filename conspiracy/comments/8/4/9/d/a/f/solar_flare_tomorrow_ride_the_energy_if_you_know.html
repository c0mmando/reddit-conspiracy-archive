    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate both your skepticism, and your willingness to place a value on your own subjective experience even if it doesnt align with mainstream scientific and social paradigms.</p>

<p>I could get into great detail about how this all works, but i dont think that will convince you. It never convinced me. I had experience it myself firsthand and I think that is true for everyone. Instead Ill try to offer a loose framework and some suggestions.</p>

<p>Given your experience with magnets, you have an idea of how crystals interact with our own electromagnetic biofields, commonly known as auras. Hematite is a magnetic crystal. crystals can help you resonate at different frequencies. whenever there is a person or object that is emitting a frequency you are interacting with, your brain will attempt to match that frequency unless you tell it not too.</p>

<p>Id recommend you experiment with crystals. a simple quartz, amethyst, and black tourmaline should be good to get you started. you should do what you want with them. diferent people experience them differently. Def try putting them near your different chakras and see if you can feel them interacting. At first, it might just be a feeling that, Oh, so thats where that chakra is.</p>

<p>None of this will have any effect and you will feel nothing if you are not familiar with your higher self. You can think of your higher self as the self simply as your true personality, as opposed to the socially created personality. your higher self is the foundation. You can discover your higher self by doing self activities. These are things that you love to do and have fun doing. Its that simple. The more you have fun and do what you enjoy, the more you will get to know your higher self.</p>

<p>Finally and most importantly is the power of intent. Intent is an extremely powerful force we each possess. If your intent is clouded by fear or doubt then it will not work. If you can master intent, many doors will be open to you.</p>

<p>A lot of people keep looking for something special that they havent experienced before, but actually its been right in front of you the whole time, most likely you just didnt appreciate it for what it is and does. </p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/IGnuGnat.html">IGnuGnat</a> 2018-03-14</p>
    <div class="md"><p>While I am generally skeptical of crystals and new age type stuff, I do believe that riding bicycles and motorcycles is a form of meditation, and I try to do it as often as I can. When I was younger, I was able to train myself to have lucid dreams and to perform certain functions within the dream. I have had one or two other incidents, which I was never able to fully explain. </p>

<p>The main issue I have with these sorts of alternative thinking is that I find little scientific evidence for the vast majority of it, and I&#39;ve looked very hard. It seems to depend on believing that as an individual, you are somehow superior or have secret knowledge, and I always wonder if there&#39;s an element of the willingness to delude oneself, which I think is dangerous. </p>

<p>However, I kind of like the look of crystals, and I&#39;m not opposed to it; maybe I&#39;ll try it one day. </p>

<p>Although I hesitate to encourage you to go down this path, due to my own skepticism, you might be interested in a sort of bean or nut that I&#39;ve heard of, that may be capable of inducing lucid dreaming, or assisting in remembering dreams better. It&#39;s called Entada Rheedii, and it&#39;s an African bean. I ordered 5 of them for a few dollars on Ebay, and then cracked one open to try it, but it tasted fairly bitter and left an unpleasant numbing sensation on the tongue, and was so hard I feared I&#39;d crack a tooth. So, I put them into plastic bags one by one, cracked them open with hammer, extracted the nut, and used a coffee grinder to grind them down. I like to try different health supplements, so I have a capsule maker, and I used that to cap the powder that resulted. I tried one large dose approximately equal to one whole nut, which caused a little digestive discomfort the next day, and several smaller doses from 1-5 caps, and while I didn&#39;t lucid dream, I slept well and noticed that my dreams seemed more vivid, and more memorable. Do your own research. I thought perhaps, you might find this interesting.</p>

<p>Onwards,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the rec on the Entada Rheedi. Ill def try to get some. I share your affinity for cycling. I would consider it one of my self activities.</p>

<p>There is a lot of sciencitfic validation for auras and human biofields. they can see them with MRI </p>

<p>Also, keep in mind the following scientific truths:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>matter is energy, energy is matter. energy can neither be created or destroyed. </p></li>
<li><p>every single cell of our bodies contains a copy of our entire DNA</p></li>

<p>today Ive had this feeling all day that theres this gyroscope spinning in my head near the third eye area. It&#39;s like a whoomp, whoomp, whoomp. It actually made me nauseas and has drained my energy. I did a 1hr meditation and that helped calm me down, but its not super pleasant.</p>

<p>If its like last flare in , this feeling will give way to very positive feelings and a burst of energy that lasts for days, plateauing, then becomes unnoticeable. </p>
