       Edward Snowden comes out to condemn the new CIA director because she's oversaw torture and they shat down his throat and called him a "traitor, snowflake, libtard, leftist" all of that. For being against torture! I thought the alt-media was against George Bush's crimes! But it's about fighting Islamic terrorism! (I don't support Islam, I don't support open-borders, or PC stuff, or any of that social engineering stuff). Serious go fuck yourselves people on infowars, and you Alex Jones, fuck you unprincipled hack. I supported Trump's recent moves in the last few months but I can't support this. So, no I am not a snowflake for being against torture and these CIA blacksites.

       I'm just angry right now at these people. I thought they were better than this.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Let me state this flatly: it was never our purpose to prevent the CIA from detaining and interrogating terrorists. On the contrary, it is important to the war on terror that the CIA have the ability to do so. At the same time, the CIA's interrogation program has to abide by the rules, including the standards of the Detainee Treatment Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd emphasize that the DTA permits the CIA to use different techniques than the military employs, but that it is not intended to permit the CIA to use unduly coercive techniques -- indeed, the same act prohibits the use of any cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment

       Maybe try the end where the author summarizes his analysis.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not what I could call a clarion call against torture. And neither is the senator's op-ed. Indeed, what's fascinating about the senator's piece this week is how well it shows he has mastered the compartmentalization of this issue, both in public and, evidently, in his own mind. He is against torturing terror suspects if they are waterboarded. But he won't vote to stop the torture of terror suspects if they are subject to other forms of "enhanced interrogation." He is against having American soldiers torture terror suspects, but he was in favor of allowing American intelligence officials to continue to do so. And he just "defines" away the contradictions. Quite literally, a tortured soul.

       That's the way this person interprets what McCain said. That's not what he said though. He explicitly said he was for interrogation techniques that didn't fall in line with torturing them.

       speaking with a lot of people who have first hand experience with enhanced interrogation and fighting a war on terror. this is just the we are fighting an enemey that isnt afraid of dying and will not respond to traditional methods of interrogation. this is the reality of the world we live in.

       The alt right is being slowly co-opted into the GOP/Right wing apparatus.  All the haunts will be taken over, the threads will all toe the line and you will find yourself defending stuff you thought was good conservative / independent ideals.

       This is what happens in a two party system.  Both sides are a big tent and the whole subsumes the part, the whole takes in the fringe.  This is what happened with the Tea Party, this is what happened in the 60s with the anti-war movement...the whole subsumes the part and has been since day 1.

       I believe it is very likely that governments are actively making forums and social media toxic so that people stop visiting or give up seeking information.

       Should be. Yes, one would think. However, since 9/11 we’ve rolled that one back. We’ve renamed torture “enhanced interrogation” so we can pretend we don’t do what we condemn other countries for doing. It doesn’t matter what we call it, we’re still torturing people. You’d think that we, as Americans, could at least agree to oppose torture, but we can’t. There’s a sizable number of Americans who really like the idea of hooking a car battery up to some guy’s balls and seeing how loud he can scream.

       What you see online cannot be counted on as representative of the population.  Remember that governments can, will, and do screw with social media, and that with the 2013 DNAA, the USG now actively uses propaganda against its own citizens.  So don't get to upset that comments like this appear and ascribe them to all those watching infowars, or any other channel.  The objective is to divide to keep control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get out and talk to people in person instead.  Don't rely on social media to figure out what people think.
