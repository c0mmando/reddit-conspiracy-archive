       This has been happening periodically now for weeks. But as of recently, it's like I see 4 threads a day saying how bad or how political this sub has become. But look at r/conspiracy in 2010, there were a lot of political themed threads then:
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100212053800/reddit.com//r/conspiracy">
        https://web.archive.org/web/20100212053800/reddit.com//r/conspiracy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would people attempt again and again to discredit the sub? What would they gain from making it seem like its been corrupted?
      </p>
      <p>
       These threads make it to the top every time. Definitely some vote manipulation there.

       They are posting and supporting bs conspiracy themes and targeting those that follow, push, or argue them. My guess is to sway views on agenda items, or election policy. Only small percentiles are needed, and these faith believers are the new swing vote. Digitally manipulated propaganda no commercials 24/7

       I noticed that also. I think they are doing it on purpose to get people to not come here anymore. It has changed but that doesn't mean we need to bail ship and declare the sub dead. The genuine users just need to be more active is all.

       This is my take too. I think we should limit meta-posts (not self-posts) to Saturdays or Sundays to cut back on it; not just to improve the day-to-day quality, but if shills are making those sorts of posts, then they'll have to be paid overtime.
      </p>

       Of course, the moderation in this sub must be a huge pain in the arse as it is. Maybe the new additions will help?

       I like when subs have self post only days. For a sub like this make exceptions based on content which mods approve on that specific day. Like if there was a major event or something. Having the roundtable is a step in the right direction.

       If those people really cared they would post the type of content they want here.

       We should all call out their stupid narrative when they post it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two biggest threads yesterday were anti-Trump. Anti-Trump information gets plenty of views here. The problem is that many people don't realize it. I've seen countless comments upvoted to the sky, occasionally guided, posting anti-Trump information. Sometimes they say "This sub is completely controlled by Trump supporters," yet they are upvoted and guilded. You would expect the lightbulb to go off in their head, but I guess not. Who is upvoting those comments if this sub is "T_D 2.0?"

       and this is just what I could find from a quick search. There are recent threads and some going back to a year ago. This sub has always had big anti-Trump threads.

       Okay so, I'm one of the users you guys would be talking about let me explain my reasoning, ive been coming to this sub for a while and in the past there was more content diversity and just for our purposes we will label it non political and political even though its not that black and white. The reason I, and I'm sure many other users here are missing the non political posts are because theyre fun to theorize about I love watching stuff on ancient civilizations and alternative history along with supernatural or unexplained occurrances, it plays into my curious nature for the unknown. Its damn good content. Then we have the political content do I care about it and read it? Yes! Its important to me to always be seeking a truth that I believe is hidden from me. But, seeing it all over the sub everyday weighs heavy in my soul and sometimes I just want to read about a damn ufo.

       There still is. The problem is the upvote/downvote system. It's not on the front page always, but it's there.

       Yes, I know. Which is why I and others here are calling you guys out. You guys just want
       <a href="/r/HistoryChannel">
        /r/HistoryChannel
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/PopConspiracy">
        /r/PopConspiracy
       </a>
       . I like it too, that's how I got started into it, but this whole talk of "going back to the old days" is just dumbing the sub down. And as I said above, that content is already here just not on the front page. So really, you just want it to be even easier to see what you want than to just scroll through a couple pages by pressing a button/tapping you screen. Also, I visit
       <a href="/r/holofractal">
        /r/holofractal
       </a>
       for pop conspiracy shit, by the way. If you want to theorize and be amazed by gifs that tap into that, thats the place to go. Or to be amazed by what is "proof" to people. Either way, good stuff.
      </p>

      <p>
       And again, that's why people here are calling you guys out. You're admitting yourself it's just a dumbed-down version of what we have now to make you feel less depressed about "real" conspiracies with evidence that affect your lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that plays right into the mentality used against us on this site and in society. They think we believe certain conspiracies because it makes it easier to swallow the reality of a situation. That we are just potheads theorizing about shit we saw on the History Channel like ancient aliens going "the Maaan is totally hiding the alien bodies, mann. It's a conspiraccyyy". That's exactly what you want the sub to become.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's fine, I guess. Because the shit I visit this sub for will still be here, and I'll still have to scroll to find it. And that's okay.

       We're closer to aliens than ever with the UFO footage the DoD has released through To the Stars. Or at least a step in the right direction. I would like to see more footage that isn't an F/A-18's FLIR.

       It's not the politics I mind, it's the clear and obvious shilling. I don't say this to discredit the sub but rather point out a reality that most long-term users here can see pretty readily.

       But yes, saying "the sub is dying" has been a tactic by users I've tagged as shills. Projection is a common theme among those with subversive goals.

       The Trump supporters flooded reddit 2015/16 then over 2017, they turned a lot of the bots off and got bored and relaxed and since like last fall, the liberals are flooding back into the subs that got Trumped and are full off piss and vinegar...but come last this summer, the Trump folks will cme back andd the process starts all over again.

       This isn't about Trump posters

       This is about anti conspiracy users brigading trying to disprove any conspiracy that goes against their political beliefs.

      <p>
       Prime example: The Seth Rich post on the top of the sub right now. The post implying Seth Richs death was a botched robbery like the police say.........Yeah this sub has ALWAYS believed the Seth Rich conspiracy but now all of a sudden they don't even though his murder is still unsolved? No this sub is being flooded by shills

       It

       changed drastically in terms of the percentage of posts that are political (particularly American). When Reddit started full-force censorship and astroturfing in the run up to the 2016 election the content posted here changed accordingly.

       At its most basic form, it's changing.  Humans fear change.  It's in their programming.  We are born welcoming the mundane, expected today, providing it was precisely like yesterday.  It's a terrifying thing not knowing what to expect.

       I have posted and seen other posts where they seem to be brigaded with "this isn't a conspiracy" comments no matter what the subject. It feels like there is something going on trying to dilute or destroy this sub altogether. If a sub about conspiracy won't consider all arguments for a conspiracy, then what's the point?

       Yeah, good looking out. I've noticed the complaints, even gave them credence, but come to think of it, I never remember a time when political contnt wasn't to be found. Anyways, I think some of the "classic" conspiracies people profess a fondness for have always been purposefully disseminated to distract and discredit. People don't want you considering political topics because that's too close to the more important conspiracies, like the fact that democracy doesn't exist or that America is a global empire.

       I feel like a good Conspiracy theorist should always gravitate toward the political, and ignore the partisan.
      </p>
      <p>
       There used to be a consistent questioning of Bush, Clinton, and Obama. But for some reason with Trump there is an instant assumption that he's guilty of nothing, or he's guilty of creating the common cold.
      </p>
      <p>
       That split is why people think this place is dying. Everyone views every political post through partisan lenses and either tries to argue either democrats or republicans/russia is behind every conspiracy. Despite the token posts about how they're both wings of the same bird, the comment sections seem to treat it like a one or the other thing.

       It's not politics. It's partisanship.

       They say it's dying because it's now apperntly pro trump. Which I though was funny seeing as both sides of American (all governments) serve only to be re-elected and by extension serve their friends.

       What is "anti-antisemitism"? You mean I am against those speak out against shits committed Israel and her ilks?

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Using the term "antisemitism" exclusively for Jews/Israel is itself an abuse cos Arabs are mostly "Semites" as well. Which I categorically reject, and it's low and it's shame.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I am not against those who speak their mind against Bad Jews/Israel. So, there is no "anti-antisemitism".

       </li>
       <li>

         Hiding the truth is neither "antisemitism" nor "anti-antisemitism".... It's against freedom, it's plain crime against humanity.

       That’s because they’re right. This subreddit is MUCH more schismatic  and is rapidly incorporating unrelated material. It’s also equating itself with stupid, vapid notions.p (i.e this Hawkings nonsense). It’s all an attempt to derail and submerge proper discussions. It’s happening, but not yet completed.

       I feel like a majority of people I talk to about this sub are tired of the Pizzagate bullshit and the constant posting of articles regarding sex abuse. It gets so fucking old.

       There are more shills than ever, which sucks, but overall the sub is still cool.

       With the recent wave of bannings, it's only a matter of time until this sub is banned. One more pizzagate gunman type event and I think it's over

       I noticed this too. Along with everybody and their mom being labeled a “schill”. I never heard the word so much in my life until I started visiting this page. I feel like this is all fishy too. Just because somebody is saying this page is dead and it’s all about politics, doesn’t mean that it is. All you have to do is click the new filter and see there’s plenty of talk going on that’s not just political.

       Doesn’t make racist and sexist less real either, but ppl calling everyone they disagree with racist, sexist, or shills all look just as stupid.
