<p>The story is that Trump met with Kim Jung Un last November in the Secret City in China.  NK was being controlled by outside forces to threaten the West with nuclear war.  This was being done to terrorize people because people are easier to control if they are in fear.  Same thing with the Parkland false flag and the Las Vegas false flag.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s far less likely.</p>

<p>The obvious answer is usually correct.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s obvious -- because that answer has proved to be correct in past similar circumstances time and again.    If you come home and see your garbage can spread across the floor, and your dog is there looking guilty with coffee grounds on his nose, he <em>probably</em> wasn&#39;t framed by the cat.</p>

<p>Of course, the obvious is answer is <em>sometimes</em> incorrect, which is why it&#39;s a mistake to just assume and adopt the obvious answer without question.</p>

<p>Having a philosophy that&#39;s says, &quot;The obvious answer is <em>sometimes</em> wrong, therefore we should question it and verify that it&#39;s correct&quot; is a prudent and intelligent way to approach the world.</p>

<p>But having a philosophy that says, &quot;The obvious answer is <em>usually</em> wrong, therefore I will assume it&#39;s incorrect and that something else is correct&quot; will just lead you to be wrong most of the time.</p>

<p>Sorry, that is incredibly suspicious. The truth is that you have no idea who did it, so don&#39;t pretend like you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, its simply false and illogical to just believe people who make careers out of lying to you. I think you&#39;re probably just naive, which is why you can&#39;t see that a false flag is more likely than Russia being behind it. It doesn&#39;t make sense for Russia to do it, anymore than it makes sense for Assad to gas his own people when the entire international community is watching and looking for a reason to come down on him.

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t get why you guys think this works? Obviously anybody with eyes and a functioning brain can see it&#39;s not true. If the point is only to degrade and disrupt it doesn&#39;t work either, if anything it goes the other way.</p>

<p>Think about it this way - with each of these posts, you are attaching anti-Russian sentiment to overt falsehoods and plopping them into the contested space. The net result is anyone who isn&#39;t already anti-Russian will find it harder to become anti-Russian in future, because to do so requires them to look past the endless tedious marketing shitposts like this one.</p>

<p>So why bother?</p>
