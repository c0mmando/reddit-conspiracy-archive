       Trump recently announced his plan for a possible "Space Force" at a speech to troops in California. The elite have realized that using the ground-based military to keep themselves richer is a dying plan, and thus are now refocusing their efforts on space. By focusing the public attention on space, they will introduce new "space force" taxes and the likes to benefit themselves continuously. I don't even know why I wrote this but the military-industrial complex pisses me off

       Shiny new objects had to be introduced. Bombs and drones are
       <em>
        so

       last year. Just think, once they start fighting these “space wars” how much money they will need. It’s really disgusting how much money goes into this shit.

       You can't militarise a science fiction fantasy land, which is all 'outer space' is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe me?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself, in all honesty, why you believe in 'outer space'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then remove the
       <em>
        appeals to authority

       I’m only talking about the appearance of the little lights we see in the night’s sky. Contemporary science is able to predict the motions of these lights by thinking of them as hot balls of gas and interpolating their mass by comparing them to other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       This same science has been able to predict weather on earth using different but related means including the movement of the earth around the sun and the variations on its axis of rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I’m wondering if your theory, as you say it is well developed, has its own formulae and equations and theories which has been able to predict natural phenomena with similar accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we disagree on what stars are, but that’s fine. Assume you’re right and they are whatever you say they are. What equations are you using to predict their behavior and what has your success rate been like?

       Yeah, and you can look at their predictions and see how they came to those conclusions. The thing is, modern science is much more precise with its predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey that doesn’t mean you’re wrong! Any chance you have anything to show here besides rhetorical questions? I was trying to not be a dick but at this point I’m starting to think you don’t actually have a competing theory and you’re just trying to poke holes in the leading theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where’s your theory? What does your math look like? What have you predicted and what do you predict?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can’t predict anything, then chances are you don’t have much of an idea how things really work, and your theory is a bit pointless.

       I doesn't, or I mean, he will give you a link explaining his theories but it is behind a $20+/mo paywall on his website...
      </p>
      <p>
       He won't give a straight answer here... he believes the earth is not flat or round, does not orbit the sun, space and vacuum are fake, so are stars, and so are planets, so is gravity, and atoms etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other things he thinks to be fake are dinosaurs, all of history, all wars, evolution etc...

       Its not worth debating him as you can see he just ask for evidence or "why" repeatedly like a 3 yearold while supplying none for his outlandish claims.

       People who consider flat Earth are hard to come by in this sub as of late. It's kind of sad that everyone here seems to think it's a psyop to distract us from the "real" conspiracies.

       In my opinion space is the real psyop and the end goal is to create a more submissive population by showing us how insignificant we are. A faint blue dot in the cosmos, what a depressing concept!

       Definitely what I was thinking.  I remember seeing articles concerning explosions in China that some likened to what would happen if a manufacturing facility was hit with a Rod of God.  Additionally, I recall mention somewhere that certain geologists couldn't identify if earthquakes in North Korea were natural or man made... from what I had read in the past, subterranean bomb tests have a certain profile, but perhaps what they saw was a kinetic impact.

       That's what it made me think. At the same time though, I don't know if I could see something along the lines of so called "alien invasions/attacks" happening, at least not anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is purely just my opinion, but I just don't think we're there yet and/or ready as a society. I mean, who knows how soon tptb/whoever is pulling the strings has anything planned to happen. I guess it makes more sense that they would ease the public into it. Basically using the ol' "frog in the slowly boiling water" thing that gets mentioned around here.

       There's probably people out there that are looking at this space force thing as an unnecessary fantasy, with trump just trying to sway some voters or something.

       Get ready for Blue Beam by then end of Trump's term. These "Starship Troopers" will need to save us from the evil aliens. An alien invasion could be a new 9/11 (of course the date will be an occult number), and could even help Trump get reelected. Of course, aside from fear, this all will be inssnely expensive for the taxpayer, and insanely profitable for the men behind the curtain.

       People who consider flat Earth are hard to come by in this sub as of late. It's kind of sad that everyone here seems to think it's a psyop to distract us from the "real" conspiracies.

       In my opinion space is the real psyop and the end goal is to create a more submissive population by showing us how insignificant we are. A faint blue dot in the cosmos, what a depressing concept!

       Yeah, and you can look at their predictions and see how they came to those conclusions. The thing is, modern science is much more precise with its predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey that doesn’t mean you’re wrong! Any chance you have anything to show here besides rhetorical questions? I was trying to not be a dick but at this point I’m starting to think you don’t actually have a competing theory and you’re just trying to poke holes in the leading theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where’s your theory? What does your math look like? What have you predicted and what do you predict?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can’t predict anything, then chances are you don’t have much of an idea how things really work, and your theory is a bit pointless.
