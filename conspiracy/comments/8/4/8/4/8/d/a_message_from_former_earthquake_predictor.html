       As some of you may know, sadly our resident earthquake prediction expert parsingsol deleted his account a few months back (due to IRL issues and such).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, as I enjoyed his posts, I kept up a correspondence with him and he has sent me the following prediction today. I'm not vouching for its reliability, simply sharing the information.

       I believe he got a few predictions correct, including one in the fall that had a high degree of accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I think a willingness to be wrong is a necessary consequence of a desire to learn and I wouldn't chastise someone for their attempts at fine tuning such a model.

       Oh I didn't mean yourself heh, there were a few users who used to take him to task on the issue and I think it eventually drove him away sadly. Apologies if my comment came off as insinuating you were doing the same.

       That said, I'll try to dig up the one from the fall that I recall being fairly accurate.

       You can’t learn without trial and error.

      <p>
       Also calling them bogus predictions when he spent a lot of time researching is disrespectful and dismissive of the extensive work he puts in.. keyboard warriors like you who put others down for experimenting or trying something new are one of the biggest problem these days. Yeah he might not be right every time but at least he’s persistent.

       A prediction is bogus if it's wrong because it's based on flawed thinking or flawed data.  No matter how much hard work someone puts into a bogus theory, that's wasted work, and the theory remains bogus.

       The specifics are my business, but, plenty.  I've gotten a lot accomplished in my life, both in the realms of science and in politics, and I'm still going.

      <p>
       My thought is that you wish
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       were doing more.  Almost always, when somebody something like you just did, it's because they are angry or disappointed with themself for that same reason.  In other words, you feel that you are a keyboard warrior who has contributed nothing to the world.

       The general idea was, that the minuscule effect of the solar winds on Earth's magnetic field sums up to measurable influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wind's pressure is tiny.
       <br/>
       But Earth's magnetic field is huge...

       Yes, they do. And, funnily enough, he consistently gives a large time frame for the quakes to fall within. Also, get this, the countries he typically chooses are all very earthquake prone. Nepal, Japan, and Italy have had 116 earthquakes in the past 365 days according to
       <a href="https://earthquaketrack.com/">
        this
       </a>
       website. That's 1 earthquake between those three countries every 3.14655 days. Obviously, odds are VERY high an earthquake happens in one of those countries within his 8 day guess (he frequently boasted about earthquakes that took place outside of his guessed timeframe as well). All he's "hoping" for is that the size of the earthquake is near his guess. Everything else he does is just playing good odds.

       No, champ. My point is that it was silly that people were super duper impressed that a guy would list  3+ earthquake prone areas and predict that an earthquake would happen there within two weeks. It’s a simple numbers game. Like, next year I predict 6 hurricanes will happen during hurricane season in the Atlantic. Wanna know why? Cause that’s about the average a year. Wanna know why I picked that location? Cause that’s where they happen. Crazy.

       Incorrect, he previous has come out and said his ability to predict where the earthquake will happen is the problem with his perditions. Magnitude has been consistent. His predictions are far from 100% accurate but every post of his I have followed were he has predicted a +7.0 magnitude quake has occurred but often not were he predicts. So I would just be prepared for the event regards where you are. Not overly useful prediction yet, but I do think he is on to something just does not have all of it worked out.

       Agreed earthquakes happen all the time. Earthquakes with magnitudes +7.0 significantly less common. I think the difference between us is that I recognize that our understanding in many topic is incomplete at best, so I keep an open mind to new theories and ideas but hey to each thier own.

       How does it take the imagination of a first grader to think solar activity can affect seismic activity? We have had a basic understanding of these concepts for less 100 years and you think we know how both of these complex systems interact without missing something?

       Maybe instead of trying to insult me for keeping an open mind, you can talk with people that would agree with you and the current accepted understanding in r/science. This is r/conspiracy where we like to talk about things that are on the fringe.

       As someone who has an engineering degree in geoscience, predicting earthquakes is always complicated. It's not something you can have 100% accuracy at. I used to feel bad when he used to get flak for not being accurate from various posters.
