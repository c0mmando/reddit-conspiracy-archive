        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like mysterious 777s follow Trump!</p>

<p>Look at these other interesting facts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump was born on June 14th 1946 10:54 AM the very hour a Blood Moon began. It was seen over the lands of Israel that very day. It was exactly 700 days before the creation of the state of Israel and 1000 days before Israel won their &quot;War for Independence&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The day of Trump&#39;s election was Prime Minister Netanyahu&#39;s 7th year, 7th month, and 7th day in office.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump was elected in the year 5777 in the Hebrew Calendar</p></li>
<li><p>7 days after Trump&#39;s election, the media reported the largest supermoon in 70 years</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is the 7th president from New York and won by 77 electoral votes thanks to 7 faithless electors</p></li>
<li><p>Neil Gorsuch (7) was sworn in by Supreme (7) Justice (7) Kennedy (7) &amp; Roberts (7)</p></li>
<li><p>On the day Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch, Gorsuch had written 777 judicial opinions</p></li>
<li><p>On 7/7/17 (July 7th 2017) Trump meets Vladimir Putin</p></li>
<li><p>Also, on the day Putin and Trump meet, interestingly enough Putin was exactly 777 months old</p></li>
<li><p>In Trump&#39;s 7th month in office, a total solar eclipse crosses the USA</p></li>
<li><p>Trump delivers his Joint Session of Congress speech during a Super Blue Blood Moon (a rare trifecta) when he was 71 years, 7 months, and 17 days old</p></li>
<li><p>Trump&#39;s NYC childhood home rented for $777 a night on Airbnb</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know that not all them are significant, some of them are trivial. But it&#39;s still quite astonishing. I&#39;m sure there are more that I&#39;ve missed. Please share any you know in the comments!</p>

<p>It&#39;s not meaningful because you&#39;re scanning a huge amount of data looking for the number 7 and moon events, but you aren&#39;t taking into account non-events. eg Nothing interesting happened on 7/7/2007 or 7/7/1977.</p>

<p>You lied in the first paragraph of your post to fit your narrative, or you fail at basic math, pick one. Either way it&#39;s 6 days, not 7, or it&#39;s 220 which doesn&#39;t relate to 7. You&#39;re a mentally ill fuckwit.</p>

I think it&#39;s personally hilarious that certain folks think God chose Trump to be president. A skeezy billionaire who&#39;s cheated on all his wives, most recently with a porn star, and is known for being a massive dick to people. He has nothing in common with Jesus or anything he stood for.

    <div class="md"><p>I assume you never read a Bible then. Most men God has chosen has committed similar to Trump. Trump takes the worse of us and makes them into great men. If you think for one second God couldn&#39;t chose Trump then you don&#39;t know a single thing about the Bible.</p>

<p>The Bible also plainly states God brings up leaders and also makes them fall according to his will in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up Christian. I used to lead worship at my church when I was younger. If you think Trump is a godly man in any way then you have been significantly fooled. He doesn&#39;t give a fuck about Jesus or anything he stood for. He plays to the crowd because he knows Christians eat that shit up. He doesn&#39;t pray or read the bible. He fucks porn stars and plenty of poor people on the way to the top. My family is still very Christian and they are absolutely disgusted by his character. If you were a real Christian, you would be too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also grew up Christian as well, but considering the difference in type of language we chose. I don&#39;t think you personally have the power or right to judge another man. </p>

<p>As Jesus said to not judge others. For it is not our place to judge only he that sits at the right hand of God.</p>

<p>So, yes you could be right, but at the same time you could get a rude awakening and be very wrong. It is not you to decide what is Godly character or not. The Bible warns during the earn time people will become prideful, selfish and desire nothing but personal greed and will avoid that which can make them Godly. </p>

<p>So to say if I &quot;were a real Christian&quot; I would be to, but well to be frank. I don&#39;t want to be the Christian you want me to be. I want to be a Christian like Jesus wants me to be and that isn&#39;t to be judgmental. You can chose to continue to judge Trump, but realize you will be judge equally so to how you judged Trump as Jesus said you will be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m clearly not Christian anymore. But my family is and I know what a real Christian looks like. I&#39;m not beholden to some book and I&#39;ll judge him if I want. He&#39;s a huge piece of shit and hes kind of famous for being one. The reason this porn star scandal isn&#39;t even a big deal is because people already know he&#39;s a shitty person who cheated on all of his wives, so it&#39;s not surprising he was banging porn stars. </p>

<p>Jesus was about helping the poor and including those shunned by society. Trump stands for the exact opposite ideas. I&#39;m sure Jesus loves Trump just like he would anyone else. But I don&#39;t think Trump gives a shit about Jesus and he certainly doesn&#39;t have a personal back and forth relationship with him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is your opinion, but like Jesus said to not judge others or you will be judged.</p>

<p>You do not live with Trump you only know what MSM and others have shown you, but you do not personally and more so truly know the man in person. So it is only that an opinion bases on what you have heard.</p>
