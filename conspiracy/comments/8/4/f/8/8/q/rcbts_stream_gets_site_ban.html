<p>Edit: Inciting Violence is the reason given according to former mods.</p>

<p>Less than a month ago though, some of these very mods were trying to get their users to abamdon Reddit and go to Voat, was this their play or was this more Reddit censorship. You decide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone crossposted something from there literally two days ago. I clicked it, wondered what it was about, and read the FAQ. I quoted part of it to someone because it was funny, so it&#39;s still saved in my post history:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Behind the scenes, a titanic battle of good versus evil is taking place. On the good side, the President of the United States, the NSA and his loyal armed forces. On the evil side, the elites who rule over us and their friends. Q says 80% of this battle will never see the light of day but it is happening, it&#39;s very real and the ramifications will one day extend to the entire planet.</p>

<p>Why? There&#39;s no easy way to build up to this so I will just go ahead and say it: the vast majority of the elites are Satan worshippers who sacrifice children to the **ancient god Moloch. They run the global child trafficking networks to supply themselves with vulnerable children to murder, rape, and harvest for organs and blood to keep them young. Their hundred year plan which kicked off in the middle of WWI was meant to completely subjugate the West both through immigration and through cultural subversion. Bits and pieces of the full picture are documented in many places but it&#39;s very hard to study in detail because the subject matter is repulsive and because it attracts a lot of distraction. It is quite likely although not yet confirmed that Hollywood and most of Washington D.C. are full of pedophiles. If you find this completely unbelievable, then ask yourself this: how many Hollywood personalities and media executives have resigned in just the last month because of accusations of sexual impropriety? Has PizzaGate really been debunked? Are there a hundred and one coded references to cult behaviour in the leaked emails of Hillary Clinton, John Podesta and his brother Tony? What do these people like to do on a Friday night with their friends from Hollywood?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah, weird quasi-cult that believed in a final showdown between the ancient deity Moloch and Donald Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never saw that. I never saw any incitement to violence. CBTS stands for Calm Before the Storm, which is a phrase Trump used. CBST mostly followed the Q posts and did related research. They pointed to very strong evidence of certain elites engaging in pedophilia and/or satanism, including the elites&#39; use of related symbols, pictures, comments, artwork, bizarre connections, historical pedophile scandals, the elites&#39; close ties to known pedophiles or satanists, and the testimony of their alleged victims. They believed Trump and his administration were on top of things behind the scenes, and seemed perfectly content to leave justice up to them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sounds fair and civil.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sounds fair and civil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that Nov 11th is an important date to watch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds fair and civil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a photograph of L Rothschild in front of a moloch-painting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds fair and civil. The image seems to have been publicly available and was only shared because of public concern. I&#39;ve seen video testimonies from children raped and killed by the elites. L Rothschild hosted the ex-boyfriend of the man who is central to pizzag ate, so they know each other to some degree. Moloch is a classic god that is known for giving power if children are sacrificed. If L Rothschild has a huge painting of that god in her house, that&#39;s a cause for public concern. Check out the judicial concept &quot;necessity defense&quot;: <a href="https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/necessity/">https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/necessity/</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;The defendant must reasonably have believed that there was an actual and specific threat that required immediate action</em></p>

<p><em>The defendant must have had no realistic alternative to completing the criminal act</em></p>

<p><em>The harm caused by the criminal act must not be greater than the harm avoided</em></p>

<p><em>The defendant did not himself contribute to or cause the threat&quot;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>recent focus on Merkel as a descendant of Adolf Hitler</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, public concern could possibly justify exposure of Merkel&#39;s past. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize what a senseless and fallacious counter point this is right? Your incredulity can go both ways. The sub is dead. Clearly I have no solid examples for you. Do you see the many other users echoing largely my same laments of the sub? Excited for an unsensored themed sub, disappointment months later as it turned out to be a secret racism waking haven. Just popping in to reply to your ass I see at least 3 others.</p>

<p>That point being made I&#39;ll take the bait. A common l, common example that anyone who browsed the sub (who wouldn&#39;t be asking your questions in the first place) can vouch for would be minorities in Europe with the influx of refugees. Many posts were of some migrant fucking up, non white of course, and of all the many commenters, ones riding the most upvotes would often be of a flavor of &quot;the guards should do the world a favor and hang (slur) in his cell&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like sure, this happened, that minority raped somebody or what have you. How many white people getting arrested for the same in this &quot;unsensored&quot; sub were posted about? Just about 0. The couple I remember, the people were usually on his side in some convoluted reasoning or another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The uncensored news removal is interesting. That sub was created as a result of censoring discussion around the Snowdan information on domestic spying.

    <div class="md"><p>Moderating a sub requires significant time and effort that is difficult to provide on a volunteer basis. If your small community grows rapidly, you quickly need more mods to handle the load. With inviting in additional mods come its own headaches as new mods is the primary avenue used to take over subs and grab power within a community. There is a whole host of strategies for agitation that can be deployed once on the inside. Don&#39;t really see fault in moderators given the thankless dirty job volunteer moderating entails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose me saying that I saw it myself when I was subscribed there for like the first month of the sub isn&#39;t going to be good enough? They would regularly say this when users called out the racist content in the sub. They didn&#39;t even try to hide it, and I have a feeling if they were here now they wouldn&#39;t deny it either. I don&#39;t have any screenshots from that long ago, and the subreddit and the moderators&#39; accounts have all been removed. You can still use SnoopSnoo to get some basic history from all of the mods though. One of them had his top three subreddits as uncensorednews, europeannationalism, and DylannRoofinnocent. One of his top used words was &quot;white&quot;. Another had &quot;jew&quot; as his top word. I know, that&#39;s not hard proof of anything, but that&#39;s the best I can scrape up this quickly. I can keep digging a bit later and see what else I can find if you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.</p>

<p>About 3/4 of CBTS_Stream came in as troll accounts trying to slide and disrupt discussion. The campaign to disrupt has followed the topic across multiple platforms.</p>

<p>Effort frequently includes taking a line of discussion being researched and delved into, then attributing big foot, UFOs, some wild conspiracy direction. Attaching a line of reasoning easy to dismiss and distracting from the actual topic of research.</p>

<p>On the 4chan side the ongoing campaign to shut down conversation included mass posting of gore filling up topics to make it more difficult to coordinate. Eventually the platform had security issues that lead to moving elsewhere.</p>

<p>Given the opposition this sub has faced on every platform its landed I suspect inciting violence content was most likely seeded by the very same people trying to shut down communication on the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve found some magic words (&quot;inciting violence&quot;) that they can use to ban groups without stirring up outrage. They don&#39;t know or care what the words mean; they just know that people find their actions justified when they say them. Magic words like that only work a few times before people realize they are just that. A year or two ago the magic words were &quot;publishing personal information.&quot; A month or two ago they were &quot;involuntary pornography.&quot;</p>

<p>When they banned the uncensored news subreddit, they used the same excuse, and there was a swarm of people defending the act and foaming at the mouth to demand censorship of stuff they found offensive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>18 U.S. Code § 2385 - ADVOCATING OVERTHROW OF GOVERNMENT
Just what does that mean?</p>

<p>REDDIT has knowingly and willfully advocated, abetted, advised and taught the duty, necessity, desireability and propriety of undermining the basic unit of social order in our nation: self-governance made possible by a civilized people who have set aside weapons and instead use words to sort out and resolve differences.</p>

<p>By dissolving the CBTS Subreddit (Calm Before The Storm), representing a vital political sunbdivision of these United States, banning its users and destroying the intellectual property produced by them, the REDDIT moderators launched an assault on every aspect of the First Amendment:  an ACT prohibiting protected speech, an ACT denying freedom of assembly, an ACT impeding the formation of closely held beliefs and the free exercise thereof.  As CBTS served as a self-published news service followed by thousands, providing information, interactive analysis and participant commentary that was read, digested and debated vigorously, it deserves every protection offered to the traditional free press, this ACT also violated that guarantee.</p>

<p>This ACT is more than the mere dispersion of a dissonant group of intellectuals.  It is encouraging others to advocate for censorship and other ways to gag free speach, assembly and public expression of opposing views; sometime resorting to intimidation and violence to that end.</p>

<p>This ACT is an attack on the fundamentals of governance enshrined in the United States Constitution and, left to run its course, will pose as serious threat to the stability and continuance of our form of government.  In effect, Reddit&#39;s ACT today is advocating the eventual overthrow of our Government.  [18 USC § 2385]</p>
