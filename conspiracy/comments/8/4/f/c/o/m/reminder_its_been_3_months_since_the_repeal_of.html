<p>There&#39;s MOUNTAINS more evidence of tech giant abuse compared to ISPs and it&#39;s not even comparable. You know why literally everyone is talking about tech giant abuse not ISP abuse? BECAUSE IT&#39;S TECH GIANTS, AND NOT ISPS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here is the problem. There is no reason you have to use google, or facebook, or twitter, or reddit. These are private companies you do not have to use. There are alternatives to almost all of them, between duck duck go, or vimeo, or voat. But, unlike those websites, many people only have access to a single internet provider, so therefore if that internet provider restricts access, you have no choice in changing your internet service. Twitter, google, all of these are private enterprises that can do as they wish, and that is specifically because they have competition in their businesses. If you hate them so much, use other platforms</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not totally true. </p>

<p>Just like with Reddit and YouTube  having very poor alternatives there are other options even in a single ISP city. </p>

<p>You could get a satellite internet connection. Or a cell phone only option. Sometimes 3rd party wholesale on the same ISP lines. </p>

<p>But just like with Reddit/YouTube the only real option is keep using it or bail and get a worse experience for more money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>but that is how internet platforms grow! I see so many people talking about youtube and its effect on conservative voices being silenced. If right now, the major conservative voices all moved to vimeo or dailymotion, sure it will be rough going for a bit, but you build from there. It is the same way you saw facebook develop away from myspace. If you take your content from youtube where you have followers and move to another platform, followers will follow. </p>

<p>If I want internet over ~6 mb/s (definitely not a perfect number, I dont know exactly what unlimited 4g from verizon wireless will get me), I probably have one provider. and trust me, I would love 3rd party wholesale. But even in a large town like mine, its one service provider and thats all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. </p>

<p>But if YouTube or Twitter were a private company still, they would be bankrupt and gone. </p>

<p>Instead they get propped up by Amazon/google.</p>

<p>But they also get to control what we see and hear. </p>

<p>And everyone seems to defend them doing any amount of censorship they want under the guise of &quot;private company can do as they like.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you don&#39;t understand is that ISP&#39;s and content providers are completely different. ISP businesses have incredibly high barriers to entry. Setting up broadband is insanely expensive and requires government subsidies and assistance, not to mention government complicity to run them through thousands of properties miles of road.</p>

<p>As a result, there is almost no competition at all in the ISP industry. Most Americans only have 1 or 2 options.</p>

<p>By contrast, internet content providers have extremely low barriers to entry. All you need is a domain and a coder to get started building what could someday compete with Google, Facebook, or Youtube. It&#39;s an actually-competitive market, <em>unlike</em> ISP&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t seem to understand the difference between an ISP and a content site. </p>

<p>Why regulate the ISPs? </p>

<p>You pay an ISP to access the internet.  Net Neutrality was to prevent the people who sell &quot;access,&quot; to the internet not 
use fees and political and economic beliefs to </p>

<p>block you from accessing all the internet and at all the same speed.</p>

<p>Some ISPs, notably Comcast and ATT want to block sites they disagree with.  </p>

<p>Some ISPs, notably all the cable and telecomms, want to charge you much more for video content access and only offer slow downloads unless a you pay a much higher fee. </p>

<p>You, on your own can boycott, facebook, twitter, google, youtube.<br/>
I don&#39;t use any of those sites except youtube and that only now and then. </p>

<p>But the choice is yours to make, use those sites or not.  </p>

<p>One of the main reasons for Net Neutrality is to not allow your ISP to block  you from visiting sites they don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>No. Net Neutrality is about preventing ISPs from influencing content. Beyond that, it does not influence internet in any way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comcast isn&#39;t going to block Breitbart. </p>

<p>Remember how stores suddenly decided to stop selling Confederate flags in protest? Do you really believe ISPs wouldn&#39;t do something similar to certain websites? If not outright blocking them, then at least slowing them down?</p>

<p>The government CAN&#39;T. Not with Net Neutrality laws, at least. Net Neutrality does not give  the government the power to block sites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Order will not go into effect until after the Office of Management and Budget completes its Paperwork Reduction Act review, which could take several months. However, last Thursday’s publication is significant because it triggers deadlines for challenges to the Order, both in the courts and in Congress.</p>

<p>The Federal Register publication gives litigants ten days to file petitions for review in federal courts of appeals if they would like to be included in a court lottery to determine the venue for consolidating the Order’s challenges. The following petitions have already been filed:</p>

<ul>
<li>New York District Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced he and 22 other Democratic attorneys general filed a petition for review at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit;</li>
<li></li>
<li>Public Knowledge, Mozilla, Vimeo, National Hispanic Media Coalition, and New America’s Open Technology Institute each filed petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit;</li>
<li></li>
<li>The California Public Utilities Commission and Santa Clara County each filed appeals in the Ninth Circuit;</li>
</ul>

<p>Several other parties, including the Internet Association (representing Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, among others), INCOMPAS, the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA), and Free Press are expected to file petitions for review in the near term.</p>

<p>ISPs are literally not setup to operate in a manner that slows one address but not another. The only way to do that would to A rebuild the entire CO in every so glue wire center in the US or invent new modems and ONTs and then replace the existing ones in use. But first they would have to r&amp;d the software and hardware which is billions then it has to go through FCC approval to develop which is illegal so it would be denied but if it was legal it would then have to be approved  by committee to be used in the field and then each customer would need a new Modem/ONT at the cost of ridiculous billions. </p>

<p>The only viable option for a prorated/content throttled company to exist would be to exist in new markets and these guys are not going to affect service as a whole. For a group of folks on the internet, the internet as a whole has no fucking clue what and how the internet works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are still making the assumption that this technology is approved on FCC level (it is not, not even in Iowa the wild west of telecom) and that the ISPs will spend billions of dollars to screw the customer. What you are saying is yes possible but A) not legal B) Financially Retarded C) awful for suctomer service D) beyond reality of implementation with the rate of technology change E) would make -0×12° sense when bandwidth plans are already budgeted in advance thus curbing the customer would serve no purpose other than passing the customer off. ISP wouldn&#39;t save a dime.</p>

<p>So while it is possible that the gov is listening to your phone calls it highly unlikely bc its expensive and serves no purpose. In the same instance the actions of curbing bandwidth is possible but it is costly and serves no purpose and actually works counter to what ISP has been planning and developing with infrastructure and CO development</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I may be wrong and missing the point of how easy it would be to implement but I have direct knowledge that the repeal of Net neutrality will not change anything in operations as of yet. </p>

<p>There may be ways to do as you say and updAte software on user end to throttle and do it without anyone knowing until its done. I could be totally wrong but I promise I will keep updated on all the software changes that are coming out. I receive updates on all equipment and software changes upcoming for a large ISP regularly. And come to think of it there was and update recently to an Adtran fiber ONT. I only read the synopsis but the basics was it was getting larger. Which means they adding something.</p>

<p>But you have me thinking. If you have more info I can read up on I&#39;d love to expand my knowledge. I&#39;ve been doing telecom eng for a yr.5 now and only now understand the basics. </p>

<p>Another thing that most ppl don&#39;t realize or sometimes forget is that all telecom service is co sidered a public utility so standards are more directly run by state law where the federal government laws provide uniformity of service state laws more dictate application of service. As a public utility pricing is dictated to ISP by local and federal government and all products deployed must be certified by state and federal government. So it gets very murky on the plausibility of implementing a system that basically defrauds the customer of the service paid for... You paid for 1G but Netflix gets throttled to 20mb. That&#39;s already illegal. So that&#39;s not going to happen.</p>

<p>Because it hasn&#39;t been officially repealed..</p>

<p>Again... these are technologies at PoPs, not at the endpoint...  You really should read up on PoPs, peering agreements, core routing and switching infrastructure and on and on...</p>

<p>This is a loaded and incredibly misleading statement.  The conslusions you make based on this are plainly false.</p>

<p>For instance</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a public utility pricing is dictated to ISP by local and federal government and all products deployed must be certified by state and federal government</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s plainly false.  Further</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You paid for 1G but Netflix gets throttled to 20mb. That&#39;s already illegal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That too ignores the absolute reality of literally every consumer&#39;s experience in the US.</p>

<p>Blocking factors and contention are a reality of massive networks.  You&#39;re sounding more and more like you have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking about...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still pretty ironic that they heavily desire &quot;neutrality&quot;, but don&#39;t wish to offer it themselves. They desire &quot;neutral&quot;  data flow just so they can be accessed over the internet without slowdown or congestion, yet speech allowance and idea propagation is heavily tilted and manipulated in their favor.  They want beefed up &quot;neutral&quot; internet access to themselves, but that same &quot;neutrality&quot; or access isn&#39;t extended to others.</p>

<p>&quot;Neutrality&quot; is only demanded in domains where it&#39;s beneficial to them.  As far as their platforms are operated. Those utilizing their services, end up get shafted. For how Silicon Valley demands others be &quot;principled&quot;, they aren&#39;t very principled themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the 100% main takeaway that people seem to miss because they&#39;ve been tricked by the ISPs devolving this into a political argument. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll handicap your streaming video because it hurts their bottom line. They&#39;ll block your torrent sites because it hurts their bottom line. They&#39;ll alert the authorities if you&#39;re watching sitcom r324 without watching their commercials because they&#39;re not getting their shekels. They&#39;ll block your preferred porn site because their new CEO has a financial interest in another one or he&#39;s against porn to further his political career.</p>

<p>I prefer my multinational corporate ISP to not know or give a fuck what I&#39;m doing. Just keep the bits moving. You&#39;re already making a 200% profit on me, fuck you.

    <div class="md"><p>I never said &quot;just Comcast&quot;.  And that&#39;s the misunderstanding.  Many of these companies have non-competition agreements.  This means that if Comcast is regionally available, then both Comcast and Cox agree that there is less investment cost needed if Cox doesn&#39;t set up there.  Comcast respects the same logic if Cox set up first.  Just because there are multiple companies doesn&#39;t mean that there is competition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny because you accused me of basing my post off false information while literally basing your post off false information.</p>

<p>Please give me a source regarding this &quot;hundreds of billions&quot; of dollars - the only source I can find is apparently from some guy&#39;s book where calculates this number out of thin air. </p>

<p>And then I actually found this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709556">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709556</a> where the guy actually read the book and found:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, it was not $200 billion in tax breaks. That&#39;s 100% wrong.
There&#39;s actually a book about this, which is online: <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/comments/61BF">http://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/comments/61BF</a>.... Read page 210-223, especially page 222.</p>

<p>The number is calculated by starting from the premise that telecom companies should be regulated as utilities, and make regulated returns on their investment. It also starts from the premise that the price of features should be proportional to their cost.</p>

<p>From that premise, it computes $103 billion as the &quot;excess profits&quot; when the telcos are compared to other utilities. Another $78 billion is chalked up to &quot;excessive depreciation.&quot; This, in turn, is based on a calculation rooted in &quot;[a]ssuming that depreciation rates should have remained constant after divestiture.&quot; (Page 220). Of course the assumption that the depreciation rate should have remained constant before and after the internet boom is ridiculous. Another $25-50 billion is &quot;cross-subsidization overcharging for long distance, DSL, and wireless.&quot; This estimate is based on the claim that the telcos added charges to phone bills that should have been accounted as costs to non-regulated services.</p>

<p>None of this amounts to getting a direct subsidy or even a direct tax break in return for building fiber. The whole point of the 1996 changes in the law was deregulation of the industry. The whole idea was that deregulation of the industry would lead to higher capital investment, which it did (just not in the areas people expected at the time). Nobody hid the ball on the fact that the 1996 law was about deregulation--everyone referred to it as such. Well, in a deregulated industry, if a company raises prices, we don&#39;t call that &quot;excess profits.&quot; If they cross-subsidize their business lines, we don&#39;t call that &quot;excess profits.&quot;</p>

<p>Did the telcos make a ton of money between 1996-present? Yes, they did. Demand for internet exploded, and demand for mobile exploded, and they invested the money to build the infrastructure that made all that possible. That&#39;s why they made all those &quot;excess profits.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And no, you obviously don&#39;t dislike them both equally or else you wouldn&#39;t have replied so aggressively nor would you have focused solely on ISPs, would you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What you just said&quot;</p>

<p>It is one of the most important arguments made in favor of net neutrality and isn&#39;t just some personal quip. Stripping the title II protections and declassifying ISP&#39;s as public utilities gives telecoms broad discretion in how they prioritize traffic. This unilaterally gives large content-providers (e.g. youtube) a significant competitive advantage as they have the capital and brand recognition to institute preferential treatment from telecoms. </p>

<p>Again, demonizing Youtube whilst simultaneously favoring the repeal of net neutrality makes absolutely no fucking sense. </p>

<p>Despite the disinformation your T_D cult slobbered down from Ajit Pai, the rules that were established in 2015 (and just recently repealed) are easy to read. <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf">https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf</a></p>

<p>is completely false. Obviously, they did have some power over ISPs since they compelled them to comply with net neutrality measures before the 2015 court decision.

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there a presumed right for an ISP to favour one set of bits over another set of bits?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact of the matter is that data is a good. It deserves to be regulated exactly as goods are and that means ISPs should have the ability to tax on data usage. Also, you should know before you go any further that the removal of Net Neutrality will actually <em>decrease</em> your internet payment in the future. Treating data as a commodity allows ISPs to actually succeed and not stagnate in the market due to trying to catch up with ever-increasing data consumption rates. Companies like Netflix were getting away with streaming an exorbitant amount of data for a cheap cost to consumers, which did not allow ISPs to increase in size and create new infrastructure. This barrier for ISPs has now been lifted, allowing them to actually increase their revenue and fund more cost-efficient internet. Netflix won&#39;t increase their monthly payment because of consumer retaliation affecting their revenue, and ISPs won&#39;t make outstandingly unfair data &#39;deals&#39; because of the same thing: customer retaliation. The market regulates itself, we do NOT need the FCC except for intervention due to excessive monopoly and due to fraud or manipulation. They do not have a place regulating the price of the internet and data. Now that the barrier for ISPs has been lifted, there is only another. ISPs are charged exorbitant prices from the <em>government</em> to lay lines in the ground. They must use the government price which is really limiting ISPs. Subsidize this program for ISPs or privatize the ground-line industry and ISPs will soon have extremely cheap rates.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;d be fine for them to charge me more for using power for my Maytag washer instead of a Whirlpool washer?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it would not be fine. Legally, it would, but the same is the case in the market. If I tried to charge you more for using a certain washer, you would probably call me an asshole and you would switch washers. That is how the market works. Consumer demand literally has the ability to regulate the market itself. Allowing ISPs to break through the financial barrier would increase the number of ISPs available to consumers(some may even offer a Net-Neutral service, which would in effect probably gain a LOT of support and a LOT of revenue). It would also drastically reduce internet prices, and increase the range that internet is offered in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Steel tariffs which is a strategic important move to re-vitalize the US steel industry, censorship is a move to prepare for war.  Dissenting voices need to be squelched so that war can be fought.</p>

<p>I estimate war is probably at least 6 months to a year out.  It&#39;s going to take time to wear people out and get everyone used to the new censorship.</p>

<p>Why war?  Well, A) the dollar is being dumped and hyper inflation is about to hit. B) Trump and the current administration is facing lots of resistance (to rooting out corruption?  who knows?).  C) America is divided and war is usually a way to unite a country (if they can control the internet and curtail free speech).  (Trump has hinted that a serious event may be required to unite the country.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Up until 2015 Net Neutrality was complete horseshit. They lost every time they were sued, and it was only in 2015 when they sneakily reclassified the internet as a broadband telecommunications service.  From 2005-2010, the FCC literally had a set of rules on their website that were &quot;advised&quot; to be followed. The Open Internet Order of 2010 fixed that partially, but still service providers were angry at the manipulation of their rights by the FCC. Even after 2015 the rules were very shakily enforced. </p>
