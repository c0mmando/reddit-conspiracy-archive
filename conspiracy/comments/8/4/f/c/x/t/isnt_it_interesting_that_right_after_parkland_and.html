<p>A) Such stories are now topically relevant, so are making national news now</p>

<p>B) After the suggestion was made some teachers decided it was a good idea and started bringing their guns to school, resulting in more accidents involving guns where there hadn&#39;t previously been guns to have accidents with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outside of a gun fight where stress kicks in, or loading/unloading the gun, negligent discharges by people trained to properly handle a gun are exceedingly rare. They train you that guns are not taken out of their holster unless someone is trying to kill you, and guns don&#39;t just go off in their holsters. That means the only time you could have a negligent discharge is when they are loading or unloading the gun, which would not occur inside a school.</p>

It makes a lot of sense if you think about it. If you know every house that you are gonna rob has an owner that owns a gun and may be home you will think pretty hard in many situations whether or not you really want to rob them. If you know they don&#39;t have a gun and they aren&#39;t physically fit person then what is gonna stop you? Other than not being a shit bag that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern socialists still follow a lot of the communist playbook.  Most at this point know that seizing the means of production by the state would be disastrous, so they find with other more subtly destructive policies like public education, welfare, government healthcare, excessive regulations and government retirement plans for all.  They settle for seizing the profits of production and redistributing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great comment. America&#39;s unique gun culture is underplayed as part of why gun violence in the US is so much worse than other countries with similar ownership rates. Also why I doubt the pissant* gun control measures that are proposed would make much difference.</p>

<p>The fact that more guns is presented as a realistic answer to gun violence says a lot.</p>

<p>*not to say that I want the type of gun control laws that would actually make a difference. Just that you would need to seriously diminish the second amendment with shit like gun confiscations before it would do anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That quote is at least half bullshit. Japan was occupied post ww2 by America and as such we didn&#39;t want their society to be able to put up a revolt against us. They didn&#39;t even really have a military force for a long time. Yakuza did have firearms though and that&#39;s one of the reasons they were able to put such a stranglehold on large segments of the society. There was Samurai code which has been played up in movies fro a long time. Yeah, samurai code, be honorable to your master. Ninja and Ronin glorification didn&#39;t really take hold until the 80&#39;s, go figure. We can go back and forth all day dropping sources, Occam&#39;s razor favors what I&#39;m saying. Hopefully somebody with more knowledge steps in, otherwise correct me where I&#39;m wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the image of &quot;machismo, bellicosity, and swagger &quot; is mostly selection bias. We never hear news stories or anecdotal accounts about responsible owners. Movies and pop culture never show us a gun owner that owns their weapons for 80 years without incident, and resolves their problems without weapons. </p>

<p>I believe the vast majority of &quot;average Americans&quot; that own guns are safe and responsible.  From memory,  there are approximately 100 Million gun owners. If the &quot;average&quot; owner wasn&#39;t a safe, responsible owner, there would be more than 50 Million unsafe gun owners, showing off their weapons and swaggering around armed. In that situation I suspect the number of accidental shootings would be orders of magnitude higher than it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>‘schools can’t even afford teachers though’</p>

<p>I don’t often call people out, however for you I will make an exception.  I don’t think you have any idea of what you are talking about here.</p>

<p>School teacher salaries come from the taxes a city or town levies upon its residents who own real estate.  The schools, in coordination with their teachers unions, present a budget of operations to the city school board, based on teachers salaries and the remaining school operations costs. (Federal school funding is also factored in, but for our purposes, we will not include that for simplicity sake). The school board reviews and/or approves and then sends to the City for approval by the Taxpayers. </p>

<p>After all of that, when you look at comparative salary packages comparing public school teachers to other professions in the U.S., Teachers are paid reasonable salaries. (when you factor in that teachers do not work year round, then teachers are paid exceptionally well).</p>

<p>They train you that guns are not taken out of their holster unless someone is trying to kill you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly.  You take your gun out of your holster when there is a distinct possibilty you may have to use it instantly.</p>

<p>For example, see all the YouTube videos of cops pointing guns at imbiciles in cars going &quot;GET OUT OF THE CAR!  GET OUT OF THE CAR!  GET OUT OF THE CAR!&quot;</p>

<p>Most of the time, the dude in the car is not, at that moment, &quot;trying to kill them&quot;.   </p>

<p>That may sound like nit picking, but I don&#39;t think it is.  </p>

<p>Another example would be, if someone is preparing to enter a home where the door has been kicked in.  Anyone with any kind of training entering that house will have his gun drawn, even though nobody at that moment is trying to kill them.  </p>

<p>I explained this. Negligent discharges do happen, but they happen in places like police locker rooms or inside homes where people are cleaning or messing around with their guns. They don&#39;t happen with trained police or permit holders who have holstered guns. And if you unholstered your gun in a school and someone wasn&#39;t trying to kill you, you fucked up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In America’s endless debate about gun rights versus public safety, there should be no disputing the hard facts in a new report on gunshot fatalities showing that at least 722 nonself-defense deaths since 2007 were attributable to individuals with legal permits to carry concealed weapons. &quot;</p>

<p>That means they&#39;re including every single suicide and shooting accident of any permit holder.</p>

<p>&quot;But a methodical gleaning of eight years of news accounts by the Violence Policy Center, a gun safety group, found that in research involving 722 deaths in 544 concealed-carry shootings in 36 states and the District of Columbia, only 16 cases were eventually ruled lawful self-defense — even though this has been a major gun rights selling point for the new laws.&quot;</p>

<p>They&#39;re probably taking only the 16 cases where the shooting went to a jury, which almost always means they hit/killed the bad guy. In almost all defensive encounters, the mere drawing of a gun causes the bad guy to go away. A tiny percentage of the time shots are fired, and even fewer times is the bad guy hit/killed. </p>

<p>Scholars that do credible research, not this obvious nonsense have concluded that defensive gun use is probably over a million times a year, and dissuades far more crime than police. Which is why the states with the worst gun laws also have the worst crime.</p>

<p>Did you even read this article? Because it&#39;s patent nonsense that is blatantly cherry-picking data. I&#39;m having trouble even assuming good faith when you cite garbage like this.</p>

<p>I don’t want people to lose their rifles but a simple license that does a basic psych evaluation, requires a gun safety class, and a background check is a pretty solid compromise.

It’s obvious certain people shouldn’t have guns and licenses doesn’t preclude anyone of sound mind and judgement from having a gun. Honestly it will help end the debate and can actually create more freedoms for responsible gun owners - no wait period, no need for additional background checks, CCW, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of the top of my head, the most recent two stories I&#39;ve seen of accidental/negligent discharges in schools were a school resource officer (aka cop) and a teacher who was also a part time officer.</p>

<p>So it should be safe to assume both had significant firearms training.</p>

<p>Also most of the stories I can recall making it to major media in the past were also cops. I guess this is because until recently it was unusual to have armed teachers (and still is, in most places).</p>

<p>The &quot;arm the teachers&quot; proposals I&#39;ve seen seem to provide for a fairly basic firearms course in order for teachers to be certified to carry in school. Therefore it seems safe to assume that incidents like these will scale roughly linearly in relation to proportion of armed staff in schools.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll pretty certain if arming teachers becomes a widespread practice it won&#39;t be long until we see students killed accidentally by a teacher. And at some stage probably deliberately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such an important point. I have had some good discussions with some anti gun people on Twitter about this topic. When any same person hears the &quot;a gazillion school shootings alread this year!&quot; argument and then sees what they actually count you can recognize how disingenious it is. My favorite was a school where a stray round went through an office window. Nobody got hurt and no motive was ever found. It&#39;s not that that&#39;s a good thing to happen but to compare it to 17 dead kids is just incredibly dishonest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banning rifles wouldn&#39;t do a lick of good, and the way the FBI tracks rifles that includes both action, lever action, anything. They&#39;re only used in 2.4% of homicides. For reference, 5x as many people are stabbed to death and over 20x are shot with handguns. More people are beaten to death with bare hands and feet every year. From 2010 to 2015 they were used in an average of 298 homicides a year compared to over 6,000 with handguns.</p>

<p>Since this is a conspiracy sub I hope everyone would ask why the anti gun crowd is up in arms about the weapon that is the least likely by far to be used in a murder. Not only why that one but if they really, really think they&#39;re not going to wait a few months after any theoretical ban to realize they didn&#39;t actually change gun violence rates at all and start pushing for complete disarmament.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might be the worst analogy or example I&#39;ve heard from a pro gun person. 1st. You use an environment with absolute NO TOLERANCE to guns. There are less guns in prisons than in Amish country. So the number of inmates that get their hands on guns is astonishingly LOW. So you&#39;re actually making a point FOR stricter gun control. In fact, 99% of shootings inside prisons are by armed guards. Or by the inmates taking the guards guns and using them against them. More points for less guns in prisons. In America, when prison guards have guns the results is 1 shooting every 10 days on average. </p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, which houses the Unabomber, the shoe bomber and a Boston Marathon bomber among its nearly 200,000 inmates, has “always operated under the principle that firearms are not routinely carried within the institution,”.  None of them—including the large prison systems of Texas and Ohio—reported using guns for everyday inmate management. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve made a great point for more gun control and less guns. But you think that since less than 1% of inmates are able to make a shitty, unreliable &quot;gun-type&quot; weapon, that this supports your notion that engineered, manufactured guns should be allowed to flood society? This thinking is what&#39;s keeping killers armed. Think about it. </p>

<p>I have no problem believing we know most everything of value about Vegas.

    <div class="md"><p>It was an outlier but I&#39;m still of the position that the infamy the media gives to the shooter is led to blame than the availability of certain rifles or not. I personally feel that the 2A is too precious to compromise on because the potential downside to disarmament is worse than the alternative. The only real test to know if gun bans work is to examine the homicide rate of a society before and after, and after examining the results of the UK and Australian gun ban that&#39;s not a route I want to go down. </p>

<p>It&#39;s especially telling that they handed in about 662,000 weapons combined during their initial buybacks and we have at LEAST 300 million. I would wager we have closer to 400 million considering they don&#39;t track rifle parts and many people put their own together. </p>

Bump stocks are stupidly inaccurate at that range, even for a large crowd, to the point where former SOF guys have even said he could have killed more people just using a semi-auto. So why not automatic? Hell, they&#39;re legal to own if you can afford the 20k. They&#39;re just never used in crimes because they&#39;re owned by rich hobbyists.

<p>Why are you saying I’m wrong and then linking 2014 when I explicitly said 2016. See “Firearms (type unknown)” and unless you believe that most officers can’t distinguish what their own fucking weapon is, it’s likely a type of rifle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listed 2014 as an example of the different tables they provide. I had mentioned 2010 to 2015 and you 2016 so I didn&#39;t feel it was necessary to link every single year to show you. Here&#39;s the expanded data from navigating your own link.</p>

<p><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-4.xls">https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-4.xls</a></p>

<p>If you want to, there&#39;s other tables in there that expand upon this and even show how many of those homicides were ruled justified.</p>

<p>I have no idea what you meant talking about the officer distinguishing his own weapon. Do you think they don&#39;t have m16s in the trunk or are unfamiliar with different firearm types? Do you think they&#39;re the ones poking around and examining the bodies? I am not being a smartass fyi. I genuinely have no idea what you were implying. Unless you think officers are eyewitnesses to most murders or they&#39;re examining the bodies I don&#39;t see the relevance.</p>

<p>You said that &quot;Most homicides don&#39;t classify the gun used&quot; when they actually do have that data for 80% of them, which would mean for most they actually do classify it.</p>

<p>The truth doesn&#39;t seem very vague. When you have a known type of murder weapon for 80% of murders involving firearms and one type of weapon is only in 5% of the known types it&#39;s a pretty sure bet not much is going to change if you could determine the last 20%. Additionally, if you look at the table you linked where it&#39;s broken down by state it shows that half of the &quot;unknown firearm&quot; types come from California, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri and Indiana, home to some of our most dangerous cities because of gang violence. Considering most gang violence does not involve rifles I would wager that it won&#39;t change the ratio at all.</p>

<p>Since this is a conspiracy sub I hope everyone would ask why the anti gun crowd is up in arms about the weapon that is the least likely by far to be used in a murder.

</blockquote>

<p>Being no US american I can maybe answer the question: The USA is rather special as a) there is a strict believe that guns provide an equalizer and b) that an assault-weapon-derivate plattform like the Ar-15 gained such commercial success. </p>

<p>Within a conspiracy sub the second part might be just as important: The sales of AR-15 variants went from 61,000 in 2001 to 1,27 million in 2012 (<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-the-ar-15-became-mass-shooters-weapon-of-choice-w451452">https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-the-ar-15-became-mass-shooters-weapon-of-choice-w451452</a>). With that decade we also saw a rise of the truther/&quot;freemen&quot; movement as well as the rise of the tea party. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the rentless propaganda that &quot;they&quot; want to steal US americans &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;weapons&quot; by e.g. the NRA is driven mostly by the want to hike the gun sales or if they truly believe that a weapon designed for urban warfare is a neccessity within their political scopes but by now we have a lot of AR-15s out in the open and a truly divided society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Freeman movement is just a bunch of weirdos. I haven&#39;t seen anything to associate them with firearms more than any other group.</p>

<p>I think that not being an American you don&#39;t relate to how those of us in rural areas grew up around guns. They&#39;re literally everywhere. Every old man has a gun case and they hand them down to their kids. You start teaching them early and instill a healthy respect for it. As such, rural areas in the USA homicide rates are comparable to the European rates anti gun people want to emulate. </p>

<p>I used to grab my dad&#39;s 22 rifle at 10 years old and go off by myself to hunt prairie dogs. You could do it on anyone&#39;s land and they&#39;d be thankful because they&#39;re a nuisance. The holes they make tend to break livestock&#39;s legs.</p>

<p>One misunderstanding is that a rifle like the AR15 is designed only for urban warfare, like you say. This is just untrue. Many hunting rifles are the same exact same in function. Any semiautomatic is the same thing, whereby the gun pulls the next round into the chamber for you after it elects the spent casing. In fact, many states won&#39;t let you hunt with an ar15 because the round isn&#39;t deadly enough and will just wound a deer and make it suffer. The only difference between an ar15 and a wood stock rifle like this one (<a href="https://www.durysguns.com/shop/remington-7400-30-06-sprg-used-gun-inv-199208">https://www.durysguns.com/shop/remington-7400-30-06-sprg-used-gun-inv-199208</a>) is that the wooden one is waaayyyy more deadly but most people will look at it and go, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s just fine.&quot; It shoots just as quickly, as accurately but has a larger round. But the ar15 gets a bad rap because it is made of polymer and is made to be modular so you can put stuff onto it. It&#39;s used a lot because it&#39;s popular, that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s popular is because it&#39;s very customizable (like different butt stocks for different size people), you can switch parts in and out of different manufacturers to slowly upgrade, it ranges from cheap to super expensive so there&#39;s one for every budget, and it&#39;s super easy to maintain. The thing is people look at it like because there&#39;s tons of ar15s that it&#39;s one gun. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s less like comparing a Ford to a Volkswagen and more like if every car company could make it&#39;s own Charger with swappable parts. Toyota might make a cheaper Charger while Ferrari makes an expensive one but if they both get into a crash it was two Chargers that crashed.</p>

<p>The mistake people make is assuming that most gun owners want to use the gun outside of hunting or target shooting. Do you want to have to, say, pick up a knife and stab someone to save someone else&#39;s life? No, because most normal people don&#39;t want to do with that. I don&#39;t want to have to do that with my gun either. I had to when I was a kid. Luckily I didn&#39;t have to fire, I just chambered a round and yelled at the person breaking in that I have a gun and they left, but I can assure you, in that moment that gun weighs 10,000 lbs. </p>

<p>They&#39;re only seen as a &quot;thing&quot; by the left largely. In smaller towns and rural areas nearly everybody owns a gun or two and it&#39;s not even a thing. We also don&#39;t have the rampant crime problems they do in the cities with gang violence despite owning the majority of long guns. </p>

<p>The NRA gets a bad rap. It wouldn&#39;t be around if it wasn&#39;t for the donations that come from mostly blue collar Americans who feel it&#39;s important to hold on to our constitutional values. It still doesn&#39;t crack the top 150 lobbyists list because most people just take it for granted. Hence, gaining 500,000 new members when people realized how rabid the left is for taking them away. The right to bear arms was important enough our Founding Fathers made sure it was the second right recognized by the Constitution and all of their personal writings and letters from the time indicate it&#39;s intent was to ensure the populace was armed enough to only be governed with consent. They had just overthrown a government they didn&#39;t consent to and thought it important we maintain the same option in order to preserve our other rights. With countries like Sweden and the UK becoming increasingly Orwellian we feel the need to ensure we don&#39;t go down the same path.</p>

<p>Tldr; The ar15 is a meme, we were founded by gun owners who fought off a government and wanted us to be able to do the same, and with the way the rest of the world is Americans aren&#39;t keen on giving up our ability to go the same route.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not intending to be. For military purposes the Ar15 is obviously a superior choice. If you wanted to slaughter a bunch of people in a crowded situation it arguably has no advantage, though. Although it&#39;s close, the 30-06 would kill more of the people it hits then a 5.56, hence 5.56 not being allowed for hunting in some states and the much larger number of wounded than dead during mass shootings with 5.56. The AR15 military advantage comes from the ability to carry much larger amounts of ammo as well as a wounded enemy being more valuable than a dead one, in that it takes away even more enemies from the fight to help him.</p>

<p>The 5.56 is easier to shoot over long distances for shooters that haven&#39;t learned to account for the 30-06s trajectory but most of these occur at such close distances that becomes a nonfactor. Likewise for magazine capacity. 10 to 30 rounds doesn&#39;t matter much when it takes less than 3 seconds to eject and load a new magazine.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to make the case that an ar15 is an ineffective weapon. I&#39;m trying to point out that any perceived advantage it has for a mass shooting is actually inconsequential. Like I&#39;ve touched on before, the VT shooter used a .22 Walther PPK and a 9mm Glock and killed twice as many people as Cruz. When you&#39;re in a close, crowded situation, which every one of these but Vegas has been, the fact is any firearm is deadly enough even in the hands of a low skilled to kill a lot of people very quickly if they&#39;re unarmed. </p>

<p>So you ask why I would be upset if I had to give up my AR15? Would you not be upset if something you enjoyed having was taken away for reasons that you know are demonstrably wrong by a bunch of people who are riding what you view as a wave of hysteria and all the while trying to frame you as the nut? That wouldn&#39;t piss you off? That a bunch of people who have mostly never even shot a weapon want to try and tell you about weapons? Not saying you personally don&#39;t but that&#39;s a large part of the anti gun crowd.</p>

<p>As long as guns exist, they&#39;re going to be used by bad people for bad things. We only have two examples of countries with similar societies going from owning guns to not owning guns, the UK and Australia. The UK&#39;s homicide rate actually went up for over a decade, reversing a downward trend decades long, and they had about .05% as many guns as us. They then had such a knife attack problem that they had to make crazy knife laws and do large public awareness campaigns encouraging people to turn in their knives. Australia&#39;s buyback temporarily halted what was already a lowering homicide rate. So one country stayed the same and one got much worse. Yeah, they have cut down on the amount of murders done in &quot;Mass shootings&quot; but now you&#39;re more likely to be murdered overall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you even shot a rifle? You have no clue what you&#39;re talking about. Here, bullet style everything wrong with your assertions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many militaries do use wood stock. The comparison is used because of the &quot;big scary black gun&quot; meme you people fall for from the antigun crowd. </p></li>
<li><p>30-06 is a more dangerous round than a 5.56 when it comes to killing rather than wounding. Many states don&#39;t allow 5.56 for deer hunting and this is why ar15 mass shootings have larger injury counts than deaths</p></li>
<li><p>The military chooses the m16, which isn&#39;t even the same as an ar15 except for looks, because it&#39;s modular so they can add accessories easily and the 5.56 is large enough to incapacitate but not always kill. An injury in combat takes 3-4 people out of a fight while a death takes one. The smaller round also lets a soldier carry more ammunition which can be useful when you&#39;re spending days away from a fresh stock. </p></li>
<li><p>All of these except Vegas have occurred in close, crowded situations where any perceived advantage to an ar15 goes out the window. The deadliest school shooting in history was done with two small caliber handguns, a .22 Walther PPK and a 9mm glock when 33 people died at VT. Any situation where a large group of unarmed people are up against any gun can result in a catastrophe. The type of gun used will not even be one of the biggest factors. The environment will determine more. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve actually used an m16, an m4, an ar15, many traditional hunting rifles and many handguns. Harping on about one type of weapon, especially basing it on &quot;hurr durr the military uses it&quot; just makes it obvious you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it fits the fit the definition, of course. Most school shootings were not mass shootings, however, and that&#39;s the point. Any incident where a firearm is discharged at a school counts, so included in that count are many suicides on campus with a gun, as well as targeted attacks with one victim, even if it was nonfatal.

<p>Here&#39;s the first example I found on YouTube using it in the media and it&#39;s not a one. Not the most egregious example but you can see how they title it &quot;18 Shootings on U.S. School Campuses in 2018&quot;. Then they open with the voiceover, &quot;It&#39;s becoming a familiar sight&quot; while showing footage from the Columbine, Sandy Hook and Parkland, attempting to associate the number 18 in this year alone to the 3 deadliest over 2 decades, when the actual familiar sight is a much different scenario. It&#39;s become this annoying little factoid that gets repeated on social media a lot.</p>

This cycle gets repeated next election, same side wants 100% and screams &quot;THERE IS NO COMPROMISEING WITH THESE PEOPLE&quot;. So the sharer bends to 80% of the widgets. Wash rinse and repeat untill one side gets their way. Both sides of the isle are guilty of this.</p>

<p>I am a liberal gun owner, (I want to be able to show up at my gay cousins wedding with a joint in my hand and a pistol in my pocket) before you tell other people I want to have barbed wire around kindergartens you should ask me or people like me first.</p>

<p>... Also if you think there are no guns on university campuses you are sadly mistaken, plenty of universities have their own armed police force <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_police">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_police</a> without being surrounded by concertina wire and sandbags.</p>

<p>We need to talk not just preach. </p>

<p>We also need better public health programs, but that&#39;s a different situation entirely.</p>

<p>So you are going to just forget about the 35+ years of legislation that has already put massive restriction on the dealer for sales regulation, that have failed, but are not being followed through by government agencies, laws? Why would the government look to kill a massive amount of its taxed income?</p>

<p>All you are doing is asking for more feel-good-legislation that the legal departments and dealers <em>may</em> not uphold[*Pretty much 35+ years up to now]. I&#39;ve been watching it over 40 years. Fuck. You can&#39;t even get government to do the right things anyways, and, that alone is going to bite us in the ass. And, when it does, you will be thankful for people that know how to use firearms and that they know who the enemy is.</p>

<p>The easier thing to do would be to move to where there are less guns, or just less people.</p>

<p>No matter how much legislation you put in the way, there are going to be mass killings; gun or no.</p>

<p>The ATF has been handcuffed by NRA supported legislation to limits it&#39;s reach to enforce the laws you refer to. </p>

<p>All you&#39;re saying is that you don&#39;t trust Government to ever do the right thing so therefor you must become a vigilante and uphold justice yourself.  </p>

<p>Holding dealers more accountable is part of the new common sense gun control I support. They are the gatekeepers of these deadly weapons. Let&#39;s hold them to that. </p>

<p>The thing that&#39;s been &quot;biting us in the ass&quot; the last 20 + years has been all those people that DON&#39;T know how or care to know how to use a gun. We allow them the same easy access to them, why? So that you don&#39;t have to wait a week for your 8th gun? Get real.</p>

<p>Limiting guns in criminals hands is the goal. Never forget that. </p>

<p>Now matter how many rape laws you pass there are always going to be rapists. By your logic we should make rape easier.  again, you&#39;re logic is flawed.</p>

<p>&quot;Train car theft in high crime areas.[Cargo at rest is cargo at risk]&quot;; is something that the city of Chicago knows about and has been trying to cure. Did you know that most of the firearms shippments that move around the US are in boxcars? Yet, we never hear about the average of 3 box cars a quarter getting raided by criminals. What is important about this, the city of Chicago says, &quot;that the criminals seem to know what boxcars to go for&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are libertarian then you have my <em>utmost</em> respect.  However, we are in a bad situation right now-- well, for the last 60+ years.  We are told &quot;just this one little law&quot; or &quot;just this one little rule&quot; over and over again, as a tactic to start the process of removing rights (it&#39;s not just gun control-- same tactic is going on over free speech: you just can&#39;t say this one little hateful thing, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. And the reason I agree with you is this. Think about every law thats been passed. Think back as far as you can remember. When is the last time a law was passed that actually gave you a new right? Every law that gets passed either restricts or denies you some right. And 99.9% of the time there is some monetary motivation behind passing the law.</p>

<p>Nope...sorry.  Any conceivable excuse to eradicate the 2nd Amendment is viewed by the entire US News Media as <em>more</em> relevant than them obtaining enough oxygen for their next breath.  </p>

<p>The US News Media has 3...and only 3...reasons for existing:</p>

<p>1)  Propagandizing 24/7 in favor of Israel.</p>

<p>2)  Justifying the elimination of gun ownership by citizens so we can be mass exterminated by the government Israel Controls if we fail to voluntarily support them.</p>

<p>3)  Justifying exceptions to free speech that are so vague and all encompassing that the net effect is that no one is allowed to criticize Israel without being accused of antisemitism and this will eventually be followed by criminalizing &quot;hate speech&quot; and executing anyone who says one word in opposition to Israel&#39;s plans for global domination.</p>

<p>Any of these 3 are continuously &quot;topically relevant&quot; and if they happen to produce profit in the process, then that is great too, but if it doesn&#39;t happen, then they don&#39;t really care.</p>

<p>You&#39;re literally making things up. The teacher was authorized by law to carry a firearm because he was trained to do so. It would be a felony otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know what doesn&#39;t happen when there aren&#39;t any guns around?</p>

<p>Implying that guns will disappear because you write a law saying so. According to this logic, marijuana does not exist in the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know what will happen if you put guns in schools?</p>

<p>Guns only shoot when people are handling them. People with any training know you don&#39;t draw a gun in public unless someone is trying to kill you (it&#39;s against the law in many places). So, no, trained teachers are not going to be <em>playing with their guns in a school</em> and then have a negligent discharge.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking teachers with guns <em>in the classroom</em>, but you know, the guys placed in a safe location nearby, where they can be accessed in what... 5 minutes (hear the shots, secure your classroom and students, get to the gun locker, open it, inspect the weapon, load the weapon, return to the area, find the perpetrator)?</p>

<p>Maybe we can take it one step further and just have a bunch of the teachers designated as permanent security. We could train them to deal with this type of issue, provide them with guns, and to be safe, uniforms. To make response time best we could group them together, maybe have them on patrols. And if we need to reach them! Let&#39;s have a dedicated phone line... but scrap the 7 or 10 digits... just use three.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are falling into your same problem you accuse me of. Arguing against something that both doesn&#39;t have to be the case. 
1. Just because you don&#39;t think what I said is the case, does not mean others aren&#39;t picturing that as other comments have said my ideas are a new perspective to them. 
2. Even if there are guns in certain classrooms with teachers trained as they ought to be, those guns would be locked up. The guns in the classroom would make the response time minimal (a lot quicker than the 10 minute average after the call has been made to the police. especially when you consider call time) Them in the classroom or in the school in general when locked up appropriately may increase the risk of an accident by a tiny percent particularly if opening the safe when it is uncalled for would result in jail time. 
2b. No one said 10 teachers would all have guns. You are assuming the teachers would be disorganized and that would result in mistakes, that simply is irrational. You give a set of people weapons in a school, you also have protocol as to where and how those people are to operate. Teachers also can easily been given IDs that identify them and say open doors on campus using strips that can&#39;t be counterfeited by a 19 year old with a desire to shoot up his old school? 
3. There is a small amount of 19 year old kids that can pass as a 30 year old as you suggest. And a 19 year old isnt going to pass as a 30 year old colleague of mine who I see daily and have meetings with. So that eliminates teachers accidentally shooting each other. 
4.Properly trained teachers aren&#39;t anymore likely to shoot a kid than police would be in the same situation, but the teachers would roughly have 15-20 minutes of a jump start according to every result in a google search. (not peer reviewed I know but it says something)
5. what about schools in rural areas that have no designated police force? Response time being over an hour? What do you do then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy who just fired a gun off in California was a reserve officer and a safety trainer.  He <em>still</em> made a mistake and discharged his weapon.  Just because you have training doesn&#39;t mean you will never fuck up.  You ever see that video from like a decade or so ago of that DEA agent showing guns to students in a classroom and he makes a big speech about how he is trained so he is the only person in the room who is qualified to handle the guns he is showing and then literally within 10 seconds he accidentally shoots himself in the foot with one of the guns he is holding?  That shit happens.  The more &quot;trained&quot; you are the more complacent you can become because you feel like you wouldn&#39;t make a mistake because you are so cautious and you have handled guns a million times.  Once it starts becoming second nature to handle a gun it also starts to get to a point where you can become complacent and make a mistake.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said anything about trusting the government.  People in the government are the ones saying &quot;teachers should be armed&quot; because they want that sweet, sweet NRA money to keep coming to them.  How often do we see news stories about teachers who aren&#39;t even mature enough to keep themselves from fucking their students?  But we want to train and arm these people?  And then once they are trained and armed what separates them from being the same as the &quot;fed goons&quot; who you say we need more gun control for?  They will then be teachers who are armed and trained in firearms the same as the police are and they are given special authority to carry a weapon and use it as necessary inside a school.  So basically our teachers will be cops thinking at any moment they may have to play hero and shoot an intruder.  What could go wrong?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Arming an educator is a dumb idea.  Sorry, it just is.  As the news reports show, accidents will happen with guns.  Why add additional danger within a classroom?  Teachers are there to educate children, adding a weapon to thier responsibilites is too much.  Do you remember high school?  Do you remember the amount of drama and stress that can occur in a school?  Adding teachers with guns is adding additional gasoline to a grease fire.  As these latest news reports show.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy for you and your comfort level with your weapon.  I&#39;m not here to say you don&#39;t deserve to have one.  But I don&#39;t care how well trained you are, if you are going to be an educator in the classroom, you should not be walking around with a gun strapped to your waist or wherever you&#39;re gonna conceal it.</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m sorry, but you having a gun does not make me feel more comfortable.  It may make you feel more comfortable, but it does not make me feel that way.  </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not here to take away your gun.  If you feel confortable having one in your house, or when you are driving in your car, cool.  I have a bunch of friends that carry protection.  But don&#39;t bring it into my kid&#39;s schools.  </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not advocating the removal of your right to self defense.  I&#39;m saying that there is no reason for teachers to have guns.  It&#39;s a stupid idea, and most people agree.  These news stories about idiot teachers hurting themselves or students because of having a gun is clear evidence that it&#39;s a bad idea.  trump is a fucking moron for thinking this was a good idea.  </p>

<p>Did you know that your more likely to hurt yourself with your own gun then from being shot by another person?  Again, you&#39;re adding more chances of mistakes to happen.  It&#39;s a dumb idea.</p>

<p>As for your notion that in an active shooter situation, I&#39;d be happy that there was another person with a gun...  Maybe.  Or maybe I&#39;d be even more freaked out about being caught in the cross fire.  </p>

<p>This notion of a good guy with a gun in a public space is stupid.  This isn&#39;t the OK Corral.  This isn&#39;t a war zone.  Your right to own a fire arm and protect yourself in your own personal space (your car, your home) does not allow you to come into a public space strapped.  Sorry.  But that&#39;s how I feel.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest, your reasoning just doesn&#39;t make logical sense to me. If you think that school shootings are a threat that we need to protect against, it makes sense to allow teacher to have a means of defense if they chose to take that responsibility. </p>

<p>You seem to think the threat of an accidental misfire is greater than the potential defense offered by allowing teachers to have arms. I&#39;m not sure either of us can be convinced, and you calling it dumb or moronic or whatever isn&#39;t really strengthening your argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not calling you dumb or moronic.  I&#39;m calling the idea dumb.</p>

<p>Yeah, we&#39;re clearly on different sides of this debate.  I&#39;m not sure how long ago you were in high school, but I clearly remember it.  I just think adding a gun into a school is throwing a match into a powder keg.  </p>

<p>There are other solutions to school shootings besides creating a war zone environment.  This NRA solution that the president is pushing is just plain dumb.</p>

<p>Again, just to be clear.  I&#39;m not against your right to own a gun for your personal safety.  That&#39;s your choice.  But there&#39;s no need for them in schools.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ll just have to agree to disagree.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And furthermore, it will not happen. Well not nationally, maybe some state or district in a state will try it, but won&#39;t be a thing. Schools are public and funded by taxpayers. We are not going to want our kids going to a school where teachers are packing heat. No way. Won&#39;t happen. I would say if anything comes of this (besides new gun laws which likely won&#39;t end school shootings but needs to happen) will be more security or metal detectors or something new that will be invented. Like a machine that can smell bullets or gun powder. Maybe schools will be built in the future with bullet proof windows and doors and an instant super lock down system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Remember &quot;The Summer of the shark&quot; a few years ago?  The news reported a shark attack and people tuned in and then they reported all of the shark attacks because it got ratings., They compared the number of attacks to previous Summers and there were actually fewer shark attacks that particular Summer and the news just sensationalized it.  </p>

<p>My point is that most of the time sensational journalism is not meant to push an agenda but more self serving for the media itself.  </p>

<p>The problem I have with this sub is that literally everything is a &quot;conspiracy&quot; here.  I feel like you can&#39;t claim conspiracy on everything  or you lose what little credibility you have.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. At least once a day now on Twitter one of the headline stories and trending hashtags will be about an incident involving a gun and labelled as an &quot;active shooter&quot;. </p>

<p>Personally, I find the media&#39;s treatment of the entire situation to be as much of a cause as anything for the big ones like Cruz. People like to mention that Germany hasn&#39;t had a school shooting because they beefed up their gun laws. They also disallowed the media from reporting from reporting the shooter&#39;s name and making them famous. We make ours into the new Charles Mansons. There have been more than a few psychologists who have said as such. </p>

<p>We have much deeper problems than the availability of guns. Everyone knows who Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold, or Nicholas Cruz are. Nobody can name John Keller or Ken Bellau, two guys who saved tons of lives in Katrina. And I don&#39;t mean to suggest I&#39;m any better. I always have to Google their name before making this point.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t counting the school shooters who chicken out, knowing that teachers are armed and able to stop them.  Or those who are stopped mid shooting.</p>

<p>Accidents always happen, whether it is a cop a security guard or your grandpa out shooting his .22.  That&#39;s life, deal.  </p>

Armed security is deterrent enough, multiple depending on school size and demographics, but arming teachers creates a conflict of interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d suggest a mental exercise exploring all the potentials for arming teachers messing with the academic focus of the school, it’s effect on student teacher relations, and overall safety. An opinion is only as valuable, and as valid, as the thought behind it. Not saying I’m right and your wrong in black and white terms, and I think your last sentiment is agreeable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well most of the nutters will say something stupid before doing something stupid.  Case in point Nicholas Cruz.  We could just improve the way we enforce the already existing law and do it better.  Cruz should have lost his right after his threats and his frequent problems with police which showed him to be a danger to society.</p>

<p>Any teacher threatening students with his gun should lose his privilege to carry it.  Any teacher with a history of rage issues or who is frightening his students should be disqualified.    </p>

<p>Many different ways to do it, I don&#39;t think there is a satisfying answer to all.  But I can say for certain those who want to take guns will not meet any compromise with my side.  </p>

<p>If we want to get deeper than the immediate security issue, we as a nation must figure out how to make schools better places and students happier and healthier people.  We could do a lot to improve on that, but I think that is far less likely thing to happen.<br/>
Standard practice for say a depressed student is to take him to a psychiatrist who will give him drugs that can increase the chances of him killing himself or others.  Instead of trying the dozens of other therapies that can improve mood and health naturally.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Arming teachers&quot; is not saying give every teacher in the country a gun. What people who actually stop and think about it are asking for are a handful of teachers in each school to undergo training, an extra background check, and a mental stability check, that then will be given access codes to a gun safe on campus in case of a shooter on campus. The guns will not be freely accessible and if touched at any time other than an emergency while students are on campus should result in jail time like carrying on campuses results in such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Budgets don&#39;t work that way. Schools are funded via property taxes, supplemented via state funding allocated specifically for education. Welfare comes from a different budget line. Don&#39;t forget this isn&#39;t a one time 80 hour training. These people need to maintain their training. Their vision will need to be checked. Their mental health status will need to be monitored (IME teachers do tend to slowly go crazy over time). A database of who is armed and who has kept up with their training hours will need to be maintained. The guns could be a tax write off, except that the Trump budget just eliminated the $250 teacher discretionary tax credit to cover all the money teachers pay out of pocket for school materials. You wanna pony up for my Glock, my bullets, my hours at the range, etc?</p>

<p>Hidden costs and unfunded mandates are endemic in all school reforms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah it&#39;s not coincidental. I tried to talk about this over there to no avail. Basically, they&#39;re going to throw news articles at you with the reasonable conclusion being that we can&#39;t protect our kids and The guns need to be confiscated. The teachers can&#39;t have guns because they&#39;ll have accidents and the cops can&#39;t protect them (remember the Hoggs kid excusing the Florida officers from not intervening because &quot;nobody wants to do that job&quot;) because assault weapons. The only conclusion that is desired to be left is to take away the guns. If there were super top-notch drones that could take a shooter out in seconds, you&#39;d see articles saying &quot;drone attacks student during lunchtime&quot;. They want the guns, and they want em bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who gives a fuck. </p>

<p>There is absolutely no defense to the notion of arming teachers. It <em>will</em> lead to injury and death to innocents. </p>

<p>I asked the two security guards at my school, one is US Mil, and the other from German Mil, &quot;How much training would it take to safely deploy guns among the teachers?&quot; Just the training question, mind you. Something these burly tatted gents have expertise in. </p>

<p>The german one just started laughing, my prediction is that he would simply say &quot;no.&quot; But the American just started shaking his head and said, so they&#39;re all going to clock the range time weekly at least too, right? </p>

<p>His take was that in the end, these things only last 1-3 minutes, and in that time, getting <em>any</em> class k-12 out the fucking door is a full time job. It&#39;s a numbers game. You&#39;re going to have more teachers getting lazy, fooled, or undertrained every day than you&#39;re going to have teachers that ever even get put into the position of having a clear shot on a confirmed shooter. Keep in mind the statistics on how often these things really happen. If you don&#39;t have meteor insurance, you can shut the fuck up. </p>

<p>Worry about something that counts. </p>

<p>Unfortunately; the world is full of shit that needs your attention. You&#39;ve got you&#39;ve head up, just maintain the swivel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not coincidental, its a logical outcome. Reasonable people who legally carry a handgun should always be on alert of the status and location of the firearm, and be highly attentive of any situation where the firearm could be commandeered. But you certainly have people who think they know firearms well enough to not need to practice firearm safety by the book. </p>

<p>In contrast, teachers need to be approachable and students should feel comfortable around their teachers. Obviously those two mindsets are at odds. With a firearm in such close proximity to so many people, it introduces a potential powder keg. Situations are more likely to go from 0-100 real quick, whereas if a firearm wasn&#39;t present, it&#39;d only go 0-20. The fact that a teacher is carrying would certainly come up in class. Kids will test the teachers to see what if they&#39;ll draw for anything less than another firearm (hello seven-figure payout). It&#39;s only a matter of time before a kid takes a firearm from a teacher, whether by overpowering them, pick pocketing, or stealing it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not making any point about how school violence should be handled or whether teachers should be armed; it just makes me sad and disappointed that it&#39;s the a realistic conclusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In regard to armed teachers and police arrival times - Do you know why they do not want that?</p>

<ol>
<li>If it&#39;s a false flag by the C.I.A./F.B.I./D.O.D. (most times that&#39;s exactly what it is) they can&#39;t control the narrative. Ideally these attacks are mainly to pull on the heartstrings of Americans to give up their 2nd amendment. Ever notice how shootings went from random places to high schools, to black churches, then to gay nightclubs, then to elementary schools. Connects dots people.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once a country gives up it&#39;s ability to defend itself - Its All Downhill from there. False flags do not mean no one dies. 9 -11= FF w/deaths. Sandy Hoax= FF w/out deaths.</p>

<p>Since barry soetoro repealed the Smith Mundt Act which prohibited our gov from using propaganda against it&#39;s own citizens mass shootings have went up 500%. That act was established to fight Nazi Commie Propaganda. Sorry guys. Todays Dems are history&#39;s nazi&#39;s. Is this a coincidence?  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/vyDDy">https://imgur.com/a/vyDDy</a>   </p>

<p>Am I trying to sway you to republican? Hell No. Bushes are All Anti-American Globalist Terrorists. I am just giving you facts. You do want you want.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Secondly the attacks are to PUNISH Americans for NOT taking our daily does of brainwashing. In doing so you cost the elite time and money off of their AGENDA. We make a huge Pedo or Drug bust - they answer back with a public shooting. This is what Trump, the Q Team, and the White Hats are dealing with on a daily basis. Doesn&#39;t matter if u hate them, they are fighting for u. In time hopefully many will see that.</p>

<p>Imagine when one of the alphabet agencies operatives or their &quot;patsies&quot; gets taken out by a teacher and is killed before he harms someone? The MSM would be literally running from kids that are trying to publicly THANK the Teacher from saving them like at Parkland. This will prove arming teachers works better than calling the cops. The deep state cannot have that. That would be a huge wound and their MAIN TOOL for gun grabbing will be demolished almost overnight. </p>

<ol>
<li>Showing that an armed citizenry can do better than cops. Many cops (NOT ALL) are corrupt and manipulate their crime stats in order to receive federal funding (OUR MONEY). If armed people were to keep saving other people it would prove we really do not need as many cops as we do. Then the public will eventually want downsizing of the DS. They cannot have that. They want a huge police state complete with facial scanners and drones everywhere. In order to achieve mass control you have to paint the illusion of mass chaos. Then the patient will not only willingly accept their arsenic, they will beg you for it. 
&quot;Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick&quot;  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aySN0FGJYpM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aySN0FGJYpM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>This problem can be cut by 70% or better overnight. Slash the alphabet agencies by 70% and watch all of these public shootings
and bombings all but disappear. They create problem,to get a reaction,to offer you a solution. It just so happens the solutions make them TRILLIONS and Burn the Constitution and Our Rights. Connect Dots People. </p>

<p>If our Government has done nothing but grow 10 fold in scale,scope,and reach then why are these types of bombings and shootings also growing? Why has their funding went up exponentially  yet all of our problems continue to expand as well?
By the time you can catch on, it will be too late to reign them in.</p>

<p>In closing I will say that yes some legit public shootings do happen. However it is very rare for some bullied kid, a scorned boyfriend, or mental case to have the access, and the balls, the skills, and be able to actually pull it off. If they do we should look into the other constant factor with many of these shootings (psychotropic drugs). Oh lets not do that.Big Pharma doesn&#39;t want that because again don&#39;t want to harm that gravy train. </p>

<p>We are being played people. &quot;It&#39;s easier to fool people than to convince them they have been fooled&quot; - M. Twain.</p>

<p>Being no US american I can maybe answer the question: The USA is rather special as a) there is a strict believe that guns provide an equalizer and b) that an assault-weapon-derivate plattform like the Ar-15 gained such commercial success. </p>

<p>Within a conspiracy sub the second part might be just as important: The sales of AR-15 variants went from 61,000 in 2001 to 1,27 million in 2012 (<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-the-ar-15-became-mass-shooters-weapon-of-choice-w451452">https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-the-ar-15-became-mass-shooters-weapon-of-choice-w451452</a>). With that decade we also saw a rise of the truther/&quot;freemen&quot; movement as well as the rise of the tea party. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the rentless propaganda that &quot;they&quot; want to steal US americans &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;weapons&quot; by e.g. the NRA is driven mostly by the want to hike the gun sales or if they truly believe that a weapon designed for urban warfare is a neccessity within their political scopes but by now we have a lot of AR-15s out in the open and a truly divided society. </p>

<p>I don’t often call people out, however for you I will make an exception.  I don’t think you have any idea of what you are talking about here.</p>

<p>School teacher salaries come from the taxes a city or town levies upon its residents who own real estate.  The schools, in coordination with their teachers unions, present a budget of operations to the city school board, based on teachers salaries and the remaining school operations costs. (Federal school funding is also factored in, but for our purposes, we will not include that for simplicity sake). The school board reviews and/or approves and then sends to the City for approval by the Taxpayers. </p>

<p>After all of that, when you look at comparative salary packages comparing public school teachers to other professions in the U.S., Teachers are paid reasonable salaries. (when you factor in that teachers do not work year round, then teachers are paid exceptionally well).</p>
