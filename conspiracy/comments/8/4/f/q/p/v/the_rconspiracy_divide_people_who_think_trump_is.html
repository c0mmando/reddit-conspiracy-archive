        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In r/conspiracy, there is a vocal and rabid opposition to Trump who constantly complain about r/the_donald users leaving their plantation and supporting Trump in the sub.  Even though negative posts about Trump are given thousands of upvotes by astroturf trolls hired by deep-state funded <a href="http://freebeacon.com/issues/david-brocks-shareblue-nucleus-multi-platform-anti-trump-media-entity/">Shareblue</a> and other organizations, these same trolls downvote and attack anyone who points out anything positive Trump has done and tell them to go back to r/the_donald. </p>

<p>I feel Trump is leading a front against the deep state but feel increasingly unwelcome in this sub and unable to express my views without being attacked and downvoted.</p>

<p>The case for Trump being one of the good guys is strong.  Just the fact that the whole MSM establishment has been negative towards Trump since he announced his candidacy is evidence, as is the debunked Russia conspiracy.  Here is a well written <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/12/virgil-the-deep-state-vs-donald-trump/">article</a> that makes an even stronger case. </p>

<p>Of course, any source that is not mainstream media is attacked as illegitimate and downvoted when the information presented is at all positive towards Trump, as will mine. But keep in mind that attacking the source is an ad-hominim logical fallacy and does not prove whether the information is valid or not.  It has been especially sad to see the alternative media attacked as illegitimate in this sub.</p>

<p>The climate has become so bad towards the supporters of Trump that they had to break off and create their own subs with r/conspiracyright where they could discuss their views openly and in peace.  They have also gone back to r/the_donald and I have noticed there have been increasingly conspiratorial posts in that sub over the past year as a consequence.  r/GreatAwakening is another that discusses the /pol/ posts of Q, claimed to be a high-level government insider with Q clearance (hence the name) tasked with posting intel drops — which he posts straight to 4chan in order to covertly inform the public about POTUS’s master plan to stage a countercoup against members of the deep state. (the first sub about this topic, r/CBTS has been banned)</p>

<p>No matter what they continually say despite evidence to the contrary, this sub has been increasingly influenced by the left, of enemies of Trump through deep-state funded operations, and a rabid base of butthurt liberals.</p>

<p>The top post in the last day has over 6000 upvotes which is unheard of in this sub without obvious manipulation, and is about how Trump supporters are stupid and have been fooled.  Many of the comments are ironically complaints about any Trump supporter who dares to express their views in the sub.  Show me <em>one post</em> with as many upvotes that says anything positive about Trump in the slightest.</p>

<p>So r/conspiracy has been successfully converged through sustained manipulation, and even though most of us are on the same side in our belief that evil exists in the world, and with a common desire to understand it and ultimately defeat it, we have been successfully divided.</p>

<p>Instead of more of the same in the comments complaining about Trump supporters, for a change I&#39;d like to see brave supporters of Trump&#39;s fight against the deep state to express how they feel about this, even if you have to use a alt account to safely do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK&#39;s assassination was not politically fueled. He came from an Illuminati bloodline (Kennedy being one of the thirteen families), that&#39;s how he was granted his position as president in the first place. He was assassinated because he was a good man and refused to do the bidding of the freemasons (such as committing false flags). Political conspiracies are always the exoteric, occult conspiracies are the esoteric. This subreddit would retain maybe 10% of it&#39;s userbase max if political discussion was no longer allowed but man would it produce some of the most useful discussion available on the internet.</p>

<p>Its bringing a ton of companies back, jobs back, and tax haven money being repatriated. If you ask an economist if this is a good move (while refraining from providing info on who is doing it and what affiliations) every single time and economist will say its a good move to get companies to invest, exist, and pay taxes in your country.</p>

<p>Middle class is getting less taxes taken out and keeping more. Its not that much, and I wish it was more, but its still more than the last guy did.</p>

<p>On top of that, bringing back companies into the U.S. and getting new ones to come here and stay here is good for the whole of the country and a variety of ways, besides just looking at how much the middle class is getting</p>

<p>Trickle down doesnt work and never did, but at the same time, not doing anything and letting companies leave here, not having incentives for them to return or for new ones to come here, is worse than not doing anything at all and trickle down not working</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Trickle-down economics” isn’t even a real concept. It’s a grossly oversimplified variation on a concept known as “supply-side economics.” Any Econ 101 textbook can explain the theory fairly succinctly. The idea is to free up capital in the areas of the economy that produce things people need or want. You can give tax cuts to a company that is producing a widget that people want. If they have more money they can produce more widgets and expand, making them cheaper and more accessible in the long run. </p>

<li>there are past administrations &amp; people currently blaming Russia to hide the meddling they have done is Russia.  This this goes way back.

Much of the details are oublic.  This shit is deep &amp; complex.  I just have a hard time believing Trump has done anything anywhere close to what previous admins have done.  Start providing more evidence to support it &amp; stop acting as if western media isnt full of propaganda.  Read as much as you can about Bill Browder/HSBC/Hermitage Capital/FusionGPS... then explain that shit to the rest of us &amp; then provide as much incriminating evidence to support the Trump/Russia claims.<br/></li>

<p>HSBC Shuts Russia’s Hermitage as Browder Sued in London</p>

<p>Henry Meyer and Jason Corcoran
HSBC Holdings Plc is closing Hermitage Capital Management Ltd.’s flagship Russia fund just as its co-founder, William Browder, is being sued for libel in London and tried in absentia for tax evasion in Moscow.</p>

<p>“It was too small to continue as a viable concern,” Browder, 48, said by phone yesterday from London, where he’s based. Browder said the closing is “completely” in the hands of HSBC, which is the trustee and manager of the fund.</p>

<p>The Hermitage Fund, which Browder started in 1996 with the late billionaire Edmond Safra, was the largest foreign owner of Russian shares when it peaked at more than $4 billion in 2005, according to Browder. Russia that year barred Browder from the country without explanation, triggering years of legal conflict, including over the 2009 death of Hermitage adviser Sergei Magnitsky while he was in pretrial detention in Moscow.</p>

<p>“HSBC has decided to jettison him because Browder is considered radioactive in Russia,” Eric Kraus, a fixed-income manager at Rolnes Ltd. in Moscow, which oversees about $150 million, said in e-mailed comments. “He had one great competitive advance: he knew how to trade Russia like a Russian during the Yeltsin years -- a time when it was one of the world’s least transparent markets.”</p>

<p>Magnitsky’s Death</p>

<p>The decision to shutter the fund has angered at least one investor, Tim Enneking of Altima Asset Management in Moscow, who said HSBC units provoked the closing by freezing the fund in August to assess how much money to set aside for Hermitage’s legal battles. A former Russian investigator, Pavel Karpov, filed a libel suit against Browder and Hermitage Capital in the U.K. over allegations Karpov was involved in Magnitsky’s death.</p>

<p>In January, after redemption requests reached 65 percent of the frozen fund’s $45.6 million value, HSBC and Browder agreed to wind up the fund, Enneking said, citing a Jan. 24 letter from HSBC, which he provided to Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Enneking said HSBC vowed to update investors on the status of their assets by Feb. 28 and he’s still waiting for answers. Hermitage has achieved an annualized return of more than 17 percent since its inception in 1996, according to a performance factsheet issued in June. The fund has invested in companies such as OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas monopoly, OAO Lukoil, the second-biggest oil producer and Evraz Group SA, the steelmaker part-owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich.</p>

<p>Browder continues to invest through his global emerging markets fund, set up after he was exiled from Russia. He declined to say how much assets it had under management.</p>

<p>Sberbank, VTB</p>

<p>HSBC, Europe’s largest bank by market value, won’t comment on the fund’s closing, said Julia Molchanova, a spokeswoman for the bank in Moscow. Browder declined to comment on the libel case against him, citing his lawyers’ advice.</p>

<p>HSBC is one of 23 foreign and domestic banks Russia chose in 2010 to advise the government on its 1 trillion-ruble ($32 billion) privatization program. Since then, HSBC and other foreign lenders including Barclays Plc and Banco Santander SA have abandoned consumer banking in Russia as state-run OAO Sberbank and VTB Group gained market share.</p>

<p>The British lender is now focusing its Russian operations on debt sales, loan financing and export credits, Mark Stadler, HSBC’s country chief, said in an interview in October.</p>

<p>Browder, a U.S. native and British citizen, has been battling the Russian government with a campaign for legislation in the U.S., Europe and Canada to punish 60 Russian officials he says are responsible for Magnitsky’s death.</p>

<p>Diplomatic Row</p>

<p>Magnitsky, who died at 37, was arrested on tax-evasion charges after he and Browder accused Russian officials of using Hermitage documents to swindle $230 million from the national treasury, a charge the government denies. The case sparked a diplomatic row, with the U.S. imposing sanctions on the Russian officials and Russia retaliating by barring American citizens from adopting Russian orphans.</p>

<p>On March 22, a Moscow court put Browder and the deceased Magnitsky on trial, represented by court-appointed attorneys. They are accused of evading 522 million rubles of taxes. Browder has denied any wrongdoing by either him or Magnitsky, saying March 19 that Russia is “officially defending Magnitsky’s torturers and killers.”</p>

<p>‘Perfectly Legal’</p>

<p>The Interior Ministry this month opened a case against Browder for another alleged crime -- buying shares of state-run Gazprom before restrictions on foreign ownership of the world’s largest gas producer were lifted. Browder and “structures” he created caused at least 3 billion rubles of damage to the state by buying local Gazprom shares and seeking to influence the company in 1999 to 2004, the Interior Ministry said.</p>

<p>Browder said buying Gazprom shares through “derivative structures” was “perfectly legal” during that time.</p>

<p>Hermitage’s relationship with HSBC continues to cause headaches for the U.K. lender, according to Browder. Russian investigators are threatening to seize documents from HSBC’s Moscow offices unless HSBC hands over financial and other information about Hermitage dating back to 1996, Browder said in an e-mailed statement Feb. 15.</p>

<p>Andrei Pilipchuk, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, declined to comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you don&#39;t believe that the bill the &quot;Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017&quot; passed through the House and Senate on 19 December and 20 December and was signed by the president on 22 December? I&#39;m sure that you wouldn&#39;t find the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1">Library of Congress</a> credible either. Is the only source that you find credible the mouth of Donald Trump? Because even then, you know, they could be editing the video or something, so I guess you probably wouldn&#39;t take his word on it either.</p>

<p>If you believe that there are no credible sources for anything, why even ask for sources?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When any posts hits r/all it&#39;s going to get a huge boost from other parts of reddit that are significantly liberal. I would like to see some more constructive comments from Trump supporters around here. Honestly most of the comments I see are just &quot;this source is bullshit&quot; or &quot;this theory about him is bullshit&quot; or &quot;this is a fake MSM narrative.&quot; This shit isn&#39;t constructive at all. It just looks like people are plugging their ears and saying &quot;fuck this story, Trump is awesome and hes fighting for us.&quot;</p>

<p>If you see a post about Trump that you think is wrong, explain why it&#39;s wrong. If you see a bad headline, read the article and find what you think doesn&#39;t add up and explain why it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Trump is not infallible. He&#39;s not some super hero that never lies or makes decisions for his own benefit. But it seems like the Trump people I see on here defend him on literally every step he&#39;s made along the way, no matter what. If you&#39;re going to defend him, I&#39;d like to see more comments that don&#39;t come off as some frustrated fan who dismisses everything as fake. Then I think there would be much better discussions going on. </p>

<p>This is the scariest thing to me about the Trump base. He seems to have very few supporters that will criticize him at all. Even when he says things like &quot;take the guns first, due process later&quot; they morph it into some sort of master chess move where he really doesn&#39;t believe what he said. It&#39;s just bizarre cultish behavior. </p>

<p>The position of president is literally impossible to be perfect in. It&#39;s a position of compromise by nature. Working with two separate parties to take in all views and hammer something out for the advancement of the country as a whole. </p>

<p>This blind partisanship on both sides really does nothing for the country and one has to wonder who the dark hand is that&#39;s working overtime to make sure it&#39;s constantly fed our attention and emotion.  </p>

<p>I actually agreed with what he said. My issue was with the blind followers who had no problem with <em>him</em> saying it. We both know full well if the <em>other side</em> (ridiculous premise, we&#39;re all fellow citizens not enemies) said it they would have major problems with it and that&#39;s a fact. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t appreciate being accused of spreading propaganda or being fooled by it. I care very little about divisive partisan political footballs. Which to me is exactly what the gun control issue is. It&#39;s a great way to divide us from our neighbors while the masters laugh. It&#39;s right up there with abortion and religion as far as hot button divisive issues that control a populous. </p>

<p>&quot;take the guns first, go through due process second.” - Trump. </p>

<p>Even T_D was up in arms about it when he first said it. I viewed that live thread. So don&#39;t try and down play the controversial nature of the quote because it was in fact controversial and a complete reversal of the GOP platform. Now, after all the partisans had time to get their marching orders from the top it&#39;s &quot;taken out of context&quot; and not controversial. </p>

<p>If a democrat said it the marching orders would have been to attack relentlessly and viciously because &quot;they&#39;re going for your guns!&quot;. Deep down you know that&#39;s 100% the truth. </p>

<p>Literally this entire quote can be said from the other side and completely work. Partisan politics is a system of control. The common man is on the same side but made to point the finger at the other as the enemy. All the while the man behind the curtain continues his work. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s anti-American to the core and tearing the country to bits. Let&#39;s stop pointing the finger at ourselves and pull back the curtain on the wizards.    </p>

<p>That&#39;s the main issue I have with that sub and to a lesser degree this one. Your doing a disservice to these subs by thinking any dissent must be trolls or shills. There are regular people in life who disagree with your point of view. And there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with that. </p>

<p>As a matter of fact it&#39;s what makes America great. Opposing viewpoints compromising and coming together for the greater good. Sadly, in 2018 it seems that is slowly slipping away. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, he was talking about taking them from the mentally ill who can absolutely be law abiding citizens. I agree though, Trump or the GOP are never taking away the guns. Democrats never will either. Americans will always have the right to bear arms period. That to me is why the gun debate is so stupid.  </p>

<p>Why do you think that is? Is it not because of his brazen attacking style in the first place? You come out throwing rocks you&#39;re going to get some thrown back. If people stopped attacking Trump he wouldn&#39;t even know what to do with himself anyway. Trump lives for stirring the pot. </p>

<p>I was listening to a radio show not long ago where someone was describing his actions just like that, by saying they&#39;re all opening moves in a meticulously planned chess game.  As in coming off strong initially on the tariffs is a way to scare people into accepting smaller concessions to think they&#39;ve won, or the talk about Mexico paying for the wall was a way to get America to accept a wall was going to be built and discuss the merits instead of the costs to make them like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually true about Trump when it comes to the manipulation of mainstream media. He is a grand chess master at using cable news/print media/social media to distract/obfuscate/manipulate. He&#39;s actually the best I&#39;ve ever seen at it and has been for 30 years. He knows the media game through and through for sure. It&#39;s probably his greatest asset. </p>

<p>Where the cultish supporters lose me though is when they try and parlay that natural talent into Trump being some sort of global mastermind with a keen understanding of global politics or even domestic politics and policy in general. He&#39;s unfortunately out of his league in that regard. </p>

<p>Honestly most of the comments I see are just &quot;this source is bullshit&quot; or &quot;this theory about him is bullshit&quot; or &quot;this is a fake MSM narrative.&quot; This shit isn&#39;t constructive at all.

<p>Or maybe your confirmation bias is in action. Every time I raise a valid question about the Russia theory asking you why you put your trust in known liars how do you respond?</p>

<p>Trump is not infallible. He&#39;s not some super hero that never lies or makes decisions for his own benefit. But it seems like the Trump people I see on here defend him on literally every step he&#39;s made along the way, no matter what. </p>

<p>No one is saying he is infallible. That doesn&#39;t mean we should assume guilt without any hard conclusive evidence and goal-post shifting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s never and will never be my case. My case is that &quot;shady connections to Russia&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that the DNC was not hacked by Russians is true which common logic suggests considering the fact that the only &quot;evidence&quot; consists of hearsay by the people most affected by Trump&#39;s loss (no agenda there)... </p>

<p>Then are we even talking about Russia at this point? Over the past year and a half it has been story after story all hinging on he central point that Russia &quot;hacked&quot; the DNC. Using that as a basis they have now turned the popular opinion to label anyone who question crucially important topic this as a &quot;Russian bot&quot;. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that Trump has done nothing positive for Russia other than not impose sanctions which are again hinging on the &quot;election hacking&quot; to be true which if its no are the sanctions even deserved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not common logic at all. That&#39;s what you believe, despite absolutely no evidence that Seth or anybody else leaked those emails.   </p>

<p>Hacking the DNC was just one of the things they did. What did you think all those indictments were for? Yeah we are still talking about Russia because Trump apparently hired a bunch of criminals whonwete actively lobbying for Russian interests. He also refuses to ever say anything critical about that one country, while he&#39;s busy shitting on so many others, including our allies. We have elections coming up and apparently Trump has no Intention of stopping Russia from interfering because he knows they are just trying to help him and his party. </p>

If you say the DNC it just tells me you have no idea how cyber-security works and you are arguing your point from a perspective of complete ignorance because not one official source has claimed that they haven&#39;t released evidence for that reason...</p>

<p>I could understand if the people claiming that Russia &quot;hacked the election&quot; actually came out and said, &quot;We can&#39;t show you definitive proof because of x, y, and z&quot; but they aren&#39;t doing this they are just acting as though it is true without showing there work.</p>

If you look at the Bill of Rights and American history -- including today -- it&#39;s very clear that there hasn&#39;t ever been a point in time when even just those ten amendments were in full effect. In fact, virtually all of them have been rescinded at one point or another, maybe excepting the 3rd and 7th. The 4th, 6th, and 8th might as well not exist today.</p>

<p>The name of a group I keep seeing is the Fabian Society.  I heard of them before, but I did not did into their background.  It seems like they have infiltrated our government, too, but I do not know how they relate to other societies, such as the Freemasons and Rosicurians.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting take, but I think it&#39;s a mistake to discount the House of Saud - A massively wealthy, massively powerful hereditary monarchy that&#39;s been running its region of the world since before Washington D.C. was founded, that managed to fund and train the 9/11 bombers while remaining an American ally, and still directs American policy towards Israel and the Middle East in general.</p>

<p>My cousin in Bristol is a member of the Fabian society, and they don&#39;t seem particularly powerful. She&#39;s a medical researcher who studies early childhood development and I think she co-authored some policy proposals or something that they developed based around improving primary education. I think they&#39;re mostly just a relatively minor policy group/think-tank for the labour party, and I&#39;m fairly sure that any labour member in good standing can join.</p>

<p>The names that I keep seeing popping up recently are Guénon and Evola. I think that the neo-Traditionalists are taking more of a centre-stage these days -- in the USA, obviously, but also Poland, France, and Italy have had recent elections with very powerful neotrad influence. I think there&#39;s a lot of danger in just lumping them in with Nouvelle Droite, since they&#39;re really explicitly anti-materialist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theorist was a term created by the CIA to disparage those questioning the JFK assassination. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists went on to examine the murders of RFK, MLK, Malcom X, John Lennon, etc. as well as other areas such as MKULTRA or running experiments on prisoners.</p>

<p>In short, it was a group of people not driven by political bias, but a desire for the truth.</p>

<p>Now, today, the conspiracy angle is used as a front for fake news. There&#39;s no devotion to the truth, no skepticism of bullshit. Pizzagate was the epitome of this new phenomenon, a so-called conspiracy with zero evidence of any sort used as a cheap and phony method of attacking a political opponent. Even worse, it was fueled by homophobia as well.</p>

<p>Now, I constantly see headlines on this sub about a politician who is out of office and the article often has zero to do with her. Conspiracy is just a safe harbor for fake news. </p>

<p>Oh and it&#39;s those of us who were here years before 2016 who are the shills? GTFO.</p>

<p>This should be a time for celebration for this sub. The Russian collusion story is making conspiracy theory mainstream. Yet too many conspiracy theorists are suddenly incapable of recognizing even the most obvious of conspiracies right in front of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok doc, let&#39;s explore the possibility this is all a plot by the CIA and the &quot;deep state&quot;...</p>

<p>So I guess the plan is to bring about a second Cold War? America was in a much better position globally during the first one, so that aspect makes sense.</p>

<p>But how do we explain the election of Trump and the acts of Trump&#39;s presidency? Like the FBI seems to believe in Russian interference too, but the FBI was also responsible for getting Trump elected. What explains this polar inconsistency? And if the CIA is pulling all the strings, why allow Trump to win in the first place?</p>

<p>And why is Trump so eager to play a pro-Putin role publicly if he is not pro-Putin privately? From hiring Manafort to firing Tillerson, pretty much at every opportunity Trump has done exactly what Putin would want him to do, even inviting Russian spies into the Oval Office to receive classified Israeli intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the laziest way to argue. I don&#39;t have time for this. Do your own research. Start with this: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KzhZoNH.jpg">The Council on Foreign Relations</a>. Notice how every news organization with the exception of Fox News has been anti-Trump for the last two years. They&#39;re globalists that want to push their New World Order. As soon as Trump wins the election, a dossier funded by political opposition is leaked from the intelligence community. The media pushes &quot;Muh Russia&quot; for over a year. People like you believe it because you think the media represents the people instead of warmongering psychopaths. <em>That Iraq and their WMDs was just a fluke. This Russia thing is different this time!</em> Seriously? Keep grasping at straws. Take your Manafort example. His involvement with Russia was years ago during Bush&#39;s and Obama&#39;s administrations with the Podesta Group. WTF does that have to do with Trump? That intelligence Trump shared was also published weeks ago by ABC and CNN -- it was about preventing terrorist attacks. God forbid we try to prevent terrorism.</p>

<p>Look, you can believe whatever you want, but this sub is never going to defend the CIA. If that means coincidentally means defending Trump, so be it. This sub hates the CIA more than it cares for the US president. That&#39;s how it&#39;s always been, and that&#39;s probably how it&#39;ll always be.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Are we still involved in the Middle East? Yes.<br/>
Are we still being spied upon by government agencies? Yes.<br/>
Is Civil Asset Forfeiture still a thing? Yes.<br/>
Are police becoming more militarized? Yes.<br/>
Are we still giving billions to Israel? Yes.<br/>
Are we still increasing the military budget? Yes.<br/>
Are we still fighting the War on Drugs? Yes.  </p>

<p>Trump is not for you or me! He is for himself and his donors. He is for Ivanka and Eric and Don Jr and the Mercer&#39;s and Koch&#39;s. He&#39;s for Halliburton and Lockheed Martin. He&#39;s for increased police power, increased military, and increased government. </p>

<p>I find it absolutely mind boggling that people can look at that man and think &quot;he represents me and my interests, the man with the golden toilet sitting in a tower overlooking New York City is fighting for me&quot;. He isn&#39;t, he never was, and he never will. </p>

<p>He&#39;s like Obama, and Bush, and Clinton. More power and money for them, screw the millions of normal Americans. As long as he&#39;s president, he isn&#39;t going to decrease the government&#39;s power. Why? Because why would he? Why would any politician? They spent hard earned time and money to become the most powerful person in the world, they aren&#39;t going to willingly give up that power. They never do. </p>

<p>Does the liberal media dislike Trump? Yes, of course. He&#39;s a republican in name, he beat their darling Hillary, of course they&#39;re going to hate him. Just like conservative media spent 8 years hating Obama. Why do people care so much about who the media likes or dislikes? Why is it that because liberal media dislikes him, it suddenly means he must be against the deep state. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t think the deep state would love having someone like him to be their lighting rod? To get all the attention and press while they just continue to do things as usual? They loved him when he was bombing Syria, but people seem t forget about that. They may bicker and fight about surface issues, but they&#39;re lock step when it comes to the important ones. </p>

<p>Trump is not fighting the deep state. He isn&#39;t for you and me. He is for himself and those who make him money. He&#39;s for increased government power and authority. Sure, he does some things I agree with but so did Obama. But when it comes down to it, we&#39;re still droning the Middle East, the CIA is still running our foreign policy, police are still militarizing, big banks are still running the economy, we&#39;re still fighting the war on drugs, and we&#39;re still acting like Israel&#39;s bitch. When those things change, maybe I&#39;ll look at Trump in a different light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media is corporate, not liberal. Probably the single biggest lie of our times is the notion of a &quot;liberal media.&quot; Pure nonsense. Even today, the media is pushing Democrats to move &#39;to the right&#39; because Conor Lamb won the House race. </p>

<p>The corporate media has always been on the side of Donald Trump. Just the fact that they put him on live all the time starting way back in 2015. That is positive coverage. When the media went negative, it did so by putting on the craziest most outraged people with the least cohesive messages to scream &quot;racism, racism!&quot; Who in the world would be won over by that approach? Nobody. That only emboldens those who believe they are not racist to empathize and perhaps even join racists, or encourages the actual racists to speak loudly and to vote.</p>

<p>The first rule of advertising: tell them its bad and they want it.</p>

<p>In the bigger picture, the rise of Donald Trump consolidates oligarch power one way or the other, and really both ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Donald Trump moves the government to favor oligarchs more, and</p></li>
<li><p>Those who oppose this extraordinary move toward oligarchy are more willing to settle for the Democrats who move &#39;to the right.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Win-Win.</p>

<p>This is not a new thing either. After 12 years of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, a fatigued population was willing to vote for just about any Democrat. They got &quot;third way&quot; Bill Clinton who often cowtowed to the reactionary Republican agenda, even while Republicans were trashing him constantly on Fake News or superficial items.</p>

<p>After eight illegitimate years of George W. Bush, a pet rock could have won the 2008 election for the Democrats. So they got a &quot;moderate&quot; unknown but highly skilled and personable Barack Obama to promise &quot;hope and change&quot; knowing full well that he would deliver little of that and people would be disappointed.</p>

<p>Then, they created their fake outsider and put him up against a giant circus of clowns to make sure he would win the nomination. They even had their most discredited neocon types endorse Hillary Clinton to make sure she would be portrayed as establishment.</p>

<p>Same tricks over and over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could buy that. But to who&#39;s benefit? I don&#39;t buy the generic &quot;international banking cabal with no specific goals,&quot; they did fine under Obama and would have done fine under Clinton or Bush III. Russia is a real possibility -- and they no doubt <em>tried</em> to engineer distractions -- but I have a hard time believing that Putin was able to pull the strings on the whole thing and completely get the better of the NATO security apparatus with the, what, three million dollars or something he spent?</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s always the perennial answer of &quot;Israel,&quot; but what have they gotten that they couldn&#39;t have gotten under a less distracting president? Personally my gut says that Saudi Arabia is the real player here, and Russia was either incidental or being put on, but I&#39;ve not been able to find anything other than circumstantial evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a better question. Why run at all? You’re a 70 year old multi-billionaire who sleeps 4 hours a night and has been running around the globe doing deals for 45 year. Most people pretty much like you, or at least the attention and money you bring them, some others think your an ass but whatever, it’s all gravy. You’re surrounded by family, your business empire is set, time to live out your golden years. Or actually instead you can pick door number 2 and bust your ass and spend millions of your own money and risk far more than that, including yours and your families lives (already 2 attempted assassinations) by knowingly becoming for some the most hated man on the planet. Knowing letting the media turn you into a sub-human monster. All so you can spend your last days doing the hardest most stressful job in the world, every day of which you know you will have to fight off the media, government, Hollywood, academia...you name it.</p>

<p>Why? 
What absolute crazy person would take that path?</p>

<p>Power? He’s had power. Most people fiend for power get into politics. Where’s he been for 70 years? Putting mints on pillows. Money? He can’t spend all his money in 5 more lifetimes.</p>

<p>I think you were closer to the mark when you said he’s doing it for Ivanka and Eric and Don Jr and his grandkids. You’re right, he not one of us. We haven’t stood in this smoke filled rooms and overheard the conversations the worlds elite engage in. We haven’t rubbed elbows with the movers of this planet while they run their mouths in front of people they <em>think</em> are all in on the game. What man <em>but</em> Trump can better know the machinations of the business and political and media back alley gutters. Who would ever betray that crowd? Who <em>could</em>?</p>

<p>It’s clear to me these people all just assumed Trump was another bootlicker like them and that someone somewhere must have dirt on the guy. That’s how this shit works. They do what they do behind closed doors because they know everyone is fucked if they step out of line because they know how fucked they are if they step out of line. You all know this, right? It’s why you’re on this sub in the first place, because you know how it works.</p>

<p>Except they were wrong this time. Nobody has fucking <em>shit</em> on Trump. Nothing. How do I know? Because you don’t know. If there were anything we’d all know by now because fucking <em>everyone</em> who pulls strings did everything in their power to keep this man out of the Oval Office. In fact, they were so sure he was as dirty as they were that they wiretapped his campaign and covered it up with a bogus fisa warrant because they were <em>sure</em> they’d find something which would keep his ass out of office, nobody the wiser what heinous breach of liberty was transgressed to ensure it.</p>

<p>I think you were closer to the mark when you said he’s doing it for Ivanka and Eric and Don Jr and his grandkids. I think he looked around, looked at what was coming down the pike with Hillary and said enough is enough, I can’t stand by and watch this happen. Why good is all the wealth you’d leave your children if the world is on fire?</p>

<p>Oh and I’m certain it’s also because of his massive ego and narcissism. I think he wants to do something that will get his smarmy-ass shit eating grin on legal tender one day.</p>

<p>So nice little speech and all, but it doesn’t add up to me. Hate the guy and his policies if you want, but let’s not gas light what went down here. If you’ve got any question what the score is, I’d recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/NnRVAzFa6Og">watching the faces</a> of everyone in that room after he calls that corrupt evil cunt what she really is.</p>

When you think of the people in the deep state/Illuminati, don’t you think of people just like Trump (rich beyond necessity/egotistical/selfish/narcissistic) except smarter?

<p>Oh nuuu he’s friends with Russia. NO SHIT. NEW. WORLD. ORDER. Two greatest powers in the world save China uniting to bring the rest of the world in line with the “supreme agenda”.</p>

<p>The “deep state” has been much more subtle in the past. For some reason it feels like they’re in a hurry now with Trump ham handing everything that needs to be in the public eye, which is pretty scary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s another possibility. Maybe he wasn&#39;t in bed with the deep state, or Russia, but has already lost the fight against them, or been coerced into participating in the theatrics.  Everything just kind of feels so fake on both sides. Following politics today feels like you&#39;re watching professional wrestling. Kayfabe, shoots, and paper champions.</p>

<p>Underneath it all I feel like the only certainty I can find is the realization that we are playing a game in which there is no clear path to victory, yet there is one way to guarantee defeat: by allowing yourself to be absorbed by the mob (any of the mobs really).  </p>

<p>In order to stay afloat, you must accept that all progress is dependent on accepting nothing as fact, that nothing&#39;s above question, and everything as exceedingly possible. That which is real is that which fits best into the jigsaw-like tapestry of this reality. Everything in its right place, and connected. The only lies are those that lead to the death of inquiry: censorship, &quot;right-think&quot;, and the insane delusion that anything at all is exactly as it seems. </p>

<p>This might seem terrifying, ridiculous, or flat out insane at first, but it&#39;s only in this world of infinite possibilities that we are able to become conscious of the path towards the human evolutionary singularity propelling us towards all that is perfect, sacred, and/or undefined. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have every reason to not believe Trump is fighting the &quot;deep state.&quot;  </p>

<p>You have essentially zero credible reasons to believe that Trump is anything but an unqualified billionaire who accidentally won an election after his pride was too great to actually admit he didn&#39;t want the job.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s likely demented and runs solely on amphetamines which keep him awake well enough, but do nothing to enhance his cognitive ability.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re not being shit on because you have an opinion that is like any other controversial opinion. You&#39;re being shit on because you clearly lack any semblance of critical thinking and stupidly believe that a higher-up government official is leaking top secret information about the &quot;fight against the deep state&quot; on a popular public forum.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re being shit on because you&#39;re posing as an insider who at the very best is taking the bait from a disinformation campaign from the Whitehouse itself.  </p>

<p>Trump has turned on many of his largest campaign promises and has demonstrated nothing but a piss-poor attempt at not fucking up 85% of what he touches.  </p>

<p>I still prefer Trump over Clinton, but you&#39;re a fucking imbecile if you genuinely believe <em>after this much time</em> that Donald J Trump, a man who was known as being an asshole for his entire life, suddenly decided to spend the last few years of his life being a saint to save the western world.  </p>

<p>The fact that you think it&#39;s even an opinion that deserves any respect is infuriating. You think that you&#39;re rooting against the deep state while in reality you&#39;re cheering them on while they fuck you directly in the mouth.  </p>

<p>Your opinion is worthless. No one takes you seriously because <em>no one should</em>.</p>

<p>I hated Hillary more than I disliked Trump. I wouldn&#39;t go back and pick Hillary either.  </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t think that Trump is in bed with Russia or anything, just that he&#39;s most certainly not the savior of the West. He&#39;s an idiot who duped people into voting for him. He got in too deep and now has np idea what the Hell he&#39;s doing.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s dangerous. I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll destroy the world. But I sure as shit do think he&#39;s absolutely clueless and wants these next 3 years to go by quickly.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how the people who consistently shill for Trump are the ones who consistently call out anyone who causes the tiniest crack in their already-fragile foundation as being a &quot;leftist shill.&quot;  </p>

<p>Projection much?  </p>

<p>I want the government to leave me the Hell alone. Hillary wouldn&#39;t have allowed that and Trump was a gamble. Its clear that he&#39;s just as authoritarian as that murderous cunt now, but for some reason you want to cling to that feeling of an optimistic path because someone who is at <em>best</em> larping talked in code on 4chan.  </p>

<p>I didnt say all trump haters are leftist shills.</p>

<p>They are all either leftists ideologically, paid shariablue types, or brainwashed libs.</p>

<p>I say brainwashed because they swallowed, and regurgitate, the leftist media narratives nonstop, who keeps obligingly pumping them out at a furious pace.  Until that is understood and acknowledged, I would expect anyone to think trump is various degrees of bad, just as you described.</p>

<p>Your lack of respect for his accomplishments proves this.  I mean, he was, after all, a billionaire with a successful TV show and a global branding business he built over decades.  He beat - easily - a field of 17 primary candidates. And he beat an entrenched basically-coronated-already opponent in HRC, I  mean the media pimping was off the charts. And he even now withstands and FIGHTS BACK against daily media/Dem bullshit. With basically no help from congress or the judiciary (minimal help, anyway).</p>

<p>And for all that, you &quot;do think he&#39;s absolutely clueless &quot;?</p>

<p>What do you even base that on? Do you need a list of the accomplishments in 1 year? Stock market? ISIS? Tax cuts?  I could go on, Im not making these up. Only someone who is an unwitting victim of media mind control would possibly say, after all that, that Trump is &quot;clueless&quot;. That level of cognitive dissonance is actually revolting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know what, I&#39;ll actually concede to most of your point and apologize for how unnecessarily hostile I was being.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump hasn&#39;t done any good things and I actually do tend to give him credit where it&#39;s due. For something like the stock market, I rolled my eyes at the predictions that the stock markets would crash if Trump were elected. That being said, I don&#39;t know if everything was because of him or because he simply continued a trend we were already following.   </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t really surprised that he beat Clinton. I felt like I saw it coming from a mile away. I didn&#39;t vote for him because I was pretty weary about trusting him so I went third party, but I still prefer him to how I would&#39;ve felt with Clinton running the show.    </p>

<p>ISIS was great, I do give him credit for that, but I don&#39;t want boots on the ground in Syria. I want to stay the Hell out of it. I want to stop cozying up with the Saudis who are committing genocide with weapons that we supply them with. Destroying ISIS is fantastic, but that doesn&#39;t negate the military action that I&#39;m not excited about.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually very happy with the taxcuts right now, but I know that it&#39;s gonna end up biting us in the ass eventually. I want to cut spending and stop throwing ourselves further into debt, and until either party actually makes an attempt to do this I&#39;d rather enjoy my money on the journey to bankruptcy.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s specific to Trump. I just expect it from government, so I don&#39;t really get pissy over it anymore.     </p>

<p>Again I&#39;m sorry for those responses. I came down from my adderall and was in a particularly shitty mood before finally getting high a little bit ago. I do this shit every now and then and basically turn my brain off and let retarded shit flow out.  I don&#39;t actually think he&#39;s clueless, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s playing 4D upside down chess and there are a few things that concern me about him. I don&#39;t understand how there are people who think he is a mastermind in the same way that I don&#39;t understand how people think he&#39;s Hitler or racist or a Russian agent.  </p>

<p>no need to apologize, your negative comments on Trump are very common.  Its cool to see you see positives too.</p>

<p>I never try to convince anyone that Trump is some kind of messiah, but every time I make any positive comments the haters unleash with shit like &quot;he is a god to you, he can do no wrong&quot;, when actually I have disagreed with things he has said and done (and will in the future Im sure). Unfortunately for me, he has turned out to be right in the end so far.  I think he just has more information now than any of us do on any given issue.</p>

<p>One argument I never have a solid reply to is when someone doesnt actually care about policy and just hates on trump because he can be an obnoxious asshole.  I freely admit thats true. But I see that as a critically important quality to start fixing this country, no meek and mild slick talk could have done it and held up to the media/establishment onslaught.</p>

<p>Takes a big person to say sorry, Im really impressed. Again, not necessary, but shows character. I think one of the biggest hurdles when I try to get across to anyone that media is actually not news, its propaganda (which means its pushing an agenda) is that if they bought into trusting media long ago, like nearly all of us have, it takes humility to admit we were fooled and lied to all along.</p>

<p>Libs, especially those in academia, have a very tough time with that. They cannot FATHOM that they were fooled, their ego cant handle it.  I know because that happened to me.</p>

<p>You have solid viewpoints, well said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, and 100% accurate. My experience has been exactly the same as yours. It isnt your imagination.</p>

<p>Of course, we arent allowed to point this out, its against sub rules to call any individual a shill.  This doesnt change reality, and I have commented on it before. This sub, like many others, is literally controlled by a Trump hate mob that is most likely ShariaBlue.</p>

<p>That isnt good, bad, or indifferent.  We just need to accept it, expose that is the reality (and has been for a very long time, BTW), and if the oppression is too heavy to make participation a waste of time, just migrate elsewhere (as many have).</p>

<p>Its a shame, but remember, the Trump haters are always either hired guns, ideological leftists, or brainwashed Trump hate zombies.</p>

<p>The paid haters you cant reason with, the ideologues can be fun to debate, and the Trump Derangement Syndrome libs I actual have compassion for and often attempt to awaken from their media-constructed matrix.</p>

<p>It is what it is.  That Trump is actually a leader the likes of which we will never again see in our lifetimes is undeniable, and that he is attempting to singlehandedly Make America Great Again, beset on all sides by a revolting globalist left machine that has seeped into the entire world (including the US) over the last few decades, is fairly obvious to anyone who first realizes the media is public enemy #1. </p>

<p>Trump could be a puppet like anyone else, just slanted in a slightly different angle that might give some people the impression that he&#39;s something different. Maybe the old models and archetypes were getting stale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have observed of trump, he is desperately trying to save us while playing the role of the puppet as best he can. If we all liked and thought he was helping then the deep state would clamp its jaws down on him for contradicting their agenda. He has to help us covertly and in the shadows and try to do as much as he can to save us without alerting the deep-state that he’s doing so, if he gets too obvious with trying to save us, he will wind up like JFK or Abe Lincoln. He is doing a very delicate and risky dance. The real power is and always has been with us, we have to come together, stop fighting each other and reconnect to a true human nature. This is like game of thrones. We are all at war over stupid shit with each other while the white walkers get stronger and stronger. If we come together and care for each other and go after the white walkers we can save the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the point. <em>Everybody</em> who wants to talk about conspiracies belong here, as long as they follow the rules. I&#39;m not even American so don&#39;t give a shit about allegiance to any one of your political parties - but someone who is Democrat <strong>or</strong> Republican should still be allowed here. You shouldn&#39;t demand that they hate both - as if, if u dont, you&#39;re not a &quot;real&quot; conspiracy user. Fuck that bullshit - you don&#39;t get to decide that and neither does anybody else.</p>
