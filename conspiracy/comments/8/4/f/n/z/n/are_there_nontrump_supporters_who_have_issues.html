       I mean, there are Never-Trump Tories. There are Birthers. Birthers tend to have jumped on the Trump Train, indeed Trump himself was v sceptical of Obamas heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, one thing I've never seen, and I wonder if it exists, is the Non-Trump Supporting Birther.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , does such a mystical creature exist? What would make that person not support Trump (just regular Non-Trump Tory things?). Did they support Trump at first, but then grew disillusioned with him as he failed to act against Obama the man (and only tore down his presidency?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama's getting a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_Presidential_Center">
        Presidential Library
       </a>
       . Construction hasn't started yet, but completion date is in 2021 (how do they know that if construction hasn't started yet?). So perhaps if Trump disrupts his librarys construction he can win back the Birthers who left?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are all Birthers Trump supporters?

       You are aware of why it was faked, right? His whole family was

       <p>
        "Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen has discovered CIA files that document the agency's connections to institutions and individuals figuring prominently in the lives of Barack Obama and his mother, father, grandmother, and stepfather. The first part of his report highlights the connections between Barack Obama, Sr. and the CIA-sponsored operations in Kenya to counter rising Soviet and Chinese influence among student circles and, beyond, to create conditions obstructing the emergence of independent African leaders."

       Barack Obama worked for a known
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_International_Corporation#Barack_Obama">
        CIA front
       </a>
       . This whole thing is covering up a very dark past, including his family members overthrowing and helping to assassinate elected leaders across the world. The faked birth certificate is just the tip of the iceberg.

       I'm with you guys. I was even an Obama supporter when I was diet woke. It's pretty telling when they use Trump to push the birth certificate issue and then when independent forensic analysis is done to confirm forgery, nobody remembered that the birth certificate was even a point of contention.

       And, they think the record keeping in the 1960s was so solid that a forged birth certificate couldn't be rendered.

       Obama was and is an illegitimate President.  If you need a birth certificate for a passport you should have to show one to vote and to be voted for.  Period.

       I agree 100%, but at this point, what does it matter. This is a serious question, not being flippant. Would there even be repercussions? We the populace would demand it, but the gov does what it wants anyways. They’d drag their feet on what to do and how to do and who’s going to do the doing. We’ll get one big ‘oh well, he fooled us and here’s a big shit pie in the face to thank you’ reaction. They’ll blame Loretta Fuddy (spelling?) and she’s supposedly the only casualty from a soft water landing in Hawaii. Big gov will just reach deep in their bag of ‘fuckery to the public’ and blow right over our indignation.

       It can. Yes I said that. Maybe you missed my edit. It has to be done though. If it is just opened it won't be, one has to select the portions for the layers. It's on Adobe's FAQ page.

       First of all, why do you lump everyone into "Trump supporter" or "non-Trump supporter"? Most people here support Trump when he does the right thing and oppose him when he is wrong, because that's how all politicians should be approached.

       Barack Obama's birth certificate was subjected to two separate forensic investigations and both concluded it was
       <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/12/investigators-find-source-for-obamas-online-birth-certification-image/">
        fake
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "One of the experts who assisted in the investigation was Reed Hayes, a court-qualified handwriting and document examiner, who runs a business in Hawaii. He is on the board of the Scientific Association of Forensic Examiners and has been in business nearly 40 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Forlabs, an Italian company that specializes in extracting information from multimedia files, also produced the results.
       </p>
       <p>
        “We had two experts from two countries in separate disciplines of forensics that came to one conclusion: Barack Obama’s long form birth certificate is not authentic,” the report said."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The birth certificate is a fucking joke. One of the people that signed it is U K L Lee. Ukelele. Because Hawaii. That's how stupid they think you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you get all huffy about accusations of him being a Muslim (he's not), the reason for this cover-up was because Barack Obama's whole family was
       <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2010/09/wayne-madsen/the-story-of-obama-allinthecompany/">
        in the CIA
       </a>
       , mother, father, stepfather, and grandmother. Barack Obama worked for a known
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_International_Corporation#Barack_Obama">
        CIA front company
       </a>
       . He may well have been born outside the US, but it was because his family was off overthrowing democratically-elected governments, not because he's a Kenyan Muslim.

       I do.  The certificate released by the white house was obviously tampered with.

       Why?  Beats me.  I'm sceptical about Obama being a Kenyan, to say the least.  Given his ties to the CIA seems more likely that he's a CIA agent with a manufactured identity.

       Does it really matter anymore? He was president for eight years, bombed some countries, signed some propaganda and increased some surveillance should probably be focusing on that instead of birth certificate which was probably a conspiracy created to deter from the previously mentioned.
