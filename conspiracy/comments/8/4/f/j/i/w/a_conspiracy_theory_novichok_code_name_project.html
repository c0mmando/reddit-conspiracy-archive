        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As a conspiracy theorist I like to entertain the &quot;what if&quot; scenarios regarding major news stories rather than just accept as truth what I&#39;m being told by governments and media outlets.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m thinking about this latest event concerning the poisoning of former spy Sergei Viktorovich Skripal.</p>

<p>A quick search shows that he operated as a double agent for UK&#39;s intelligence services during the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve often wondered who were Christopher Steele&#39;s contacts regarding the &quot;Dossier&quot;. Coincidentally, Steele worked for MI6 from 1987 to 2009.</p>

<p>From 1990 to 1993, Steele worked under diplomatic cover as an MI6 agent in Moscow, serving at the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Moscow.[</p>

<p>This makes it within the realm of possibilities that Steele and Skripal had a working relationship. </p>

<p>First logical questions - </p>

<p>Why would Russia wait 15 years to assassinate Skripal? </p>

<p>Why do it at a time when western powers are doing everything they can to demonize Russia/Putin knowing full well that anything suspicious that could even remotely be connected to them, would be?</p>

<p>Why use such a &quot;signature method&quot; of poisoning, one that was going to be traced specifically, almost categorically back to Russia?</p>

<p>When you look at it this way, it makes almost no sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>Also suspicious is the reaction from the UK government to immediately publicly accuse Russia of being guilty without providing absolute proof. Instead they rely on the claim that the Novichok agent could &quot;only have come from Russia&quot;...how convenient. Too convenient.</p>

<p>Apparently, the man who first made the global community aware of the Novichok agents also wrote an autobiography in which he states how easy it is to obtain the chemicals necessary to create the &quot;less deadly&quot; variants of the Novichok series.</p>

<p>Also released in the book are some of the more simplistic chemical equations of the nerve agent, as seen on the Wikipedia page about it: </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent#Description_of_Novichok_agents">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent#Description_of_Novichok_agents</a></p>

<p>Mirzayanov, Vil S. (2008), State Secrets: An Insider&#39;s Chronicle of the Russian Chemical Weapons Program, Outskirts Press</p>

<p>I notice the major news outlets aren&#39;t bringing this to our attention. Which is one of the reasons I&#39;m writing this post.</p>

<p>Now, recently we&#39;ve had a big story about a missing CDC worker that has piqued the interest of many of us on this sub. Some will be quick to say &quot;But he specialized in viruses like Ebola and Zika&quot;...which is true. But I&#39;ve stated before that it&#39;s his knowledge of lab equipment and chemistry that concerned me more than anything else.</p>

<p>And according to Mirzayanov, the &quot;expert&quot; that everyone is sourcing, the technical abilities required to create the Novichok nerve agent are not extremely difficult. I&#39;m presuming Timothy Cunningham the missing CDC worker probably has/had the technical abilities.</p>

<p>So, is it possible that Skripal was one of Steele&#39;s informants used in the creation of the dossier? Is it possible that certain people were concerned that Skripal was going to reveal certain things about the dossier that were going to damage it&#39;s credibility? Yes, it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>Is it possible that he was going to reveal things about the dossier that would enhance it&#39;s credibility? Yes, it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>Is it possible that a certain US intelligence agency that specializes in covert operations contracted Timothy Cunningham to produce a variant of the Novichok nerve agent to use as a means of not only assassinating Skripal to prevent him from revealing what he knew..(this includes forces acting on behalf of Trump as well as those acting against him) but to also further demonize Russia and specifically Putin as their election draws near?</p>

<p>Yes...all of these scenarios fall within the realm of possibilities.</p>

<p>And what if somehow we found out that this whole Skripal poisoning was a combined effort of US and UK intelligence agencies?</p>

<p>What would their reaction be? Wouldn&#39;t they justify it as a  necessary reciprocal action brought on by the fact that Russia/Putin meddled in the 2016 election? That because Putin has demonstrated that he has no regard for the sanctity of the US democratic process that any and all means of removing him from power are now acceptable?</p>

<p>Yeah, I could see them doing that.</p>

<p>Anyways, that my conspiracy theory for the day. Peace out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly this seems like what happened to me. More or less. Maybe the spy wasn&#39;t even dangerous though, they just needed someone who Russia could conceivably kill for some reason.</p>

<p>The way the british/world news instantly knew it was Russia and could only be Russia was laughable. They may as well have found a note that said &quot;Дeath to traitors -from Яussia w/love&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very possible. The reaction from the UK was the ringer for me. I could see if they had definitive proof, but they don&#39;t.  </p>

<p>So do you think the CDC worker was kidnapped or contracted? I say kidnapped because the window left open at his house. According to his parents, that was not normal. Were his prior text messages to friends/family ever revealed?  Not sure if he was involved or not, but it is a very odd case.</p>

<p>Regardless, I think this has way more to do with increasing the heat on Russia. Between this story, the Russiagate narrative and the increased tensions in Syria, it really seems they want to have a showdown. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judging by the latest actions of UK, we have now officially entered another cold war with Russia.</p>

<p>23 diplomats expelled and assets frozen...</p>

<p>What a fucking joke. They always manage to find a way to justify increased spending on military and intelligence agencies...every fucking time.</p>

<p>Just over a year ago it looked like a healthier relationship with Russia would be possible...thereby reducing the military defense budget. Now it&#39;s gone. The fact is, they were never going to let it happen.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a fucking scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My pet theory that I&#39;m just fleshing out, and here is as good a place to post it as any....</p>

<p>Russia sold a bunch of their novichok toxins for a bit of extra cash in the 90s or later. We all do silly stuff for money.  One customer was North Korea. They maybe even helped with some nuclear development, but that&#39;s another story. </p>

<p>So, over the past year or so, for some reason NK and Russia have fallen out.  Maybe Russia has been a little too demanding, maybe Russia was creeping towards dumping Korea cos of the nuke tests, maybe Russia double crossed Korea in an attempt to have some sanctions lifted. Maybe something to do with killing Kim&#39;s little brother? Who knows.  Something. But, it was enough to push Kim towards asking for a meeting with Trump. The devil USA! It must have been known that friendship would upset Putin. It must have been on purpose. That was the plan. </p>

<p>So, how else to piss off Putin? Simples, drive divisions between him and everyone else. Make an obvious hit job, with Russian fingerprints all over it. Make it so obvious, everyone will suspect Russia. Use the stuff he sold you ten+ years before. Kill an opponent of his. Shit, NK have form, the means and, possibly now, the motive.  </p>

<p>Now, Russia can&#39;t admit they sold chemicals to NK. Maybe they sold to other people as well, so they can&#39;t even be sure who actually did it without testing the stuff. They also won&#39;t admit to doing the deed. The UK won&#39;t let them test the chemicals.</p>

<p>Meanwhike, the UK take the opportunity to flex their muscles, and follow the anti-Russia slant from over the past year or so. Brownie points for Maybot and the gov. </p>

<p>Kim gets to be pally with SK and USA for a while. Maybe it&#39;ll work out, who knows. No one would want to accuse them of this, not at this stage when progress is being made on peace. ..</p>

<p>Look for the motive in the coming months. Look for Russian influence, or the lack of it, in the trump-kim meetings. Russia wants desperately to have a say in how Korea develops over the next few months and years. Why don&#39;t they have it? </p>

<p>I&#39;m probably going to need some further thinking on this, but right now this is what I&#39;ve got. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually some of the variants chemical equations were published in the Mirzayanov autobiography in 2008.</p>

<p>The facilities needed to do it are the same as a fair sized pesticide manufacturing plant.</p>

<p>The nerve agent is a binary formula. The two ingredients are fairly benign and stable by themselves.</p>

<p>It only gets risky during the mixing stage...at the target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I legit only came too this subreddit looking for this thread.</p>

<p>All around people are so convinced it was Russia. But all I can think of is why.</p>

<p>Why now? With the elections, tension in Syria with US and Russian forces fighting with different sides, hosting the world cup in a few months.</p>

<p>Why the nerve agent? Why use something that literally has your name on it, instead of using another way. Literally, shooting the guy in the face would be less obvious that it was Russia&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>Why not co-operate with Russia when they ask for a sample of the nerve agent found? They could find some means where scientist from both sides could meet and do their science stuff to come too a conclusion. Although the russians could just bring another nerve agent. But refusing all together and just demand answers is weird. The Russians have denied and asked for a sample, they get &quot;Hell no, explain!&quot;... wut?</p>

<p>I am not 100% convinced it was Russia, it could just as well be that the main narritive is true. But I feel like people aren&#39;t really thinking. </p>

<p>If it is true, then I am worried because they just might be stupid enough too fire a bunch of nukes into EU.</p>

<p>If it is false, then I hope that will come too light, and all this will be over. Otherwise, nukes.</p>

<p>P.S: this could all just be about oil again with Russia/Syria winning, that means that the Iraq/Iran pipeline will go through, not the Saudi one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One theory, Netanyahu met with Trump last week on the 5th with intelligence on active  Russian double agents within the UK that uncovered that Israel had been the key state that Kushner  reached out to during the election meddling. So mossad handled the putting key players like manafort with his connections could have russians set up the bot farms and social network engineering. Then put all key players in to implicate the Russian&#39;s as key players and fair enough they were the ones who got there hands dirty.
Fast forward, Israel is awarded embassy move to Jerusalem for nothing, Kushner&#39;s family foundation has given a unknown amount of money to Israeli settlements and who knows what else, Kushners business was given a 30 million dollar loan while in office from an Israeli bank. Just ticking off some boxes.
Russia has already been implicated they let mossad know of the new intelligence leaked by the double agents, Netanyahu tells Trump he needs help back in Israel with his court cases  and mossad will handle this damaging information about Trump. Mossad probably recovered the nerve agent in syria.</p>
