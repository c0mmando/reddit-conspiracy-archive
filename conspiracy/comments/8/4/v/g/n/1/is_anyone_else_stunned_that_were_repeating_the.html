      <p>
       I wasn't around for Vietnam (it's
       <em>
        insane
       </em>
       to me that they got away with that unfathomably stupid war), but I vividly recall during the build up to the Iraq war that questioning that decision was akin to "not supporting the troops."
      </p>
      <p>
       This logical fallacy may seem obvious now, but at the time it felt like 9/11 and the subsequent propaganda narrative suspended all rational thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Obama's election, I soon realized that these narratives were being created by and for the pathetic world of partisan hackery. Because of these MSM-pushed narratives, by questioning the Iraq War I was labelled as a "crazy leftist" and by questioning Obama's drone wars and insane actions in Libya somehow made me a "crazy right winger."
      </p>
      <p>
       The similarities between Bush and Obama were so striking that it proved to be a massive wake up call for many with respect to how both major parties are bought and paid for by the military industrial complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now we get to Russiagate. I remember as a kid learning about the Red Scare/Cold War and simply marveling at how an entire generation could be raised in fear. That generation is still "in control" and this fear-based mindset has shaped the world's foreign policies for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       With 9/11, they're trying again, this time raising a generation with "Fear 2.0."
      </p>
      <p>
       However, technology/the internet is responsible for waking up a significant portion of the younger generations, so now they've set their sites on the internet itself by lumping it, in its entirety, with their "fake news" xenophobic memes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Russia a thuggish mafia state that executes dissidents? Probably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are politicians/elites all connected to each other via shady business/criminal dealings that span generations? Almost certainly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this mean we should allow ourselves to be whipped into a frenzy enough to embrace a global conflict, especially at the prodding of the same institutions that have blatantly lied to us before, at the cost of
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       human suffering?
      </p>
      <p>
       I say: Absolutely not.

       Wouldn't it be an interesting turn if some 'new evidence' comes to light that 'Iran is capable of generating Russia's VX nerve agent' or something. Not specifically blaming Iran for the attack in the UK, but using it as a tangent to say Iran has chemical weapons.

       Remember back to the first Gulf War in the early 90s? They were hyping up the size of the Iraq army for months - and the elite Republican Guard. It was over pretty quickly. I'm sure Iran would go the same way and probably with less US casualties with the amount of unmanned and aircraft attacks. We're basically the Empire from Star Wars.

       It won't be with Iran.  It can't be invaded without an escalation bigger than Vietnam and it can't be attacked with airstrikes without hostages being taken or a retaliation that would require a remedy bigger than Vietnam.  The horse has fled the barn on that one.

       If you pay attention to Trump's administration's rhetoric, they have always been heavily against Iran, starting with when Flynn was saying that "Iran is on notice".
      </p>

       I suspect that Trump will end the Iran nuclear deal, and the extremists in America and the extremists in Iran, will call for war against each other afterwards.

       The most ominous thing about the Donald Trump campaign -- lost in all that Evil Hillary Neocon Warmongerer -- was the fact that Donald Trump wanted to break the Iran deal. This is straight out of the George W. Bush agenda -- the unfinished agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on this fact alone, I never bought into the "Donald Trump wants peace" belief being sold.

       I don't think it's stupid question at all. And to be honest, I have no idea myself. I just have a surface level of knowledge when it comes to this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, from my limited knowledge, I think one of the reasons they say they want to go to war with Iran is because they say that Iran is big state funder of terrorism around the world. I think some of that is true, but I don't know to what extent.

       It always comes down to resources we can plunder or economic competitors we can decimate. In the case of Iran, I assume it's about regional control of resources (oil). It's never
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       about terrorism. If it was, Saudi Arabia would have been in our crosshairs a long time ago. They transparently fund terrorism, whereas Iran's connections have always been murky and subject to the biases of the storyteller.

       Since when does the USA go into a conflict in a rational way?  The Iraq war was both unnecessary and began with false evidence.  They've wanted Iran destroyed for decades.  Since when do they care about soldiers deaths?  Remember when Bush hid the soldiers bodies coming home from Iraq, so it wouldn't upset the public and potentially their war of aggression?

       The next great war will take place in the EU following the economic collapse that will inevitably take place there.  The dwindling native  population of several countries in the area have created a massive imbalance between tax payers and those consuming social services.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UN's plan to bring in new blood and to transform these immigrants and their children into law-abiding tax paying citizens has been met with resistance and unanticipated costs that substantially dwarf those estimated.   These challenges will ultimately prevent these failing states from saving themselves economically.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an effort to survive, half of the continent will push for a stronger EU with more centralized totalitarian economic control over its states and half of the countries will seek independence.  As the survival of each of these countries will depend on the outcome, no amiable resolution will be available to parties.  The continent will collapse into a violent civil war as millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States will send "peace keeping" troops to the continent and station a massive amount of troops in the UK.  China's economy will be strengthened.   China will desire to continue trading with anyone they wish while the US will attempt to stop all trade between the half of Europe supporting the EU and the rest of the world.  This will escalate a trade war between China and the US and it will appear in the media as though China and the US are dangerously close to war, though both countries will avoid direct military conflict with one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US will ultimately spend trillions of dollars, once again, cleaning up after those who fail to learn from history and continue to pursue socialist and communist policies.

       I think he's referring to the issues you get with an aging population and pensions. Australia (where I live) has identified this as a key problem we're going to face going forward.
      </p>

       The problem boils down to "We used to retire at 65 and live till 80, now we retire at 65 and live to 90". That means you need a larger tax-base to pay for it (which is where the ponzi scheme portion comes in), or you need to cut pensions. Pensions is political suicide, so you go the other way. Young people have fewer children (for professional reasons, wider availability of contraceptives, whatever), so you need to augment population growth with immigration.

       <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/populationpuzzle/">
        This
       </a>
       is an old-ish documentary on the subject (the whole lot is on youtube, but it's kind of useless - it mostly asks questions then abruptly ends).
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW I don't think this is a ponzi scheme, and that governments will find other ways to adjust (potentially with a sensible immigration policy involved), but that is a popular-ish mode of thinking.

       Not really. Germany has been driving a lot of the EU economic power these days, and because of this they have a lot of political power. Makes sense this is what Nazi Germany planned for... They funneled out gold and over $500m of it was never recovered. Many believe this money was used both to bolster industrial Germany after the war and also to start the European Economic Commission (which would later become the EU and whose first president was one of the Nazi party's top economists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazi party actions regarding this theory that are provable were specifically to make sure that if the region fell apart again, Germany's industry and banks would remain strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for whether or not there's a Nazi conspiracy mixed up in there, it doesn't matter. The facts are that the money went missing and the EEC (and its modern form, the EU) was actually part of the Nazi party's defeat plan.

       Just for the record...
      </p>
      <p>
       the critical financial difficulties the EU is now having and any economic collapse if it comes will be as the direct result of Wall Street having trading worthless sub-prime mortgage derivatives into the European banking system as valuable assets that those banks then proceeded to issue all kinds of loans with those assets to back them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loans that were also and actually worthless as a result with no way to legally resolve that in keeping with the good faith that those loans were issued.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the true nature of those toxic assets that nobody could possibly collect on and the loans that had been issued off the back of them finally came to light Europe quite literally lost half of it's value on paper overnight and has been forced to struggle with the reality of that ever since. That is also what has placed Italy, Greece, Spain, and Portugal in such dire straits with not much in the way of any real help for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the US government deliberately allowed those sub-prime mortgages to be issued, knowing that the vast majority of them could only fall into default and Wall St. to knowingly bundle them up into worthless derivatives and trade them into the European banking system without any criminal charges or penalties ever being brought against those responsible for committing that enormous and outrageous financial fraud, only proves that the US government fully intended and wanted to collapse the Euro and show the European nations who their real boss happens to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you can't raise the value of your own currency in competition against one that is steadily growing stronger and more desirable than your own on the world market then the only alternative is to find some means to weaken and devalue theirs and sabotage the economy that gave it that strength at the same time, and as illegal and reprehensible as that was, it was precisely what the US government did.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also intended to intimidate and keep the European nations in line with US ambitions in Europe and beyond
       <em>
        if they know what's good for them
       </em>
       and to firm-up their support for the US run protection racket that's called NATO without any further complaints or foot dragging.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I look around all I see are a long series of messes and human degradation that the US has deliberately created by surreptitiously intervening in the political affairs of other nations in order to put compliant puppet regimes and even ruthless dictators on the US payroll to run them in order to have them sign over over their nation's resources and their own people into indentured servitude to major US corporations that will move in and fully exploit them and those resources for a mere fraction of their real worth and pocket the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that doesn't work then a military incursion whose main purpose is to utterly destroy those countries infrastructure and bring them to their knees is the next step. Once that's done whoever is left in charge will have no choice but to sign over their most valuable resources or assets to major US corporations out of sheer desperation and for a mere pittance and a promise that some help will eventually be forthcoming if they co-operate with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple fact of the matter is that the US is automatically at war with any country that attempts to pursue any form of socialist or egalitarian economic policies from the very moment any of them make a move in that direction, whether it's democratically arrived at and the wish of the majority of their people or not and they will go on the US hit list or simply on it's shit list depending on how serious the US happens to view any of those moves.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's because the possibility of them succeeding and encouraging any others to follow suit has to be contained and snuffed-out by any and all means and no means are out of bounds or off limits no matter how reprehensible they are or what any of the human consequences those actions will have on any of the citizens of those nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the degree of difficulty in having any succeed with all the political, economic and military power US pits against and constantly undermines them with, needs to be seen for what it is when it comes to how and why any actually fail and fall from grace from honest and hopeful beginnings, and it is rarely through any fault of their own, nor any real surprise when they do given the role that always plays in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't ever kid yourself about the US always being the "good guys" and saviors of the world, it's never been more than a phoney Hollywood myth that no one on the planet except ordinary Americans have been cajoled and inculcated to believe.

       They're an admin-condoned harassment sub, they refer to the people they mock and harass as "Top Minds", a satire to reflect that the people they make fun of supposedly think they've got everything figured out while discussing that which is not part of a specific set of accepted group think, the accepted group think being typically aligned with MSM and Shareblue narrative. They regularly brigade threads of anyone who delves to entertain discussion of ideas outside of the bubble of right-think.

       That's half the point, they've created a narrative that in a sense relies on itself in order to be palatable. You have to actually ignore what AP is saying and enter the conversation "knowing" he is pushing Russian/alt-right/pro-Trump propaganda even though you would be completely off base on all three accounts. It's literally embedded in the tactical nature of their subversive actions to act deceptive in this manner.

       While I agree Putin and Trump are corrupt and Russia probably meddled in the election which I’m guessing it has always done... but doesn’t this global escalation seem manufactured to you? It literally is Cold War 2.0 because there needs to be a bad guy for the gov to deflect to (R and D) and people are over being afraid of terrorism.

       Since top minds has linked to this thread, surely you will put it in contest mode, or delete the thread entirely. I see this done at the drop of a hat if the submission is wrongthink. But if it's favourable to the narrative you wanna push, for some reason, it always

       You missed my point. I don't see anyone getting unhinged or hysterical and demanding war.  However, there are a lot of people outraged at the idea that Putin is to blame for this poisoning, and in some cases, any wrongdoing at all ever.

       They voted for bush twice. Bush. The guy who blatantly lied to get us into the undisputed biggest foreign policy fuck up since Iraq. And they said "ya, let's give this draft dodging cowboy another shot. 'Least he's not libtard!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And now they pretend they hated him all along. Trump supporters all act like they despise Bush. You all (9/10) voted for Bush! You don't get to point fingers at anyone but yourselves.

       After browsing his history it does seem to fair to say that he isn't an ardent Trump supporter, but he does seem rather protective of Russia, such as when he tried defending Russia annexing parts of Ukraine:

       Two points.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) This was in response to the violent revolutions and neo-nazi militias funded by Western NGOs. This is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Crimea actually voted to join them.
       <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/02/11/how-crimeans-see-ukraine-crisis/">
        This is backed by various independent polls.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A Pew poll from April 2014 revealed that 91 percent of Crimean respondents believed the referendum was free and fair, 93 percent had confidence in Putin, and 85 percent believed Kiev should recognize the results.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another poll in June 2014, this one from Gallup, showed 94 percent of ethnic Russians in Crimea thought the referendum reflected the views of the people and 68 percent of ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea agreed. The poll found that 74 percent believed that joining Russia would make life better.
       </p>
       <p>
        A GfK poll from February 2015, sponsored by a pro-Ukrainian group in Canada, revealed 93 percent of Crimeans endorsed the referendum.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Crimean Tatars, an ethnic minority comprising approximately 12 percent of the population, is divided on reunification. Surveys reflecting the view of Crimean Tatars specifically, or which break down opinion by ethnicity to include the Tatars, are difficult to find. Russian media has reported that 30 percent of Crimean Tatars voted in favor of reunification but it is unclear where this figure originates from.
       </p>
       <p>
        One survey conducted jointly by Open Democracy and the Levada Center, published in March of 2015, did include Tatar opinion. Their results revealed that 50 percent of Crimean Tatars supported the referendum (30 percent generally and 20 percent absolutely) while 30 percent opposed it and 20 percent did not express support or opposition.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So again, OP isnt incorrect in this regard. I'm really tired of people spouting the invasions as talking points because the
       <strong>
        West is the aggressor in all of these situations.
       </strong>
       This constant black-white rhetoric which ignores all context and relevant facts (from both sides, East and West) is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       getting tiring.

       As a guy that knows someone personally who is from Ukraine, this is absolute bullshit propaganda.  I suppose next you're going to make it clear to us that while missile that shot down MH17 and killed 280 people was in fact Russian technology that Ukraine did not posess, it wasn't Russia, but those damned Ukrainian separatists that shot it down!  Or like, the CIA or something right?

       My guess is it's because equating this whole Russia mess to the Iraq war and Obama's actions in Libya is kind of a stretch. The first two scenarios were military campaigns as usual pushed by each administration and Trump's Russia is something totally being 100% denied by the current administration. Kind of makes no sense to equate them all. Especially since we aren't yet at war with Russia.

       If Mueller comes back and says nothing happened, will you agree with his findings, or accept? If he comes back and says Trump colluded, but no actual crime was committed, and so there will be no prosecution..   will you agree, or accept? If he comes back and says, we found a ton of criminal activities amongst hundreds of people... and a few of those people are very very vip , would you agree, or accept? At what point do you not accept the "conclusion"? Is Mueller all knowing?

       to respond to your post honestly, I truly believe trump did something wrong. But, I trust the Mueller investigation. If he finishes, and has the indictment and charges against manafort, flynn, maybe some other high ranking officials, but says we just could not find anything against trump, I will be extremely skeptical, but I would take it for his word. It doesn't mean I would agree with trumps policies or cabinet picks any more, but i would buy that instead of being bought and paid for by Russia, he just really seems to like maniacal authoritarians like duterte and xi

       It's honestly annoying. I don't care about Russia, every report I've seen pointing fingers at Russia is absolute bullshit. 
I like Russia, RT is one of the last news stations that can put an unbiased headline out while the story is developing. Our news stations are too afraid to do that. They need to find their angle and will wait.
I have Russian friends that are normal, wonderful people. 
So why the fuck are we against Russia!? 
Most likely because Hillary lost the election and no one can fucking handle it still so it must be a bogey man

       We've destabilized the entire Middle East causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, if not millions, and created millions of refugees and you think that's cool because we didn't 'annex' any of them?
      </p>
      <p>
       And it wasn't all of Ukraine...Crimea is historically part of Russia and the site of a Russian base. What if another country came into Cuba and decided to kick us out of Guantanamo? We have hundreds of military bases all over the world, and if any one of them was threatened to be reintegrated into their home country we would retaliate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Russia is some pinnacle of virtue, but I'll argue all day long that they have nothing on us as far as crimes against humanity. We are not the good guys and we haven't been for a long time. We create conflict for profit and to justify our massive military budget. We torture, assassinate, imprison without trial, drone bomb innocents, overthrow countries and basically leave a swathe of chaos and misery everywhere we touch. Name one country that's better off since we came to 'help' them.  In the meantime our own country is crumbling around us. We slip further and further down the ranks as far as infrastructure, education, medical care, but God forbid we could go a fucking year without being involved in a half a dozen different conflicts around the globe, spreading our version of 'peace and democracy' whether they like it or not and spending trillions in the process.  And Putin is the bad guy? Take a look at your own fucking country and the war crimes of every single one of the last six presidents.

       RT has been protected by Putin at all costs. Why do you think? Because it shows what he wants shown and what narrative he wants pushed. That has been the case for years, if not close to a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this has nothing to do with the Russian people. Why would you even say that? My Russian friends all know that Putin did the attack. They will say, no, he didn't do that(with a smile).

       Not brigading, and didn’t down vote, but this is the 5th or 6th ‘Russia Defense’ post I’ve seen on here in the last 24hrs (especially if you browse by new). It’s tiresome, so I’m not surprised there are some downvotes, and less surprised it’s not being as upvoted as you’d like.

       Stating that America's attacks via the media towards another country are baseless and part of a narrative in no way defends said country. Maybe some are less minded and would tend to rely on a stretch of logic as such to judge a person or the content they are posting but I would hope that viewers of this sub were above that.

       I put ‘Russia Defense’ in quotes for a reason. It is a generalization based on the recent influx of these type of posts, and there are others that are certainly more defensive of Russia than this one. The point of my comment wasn’t a critique of this post, or any post really, more that the whining about downvotes as proof of brigading may not be the definitive proof some think it is. Sometimes there are other factors like over-saturation, etc that affect how a post is voted on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it’s weird to me that Russian Government and Russian Media aren’t held as accountable, by a vocal minority on this sub, as American Government and American Media are, frankly neither should get the benefit of the doubt.

       Take a look at the empty comments that litter this thread which do nothing but misrepresent OP's posts. It literally happens in every Russia thread. You get hoards of users defending the MSM narrative with no critical thinking in sight.

       OP posts so many threads about Russia many are responding to that rather than this specific post. That is unfortunate. However considering one of the biggest MSM networks, FOX, is trying to discredit anything related to the Russia Investigation it gets pretty tiresome seeing people say that if I believe Russia acted improperly that I’m following the ‘MSM Narrative’. I do believe that Russia interferes in our elections, possibly used influence to change GOP platforms, and continues to use kompromat to avoid sanctions from the US government. That’s just as much a valid theory, especially in this forum, whether CNN talks about it or not. It’s not my fault the conspiracy I believe is perpetrated by idiots and has come to light more than other conspiracies.

        However considering one of the biggest MSM networks, FOX, is trying to discredit anything related to the Russia Investigation it gets pretty tiresome seeing people say that if I believe Russia acted improperly that I’m following the ‘MSM Narrative’.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because FOX says it isn't true, it is? That's as bad as saying anything the MSM puts out is false. And it's not just FOX. Respected journalists, commentators, and whistle-blowers have called this investigation a sham. This includes Chomsky, Greenwald, Sibel Edmonds, Robert Parry, etc. Yeah, Russians try to interfere, as does every country, but there is still absolutely no evidence they had any meaningful impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean Trump and co. are not laundering money and are overall financially compromised; they most certainly are. The investigators themselves are guilty of the same crimes, and the Special Prosecutor is a giant piece of shit who has covered for the Deep State's crimes (9/11, illegal FBI searches, IRA scandal, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       And these new sanctions do nothing but hurt Europe, since they are dependent on Russian oil and gas.
       <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/unintended-consequences-us-sanctions/230503/">
        These sanctions would force them to rely on the more expensive American oil/gas.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Already, Europe is panicking over the idea that countries like Germany might have to purchase expensive American Liquefied Natural Gas which then has to be painstakingly shipped to Europe rather than the cheap and comparatively local alternative of Russian pipeline gas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russia could, therefore, tempt Europe with the carrot of cheap energy and goods while combining it with the stick of demanding Europe drop its own sanctions against Russia, most of which date back to 2014. Russia already has sympathetic ears in southern Europe on this matter and Germany may well be moving in this direction due to America’s blatant disregard for northern European concerns.
       </p>

       So while the story has
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       validity, it is nothing but a distraction to the actual factions which dominate our electoral system and government, such as the Council on Foreign Relations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same MSM shitting themselves about Russia has
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       talked about the CFR's influence. Do you not find that insane?

      <p>
       Well that's blatantly false, since there are many, many conspiracies with far more evidence than Manchurian Candidate/Russian Hacking/Meddling/Collusion/Whatever the new term is as goalposts move, e.g false flags (Operation Gladio), the White Helmets being a propaganda construct, the New World Order, Operation Mockingbird, MK Ultra, elite pedophile rings, and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do feel your pain, many conspiracies get discredited because vocal idiots do an awful job of representing them.

       Not sure if you intentionally missed the point but I’m not claiming the Russia Conspiracy has the most evidence of all of the conspiracies ever, I’m saying that this administrations incompetence has made this conspiracy much easier to report on because they get caught lying almost daily. That the conspiracy is sloppy and therefore reported on more than say 9/11 by the MSM shouldn’t be held against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also never even remotely said I believe it because FOX said it was false. I just wonder why the ‘MSM narrative’ is used to discredit what I believe when one of the biggest MSM networks is pushing the opposite ‘narrative’.

       Problem is, there has already been quite a few headlines that have been redacted silently. This is the definition of manufacturing consent. If you recall, they did the exact same thing during the Libyan War - they plastered Gadaffi "rape squads" all over the front pages, then quietly retracted it once people realized it was a blatant lie. This is just an example out of many, of course.

      <p>
       That's a fair question. If you read articles from those who are openly critical of this Russiagate nonsense - Greenwald and Edmonds as examples - they don't discredit it because the MSM is pushing it. They do so because the narrative of "collusion" is based on very flimsy evidence pushed by extremely untrustworthy sources, and the investigation itself is headed by corrupt individuals (Mueller has covered for 9/11, IRA scandals, illegal FBI searches, etc.). That, and blatant propaganda sites like Hamilton 68 (created by Neocon thinktanks and spooks) are being pushed by these MSM outlets as more "proof" of "meddling." This should alarm you greatly.

       I can appreciate the nuance Greenwald brings to his arguments, and while I’m not as distrustful of Mueller in this instance, those are fair criticisms of him. I would disagree the evidence for (at the least attempted) collusion is flimsy, but that is a fair argument to have as well. I personally don’t think anyone from Russia ever colluded with Trump personally, but I do think members of his campaign were approached and in some cases reached out to Russian intermediaries for help on dirt on Clinton and Trump was aware of it. And I think he knows there are financial crimes in his past involving Russian money and feels it is in his best interest to try to keep the Russian sanctions from hurting his business there.

       Edit. Thanks for the discussion and opportunity to clarify my points in a cordial manner. My response was pretty defensive and I appreciate you looking past that to clarify your stance.

       My point is that Trey Gowdy was the only house republican to see all of the underlying evidence, and once he did, he changed his tune real quick, and is now saying very publicly that Russia did try to interfere with our election in order to help Trump.

        Russian police have reportedly arrested a man who has claimed to be a worker at a so-called troll factory in St. Petersburg, Russia, hours after he gave interviews to foreign journalists and lifted the lid on a secretive organization the U.S. Department of Justice last week accused of trying to undermine the 2016 presidential election.

       Kind of agree here. Given all the rhetoric, the current administration is  itching for conflict with NK or Iran. Also, there is no way you can have any conflict with Russia except the a la cold war. The toned down version is what your sanctions get.

       I don't give a shit about what you believe either. There's so much smoke that there is no doubt about a fire, be it from the meeting between Jr. and the Russian lawyer (which Jr. himself was told was organized as an effort by the Russian government yet he still attended) to the troll factories that were utilizing propaganda to help trump and hurt hillary, to the shady connection between Trump and Russian mobsters (living in his building), to an attempted Trump towers in Moscow, and more.
      </p>

       It's funny how people here are willing to build up so many theories over one tiny little irregularity, yet this obvious massive conspiracy of a foreign government influencing the US election is just brushed over.

       I was around for Iraq. I thought the Iraq war was unjustified and the reasoning bogus. I don't believe there will be a war with a Russia nor would I support it. Russia did interfere with the election. The Trump​ ​Administration's many connections to Russians are fishy as fuck. These are the reality. Anyone who call it a "red scare" is directly spreading Russian propaganda whether they do it purposely or not.

       Hahaha, right. That's why you start with a dishonest question. As if anyone who has followed the news on this story didn't know how Russia has interfered with the election. If you want to dispute the evidence and claims presented by Mueller's indictment of those 13 Russians and the IRA and numerous other evidence and claims presented by the Intelligence Community's reports and media's, go right ahead, but don't come here trolling me with a stupid question and deny you are a troll lol.

       Just from the absolute most basic start, before any actual election voting happened, Russia was found to have hacked the DNC.  They then released contextless emails in a manner designed to disrupt the US election cycle, specifically attempting to make the Democrats look bad, which DIRECTLY helps Trump.  This has been admitted by literally every major player in this, Republicans, Democrats, Trump, Obama, you fucking name it, they have admitted it, and it's interference.

       I don't even have to get into any nebulous "facebook ads" shit that you're so salivating at, this is concrete meddling and you absolutely can't deny it or you're a troll, plain and simple.

       First, not a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the claim that the contents of the DNC server were LEAKED, not hacked, is spurious at best. The MSM doesn't seem to want to talk about this, but here you go.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/a-new-report-raises-big-questions-about-last-years-dnc-hack/">
        Many very legitimate people
       </a>
       in the
       <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/07/24/intel-vets-challenge-russia-hack-evidence/">
        intelligence community
       </a>
       have spoken about the evidence proving this. The download time recorded was way, way too fast to have been anything other than a physical drive download on the premises. Inside job. The DNC wouldn't even allow the FBI to examine the servers. What does that tell you about the veracity of their claim that it was hacked by Russian state actors?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks released the emails. They have repeatedly stated that the source was not a Russian, and in fact have hinted multiple times that it was a whistleblower from within the DNC themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another note, the US intereferes with every single election on the globe in one way or another. Russia didn't cause Hillary to lose. She lost because she was a deeply unpopular candidate who completely underestimated the other deeply unpopular candidate. There are a lot of reasons why she lost. But Russia 'interfering' is not one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia did not hack the DNC. Look beyond the MSM for your information, my friend.

       Haha, why not feed the troll? Because that's what the troll wants. An honest person would have acknowledged what's been covered and discussed extensively instead of pretending to be ignorant to derail the discussion. He know what's been put out there about Russia's interference in the election. If anyone want to dispute that, then start from there, don't pretend like that's all new and needs to be explained again.

       It still isn't clear to me why Julian Assange would be involved in hurting Clinton during the election. Not that Clinton was a great candidate, but why against Clinton and not both Parties. I don't quite understand why Assange seemingly wanted to help Trump win - I know he has stated that this wasn't his intention, but I don't really buy it at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the Wikileaks leaks were from institutions that the Republican party historically is more connected to/has more interest in, like the US military, financial institutions, surveillance programs created under GWB, etc. so it's not clear from Assange's history that he has a Republican bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any ideas?

       Because Democrats didn't pardon him like he thought they would and he wanted revenge, he was positive Democrats were as shitty partisan hacks as Republicans and as soon as Obama got in power he would have everything dropped and be able to go back to living a somewhat "normal" life.  That didn't happen, so this was his chance to "get back at" America for de-facto imprisoning him in Russia.

       Still seems kind of weird. Someone in his position, who 'nobly' leaks important documents, doesn't seem like someone who should do something of that magnitude out of personal revenge. What if his actions ultimately made the world a worse place? I'm not so sure Trump ended up being better than the status quo.

       Wikileaks only reports information it can personally verify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe any information they received on the Trump campaign wasn't verifiable or maybe they didn't receive any.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also possible Assange has a personal vendetta against people who kept him (safety reasons)  from leaving the safety of the Ecuadorian embassy.

       Since said evidence has been available and discussed plenty every where already. You can either address the Intelligence reports, the witness testimonies in Congress, the indictments by Mueller or you can be a troll and pretend to have lived under a bridge all these time and ignorant to all current events. Your choice. I know which one I'll engage with and which I won't.

       Since you’ve been following the story so closely you know that no proof, or even solid evidence, has been presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was merely the intelligence community’s (IC) “assessment” that Russia interfered, but no evidence was presented for their assessment. And considering how often the IC have lied/gotten things wrong in the last, it’s rather hard to trust them now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, the indictments of 13 Russian trolls hardly implicated the Russian government. It would also be a stretch of the imagination to characterize their activities as “interference.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you said rather matter-of-factly that Russia interfered despite the lack of proof I assumed you were privy to some outstanding evidence. I guess not.

       Hahaha, right, Russian trolls just woke up one day and decide to support Trump​ for president in the US and the Russian government which purges its dissenters ruthlessly is completely ignorant and innocent of any of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reports have provided evidence that Russia hacked into States' voter registration rolls, but obviously nothing the US government puts out is good enough for you but we should suspense our critical thinking skills when it comes to Putin's involvement in these operations.

       And that's why I don't engage with trolls because you people don't care about engaging in honest arguments.

       That's a dangerous assumption. When you're playing cat and mouse with another superpower all it takes is one mistake, one misstep and things can escalate very quickly, as in minutes quickly. We found out many years after the Cuban missile crisis close we came to global nuclear war and that was with a sane president in office.

       I completely agree, we're being led in circles by the same old tricks. Russia should never be under-estimated but to point the finger as if they're the cause of all our problems is laughable.

       I remember just how much 9/11 affected the psyche of everyone in the US. My father was a moderate conservative with socially liberal views and after 9/11 he was putting American flags on his car and talking about killing "sand niggers". The propaganda worked extremely well and the deep state wil keep using the same tactics until they're no longer effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       People say Bush Jr. really woke up the masses but I'd say you're experience was the more common thought process most people questioning this cluster-fuck went through. I honestly still had some hope in the system until Obama showed his true colors. That's when I really started to realize it's not just a couple bad apples in Washington DC. The whole bunch is rotten.

       In those days, lots of cars had external antennas. It seemed like 90 percent of them were flying Chinese made American flags. It worked very well.

       In 2016, the trick is to pretend that born wealthy Donald Trump is an outsider, and disgruntled Americans fell for it in large numbers. Even though it is so overwhelmingly clear that Donald Trump is pure establishment with a bad mouth, not enough people have awakened to the reality. We were fooled.

       It became obvious after the Cold War that the Soviet Union was painted over rust.
But they were very useful to justify a military budget so damn high.  We have been spending the same inflated amount of money (approx $600 billion a year) as we did during the Regan years.
      </p>
      <p>
       We destroyed Iraq because we know they were running around with WMDs, and Afghanistan?  That was a cake walk but we just cant kill enough of those Jihadis living on dirt floors and after 17 years its hard to justify spending all that stupid money on them.  So lets start pointing fingers at Russia again, provoke them, because that is real smart is to be start messing around on their front yard when they keep a bunch of  Nukes in the back yard.
      </p>

       Because past performance always guarantees future success. That's always the worst strategy for investing and gambling in Las Vegas.  But lets forget about that with our Military Strategic planning and diplomacy.

       Fair point. I agree that Russia is definitely doing shady shit (as the US surely is) but global conflict is moronic and not the answer, however I don't think anyone wants that. Proxy wars are one thing but conflicts between major world powers $$$$$$$ too much. If things didn't reach that point during the Cold War, I doubt they will now.

       A few months ago we had a gentleman  from China visiting were I work for a couple weeks. He didn't really speak English, but was a nice, pleasant guy. Just like most people except from China.

       Being around him really made me contemplate the relationship between the US and China. We have this "us vs them" mentally. But... normal citizens don't have a problem with people from other countries. People in power create the "us vs them" mentally. We're told other countries are our enemies, but their not really our enemies. They're just people like us. It's really messed up the tension between countries is caused by a few people and we pretty much fall in line.

       Your first two terms are vague, probably intentionally, so that no matter what I post you can say....not big enough, or not reputable enough.  That said, this study from back in 2012 was done at Harvard University:

       <p>
        Findings from our meta-analyses of 27 studies published over 22 years suggest an inverse association between high fluoride exposure and children’s intelligence.

       In the Brief Review of the link one question arises immediately for me. They reference in vitro exposure two relatively high levels of sodium fluoride. Does any of this go on to suggest that the Limited levels of fluoride in drinking water will have the same effect as in vitro concentrations?

       Well first if you read your toothpaste it says do not swallow and toddler toothpaste is non fluoridated. Now ask Why this is yet they put it in our water?

       Yeah because the dose in toothpaste is high enough to be damaging. I'm specifically looking at the mind control attributes given to fluoride. Idgaf if it protects my enamel and cleans my water.

       Did you go to link? Did you read it? Just asking because it did have your answer in there.
 Flouride is only good as a topical. If you ingest enough its highly toxic to the body over a long period of time. It also does not clean your water at all

       If it truly interests you you should look it up and read up on it. Many actual studies I just so happened to pick the first link out of laziness.

       Can someone please explain to me what the big deal with Russia is? Everywhere I look it's collusion with Russia this and deals with Russia that, this isn't the Cold War, we aren't at war with Russia, who gives a fuck if we work with Russia? We should be working with everyone if we can we're all on the same god damned planet. Last I checked with the current armaments the next world war would be the last war ever because we'd probably all die. Surely every world leader knows this, including Putin and Trump. So someone please explain to me why I should give one tiny iota of a fuck about Russia.

       You shouldn't. All of this Russia hysteria is a distraction away from the Democratic Party's complete failure during the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of doing an honest postmortem on how they were defeated by a incredibly unpopular candidate (hint: it was and continues to be the fact that they offer zero real alternative to the Republican party and are in fact the same party answering to the same corporate oligarchs), they are fomenting war with a nuclear power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the same people screaming about how dangerous Trump is just voted to give him another $80+ billion for the military without so much as a peep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is a boogeyman and the people in this thread are lapping up the BS that Fox News or MSNBC or pretty much any of the corporate-owned media is spewing out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact: Russia's military budget is $46 billion. The United States? $611 billion. Their economy is roughly the size of Italy. They are not a communist country. They do not have a single military base outside of their borders. The US? 800 bases on foreign soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Putin a good dude? Absolutely not. But he and his country are not the ones running around the world bombing people and funding terrorism. That is the United States. And without another Osama Bin Laden-like villian for which to justify the astronomical defense budgets (that no politician seems to say 'no' to), the Establishment needs an enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with this is that at some point, this bullshit is going to turn hot and we will have poked a NUCLEAR superpower too many times. And then what? We all lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not Russian. I am American. I consider myself politically progressive. I am 100% all in on diplomacy over unfounded accusations made by an Establishment that can't stand the fact that an outsider was elected that might end up getting everyone on the fucking planet killed.

       Why Russia? Two reasons: they are in the way of the Yinon Plan. AND a Russia/US alliance would be too strong to be controlled and may, in fact, put Israel in a box preventing them realizing the fevered vision: "Master of the One World".

       The reason you see such an organized "upvote to blame Russia, Trump / downvote to question the media or Western spook agency narrative" is because three groups all want to push the "muh Russia" narrative, some for different reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC-Shareblue shillbots of course want to push this as an anti-Trump narrative.  They aren't necessarily pushing for war -- cold or hot -- they are just political opportunists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shill accounts for Western intel agencies and what is often referred to as the military industrial complex
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       want a cold war because it's good for both of their respective businesses.  They mostly just want more defense spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you have the globalists and their shills.  They despise Trump and Russia because both represent their primary enemy: nationalism.  Their end goal might well be domination by any means -- even war.
      </p>
      <p>
       These culminate together to generate the upside down vote totals you see in some conspiracy threads like this one where so called "conspiracy" posters rush to embrace the official government line.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said in another comment that I believed both Russia and Russian's enemies had equal reason to want the spy killed.  But in retrospect, I was wrong.  Globalists, in particular, both in the deep state and in our intel agencies, had the most to gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than pushing the Russia narrative, the attack highlighted two things:  the impotence of Britain as a credible threat militarily, and the related narrative that Britain alone (that is, post Brexit Britain without the weight of the EU) is more prone to being pushed around than a globalized, EU-controlled Britain.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the globalist faction, using like minded elements inside western intel agencies -- or maybe even their own people -- are the most likely culprits based on who had the most to gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since the globalists have been called out of late and tried to shield themselves with laughable accusations of Antisemitism in order to immediately shut down any attention being drawn to them, I should point out that by 'globalist' I do not mean 'TEH J00S.'  I mean people who want a single, worldwide authority to administrate and police us all.

       Great post and I will try to give you an educated answer (although I'm reminded on a daily basis I know nothing). Are you a god believing person? Have you tried asking him what's going on? Because it actually works as most of the great philosophers will attest to, although many know it as meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Plato does a good job of covering these types of topics in his The Republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's put on the hat of government for a second and decide that manipulating the masses is for the greater good, because to people like you and me it is quite obvious. Why would they need to do this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it because the human condition requires being reminded that war is bad every decade and century? Would it not be most appropriate to give people their need for bloodlust and war in a controlled setting where the victors are decided before hand by the hidden world government? This way they can all be reminded for the next 70 years that Hitlers are bad and war / violence is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it because in order to maintain order and control, the world needs a single large military force to prevent any others from growing too large? So we have to make up these false flags in order to prevent people from complaining that people are starving while the government buys another 1000 missiles for $100k each?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it because the economy is shitty and blowing up all our old toys in the desert creates demand from the military industrial complex to help the government funnel money into the economy?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three reasons right there that all may have some truth to them.

       I think it's the other way around. Putin is using everyone else to improve Russian image and influence around the world. I think Russia is going for the "World superpower" again after a severe stagnation.

       What we'll see from them is probably:
       <br/>
       -Stockpiling nuclear weapons and deployment methods
       <br/>
       -Total brain drain of anybody with Russian experience
-Building the Russian buffer zones back up
       <br/>
       -Eliminating potential NATO expansions
       <br/>
       -Aggressive pushes towards resource exploitation
       <br/>
       -Destabilizing political landscapes in any rival

       Good post and Good point. It further represents the fact that the president ISN'T in charge. No matter who was the president for all of theses years since 911....we have been slowly but surely heading into the same direction regardless who was "in charge".

       Has it occured to Russia that it is very strange that the UK, a country of no military significance, a country that could be completely destroyed forever in a few minutes by Russia, would concoct false charges against the Russian government, announce these charges publicly without providing any evidence whatsoever, bring the unsupported charges to the UN, issue an ultimatum to Russia, dispell Russian diplomats and seize Russian assets on the basis of mere allegations, all the while refusing any evidence and any cooperation with Russia, as required by law, in the investigation of the charges?

       Russians, both government, media and youth brainwashed by American propaganda and the Washington-funded NGOS that the Russian government permits to operate against itself in Russia, seem to think that the many accusations and threats issued against Russia are some kind of mistake that can be rectified by recourse to evidence and law. Apparently, after all these years the Russians still do not understand that Washington and its vassals have no interest whatsoever in facts or law.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the UN the Russian ambassador, in response to the evidence-free accusation by the UK prime minister that the Russian government had used a military-grade nerve agent to attempt to kill two people on an English park bench, went through all the legal reasons, including the requirement of collaboration with Russia in examining the evidence, to establish that the UK accusation was in violation of law and unsupported by any evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do the Russians think the British government cares a hoot about law or evidence? Are the Russians really this brainwashed about the West?
      </p>
      <p>
       The British government of Tony Blair cooperated with the George W. Bush regime in propagating the lie that Saddam Hussein in Iraq had “weapons of mass destruction.” This lie was used to invade and to destroy Iraq and to leave the country 15 years later in chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       The British goverment also supported the lies about Gadaffi in Libya and participated in overthrowing the Libyan government. The British government also supported the lie that Iran had a nuclear weapons program. There was never any evidence, but evidence was of no interest. An agenda was in motion, and the agenda was independent of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the British Parliament voted down British participation in Obama’s planned invasion of Syria, the current British government supports the lie that Assad is using chemical weapons “against his own people.”
      </p>
      <p>
       By now one would think that Russians, both government, media, and public, would understand that all the West is capable of is to lie. The purpose of the lies is to demonize Russia and to set up Russia for military attack.

       You missed my point. I don't see anyone getting unhinged or hysterical and demanding war.  However, there are a lot of people outraged at the idea that Putin is to blame for this poisoning, and in some cases, any wrongdoing at all ever.

       R/conspiracy has no problem with mainstream news when it supports a conspiracy against the Clintons or Democrats. Just when it's against Russia and Putin.
