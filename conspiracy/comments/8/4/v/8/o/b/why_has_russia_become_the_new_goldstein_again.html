        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The USSR was always the boogeyman, then came along the media‚Äôs promotion of international Islamic terrorism as public enemy number 1. </p>

<p>What does the US/West have to gain from rebranding Russia as this great enemy, but simultaneously say how weak they are?</p>

<p>I just find it strange that despite any clear ideological differences (except the US is less transparent with its authoritarianism and has excellent PR) the US and Russia are now ‚Äúenemies‚Äù again. It‚Äôs relatively impossible to speak to anyone about this without a fierce emotional response‚Äî as if people are being forced to choose an alt-right identity or a mainstream democrat one.</p>

<p>TLDR: ?? W Russia?</p>

<p>Do I think Russia is being made a &quot;boogyman&quot; for the democratic loss in the American elections? yes. Do i think Russia is the single most destabilizing and disrupting powerhouse in international politics since the end of WWII? Also yes. Do I think the American dominated <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a bit na√Øve in it&#39;s opinion of Russia, and should try to see in how much constant fear the people of minority groups within, or the people of neighbouring countries, live? yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She noted that Russia has complained that the US criticized them too much.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf the Russian government would stop using chemical weapons to assassinate its enemies. And if the Russian government stopped helping its Syria ally to use chemical weapons to kill Syria children ‚Ä¶ we would stop talking about them.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe take no pleasure in having to constantly criticize Russia. But we need Russia to stop giving us so many reasons to do so.‚Äù</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two thinkers of geopolitics that you need to be familiar with to understand what is going on, MacKinder and Spykman.   Mackinder published an important paper called the &#39;Geographical Pivot of History&#39;, where he laid out the concept of the &#39;HEARTLAND&#39;.  This is the Eurasian land mass. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographical_Pivot_of_History">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographical_Pivot_of_History</a></p>

<p>Spykman was somewhat of a critic of Mackinder and he emphasized the area called the &#39;RIM-LAND&#39;, as being more important than the Heartland proper.  The Rimland is the geographical area of coasts and the middle-east which surround Eurasia.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimland">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimland</a></p>

<p>Today, Eurasia is becoming more interconnected and rising rapidly in terms of power.   When it will become interconnected, it will form the biggest market in the world. </p>

<p>You heard about the &#39;New Silk Road&#39;?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2018/03/13/5-new-silk-road-projects-that-will-alter-your-view-of-how-the-world-works/#13aa82b01dea">https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2018/03/13/5-new-silk-road-projects-that-will-alter-your-view-of-how-the-world-works/#13aa82b01dea</a></p>

<p>The BRICS?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS</a></p>

<p>China&#39;s alternative to the World Bank and IMF?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/04/30/china-offers-a-world-bank-alternative/">https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/04/30/china-offers-a-world-bank-alternative/</a></p>

<p>In other words, Eurasia is rising in power.  At the same time the US is starting to loose control of the RIM-LAND.  All post WW2 strategy was based on the policies of containment, and those are rapidly failing. </p>

<p>In addition to this you have the importance of energy economics.   Obama lifted the ban on exports of US energy, and the US now wants access to the European marketplace where Russia is a direct competitor. </p>

<p>This is the background. </p>

<p>Specifics of demonstrating US waning power is the way Russia has been maneuvering around US policy.  The neocons always wanted an enemy of this nature, and there was a push to re-orient US policy in 2008 with the crisis in Georgia, however, the economic crisis put a stop to it.  Then when Syria machinations started to be played, Putin, managed to get a letter published in the NYT, calling out the US establishment. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html</a></p>

<p>The next day, all of the US intelligentsia was outraged.  The US attempted a coup in Ukraine, and Russia outplayed them with the Crimea maneuver.  Embarrassment number 2. In terms of Middle-East policy, US-Israeli policy of destabilization has been known since at least 1998, and by now we should all be familiar with Wesley Clark&#39;s, timeline.  Russia managed to defeat this policy in Syria. Embarrassment number 3.   You have to remember that Iran was always the prize for these guys.  Both Iraq and Afghanistan are going to be lunch pads for the Iran invasion meaning invasion from West and the East.  The necon Institute for the Study of War, 2 years ago, projected war with Iran in 5 years.   However, there is a risk that both Iraq and Afghanistan might be lost.    </p>

<p>All of this anti-Russia stuff, is meant to get them to back down, and allow the overthrow of Syria, and to not interfere in the upcoming war with Iran.  They will continue to levy economic sanctions as long as Russia does not back down.  </p>
