        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>News is <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/2018/03/14/14/45/stephen-hawking-dead-at-76">reporting</a> that Mr Hawking has passed away.</p>

<p>How did he live so long in the first place, given the condition with which he was afflicted?</p>

<p>If we never saw him talking, how do we know it was not a case of <em>somebody else</em> typing those words into his voice machine?</p>

<p>How could a person who allegedly typed with muscles in his mouth possibly write so many books?</p>

<p>Is the whole thing an elaborate joke on the masses, to get them to believe that a vegetable was in fact the &#39;smartest man in the world&#39;?</p>

<p>Discuss.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Many people are linking to the Miles Mathis paper on Stephen Hawking, which you can see <a href="http://milesmathis.com/hawk3.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those interested in Mathis&#39; work, I highly recommend you check out the group blog <a href="https://pieceofmindful.com/">Piece of Mindful</a>.</p>

<p>Donald, Hilary, and Bernie are all around the same age.</p>

<p>2/3 of them have blonde hair while Bernie is full gray.</p>

<p>Are we expected to believe that these 70 year old people magically do not have gray hair? That Bernie only has gray hair because he&#39;s 4-5 years older than the other two?</p>

<p>Also, FWIW, I think history will look back on his publications as mostly either wrong or inconsequential.  Hawking radiation is his one major contribution.  Everything since then has been Emporer&#39;s New Clothes.</p>

One of the most famous physicists in history with access to any and all medical treatment he wants, was just misdiagnosed his entire life, and they didn&#39;t bother to find out what his real malady was.

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s not that simple. Each of us contain tens to hundreds of thousands of genetic variations that interact in a countless different ways, and it&#39;s impossible to know what specific combination of genetic variants contributed to his longevity from him alone. Fortunately, although his longevity is rare, it&#39;s not unheard of (2-4%), so eventually, with enough data, we may learn what combination of genetic variants enables a slow-progression form of ALS.</p>

<p>Stephen Hawking had his genome sequenced. I guarantee that his data is stored in an anonymized fashion in a database regularly used in ALS research. It&#39;s extremely likely that his data has already contributed to key findings in juvenile-onset ALS. </p>

But there is not real definitive treatment for ALS let alone for a rare muscle wasting disease, especially someone diagnosed in the 1950s. There are some drugs that might stop progression of ALS but I don&#39;t think they are terribly effective.

    <div class="md"><p>He made a comparison between modern art and modern physics that blew me away. Honestly, which is more likely: there is, essentially, a very small &#39;priest class&#39; of physicists who are able to make sense of ABSURDLY abstract/unintelligible modern physics (seriously, it&#39;s hard to describe how far beyond human intuition modern physics has gone, you need to read the heavier pop-sci books where they try to explain some of it), or that it&#39;s all more or less tail-chasing bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, modern physics-- relativity and quantum mechanics-- are more than 100 years old.</p>

<p>General relativity was published in 1915. The Copenhagen Interpretation was declared in 1927, but people started talking about quanta around 1900.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s been a lot of time for art, and even mysticism, to be influenced by it. Indian mystics of the mid-century, like Maharishi, loved it, and talked about it being a way for materialist westerners to understand deeper reality.</p>

<p>As far as occult principles and sacred geometry, they are the building blocks of the universe and the mind. We can&#39;t escape them any more than we can escape being born with four limbs and the ability to learn language. Of course you&#39;ll see aspects of those forms in all art, science, and religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well its not really that small though. Physics is a hard subject and much of it is not intuitive to the average person. It makes sense that, among the already small amount of physicists, there will be some who can go even further.</p>

<p>Claiming its all bullshit falls apart when so much of it is transparently testable, and can be confirmed with real world testing. If you were talking theoretical here, maybe you&#39;d have somewhat of a point, but it takes a long time for a theory to form.</p>

<p>As for the chess example, being called the best doesn&#39;t mean you are the best. There are plenty of people who likely accel at a greater level in many fields that, for whatever reason, do not step into the limelight. Most pro chess players go online to lose, as it gives them new insights and strategies. I remember a famous player saying in a video that they knew they would lose if they responded with a certain move, but in doing so they would learn how the opposing move worked.</p>

<p>Yes,  and as someone who has been subject to and has subjected others to it, it is quite methodical. I think, from most of your replies to both me and others here, you are either a troll, in which case well played, or you have a very large misconception about theory vs  hypothesis.</p>

<p>You can read about this yourself, you can look at mathematical proofs. You can see the technology that is only possible because the theory is sound, and has lead us to being capable of reaching that technology.</p>

<p>Further down you talk about physics grads being lemmings because they believe in quantum mechanics, yet there are experiements, like the double slit, that YOU can carry out to see this phenomena at work.</p>

<p>My research is in Quantum Computing. I have seen calculations done on existing QC&#39;s that utilize algorithms that are based around the properties of quantum mechanics, and the results we get confirm that the math works.</p>

<p>Now of course there are still holes and gaps in many of these theories, but to claim they are nonsense, despite the overwhelming amount of data to support them and experiments and proofs that support them is just ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are distorting the truth a bit. <em>Nobody</em> understands modern physics on an intuitive level, not even the supergeniuses who built it; the maths we can wrap our heads around, but their implications not so much. Things like quantum mechanics and the more out-there stuff of general relativity are just so far removed from the human experience that no human mind will ever understand them in full. It&#39;s one of the reasons why all interpretations of quantum mechanics either contradict the maths (for example, the Copenhagen interpretation requires a mechanism of waveform collapse, which the maths do not predict) or require outrageous and as of now unfalsifiable assumptions (like Everett&#39;s many-worlds hypothesis). Hawking more or less admitted that he himself can&#39;t visualise the mechanism behind Hawking radiation.</p>

<p>In addition, most of modern physics has been experimentally verified beyond reasonable doubt and can be used to make <em>incredibly</em> accurate predictions, which means it must be onto something. That the standard model somehow, somewhere has a mistake or oversimplification is an accepted fact any respectable physicist will readily admit--if the model were perfect, quantum mechanics wouldn&#39;t contradict relativity--but too shove it aside as &#39;tail-chasing bullshit&#39; is both ignorant of the absolute <em>mountain</em> of empirical evident and demonstrative of your lack of understanding on the topic you are so confidently judging.</p>

You would admit that the way people defend/discuss modern particle physics is fairly similar to the way they discuss modern art though, right? And there is a LOT of money flying around in physics.  Money + utterly inscrutable reasons for transferring that money usually isn&#39;t a good combination when humans are involved, that&#39;s as far as I&#39;ll go.</p>

<p>Honestly, which is more likely: there is, essentially, a very small &#39;priest class&#39; of physicists who are able to make sense of ABSURDLY abstract/unintelligible modern physics (seriously, it&#39;s hard to describe how far beyond human intuition modern physics has gone, you need to read the heavier pop-sci books where they try to explain some of it), or that it&#39;s all more or less tail-chasing bullshit?</p>

<p>This is an excellent question. </p>

<p>It is amusing to me how we are raised to believe in these super intelligent genius scientists who can see things ordinary men cannot see.</p>

<p>When I speak to physics grads about &#39;quantum physics&#39; I feel like I am talking to brainwashed lemmings. Utter nonsense they spout.</p>

<p>The first time this happened I brushed it off. After the second time I became a little concerned. Then it happened again and I began asking questions.</p>

<p>Then I discovered the hysterical <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">Cavendish experiment</a> and, well, now my eyes are wide open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who can understand modern physics have spent a lot of time and effort to get to that point. And while physics is hard and far away from every day intuition, all of it still makes sense, and you can follow the arguments, in principle do the experiments, work out the math and so on. This takes time and effort, and all experiments are not so easy to perform, but everyone of average intelligence can probably learn physics up to and including modern topics like quantum field theory and relativity. </p>

<p>Also, some people are actually on a different level compared to us mere mortals; &quot;genius&quot; is not an empty term. There is a famous theoretical physicist called Ed Witten, who is basically the father of string theory. I&#39;ve personally seen him &quot;in action&quot; at a few conferences, and he is very impressive, almost scary. From a 20 minute talk on a technical topic, he seemed to understand things as well as the professor that was giving the talk, and could ask highly specific and relevant questions, and even suggest what he thought was a solution to one of the open problems. If that happened once or twice, then okay, maybe not too impressive, but when it happens over and over, and for very different topics, then it starts being highly impressive. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just have a hard time believing that there are people out there who are just on truly a different plane of understanding the universe. Like, the best chess player on Earth has done AMA&#39;s where he says he regularly loses to complete randoms online. He&#39;s &#39;the best&#39;, but he&#39;s not on a different plane of existence. It&#39;s weird.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#39;s a pretty terrible comparison, and faulty logic. The random people he lost too were probably not really random people, but other strong chess players (IMs or GMs, even) who devoted a lot of time to chess. If you pit Magnus Carlsen against someone who just knows the rules and played a few games for fun, he will win every game. He could probably beat 10 such people at the same time without seeing the boards; which I would call being on a different level. </p>

<p>Also, do you think the same way about other technical fields? Can a brain surgeon really be on a truly different level when it comes to brain surgery, compared to a random person? Or even compared to a random doctor? Of course they can; because they spent years and years getting there. </p>

<p>To eliminate the evolutionary &#39;warring&#39; you&#39;d have to have a monoculture.  That monoculture would have to feed on itself, which would select for the absolute most ferocious, warlike, monstrous, least empathic conquering barbarian horde you can imagine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s temping to imagine a stable symbiosis appearing between say, a shrimp and the algae it feeds on... but symbiosis is just detente in the evolutionary war.  It only lasts until one side&#39;s genes finds the right way to put the screws to the other side.  The symbiosis we see on earth is actually maintained by the outside predators, or environmental limits (such as in a biosphere) that couldn&#39;t allow the excess resources that intelligence needs to develop (intelligence is extremely wasteful!  Think of how successful and adaptable ants are, without carrying around huge 3lb brains)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not true.  Deer will overpopulate until they destroy the food supply, then starve, if they are not sufficiently culled.  Rats introduced to the island of Mauritius caused the extinction of a whole species.  Zebra mussels introduced into the Great Lakes have almost completely wiped out the native bivalves.  Beavers destroy as much land as they possibly can when they build a dam.  Army ants can wipe out a whole microecosystem if they happen to cross it on the march.  Your body is at constant, constant war with pathogens-- it never ends for your white blood cells and antibodies, every day is Vietnam.</p>

<p>The &quot;balance&quot; is just the steady state where one side&#39;s weapons are temporarily neutralized by the other side&#39;s defenses.  It&#39;s not harmony, it&#39;s detente.  It looks harmonious in the short view, but in the fact everything around you is constantly falling out of &quot;balance&quot; with each generation&#39;s selection. </p>

When you have the technology to annihilate your entire species, you survive through cooperation, not war.  Water is an incredibly abundant resource, there are water clouds larger than our solar system floating out in space, all mineral resources are far more abundant on asteroids.</p>

<p>Maybe some aliens feed off negative emotional states like suffering, in that case i can understand being wary of them, but considering their general tactic on earth is observation and non-interference, i dont think they are hostile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a major spoiler to anyone that wants to read the books, so be warned.  The author basically proposes a solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox. </a>  </p>

<p>He starts with two axioms:</p>

<ol>
<li>Survival is the most important goal of every civilization. </li>
<li>Every civilization will continue to grow but the universe is limited. </li>
</ol>

<p>Then he basically game theories what would happen if one civilization discovered another one, lets call them Group A and Group B.  Would they make contact or not, and what would that contact look like?  Let&#39;s also say for simplicity they are either hostile or friendly.  He also makes these two important assumptions in figuring out the decision matrix:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Civilizations can experience technology explosions.  So if we are talking about Group A discovering Group B, even if Group A is initially more advance, Group B can experience a technology explosion and surpass Group A.  The important part here being more technologically advanced means better weapons and would win a conflict. </li>
<li>Suspicion Chain is the next thing he introduces in the reality of the scale of the galaxy.  Basically you can communicate at light speed but travel is much slower, so you can talk long before making contact.  But how can you figure out if the other civilizations are hostile or friendly?  Even if you could figure it out, how do you know the other civilization thinks you are friendly or not?  And the suspicion chain just goes in circles.  You wouldn&#39;t ever be sure the group you were talking to was friendly, or thought you were friendly, so they could be mounting the attack all while pretending to be friendly.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>So Group A discovers Group B.  What offers Group A the best chance for survival?  </p>

<p>If they make contact and are friendly, they risk group B having a technology explosion and being destroyed. </p>

<p>If they don&#39;t make contact, again they risk group B having a technology explosion and being destroyed.  </p>

<p>The best option to ensure long term survival of your civilization is to stay quiet, and destroy any civilization you do find.  </p>

<p>This gives rise to the view of the galaxy as a Dark Forest.  Every civilization is a hunter with a gun trying to stay quiet.  If they encounter another hunter with a gun they only have one  choice, doesn&#39;t matter if the other civilization is more advance or primitive, or hostile or friendly, you shoot or you are killed.  </p>

<p>Because a popular post here recently has been about people missing actual, compelling conspiracy theories. I come on here tonight, i scroll down, everything is Trump and Russia...fine, to a degree.</p>

<p>Then I see this post...yes! Something interesting. Only after I click on it, I see it&#39;s being downvoted to hell after an hour. </p>

<p>What facts do I need to know? I am here to learn, newfriend.</p>

<p>The thing that gets me is, if we never saw Hawking typing his words, then we must accept the <strong>possibility</strong> that somebody else was doing the typing.</p>

<p>Once we accept this possibility, then we can either ignore the obvious questions, or ask and discuss them.</p>

<p>But that would only matter if he was here to have a discussion... which he is not. </p>

<p>He has an entire website that charges $20+ for the privilege of reading and viewing his ignorant musing. He comes here to shill his website and video and to troll people.</p>

<p>You see, step2thjep has mistaken ignorance for skepticism. He thinks if his under-educated under powered brain does not know of something, understand something, or de novo prove it or discover it, then its fakery.</p>

<p>In his infinite wisdom he has decided missile, atoms, planets, the moon, space, a round earth, evolution, dinosaurs, all of history, gravity, wars, etc are all fake... because he doesn&#39;t get how they worked or the science behind these concepts. </p>

<p>Some neurologists have questioned his diagnosis, suggesting he may have adult onset spinal muscular atrophy, a disorder similar to MND but which has a much better prognosis and potential for a normal life expectancy. Most experts however believe his symptoms match classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the commonest form of MND. Although the normal prognosis is two to five years, one in 20 patients survives 10 years or more. Brian Dickie, the research director at the MND Association, said he believed there could be something in Professor Hawking&#39;s genetic make-up that might explain his survival.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is something fringe for you (and the truth): Hawking <a href="http://milesmathis.com/hawk3.pdf">died and was replaced</a> wih a double [pdf]. It is pretty self-evident when you compare the pictures, and when you read about that one fateful night.</p>

<p>But also, realize such a handicapped / caricatural man (speaking through a computer) is a tremendous asset and marketing tool (in this day and age when victims are heroes). He was (still will be) used in every possible setting to spread doom porn, to advance the transhumanist agenda, and generally to advocate for the central planners’ goals.</p>

<p>The well-known lecture <em>Life in the Universe</em> is one among many examples (and perhaps one of the best known). See <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/life-in-the-universe.html">here</a> for the whole thing. It is worthwhile reading it in full and realizing the amount of fallacies, inconsistencies and nihilist (and indeed morbidly materialistic) ideas that are put forth herein. </p>

<p>The real Stephen Hawking has been rolling in his grave for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhhhhh it&#39;s clearly the same person in all of those photos. Big surprise that progressive degeneration of all your motor neurons to the point of full paralysis leads to dramatic changes in the face. Have you ever noticed what bone loss in the lower jaw does to the elderly? What sort of effect do you think not being able to open your mouth let alone chew anything for half a century had on Hawking&#39;s appearance? His head was propped upright not by under its own power but with the support of that headrest for 50 fucking years. The parts of the skull he&#39;d otherwise be constantly articulating settled against each other.</p>

<p>Also his teeth don&#39;t look filed down in the older photos. They look like they&#39;re mostly hidden by his relaxed mouth, whereas in later years the deformation of his jaw had clearly driven them up and forward relative to his mouth so they were always out. Seems very possible he suffered some gum degeneration as well which would expose more of his dentition.</p>

<p>If he&#39;d been secretly replaced with a double and his teeth didn&#39;t make any sense, don&#39;t you think the people responsible would have bothered to do something about them? This PDF is some of the dumbest shit I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people just want to get to the truth. And if something is easily debunked or doesn&#39;t make sense then it&#39;s going to get called out. Isn&#39;t that the purpose of discussion here? To determine what&#39;s true and what isn&#39;t or what&#39;s plausible, probable, or possible?</p>

<p>Skeptical people like to challenge their own and others&#39; beliefs. If you can&#39;t take criticsm or your viewpoint being challenged then why even be here? Just create <a href="/r/conspiracycirclejerk">/r/conspiracycirclejerk</a> where no one is allowed to disagree with anyone&#39;s conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>And when you state things matter-of-factly like &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding, it&#39;s clearly a different person&quot; when most people disagree then yeah, you&#39;re going to get downvoted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good to question and dismantle the theories presented here. Otherwise it&#39;s just a bunch of LARPing based on the headlines of the day. I personally don&#39;t buy into this theory one bit. I&#39;ve knew a man with ALS and he lived for 18 years after his diagnosis. Others have lived even longer, Hawking included. This theory seems like it was strung together through ignorance. Basically OP should read like this &quot;I, having limited knowledge of ALS, am suspicious about someone living so long with the disorder. So it must be a conspiracy.&quot; </p>

<p>This just in! All of this makes you look younger and less frail. If you ask me, he lucked out by getting a better looking double than himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Nihilism put into practice is the problem, not the idea of it. We see it oozing into out society in many ways. Science for science sake, experimentation for experimentation sake. There&#39;s no groundedness.

It&#39;s the antithesis of what America was founded on and many people are drawn to it out of economic apathy, hypernormalization, and because it&#39;s hip. YOLO in practiced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Derived meaning must lie on inherent meaning. If there is no inherent meaning, there can be no derived meaning.</p>

<p>If your taste for music is just synaptic impulses, if love is reducible to hormones and neurotransmitters, if artistic creativity is an archaic reflex that evolved out of random occurrences because it somehows favors survival, if the beautifully fined-tuned universe is not beautiful at all because beauty doesn’t exist ... then why get up in the morning? Actually, why not just kill yourself, as anything you do is inherently meaningless? (Even your presumed fear of death, which as a rational being you could just ignore as it is a mere chemical reaction in your brain and doesn’t mean anything). But most importantly, <em>why engage in this conversation with me</em>? Why deploy efforts to condescend and try to insult me?</p>

<p>Here is the truth: consciousness is not secreted by the brain. Life is dream, and a beautiful dream. Not only does Beauty exist, but you are beautiful yourself, regardless of whether you realize it or not.</p>

<p>Or is he, like many of us, tired of the complete circus known as &#39;politics&#39; taking up half of the front page of this sub?</p>

<p>I personally think this is an absolutely ridiculous conspiracy, but it&#39;s a nice change from the usual.</p>

<p>Also, wasn&#39;t it theorized (maybe even confirmed at this point) that Hawking may have initially been misdiagnosed? </p>

<p>Thanks, newfriend.</p>

<p>I first heard of this one about three years ago. At first I thought it was crazy.</p>

<p>A guy had called in to a talkshow I used to listen to and I honestly thought he was trying to &#39;spread disinfo&#39; (I used to be a conspiratard).</p>

<p>After looking at some footage of Hawking for myself, I noticed that there was zero evidence that he was doing the typing.</p>

<p>Then I began digging further and the whole ruse became so obvious.</p>

<p>Now I find the whole thing funny, just like most of TPTB&#39;s jokes on the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep... &#39;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/">Hawking lost his ability to speak in 1985, when, on a trip to CERN in Geneva, he caught pneumonia. In the hospital, he was put on a ventilator. His condition was critical. The doctors asked Hawking&#39;s then-wife, Jane, whether they should turn off the life support. She vehemently refused. Hawking was flown to Addenbrooke&#39;s Hospital, in Cambridge, where the doctors managed to contain the infection. To help him breathe, they also performed a tracheotomy, which involved cutting a hole in his neck and placing a tube into his windpipe. As a result, Hawking irreversibly lost the ability to speak.</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s really not.  I know quite a few religious zealots who are anti-science as it tends to eventually unravel the mysteries that require <em>faith</em></p>

<p>Funny though because with each new answer, more questions arise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know quite well how signals get transmitted and received. Baffled why you think it needs a tower. How does a walkie talkie work with no tower? You talk in to one, it transmits signal, the other receives the signal, you hear the speech. No tower at any stage of this. </p>

<p>A tower can be used for local comms, to gain greater range against the curve of the earth. Your own position defeats your argument- if the earth were flat towers would not be necessary at any distance. But, since you do have to overcome the curve of the earth, you need a tower for short distance extension or range. If you want to go to the other side of the globe, you need at minimum 2 satellites. Which, really, does the same thing the tower does- extend line of sight over the horizon. Like a really really tall tower. But towers that tall are not possible yet, so we use satellites in orbit to perform this task. </p>

<p>Towers are not because of the curve you moronic piece of misinformed human...As you said its to extend the signal,because signal can get anywhere so far before it is lost.Ever wondered why you lose signal on your phone?You seriously try to argue here that we lose signal because of curvature and we need towers to bypass that?what a fkin idiot,my god...You deserve to believe anything,really </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your ignorance seems to be making you very angry. Only you can resolve that.</p>

<p>You spend a lot of time addressing your own positions instead of what I said. Go back and actually address my points this time.</p>

<p>And here is a shocker for you- those radio waves will travel forever until they hit something. Forever. The first radio signal ever created in 1864 is still moving through space to this day. The limits on range are simple: transmit power, receiver sensitivity, and blockage.</p>

<p>Your cell phone, operating at about 1 watt, can produce a signal strong enough to another cell phone to use over 1000 miles away. 
  Yes, cell phones do not communicate directly to each other. I know this, I use their weaker receiver because the tower has an even more robust receiver. </p>

<p>Why do the cell phones not get more than 20 to 50 miles then? Even in flat terrain?<br/>
because something stops the signal. The Earth gets in the way, dropping that distant target below the tower&#39;s horizon. At 30 miles, the tower horizon to a 6 foot person is 486 feet high. terrain and elevation give you some advantages and some disadvantages.</p>

<p>Corporations and most modern Democrat party politicians are not left wing. Also....big pharma is not left wing either and they push the &quot;you don&#39;t trust vaccines?

<p>For the record, global warming and stuff...I don&#39;t know for sure if it&#39;s human accelerated but I both acknowledge fossil fuels will run out AND that the elite want to shoe-horn in a regressive corporate scam in the form of carbon tax, at the expense of the working/middle class/upper middle class. </p>

<p>If we can all sort out the misunderstandings and see how closely we actually are aligned, (we&#39;re all freedom-loving workers after all deep down) we would more easily unite against the banksters and other corrupt oligarchs, demand money out of politics, dismantle CIA/secret societies/nationalize the FED, etc.</p>

<p>In terms of socialism, it&#39;s a pretty broad range of ideologies (libertarian socialism is way better than more authoritarian stuff) but economically we can have
a balance between personal freedom (socialistic/worker protections) and economic freedom (capitalistic freedom limited to ethical small/medium business that play by the rules, and break up big monopolies, corporations and big banks that screw us over).</p>

<p>Virtually everyone&#39;s brainwashed so we should take care to slowly help each other re-assemble reality from the half truths fed to us daily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what&#39;s ironic? I think Karl Marx was pro-gun lol! (Something about protecting the proletariat from tyranny?).
I don&#39;t have much of a view on Marx as I haven&#39;t read his theories properly but I do know that people confuse &quot;Marxism-Leninism&quot; (Lenin&#39;s twisting of Marx&#39;s theory of how communism eventually will come) for actual Marxism (of which there are at least three types: classical, orthodox and revisionist). So I don&#39;t really have any beef with Marx, but I am annoyed with Lenin/Stalin/Mao claiming the socialist and communist name to describe their corrupt cronyist state capitalist dictatorship model that gave them too much power. I&#39;ve read that Marx wasn&#39;t even authoritarian but don&#39;t take my word for it as I need to research more on it another time.</p>

<p>My gun law views are a bit mixed: I hate what guns do (literally only function is destruction/killing) and think strict anti-gun laws work very well for most countries (e.g. those in Europe). But the U.S. could be a logical exception as it&#39;s the NWO battleground and the elites/secret services probably give illegal arms to city gangs, drug cartels, MKUltra victims, etc. anyway so we&#39;re screwed in that sense (hostage situation until we actually &quot;drain the swamp&quot; of secret society and corporate shills from government.) I try not to jump to conclusions as these things are often complicated considering who&#39;s running the show. It would probably make more sense if we focused on other things before arriving at gun rights. Fixing the government is a priority because everything leads back to politics/corporately controlled government.</p>

<p>My friend I just want to recommend avoiding the pointless terms &quot;<strong>THE</strong> left&quot; and &quot;<strong>THE</strong> right&quot; for multiple reasons (copy/pasting from a previous comment) :</p>

<p>&quot;THE LEFT&quot;/&quot;THE RIGHT&quot; is language we should ideally avoid because it&#39;s A) divisive, B) prone to extremely broad generalizations, C) what some think is left/right is not actually left/right respectively and centrism is also ignored for some strange reason, D) everyone on the left half of the spectrum is a leftist, but people seem to confuse left wing with SJW/feminist/&quot;white privilege&quot; brainwashed people lol. This just increases the divide and conquer agenda&#39;s power. Oh and E) not all left wingers, centrists or right wingers think exactly alike, respectively. Hive mind = sheep.
Saying left wingers are SJWs is like saying right wingers are racists. Not everyone who is left/right wing is SJW/racist. The whole SJW vs alt right or whatever is divide and conquer.</p>

<p>Just to add another layer: the corporate media brainwashes the population with their bullshit
definitions of left and right and &quot;moderate&quot;. They pretend moderate = &quot;between Dem and Repub&quot; which
is bullshit because that&#39;s just a brand loyalty scam. Both modern parties have moved so far to the right and
modern Dems are pretending &quot;we&#39;re leftist because LGBT rights, pro-choice&quot; when that doesn&#39;t mean shit economically.
They try to shift the goal posts of what is left/center/right so that we edge closer to NWO global fascism:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any categorization is divisive.  But not necessarily in an awful way.  Many people do follow the crowd and the mainstream media, so they often lump themselves into a group think mentality and I&#39;m just pointing it out.</p>

<p>I think calling people &quot;libtard&quot; and &quot;Nazis&quot; (and assaulting them for being &quot;Nazis&quot;) and TV personalities making vulgar and uncivil attacks on sitting presidents and their children is more divisive.  It not only divides but increases animosity and gives an OK from our sheep&#39;s leaders that this type of behavior is OK.  Also Trump promoting violence at his rally&#39;s is divisive, though fortunately the right has not been organizing political violence as the Soros backed Antifas have been.</p>

<p>I fully agree with you we have a one party system when it comes to some of the most importance issues like Agenda 21, foreign policy (endless wars) and the surveillance state.  I just try to push the truth and squeeze it out of both sides of the argument.  Each side has a piece of the puzzle, but also have failed ideas we need to discard.</p>

<p>I&#39;m for promoting civility, debate dialogue, and from what I&#39;ve seen it is mostly right wing pundits pushing this idea... while many progressives are in a frenzy ready to justify political violence because the other side (they say) are literal &quot;Nazis&quot;.  Just saw a post on r/Progressive to that effect yesterday!  So yes when I&#39;m seeing a bigger problem on the general left I say so and focus more on that roadblock to peace and civility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean labels per se, there&#39;s nothing wrong with saying &quot;left wingers are more likely to be SJW and right wingers more likely to be racist but both are optional and corrupted personality traits pushed by the elite anyway, not everyone is an SJW/racist&quot;. (Although this
statement might cause a bit of unnecessary division.) Instead of using vague labels (e.g. liberal/conservative)
or even pretty distinct/solid labels (democratic socialism, anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, centrism/social democracy, etc.)
it would be better to avoid political sport teams and JUST talk about policies without ad hominem attacks. Best way.</p>

<p>The problem is: when everyone on the left half of the spectrum is a leftist but people incorrectly say &quot;THE LEFT / everyone on the left half of the entire spectrum&quot; is a &quot;so and so&quot; which can&#39;t possibly be logical considering how massive the spectrum is. It&#39;s far too broad of a generalization. 
You can&#39;t compare a false leftist (Democrat party worshiper) with an SJW with a democratic socialist with a Leninist. Massive differences so generalizations would be illogical.
Like assuming everyone from Alabama is a incestuous racist. Waaay too broad man. Hope you get what I mean. Literally the corporate media was saying &quot;THE left/THE right&quot; super frequently during the Antifa vs Neonazi psyop. They want us to oversimplify the spectrum (BOX ONE or BOX TWO rather than an actual spectrum) and choose retarded groups to fight each other with. 
Let alone the fact modern Democrat puppets aren&#39;t even left wing or centrist! So it&#39;s a really really bad idea
to use the terms &quot;THEEE left&quot; / &quot;THEEE right&quot;. </p>

<p>Also remember there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;both sides&quot; because this implies there are only two ideologies on the ENTIRE spectrum which is demonstrably incorrect. A slightly right wing guy is going to be astronomically different to a far right authoritarian fascist for example (in fact a slightly right wing guy could hate the Republican/Democrat parties and be a legit ally of mine). I would like to unite everyone that&#39;s reasonable, i.e. moderate libertarian forms of center left, centrist and slightly right. (But not extreme right libertarian like the Libertarian party, although
even extremists could be reasoned with if misunderstandings are cleared up.)</p>

<p>Fighting for workers&#39; rights, no SJW crap, break up monopolies, legit social programs for the common man untampered by corporate profiteering, etc. (like FDR&#39;s New Deal) stuff that I think can be compatible in that anti-establishment region of the spectrum. Far left anarcho-communists (real communists, not Leninists, anarcho-communism has never existed) can also be reasonable, I just find their classless society ideology takes far too much work to start working correctly but I welcome anyone reasonable as my ally and offer clarification to extremists in the hope they can see reason and join sanity once they realize their perspective was distorted. Antifa give anarchists and anarcho-communists a bad name, these are freedom-loving anarchistic people that don&#39;t trust the gov but Antifa is infiltrated with SJW/violent shills
to paint anarchistic ideologies as &quot;molotov man violent and SJW&quot; which is a bullshit stereotype made for TV. </p>

<p>Anyway I agree with you that violence is not the way. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a NeoNazi or spiritual hippie or hardcore feminist SJW or whatever. Hitting someone because of their views is just screwed up. Reasoning with each other is the most legit way to wake people up, instead of insulting/hitting people.</p>

<p>The label &quot;progressive&quot; I assumed meant like proper left winger and not fake left? But Clinton called herself a progressive so that totally muddies the waters now for normies. I think some SJWs also make up a % of that label. But the ideology itself, I&#39;m not sure, it sounds sort of vague. Anyway r/progressive seems like a red flag as I&#39;m seeing a lot of SJW bullshit like feminism and focusing too much on racial shit. It&#39;s likely compromised just like r/socialism and r/latestagecapitalism which ridiculed and downvoted me like the shills they are, for going against their &quot;capitalism or socialism, choose one&quot; narrative which is bullshit, you can have both simultaneously (they know higher degreees).  Jimmy Dore is pretty good, haven&#39;t watched him extensively or recently but he&#39;s fairly reasonable. </p>

<p>The Young Turks used to be decent (agreed with maybe 80-90% of what they said, hated the SJW stuff that sometimes came up but also hated the retards and shills in the comment section always saying shit to start an argument) but as far as I can see, they&#39;ve gone really downhill since promoting Hillary after Bernie got rigged out of the primaries. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to say &quot;it&#39;s JUST the SJWs that are the problem! They crazy!&quot; because that essentially ignores
the problems of &quot;conservatives&quot; &quot;NEOconservatives&quot; &quot;alt right&quot; &quot;white nationalist&quot; &quot;NEOliberal&quot; and other flawed right wing strains that some have fallen for. What we have to do is, fix problems on ALL SIDES. Democratic socialists should reason with authoritarian Leninists, general left wingers should reason with SJWs and get them to see feminism/white privilege/EXTREME-political-correctness is bullshit and not left wing. And free speech is not to be feared: if someone says something retarded, it will speak for itself. As long as violence isn&#39;t being promoted, they should be free to speak their mind.</p>

<p>Moderate right wingers should reason with the corporate ass kissing NEOliberals, &quot;tax is theft&quot; extremists, racists, corporatists, cronyists, etc. Real progress doesn&#39;t mean abominations/twisting society. It means stuff that improves the quality of life. None of this &quot;the patriarchy&quot; bullshit, it&#39;s the elites that are the problem, not merely the fact that they&#39;re usually male, but their power and psychopathy.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get manipulated by crap you see on YouTube and the corporate media. We need to unite
rather than demonize and point fingers. But definitely I see extreme right economics as more of a danger to workers than SJW shit that
doesn&#39;t really get traction (feminazis don&#39;t have any real power hahaha) but SJWs can certainly be annoying, organic or shills, either way. 
A lot of pundits use &quot;conservative&quot; when they&#39;re talking NEOliberal shit like deregulating the markets to give corporations more power. Conservative has become meaningless like Liberal. 30 years ago lib and con would have meant something totally less retarded.</p>

<p>Anyway there&#39;s always going to be minor disagreements (wedge issues mostly) but we can accomplish much by just calmly slowing down, maybe that will make feminists rage less since it seems to be a fight or flight response lol (i.e. anxiety? Maybe they can&#39;t help being aggressive as they feel threatened because of their brainwashed worldview?). We have to lead the example, the reasonable non-SJWs, non-corporate boot lickers, pro-working class &#39;woke&#39; people. Non-authoritarian center left, centrist and slightly right wingers. We can really wake people up by showing how extremist the retarded modern Dem/Repub/Libertarian parties are.</p>

<p>E.g. &quot;hey alt right people, stop blaming the immigrants for what the corporations are doing, they literally move the jobs to wherever has
low worker protections so they can exploit the shit out of them like slaves, although mass immigration isn&#39;t necessary anyway&quot; and &quot;hey feminists, your ideology is not the same as equality so we&#39;ll have to disagree there, but think about it, is it better to focus on tiny differences at best, between pay between men and women or the giant elephant in the room, EXTREME income inequality across ALL WORKERS of ALL RACES, BOTH GENDERS, etc. Don&#39;t let the elite manipulate you, Males are not the enemy, banksters are, look up this shit! While we
argue about silly crap, they&#39;re laughing all the way to the bank!&quot;. We can find common ground in logic like this.</p>

<p>We need to be friendly and stuff like potential allies. &quot;We the people&quot; sort of alliance or comrades if you will (it&#39;s not only Leninists that use this friendly term). But don&#39;t believe anyone on TV, (pundits are usually full of bullshit) it&#39;s all corporately controlled and based on psyops/cults of personality/money making agendas like book deals and shit. I don&#39;t trust any mainstream &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; pundit because
they seem to be extremist establishment two-party system ass kissing puppets (economically or socially). </p>

<p>The corporate media all lied about French president Macron the Rothschild banker, for example. They said he was a &quot;centrist&quot; hahaha
he&#39;s actually an extremely right wing shill who wanted to remove worker rights, give tax breaks to billionaires, etc. Hence
why people were protesting against him in France. He&#39;s a shill for the super rich.</p>

<p>But yeah man let&#39;s try to separate economics from social issues and real left wing from SJW. There&#39;s astronomical differences between them. Clinton is an SJW (muh glass ceiling) but economically extremely right wing (NEOliberal wallstreet-corporate puppet). We also need to make a distinction between
&quot;left wing ideologies&quot; and &quot;people who <strong>think</strong> they&#39;re left wing&quot;. Democratic socialism written in a legit political science book isn&#39;t going to change, but people who think they&#39;re this or that, can morph into whatever if they&#39;re influenced by the lying corporate media. Centrism also deserves a voice. Moderate politics scares the shit out of the elite. Extremism helps push their agenda.</p>

<p>So yeah we can try to sympathize with each other and figure why someone believes some bullshit.
If all else fails in negotiations, we can just agree to disagree and then suggest removing money from
politics, nationalize the FED, remove secret societies/CIA from gov. Lol tell SJWs that nazis
were imported into the U.S. via operation paper clip, that would help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost agree with you, but I think you&#39;re viewing it through a particular lense. I, like the other user, wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the guy, nor am I of people like Musk, Neil deGrasse Tyson. I respect that they&#39;re all very smart guys and have contributed toward the advancement of science and been great communicators to the public, but they all come off as gatekeepers. They promote certain avenues of science while completely disregarding/dismissing other avenues. They&#39;re all &quot;mainstream establishment scientists&quot; and tend to push a certain agenda alongside the topics they talk about, rather than simply promoting &quot;the scientific method&quot; as it is and applying that everywhere workout bringing biases into the equation.<br/>
I do realise how some people can see the push-back against these establishment figures as &quot;anti-science&quot;, but I think that&#39;s just people not looking at it hard enough. Also, I realise that some people actually do go so far as to think &quot;well if X establishment scientist said it then I don&#39;t believe it because he&#39;s a fake!&quot; simply because they have lied and/or misled in the past, similarly to those who think &quot;well of the MSM said it then I don&#39;t believe it because MSM is fake news!&quot;. But thankfully these types people are in the minority. I believe, based on my encounters and interactions with people on the topic, that most people who are critical of certain mainstream scientists and public figures are critical because of the agenda that appears to be pushed by these types, and not because they are &quot;anti-science&quot;, which is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot to discredit people. </p>

<p>This makes me think either something screwy happened (involving the elites, e.g. murder, euthanasia, deliberately chosen date, in hiding/immmortality shit lol) </p>

<p>or it being significant in a numerology/astrology/spirituality/synchronicity sort of way.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because the theory is stupid. It&#39;s rare to live long with als but it happens and the stuff they point out like fake teeth and hands is easily explained as Hawking just trying to look somewhat normal. They also say he looks different as he ages. No shit not everyone is Keanu Reeves. But if you  look at his ears they are always the same shape. And surviving AlS for so long is explained because we just don&#39;t know everything there is to know. We just don&#39;t. Medically we are pretty limited when you really think about it. Yes we can do some amazing things but the understanding of why some people survive disease longer than others or how to cure disease is a long ways out. </p>

<p>Its actually ironic you chose black holes as a untestable theory when we are in the midsts of a landmark observation right now: <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/star-orbiting-milky-way-supermassive-black-hole-sagittarius-a-einstein-relativity">https://www.sciencealert.com/star-orbiting-milky-way-supermassive-black-hole-sagittarius-a-einstein-relativity</a></p>

<p>The whole, and only, argument are making is that his appearance changed. By that logic, I can make the claim that actress Renée Zellweger was replaced by an alien.When you point out that she obviously had plastic surgery, I would argue out that &quot;No one changes <em>that much</em> from plastic surgery.&quot;</p>

<p>We have no idea if it degraded his intellect or not. We have no way of knowing the words credited to him are his. For all we know it could be a collaboration of several people who push their theories and ideas out under his name.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t have all that many people who were truly close to him and interacted with him often enough to know if something weird was going on. His only way of communication was through a computer that theoretically would be pretty easy to control. He would have no way to alert people if something truly was going on.</p>

<p>2 people can keep a secret. Sometimes 3 people can. You’re talking dozens, minimum.</p>

He is here to promote his website and YouTube channel. He charges $20+/mo for his website where he claims to be the “worlds leading skeptic”. </p>

<p>Check his post history, he attacks other users to prove his intellect and then surreptitiously inserts links to his website or husband videos that reference his site or podcast he is on.</p>

<p>He got banned from crypto subs for shilling. FYI he is likely John Le Bon.</p>

<p>He believes that’s if he does not understand something it must be fake. He isn’t very bright and undereducated so he doesn’t get most things. So he doesn’t believe in atoms, nukes, missiles, round earth, the sun, planets, stars, space, gravity, dinosaurs, evolution, all of history, all wars, all mass casualty incidents, etc...</p>

<p>tl;dr He is here to shill his website, confuses ignorance with skepticism </p>

<p>Thanks, newfriend.</p>

<p>Personally I find it amusing that so many &#39;awake&#39; people still believe that Hawking is (was) a real guy, just as presented to us by the telescreen.</p>

<p>But I remember when I was first exposed to this idea, I too was repelled by it, so I try to be sympathetic.</p>

<p>We are all on different paths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if your response is serious or not but I will answer regardless. Just because someone comes up with some stupid ass, random idea in their head, doesn&#39;t mean it should be considered for legitimate discussion on here. The example I came up with in my original post is literally no more ridiculous than what this thread&#39;s post is and yet, you should be able to see the point I am illustrating.</p>

<p>Someone clearly just randomly had a stupid fuckin idea to get Karma and posted it. I come here to engage in actual well thought out, logical discussion. You guys are constantly crying on here about all the hate you get from other subs and yet, you legit stick up and validate a stupid fucking non sense post like this as if it actually is worthy of debate. This person just randomly had a thought about Hawkins because he just died and people on here are acting like it&#39;s worthy of discussion. </p>

<p>Posts like this make this sub look bad and discredit any legitimacy this sub has to offer.</p>

<p>You are correct in that I should not of come off so negative. For that I seriously apologize. However, this is such a blatant ridiculous no sense post just because someone had a brain fart of a random idea and decided to post it here and people give it legitimacy.</p>

<p>This post was literally just a &quot;What If&quot; based on NO ideas as to HOW or WHY it could be true in the slightest. Any conspiracy, if it&#39;s to be considered seriously, should BY NECESSITY, have a freakin WHY or HOW in it. Not a random erratic thought based on nothing.</p>

<p>My example of the Sky Lights is something I randomly pulled out my ass and yet, it holds the same credence this post does. I mean for christ&#39;s sake, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s something like this someone form TopMinds would post just to get a laugh at your guys expense?? Come on man</p>

Is it probable? Probably fucking not.
Is it plausible? I guess this depends on your own opinion, in my opinion it is not plausible, so I wouldn&#39;t start digging holes if I were you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but theres a bigger grey area as to what they lied about. With Hawking, its pretty binary, either hes been legit or they pulled a weekend at bernies on him. There is a clear and opposite alternative theory (or fact, however you want to look at it)</p>

<p>With Osama, you cant really confidently lock into one alternative explaination. Did he orchestrate it by himself? Did he cospire with the Saudis? Did he have nothing to do with it and take credit? Did he have nothing to do with it and we faked videos to make it look like he took credit? Did the administration orchestrate 9/11? Did they know someone else orchestrated it and let it happen? I could go on, but i hope you get my point.</p>

<p>Its hard to say how many people are lying about 9/11 and what they are lying about whicu, in my opinion, makes it easier to get away with</p>

<p>I would personally think of this as a good thing, and I don&#39;t think for one second that it precludes learning about new things (OR spewing half-baked nonsense).</p>

<p>There are idiots doing it, as well as very smart people, but by and large, entertaining a notion regarding just about anything is the definition of an open mind and a prerequisite for progress, in my view. </p>

<p>We need more people who dare to think unthinkable things if we ever want to come up with new things and ways of doing them. There&#39;ll be offensive notions too, of course, and countless idiotic ones, but don&#39;t knock it, brother. It&#39;s the essential muck we see the most valuable flowers spring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand what you&#39;re saying and appreciate the logical response, but I guess I have a very different opinion of what this sub should be.</p>

<p>The reason I joined the conspiracy sub is because I think, mathematically speaking, taking into account the history of people and the enormous width of character the human race has displayed that conspiracies, on some level, should occur, even if in small numbers. </p>

<p>But you also need to factor in the fact that people are people. Some people are balanced, some are too forgiving, some are too quick to shoot. </p>

<p>And I also believe that just pointing at everything and saying &quot;conspiracy&quot; is just as bad as believing that there&#39;s no such thing. It&#39;s almost a boy cried wolf situation. My understanding is that&#39;s been a CIA tactic for many years.</p>

<p>So while I appreciate you want to foster a community of acceptance, I don&#39;t feel the same requirement when talking about the topic of conspiracy because I feel it&#39;s almost our duty to be just as diligent with dealing with false flags as we are with dealing with the real ones. That is, misinformation is just as bad as ignorance.</p>

<p>After reading the article, it seems to me that calling Mr. Hawking a “misogynist” is more than a bit over the top based on the information presented. Somehow not mentioning your wife in a speech, refusing to talk about your disability 24/7 with her, disagreeing with her on religion, and having her and your children help your completely paralyzed self throughout your life is indicative of a “master and slave” relationship? I laughed, honestly.</p>

<p>Yes we know, everybody did that heard of him. You didn&#39;t give a proper answer though. I assume he meant as to why he lived for so <em>long</em> as the avg life expectancy is roughly 2-5 years. Stephen Hawking outlived that by 10x fold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, Hawking has his eyes to the stars. There are more pressing concerns for Hawking than the petty political activities of humans on Earth. Still, as an intelligent and famous man, Hawking has been asked his opinion on various political matters, and though he’s reluctant to give it, there have been a few issues of interest to Hawking.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>In March 1968, Hawking marched alongside Tariq Ali and Vanessa Redgrave to protest against the Vietnam War.[315] He was a longstanding Labour Party supporter.[316][317] He recorded a tribute for the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore,[318] called the 2003 invasion of Iraq a &quot;war crime&quot;,[317][319] supported the academic boycott of Israel,[320][321][322] campaigned for nuclear disarmament,[316][323][317] and has supported stem cell research,[317][324] universal health care,[325] and action to prevent climate change.[323] In August 2014, Hawking was one of 200 signatories to a letter opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#39;s referendum on that issue.[326] Hawking believed a United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) would damage the UK&#39;s contribution to science as modern research needs international collaboration, and that free movement of people in Europe encourages the spread of ideas.[327]</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t consider any of those political views significantly controversial. Where exactly do you think his influence lied?</p>

If you start looking places for conspiracies you&#39;ll find them wherever you look regardless of whether something is going on or not. You should instead assume everything is as it seems, and then conclude there is something going on only after you have reviewed the facts.</p>

Hawking may be similer to that of a person in a vegitative state, but it doesn&#39;t mean he is. He has a condition where he can&#39;t do shit with his body but his mind is completely unaffected.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I have to say this because that term is a pet peeve of mine - A vegetable is something you eat, not a person. The term you are thinking of is someone being in a vegetative state, which Stephen Hawkings was not. He was severely physically disabled though. </p>

<p>You would be shocked at how advanced communication devices for the disabled are nowadays. Eye gaze devices alone are changing the world for people who are physically disabled but cognitively functioning. </p>

<p>Your question of him living to 76 years old though, that I can get behind!! Besides the fact that his disease was progressive, the damage to his body was so extensive. My guess, he had access to experimental treatments that us “normal folk” don’t have access to. </p>

<p>Conspiracy? Possibly! Wealth buying longevity with his health? Most likely!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can honestly tell you how he lived so long.  For starters, he had some of the best care available for a person afflicted with ALS.</p>

<p>Second, ALS can progress and progress and then all of a sudden stop.  Granted, that isn&#39;t always the norm but there are definitely plenty of cases where this happens.  </p>

<p>The reason I know this is my father was diagnosed with ALS almost 5 years ago but almost all of the damage is relegated to his upper extremities. He has almost no use of his arms and hands, however, his legs have not been affected at all.  So while he can&#39;t drive and severely struggles just to put a fork to his mouth, he can walk for miles with no issue.</p>

<p>The thing with ALS is that it makes you a prisoner inside your body.  Your mind can be sharp as a tac while your entire body fails around you.  There is a version of the disease called &quot;bulbar onset&quot; that do affect your mind though.  It leads to people experiencing dementia type symptoms before the body fully starts to break down.  Much like how Huntingtons disease works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other people you listed are all much better known for popularizing science than for doing science themselves. Einstein absolutely is regarded by physicists as being one of the most important physicists of all time. The development of both special and general relativity was complex and involved various individuals (this is true of most scientific theories) but it is pretty widely agreed that Einstein made the most significant contributions in both cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He earned his nobel, but it wasnt for relativity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many important scientific contributions have not earned Nobel prizes. There are only so many of them to go around, the committees tend to be somewhat conservative (i.e. they mostly award older work that has been definitively verified), and they avoid making posthumous awards, so plenty of things get overlooked.</p>

<p>My understanding is that Einstein&#39;s Nobel was deeply controversial. Some people thought he deserved the award for special relativity, but others still doubted relativity, and others opposed him due to antisemitism (this was around the time that the Deutsche Physik movement was getting started). He was eventually awarded it for his (important) work on the photoelectric effect as a compromise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ALS is not a single disease. It is a group of diseases that cause atrophy of motor function but the neural location of onset, implicated genes, and familial nature differ among the different subtypes. Hawking&#39;s case is obviously not the hum-drum sporadic type that is most commonly diagnosed in late adult life.</p>

<p>The average age of diagnosis for ALS is 55 years old. Hawking was diagnosed at 21 years old.
Early-onset ALS correlates with a much better survival time. The 10-year survival rate is 10%. The 20-year survival rate is 5%, which is low, but its not as if people never survive a long time. Remember the average age of diagnosis is 55 years old so most are older when they get the disease and won&#39;t be living 20+ years anyways.</p>

<p>The more likely answer to his 40+ year survival is that he was diagnosed so early, allowing for a better prognosis AND he does not have a rapidly progressing form of ALS. Most patients are not diagnosed so early, so Hawking was already an anomaly from the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i find it interesting how he survived so long. even if he had a &quot;rare case&quot; i&#39;d be interested to know more details and why not many people talk about the fact he was the longest survivor of the disease. he was told he had 2 years. he survived 57. why does this seem to only be a sidenote and hardly ever mentioned by the media? like he was a complete medical miracle. i don&#39;t understand why, after his intellect and talent, his incredible survival isn&#39;t one of the first things that comes to mind. there&#39;s a whole spectrum of theories and i&#39;m open minded to most from he just got stupidly lucky and there&#39;s actually no funny business, to he received elite medical treatment unavailable to the general public, to he died and was replaced.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve also wondered how we can verify the stuff he &quot;said&quot;. could some utter bastard not just turn off the eye tracking thing so stephen couldn&#39;t control it, then programme it to say whatever they like and pretend it&#39;s him saying it while he has to sit there like a lemon? you can tell a fair bit from his body language (like he often smiles when making a joke, which leads me to believe it is him), but no one can be certain.</p>

<p>i think with all his conspiracy theories, his death could be a defining factor. if they were replacing him with an imposter or similarly &quot;preventing&quot; his death, why have him die now? i&#39;d keep up to date with current affairs and make sure theres nothing we need to be distracted from. if the next few days reveal a motive, i&#39;d be very suspicious 👀</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did he live so long in the first place, given the condition with which he was afflicted?</p>

<p>Great question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we never saw him talking, how do we know it was not a case of somebody else typing those words into his voice machine?</p>

<p>Who would that be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How could a person who allegedly typed with muscles in his mouth possibly write so many books?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He knew he had something to give to the world, and limited time to do it.  I imagine if I could only move my mouth, I wouldn&#39;t spend the effort shitposting and sharing buzzfeed articles, you know?  The guy had grit.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s play that out.  You now run the Secret Global Cabal, and you have a team of scientists talking through Stephen Hawking&#39;s voice computer.  Besides a mean hoax, what are the other motivations for doing this?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>you have a non-threatening face to your agenda.  I don&#39;t know what that agenda is.  Science education, maybe?</p></li>
<li><p>maybe other people with disabilities have something to aspire to.  That&#39;s not a bad motivation, but I can&#39;t see that being a primary one.</p></li>

<p>Maybe. All I&#39;ve EVER heard about Stephen Hawking was that he was the most brilliant/intelligent man in the world but all I ever saw was a carcass in a chair speaking like a robot. I&#39;ll be honest and say I never read his work or sought out any of his lectures sans a few minutes here or there, but yeah it could be a joke. </p>

<p>Hawking has spoken about his past consideration of suicide. He died on Einstein&#39;s birthday... It just seems like the right time, you know? I mean, I wish he didn&#39;t <em>(duh)</em>.. but if I were in his shoes and wanted to go, I guess that would be the day I picked to die! Either way, it&#39;s an interesting cosmic coincidence.</p>

<li><p>Died on 3.14  same date as Albert Einstein.  Yah ok.  Coincidence?</p></li>
<li><p>His voice box was made to sound like a robot, or more like himself before he lost his voice.  Why not his voice when he was fluent?  You can make a voice box able to read his eye/mouth movements, but you can&#39;t make it sound like anything but a robot.  Yah, ok.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone who tried to get him as a guest speaker had to be vetted first.  Oh and He also costed a fortune to get.</p></li>
<li><p>Outlasts all other ALS people, by like 50+ years.  LMFAO  Yah ok.  Must be using his mind to keep himself alive.</p></li>
<li><p>All of his interviews where per-recorded.  Otherwise he would be explaining things to you for hours if not days to get out a paragraph.  Basically his handlers could make him say anything they wanted him to say and what was he gonna do about it if he didn&#39;t like what they made him say?  Nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>He got younger looking as he got older after 1985.</p></li>
<li><p>They used him as a prop, for the Globe theory; and the creation myth; and the Alien agenda.  (Globe is a myth....prove it without CGI) (Creation theory = Two nothings come together to make something.....everything.) (Alien Agenda = part of creation myth.  believe in the universe and you believe in Aliens who are demons....but you can&#39;t believe in demons or you must believe in god.)  God exists = Albert Einstein was right.  Hawking death over Einsteins is their way of saying Hawkins over Einstein = Big Bang over gods creation = Satan over God.</p></li>
<li><p>They used Stephen to promote the Globe.....Even though the Real Stephen before they shut him up; didn&#39;t believe in it!</p></li>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How did he live so long in the first place, given the condition with which he was afflicted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple: he likely didn&#39;t have what everyone adamantly claimed he did.</p>

<p>British doctors use &quot;motor neurone disease&quot; as a generic umbrella term much like &quot;cancer&quot;.  It is <strong>not</strong> directly equivalent to &quot;ALS&quot; that Americans talk about - ALS is <em>a</em> motor neurone disease, not Motor Neurone Disease.</p>

<p>These diseases are not easy to diagnose even now, let alone in the early 1960s.  1960s doctors in Britain were also terrible - just completely up themselves and not hugely competent.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s been suggested he might actually have had MS (although the diagnosing physicians claimed it wasn&#39;t), but another theory is MMNCB (Multifocal Motor Neuropathy with Conductive Block).</p>

<p>That and MS are orders of magnitude more likely in someone of his age at diagnosis.  However, the differentiating test for MMNCB didn&#39;t exist in 1963 and the condition itself basically didn&#39;t exist as a result, simply because nobody could test for it.</p>

<p>MMNCB has no impact on life expectancy and can actually be managed and brought under control to limit impact on everyday life.  Many MMNCB patients take years to become fully disabled, if it happens at all.</p>

<p>Based on his symptoms, age of onset, and the progression of his condition... this isn&#39;t a ridiculous suggestion.  Hawking was possibly misdiagnosed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What did they do about his colleagues though? All of this is fascinating until you realize that what they&#39;re doing is not simply &quot;manufacturing some huge pile of equations&quot; as Mathis puts it. Even if modern physics is only mathematical masturbation (as it may be) that doesn&#39;t make impersonating a world class physicist as simple as learning the Greek alphabet. There are thousands if not tens of thousands of qualified physicists and mathematicians who&#39;s entire life is nothing but their work and they certainly would have <strong>no</strong> problem with outing a charlatan, they love shooting people down. This is assuming that there are some physicists and mathematicians who don&#39;t work for the NWO making up equations to &quot;look smart&quot;. I hope everyone can agree this is obvious.</p>

<p>If one could show that some, if not most of Hawking&#39;s colleagues were all inexplicably replaced in the mid 80s I could maybe stretch it but did the actor review the necessary material of role-playing a mathematical physicist? Is he well versed in the modern developments of pseudo-riemannian metrics, principal bundles or symplectic geometry?</p>

<p>I know some may doubt it but my intention by rattling off a bunch of math lingo was not to bolster some &quot;I&#39;m smarter than you&quot; fallacy, I&#39;m simply listing a few <em>measly</em> aspects I have a vague understanding of which would need to be mastered to successfully place a fake Hawking into a top mathematical physics community.</p>

<p>The simple version: As specious as the claims of theoretical physics may be math is still a real thing with people discovering new things to this day and an actor wouldn&#39;t last a minute in a discussion on the level people like Terrence Tao and Ed Witten communicate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is something fringe for you (and the truth): Hawking <a href="http://milesmathis.com/hawk3.pdf">died and was replaced</a> wih a double [pdf]. It is pretty self-evident when you compare the pictures, and when you read about that one fateful night.</p>

<p>But also, realize such a handicapped / caricatural man (speaking through a computer) is a tremendous asset and marketing tool (in this day and age when victims are heroes). He was (still will be) used in every possible setting to spread doom porn, to advance the transhumanist agenda, and generally to advocate for the central planners’ goals.</p>

<p>The well-known lecture <em>Life in the Universe</em> is one among many examples (and perhaps one of the best known). See <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/life-in-the-universe.html">here</a> for the whole thing. It is worthwhile reading it in full and realizing the amount of fallacies, inconsistencies and nihilist (and indeed morbidly materialistic) ideas that are put forth herein. </p>

And surviving AlS for so long is explained because we just don&#39;t know everything there is to know. We just don&#39;t. Medically we are pretty limited when you really think about it. Yes we can do some amazing things but the understanding of why some people survive disease longer than others or how to cure disease is a long ways out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost agree with you, but I think you&#39;re viewing it through a particular lense. I, like the other user, wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the guy, nor am I of people like Musk, Neil deGrasse Tyson. I respect that they&#39;re all very smart guys and have contributed toward the advancement of science and been great communicators to the public, but they all come off as gatekeepers. They promote certain avenues of science while completely disregarding/dismissing other avenues. They&#39;re all &quot;mainstream establishment scientists&quot; and tend to push a certain agenda alongside the topics they talk about, rather than simply promoting &quot;the scientific method&quot; as it is and applying that everywhere workout bringing biases into the equation.<br/>
I do realise how some people can see the push-back against these establishment figures as &quot;anti-science&quot;, but I think that&#39;s just people not looking at it hard enough. Also, I realise that some people actually do go so far as to think &quot;well if X establishment scientist said it then I don&#39;t believe it because he&#39;s a fake!&quot; simply because they have lied and/or misled in the past, similarly to those who think &quot;well of the MSM said it then I don&#39;t believe it because MSM is fake news!&quot;. But thankfully these types people are in the minority. I believe, based on my encounters and interactions with people on the topic, that most people who are critical of certain mainstream scientists and public figures are critical because of the agenda that appears to be pushed by these types, and not because they are &quot;anti-science&quot;, which is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot to discredit people. </p>
