And the propaganda campaign is targeted now at gun owners, or average everyday americans. The disarming-campaign and propaganda is explicitly targeting the young. The youth and the children. Mind control always starts with the very young, the next generation.</p>

<p>Remember that these people are not in a hurry. They plan agendas to be carried out over centuries. Collectively capturing and polluting the minds of the &#39;next&#39; generation is how they can sell ANY lie to the masses. Our parents shake their heads in disbelief at our ww2 revisionism (they cannot intellectually unlink it from hatred, racism and bigotry). Kids nowadays are bombarded with &#39;school massacre&#39; bullshit hoaxes and when they are in their 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s, anyone defending gun rights will be inseparably linked to &#39;hatred, violence, bigotry&#39;.</p>

<p>Every grand lie in human history has been hieved into the collective consciousness in this manner. By infecting the minds of the next generation with it.</p>

<p>Ive seen/heard the mocking phrase, &quot;They didn&#39;t come for your guns&quot; soooo many times, but, always from folks that have an attention span of about 1 day.  If they didnt see it happen yesterday, it probably never will, in their line of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are very well developed already and only getting better, I want to assure you first of all, that none of this is over your head, not even the deepest number part, cause you really don&#39;t need to know any math to understand.    Basically for anything to be money there needs to be scarcity, we could not have money flow online like information has since the internet because anybody can copy information and we cant have people duplicating money, bitcoin solved the duplication problem, basically by time stamping a transaction through the act of making all the computers that have downloaded the program solve the same problem. that is basically it.  this basic recipe has been changed a little for the online platforms that have a currency and the ones that have a different purpose all together,  steemit.com is one, the russian steemit is just as good cause its an exact copy, its called &quot;golos&quot; here you can see the best currencies that already exist coinmarketcap.com only a handful of them are platforms though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice description man, to add to that about blockchain ; if a government doesn&#39;t like you they tell the bank to freeze your money, they can do that because the bank is the central control of fiat currency, what a blockchain does is take that option off the table;  it takes away control from a central point and distributes it to everyone on the network, the implications of this is going to change the world economy, which I&#39;m happy about, but history shows that no change of this magnitude is particularly pleasant for the common people living while it happens and especially when it involves taking power away from the central bank, we are probably going to be around when it happens: I would say we are figuratively in the 1910&#39;s right now, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/federal-reserve.asp">1907</a> = 2009 as I see it ; banks consolidating power, we all know what happened after</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree on the adoption part, but the implications blockchain has for global finance isn&#39;t going to be pronounced until like the internet, the genie can&#39;t be put back in the bottle, I think we are not even fully realizing the monumental shift the internet has put in motion for the global society, the same way crypto will for global finance; historical events aren&#39;t necessarily viewed as such while they are happening, it&#39;s usually when the later generations look back on it its significance becomes clear</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are going to continue to chip away at the small elements of gun ownership, such as ammo types, magazine capacity, stock type, barrel length so over time people&#39;s choices of self defense will be severely limited. They will also push to integrate mental health issues with background checks...soon there won&#39;t be a citizen alive who hasn&#39;t been diagnosed with <strong>something</strong>, whether it&#39;s ADD, depression, autism, or simply being a sicko that believes in conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>The enforcers who work for the state however, such as the military and more importantly the local police will of course be armed to the teeth. They <strong>won&#39;t</strong> be banned from firearm ownership despite having tendencies toward aggression and sociopathic traits...the state needs these types.</p>

For three years there about
Got wounded in four places
And I starved at Point Lookout
I caught the rheumatism
Campin&#39; in the snow
But I killed a chance of Yankees
And I&#39;d like to kill some more
Three hundred thousand Yankees
Is stiff in southern dust
We got three hundred thousand
Before they conquered us
They died of southern fever
And southern steel and shot
I wish they was three million
Instead of what we got
I can&#39;t take up my musket
And fight &#39;em down no more
But I ain&#39;t a-goin&#39; to love them
Now that is certain sure
And I don&#39;t want no pardon
For what I was and am
I won&#39;t be reconstructed
And I do not give a damn
Oh, I&#39;m a good old rebel
Now that&#39;s just what I am</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is anything people will avoid being, it&#39;s a hypocrite. What better way to bring them to your side of the argument than by tempt them with mass school walkout, even if they don&#39;t fully understand the issues they&#39;re protesting against, and in some csses, make it mandated they participate without opposition. Come election time, it will be so much harder for these kids to vote against a protest they participated in because they don&#39;t want to be hypocrites. Easy way to gain D voters and demonize RS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this is true, being a 21 year old I actually see both sides. Yes, there is alot if anti-gun liberals, but the more of them coming out, the more I see my peers reject that idea and cling firmly to the 2nd amendment. </p>
