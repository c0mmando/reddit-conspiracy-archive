Especially now that Russia is one leg in, one leg out of America&#39;s bed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This assumes those dissidents and potential dissidents don’t fully understand that Russia can get to anyone at any time, which is simply false. Do you think that former CIA members aren’t fully aware that the CIA could make them and their families disappear at any moment in time for any reason? So what makes this different? </p>

<p>And that’s not to mention that the guy poisoned likely worked with that same positioning agent in the past and knew exactly how it worked and what it was (based on his past - he went to the military engineering school and was in Russian special forces). Also, he was a double agent for the UK so if he knew about it then it stands to reason that the UK knew about it because his job was to give the UK information about things like that.</p>

<p>He was living in the UK since 2010 and was poisoned 8 years later? How is that showing anyone Russia can “reach them”? He was literally in their custody until 2010 and was traded to the UK so why didn’t they just kill him while he was in custody? </p>

<p>I think it’s way more likely that he was killed by MI6, or whomever, in an attempt to frame Russia. It’s likely that they found out he was 1. Still working for Russia as a spy, 2. Gave up some huge UK intelligence to Russia while he was a prisoner there, or 3. They needed a reason to blame Russia for something of which we aren’t fully aware of yet. The idea that a Russian spy wouldn’t be fully aware that he could be killed at any moment, especially when he was a double agent, is actually laughable; and that’s not even considering that he probably killed people in the same manner as he was killed, or at least knew of the capability. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The part where Russia actually did kill a guy with nerve agent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m almost positive this has happened before involving countries that weren’t Russia. So my question still stands, do you think Russian spies aren’t fully aware of the capabilities and “reach” of the government they work for? My analogy was relating the CIA to the KGB/whatever they call Russian spy agencies these days. A point which you seem to have missed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In which case the UK would arrest him and interrogate him to learn what he&#39;d revealed, and then charge him with espionage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily if they could use him as a patsy to make it look like Russia did it and put more hate on them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, or Russia just fucking did it, like they&#39;ve killed literally dozens of dissidents on foreign soil over the last decade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely possible. I wasn’t saying it was <em>impossible</em>, I was saying it’s mighty convenient that Russia has another finger pointed at them considering how everyone is blaming them for everything these days.. also, again, lots of countries kill people on foreign soil, not just the scary Russians...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the fuck is with the &quot;Russia is a country of saints&quot; shit here lately?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said anything of the sort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Word, okay, that must be the reason the mafia never <em>actually</em> kills informants, because everyone knows they could -- why, the idea of the mafia actually committing murder is <em>laughable</em>, obviously every potential rat knows they could be killed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rats spill information <em>despite</em> of the threat, not because it doesn’t exist. OP said Russia maybe wanted to send a message. My comment is that Russia doesn’t need to send a message because whomever that message was intended for already knows the implications/consequences. It doesn’t make sense to do so years after the fact. We are talking about 8 years and a heavy regime change from when he originally spied to when he was caught and jailed, and eventually sent to the UK. </p>

<p>If they wanted to send a message then why the fuck would they release him in the first place? Why not just torture him and kill him in Russia when no one would question it? Why go about it in this sloppy way when they are already on the hot seat? Does that make sense to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a pillar of Israeli Russophobic Argument. The Ukraine is not only squarely within Russia&#39;s sphere of influence, but the Crimea has always been administered by the Russians. If they didn&#39;t own it they&#39;d rent it. They have no other winter ports. The Crimea is the Houston of Russia and if America wanted to Federalize the Gulf shore of Texas it would be the same thing. </p>

<p>All notwithstanding the fact It doesn&#39;t affect Americans in the slightest. </p>

<p>&quot;What Russia does to Ukraine&quot; was the last thing they used to try to stir up Anti-Russian Sentiment in American. And who is <strong>they</strong>? Is it the Poles or Lithuanians or anybody from NATO? No, it&#39;s Israel and Zionists. They have wanted to strike Iran for a decade and Russia is the only thing that stands in their way. So, is it the Polish or Lithuanian Lobby pushing Russian sanctions in congress?</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s the Jewish Lobby who makes the Crimea their business and worse, the American people&#39;s business all because of Russian support for the Arab League against Israel. Let&#39;s not fool ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all, I&#39;m not saying that Russia cannot be behind the case. It probably is. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just kind of suspicious how fast and straightforward this whole thing unfolded and now, just after a few days, the whole Western world is allied in condemning Russia for their attack and planning for retaliation. Again, I&#39;m not saying they cannot be behind it, this just raises thoughts about how easy it would be to false flag an attack like this. Just aim a chemical Russia is known to manufacture to a Russian national, and immediately you can accuse Russia for a chemical attack in your own soil.</p>
