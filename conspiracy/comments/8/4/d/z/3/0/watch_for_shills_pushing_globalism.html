    <div class="md"><p>Oh my god, you talk like a moron. Globalism DOES NOT EQUAL what you are trying to explain nor what I am emphasizing. It’s not solely a capitalist conspiracy. In fact, the end game is to generate a socialist dystopia and capitalism is the vehicle used to achieve that. What I am saying is, a nation cannot retain its nationhood if it is ethnically cleansed. It will be weaker the longer it is divided. Thailand and many countries in Asia are still far away from being globalized. They trade among each other, but they still have strict immigration laws. They are distinct. But now they are slowly being diversified. This is how globalism works it’s way in, and through other things.</p>

<p>Capitalism is already making them rich beyond all comprehension, socialism would only get in the way of greater profits down the line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I am saying is, a nation cannot retain its nationhood if it is ethnically cleansed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nations and ethnicities are fictional divisions of the working people of the world. Your capitalist masters love it when you focus on these illusions instead of the <em>actual</em>, objective, material conditions that divide you from your masters/owners.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It will be weaker the longer it is divided. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The division is between masters and owners. Divisions of race, ethnicity, creed, religion, etc, are all delusions which the capitalist class gladly exacerbates and exploits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blah blah immigrations and ethnonationalist bullshit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve been duped beyond recognition, I pray that one day you&#39;ll come around and see how you&#39;ve been deceived and distracted.</p>
