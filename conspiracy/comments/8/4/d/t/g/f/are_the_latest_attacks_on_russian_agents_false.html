<p>To those who are convinced that Russia is currently the major &quot;bad actor&quot; on the world stage right now: If they are smart enough to manipulate an entire US election, why would they use an &quot;exclusively&quot; Russian-developed nerve agent that ostensibly could be tracked back to them?</p>

<p>If Russia indeed was responsible, why is the UK hurling dangerous accusations before the facts are all in?</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t more people questioning the UK&#39;s pronouncement?</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t more people entertaining the possibility that this event was manufactured for an excuse to whip up more anti-Russia sentiment?</p>

<p>With the prevalence and increasing voracity of the fake news phenomenon, it&#39;s disturbing to see entire governments make bold accusations before all the evidence has been considered (see Trump&#39;s actions after the &quot;gas attack&quot; in Syria).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea it really is disappointing. But then again, I have to wonder how many people actually believe them. I think a lot of what we are seeing is shilling and manufactured consent via the media.

    <div class="md"><p>As I just posted elsewhere in another similar post.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/11/22/finally-we-know-about-moscow-bombings/">They did it before with the Russian apartment bombings.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Residents of an apartment complex had reported unusual activity in the basement and observed that three people in a car with partially papered-over license plates had unloaded sacks whose contents they couldn’t make out. A professional bomb squad arrived and discovered that the sacks contained not only sugar but also explosives, including hexogen, and that a detonator was attached. After the sacks were examined and removed, they were sent by the local FSB to Moscow.</p>

<p>The entire apartment building was evacuated. Local authorities found the car used by the three who had planted the explosives, a white Zhiguli, in a nearby parking lot. <strong>To their astonishment the license plates were traced to the FSB. And when they apprehended two of the suspects, it turned out that they were FSB employees, who were soon released on orders from Moscow.</strong></p>

<p>After a day and a half of silence, Patrushev announced on television that the apparent bomb had been part of a “training exercise” and that the sacks contained only sugar. The local Ryazan FSB and regular police, who had been combing the city for more explosives, expressed outrage. In the words of one police official: “Our preliminary tests showed the presence of explosives…. As far as we were concerned, the danger was real.”</p>

<p>A central question involved the materials used in the explosives. The day after the first Moscow apartment bombing, an FSB spokesman said that both hexogen and TNT were discovered. Patrushev himself confirmed this in his September television interview. But by March 2000 the FSB had changed its story and claimed that hexogen had not been used in the bombs. <strong>In fact, several Russian investigative journalists were able to demonstrate that hexogen was the key ingredient in all of the bombs and that hexogen can only be obtained from Russian government facilities under the control of the FSB.</strong> According to Novaya gazeta reporter Pavel Voloshin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The targets, perpetrators and zakazchiki [those who gave orders] of the terrorist acts can be determined by the provenance of the explosives. <strong>The circulation of explosive substances in Russia is under strict state control…. To “conceal” a supply of hexogen by skirting the existing rules is de facto impossible.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>People should look into the apartment bombings, yes. That has no bearing on the recent events though. The apartment bombings in Dagestan served as a catalyst to move troops into Georgia and Chechnya. </p>

<p>If anything, this move would reflect poorly on Putin as it&#39;s unfolding right before an election. The apartment bombings cemented his power, but these assassinations would make people question the validity of his power and potentially lead to fewer votes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your opinion.</p>

<p>In my opinion Putin constantly displays himself as the overt representation of masculinity in Russia. He literally says in interviews defectors face death. Because the Russian voter is deeply nationalist and has been fed Putin propaganda for at least 20 years.</p>

<p>&quot;So what if some traitor spy gets poisoned? He shouldn&#39;t have betrayed Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>Making a mockery of the west is nothing but a vote winner for Putin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it would reflect badly on Putin in Russia in terms of approval ratings. I think the people there genuinely do approve his strong man tactics, because they think it&#39;s at least better than what was going on before Putin was in power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that there is no political motive to conduct this operation now. Power has been consolidated and cemented and parallel institutions have been created so there&#39;s no need to go after someone years after the fact, especially when the Intel the man possesses is undoubtedly no longer relevant or actionable. </p>

<p>There was motive for the apartment bombings, but there isn&#39;t a clear motive in this instance. With this in mind, the election is largely irrelevant, and that isn&#39;t directly contradicting any point I&#39;ve brought up so far. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Russia isn&#39;t responsible for poisoning him, just that there are myriad alternative explanations that are equally reasonable, that also allow for a clearer motive to be shown. I have a Russian degree, and am no stranger to the state&#39;s atrocities both past and present, but haven&#39;t seen anything clearly illustrating Russia is behind this particular event. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you exactly how the apartment block bombing affect current reality.

    <div class="md"><p>I hear that, but the same people pushing this talking point have also been claiming that Putin doesn&#39;t allow fair elections, which seems redundant if he already has the support of his people. (I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re making this claim, just addressing it&#39;s been a talking point here today.) When both those ideas are pushed simultaneously, I&#39;m led to believe someone is using weak premises to push a pre-drawn conclusion. </p>

<p>That being said, Putin is cunning and ruthless, and I don&#39;t at all doubt many were &quot;impressed&quot; by the apartment building debacle. The crux of what I was saying however, is that the apartment building bombing was used to push an aggressive foreign policy and cement power. There is no need for that now, so I find this move to be incredibly curious, if it was in fact Russia that did this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know hos much support he has, but it appears more than when the people were out protesting the apartment block bombings. Elections there certainly are not fair. They have a board that decides if people can run at all. But, then elections here aren&#39;t fair either.</p>

<p>So how do we clean both of these things up? </p>

<p>Vladimir Putin got in because Boris Yeltsin was widely despised and seen as a sell out of Russia. </p>

<p>You could also so that Donald Trump got in because Hillary Clinton was widely despised and seen as a sellout of the people.</p>

<p>Regardless of exactly how true we believe these claims are, one thing we should all agree upon is that the cure appears worse than the disease.</p>

<p>I am tired of people diagnosing problems and then providing cures that are worse than the disease.</p>

<p>We need to get Donald Trump and his cabal out of power and we need to do so by making progress -- not by slipping back to a Hillary Clinton type. That is the challenge.</p>

<p>You&#39;re putting words in my mouth.  Never said that.  Stay on topic.<br/>
Although you do post constantly attacking Russiagate, but you don&#39;t wait for the results of the investigation before calling it all a farce.  Now you&#39;re upset that an entire nation makes up their mind without waiting for all the information.  Street goes both ways.  You only think it&#39;s unfair when it&#39;s against Russia.</p>

<p>If they are smart enough to manipulate an entire US election, why would they use an &quot;exclusively&quot; Russian-developed nerve agent that ostensibly could be tracked back to them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putin is a spook gangster turned president. He has 0 compunction in murdering dissidents. He wants everyone to know it was him, sort of a &quot;what are you gonna do about it?&quot; deal. </p>

<p>As you identify Putin successfully manipulated the US election. This attempted assassination tests the relationship between the UK and the US and NATO all the while Putin looks like a boss to Russians as they approach an election. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Russia indeed was responsible, why is the UK hurling dangerous accusations before the facts are all in?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes when a bully throws dirt in your face, you have to talk tough. Putin has got away with too much already and someone must act. It just so happens he chose the UK to test the waters. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why aren&#39;t more people questioning the UK&#39;s pronouncement?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn the opposition leader in the UK literally questioned May today at PMQs. He asked why the government weren&#39;t following the chemical weapons body process. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why aren&#39;t more people entertaining the possibility that this event was manufactured for an excuse to whip up more anti-Russia sentiment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that is extremely unlikely. Its not like Russia needs help in looking bad. </p>

<p>Also Putin has literally told defectors they would find death wherever they fled to. </p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>That is their official position. If you think that can be taken at face value I&#39;m at a loss for words. There are many things wrong with this narrative.</p>

<p>First is the erroneous comparison to Litvinenko.</p>

<p><a href="http://truepublica.org.uk/united-kingdom/not-told-russian-spy-sergei-skripal/">http://truepublica.org.uk/united-kingdom/not-told-russian-spy-sergei-skripal/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a major difference between Alexander Litvinenko and Sergei Skripal, which is not being reflected in the media. Litvinenko was a good man who attempted to expose abuses of power within Russia, in defence of the rights of Russians. Skripal is a traitor who sold the identities of Russian agents abroad to the UK, in exchange for hard cash. This may very well have caused the deaths of some of those Russian agents operating in conflict zones. If this is indeed a poisoning, there are a great many people who may want Mr Skripal dead – nor in this murky world should we overlook the fact that he must have known interesting things about his MI6 handlers. “Litvinenko II” is rather too pat and obvious, and could be a false flag set-up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, like I mentioned, there was a British government chemical weapons research facility 8 miles from the scene of the crime:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nerve agents including Sarin and VX are manufactured by the British Government in Porton Down, just 8 miles from where Sergei Skripal was attacked. <strong>The official British government story is that these nerve agents are only manufactured “To help develop effective medical countermeasures and to test systems”.</strong></p>

<p>The UK media universally accepted that the production of polonium by Russia was conclusive evidence that Vladimir Putin was personally responsible for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. In the case of Skripal, po-faced articles like this hilarious one in the Guardian speculate about where the nerve agent could possibly have come from – while totally failing to mention the fact that incident took place only eight miles from the largest stock of nerve agent in western Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skripal was also pardoned by the Kremlin and was part of an exchange with the US. Why did Russia then decide to use an obviously Russian-originiating neurotoxin to murder a retired spy who they allowed to leave?</p>

<p>This reeks just like the repeated Sarin gas attacks.</p>

<p>The nerve agent  wasn&#39;t even exclusively Russian.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moonofalabama.org/2018/03/theresa-mays-45-minutes-claim.html">http://www.moonofalabama.org/2018/03/theresa-mays-45-minutes-claim.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existence of these chemical agents was disclosed in 1992. Russia joined the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction in 1997. It has since (unlike the U.S.) destroyed all left over stocks from the Soviet Union&#39;s chemical weapon program. It does not produce chemical weapons.</p>

<p>These agents and their formulas are not an exclusively Russian knowledge or product:</p>

<p>One of the key manufacturing sites was the Soviet State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology (GosNIIOKhT) in Nukus, Uzbekistan. Small, experimental batches of the weapons may have been tested on the nearby Ustyurt plateau. It may also have been tested in a research centre in Krasnoarmeysk near Moscow. Since its independence in 1991, Uzbekistan has been working with the government of the United States to dismantle and decontaminate the sites where the Novichok agents and other chemical weapons were tested and developed.</p>

<p>The formulas for the various Novichok agents are not a Russian secret. The U.S. and the UK surely know how to make these. The agents are said to be made from simply components used in civil industrial processes. (To qualify any agent as &quot;military grade&quot; is by the way nonsense. Many chemical agents used in civil process are also incredibly deadly.) The Porton Down chemical weapon laboratory of the British military is only some 8 miles away from Salisbury where the Skripals were allegedly poisoned.  The British government claims that Porton Down identified the agent allegedly used on the Skripals. The laboratory is surely also capable of producing such stuff, just like similar laboratories in other countries are able to do.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t know that Putin got popularity from that actually, can you shoot me a link on this? And regarding those bombings, it is pretty much accepted that Putin and the FSB <em>at the very least</em> knew beforehand it was going to happen.

<p>I&#39;m really not too sure.
The only thing that stands out to me as odd is the fact that the nerve gas was Russian-made. I somewhat doubt that the Russians would use their own gas in their own attack. It&#39;s too obvious.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe they wanted to be found out?
It&#39;s possible that Russia has wanted to cut ties with the UK for a while now but didn&#39;t want to be the one to actually make the break.</p>
