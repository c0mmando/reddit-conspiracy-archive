        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So we&#39;re supposed to believe that Russia wanted to kill this double agent, and in order to do that they&#39;re going to use a nerve agent developed IN RUSSIA.  Oh, and so far they&#39;ve failed, the guy didn&#39;t even die yet.  </p>

<p>This just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  If you want a spy dead and want to be sneaky about it why are you going to use a weapon that supposedly only you have access to?  And if you&#39;re not concerned about getting caught (since you clearly aren&#39;t by using this special weapon) why not just shoot the guy on the street or bomb him and make sure he&#39;s dead instead of this lame poisoning attempt?  Or at least use some poison that&#39;s stronger?  </p>

<p>Smells like a setup to me.  I&#39;m not suggesting Russia wouldn&#39;t be willing to kill a traitor but I would think they would be more competent about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did it before with the Russian apartment bombings. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Residents of an apartment complex had reported unusual activity in the basement and observed that three people in a car with partially papered-over license plates had unloaded sacks whose contents they couldn’t make out. A professional bomb squad arrived and discovered that the sacks contained not only sugar but also explosives, including hexogen, and that a detonator was attached. After the sacks were examined and removed, they were sent by the local FSB to Moscow.</p>

<p>The entire apartment building was evacuated. Local authorities found the car used by the three who had planted the explosives, a white Zhiguli, in a nearby parking lot. <strong>To their astonishment the license plates were traced to the FSB. And when they apprehended two of the suspects, it turned out that they were FSB employees, who were soon released on orders from Moscow.</strong></p>

<p>After a day and a half of silence, Patrushev announced on television that the apparent bomb had been part of a “training exercise” and that the sacks contained only sugar. The local Ryazan FSB and regular police, who had been combing the city for more explosives, expressed outrage. In the words of one police official: “Our preliminary tests showed the presence of explosives…. As far as we were concerned, the danger was real.”</p>

<p>A central question involved the materials used in the explosives. The day after the first Moscow apartment bombing, an FSB spokesman said that both hexogen and TNT were discovered. Patrushev himself confirmed this in his September television interview. But by March 2000 the FSB had changed its story and claimed that hexogen had not been used in the bombs. <strong>In fact, several Russian investigative journalists were able to demonstrate that hexogen was the key ingredient in all of the bombs and that hexogen can only be obtained from Russian government facilities under the control of the FSB.</strong> According to Novaya gazeta reporter Pavel Voloshin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The targets, perpetrators and zakazchiki [those who gave orders] of the terrorist acts can be determined by the provenance of the explosives. <strong>The circulation of explosive substances in Russia is under strict state control…. To “conceal” a supply of hexogen by skirting the existing rules is de facto impossible.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are consequences, the consequences are happening now.  And I&#39;m sure that anyone who planned to use a nerve agent (WMD) in a public place knew the kind of worldwide revulsion that would take place.  This is why it appears not to benefit Russia, but benefit Russia&#39;s enemies,.  </p>

<p>It has successfully achieved exactly what it was intended to achieve (ie. worldwide revulsion, distancing of all world leaders incl. Trump), with the knock-on effect of causing Corbin issues and probably will lower Labour in the polls.  I thought Russia played a careful geopolitical game, played the game like a game of chess, this is the opposite of that. There are no immediate or even longterm gains to make from a move such as this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Russia did it and wants everyone to know it (intimidation)</li>
<li>Someone is framing Russia in a false flag</li>
<li>Russia did it so that May would take the bait. This is making her very popular in the UK - right at the time that even her own party was turning on her. This will reinforce the wedge between the parties in the UK, which is in line with Russian agitprop</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Who gains?</p>

<p>Immediately all Western leaders are supposed to back the UK in condemning Russia and Putin, will Trump?  If he does, he&#39;s distanced himself from Putin which many have wanted him to do, if he doens&#39;t he loses face in the US.</p>

<p>Will Corbyn denounce Russia and Putin? Not yet, he&#39;s asked for evidence.  All ready we have many Labour MP&#39;s against their leader and more of the usual anti-Corbyn headlines about him being a a Putin supporter.  Just when Labour are several points ahead in the polls.</p>

<p>And finally, the usual anti-Russia rhetoric throughout the Western world.</p>

<p>Yes, it does seem fishy, especially when Putin appears to gain nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Trump is whatever. He&#39;s a temporary world leader who has no idea what he&#39;s doing. Putin will outlast him and play him for everything he&#39;s worth. I lived in the former Soviet Union for a time and those Eastern European states have known that Russia&#39;s intention was to reclaim them. They told me that 10 years before Crimea. They know what&#39;s coming. They&#39;ve lived through it before and are prepared to fight and die to not be part of Russia again. We saw that in Ukraine in 2014 (which people seem to have forgotten about) Russia is Hardly a harmless player on the world stage. </p>
