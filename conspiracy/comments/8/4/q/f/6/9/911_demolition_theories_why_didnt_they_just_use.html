       This mainly concerns the theories that say the impact of the planes wasn't what brought the towers down and that there was more going on behind the scenes. I'm talking about the twin towers, not WTC7. Theories like the buildings were rigged with demolition charges, had thermite canisters to weaken structural supports, the planes were giant cruise missiles, a tactical nuke was used or the planes were holograms and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all based on the premise that the impact of a 767 is not enough to, by itself, damage the towers to the point of collapse. So my question is, if it was truly orchestrated by a centralized organization, why didn't they just use a 777, A340 or 747? Or if even that wasn't enough to bring the towers down, why not a C-17, KC-135 or C-5 packed to the brim with fuel/munitions and claim that it was the victim of a Fedex 705-style hijacking by an Al Qaeda insider in the USAF? What's the need to add thousands of additional engineering/demolition personnel and hundreds of possible points of failure to an operation that had only one chance to succeed?

       From an engineering perspective the "pancaking effect" the NIST report put out is impossible and can't explain the speed of the buildings fall into it's own footprint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions have been asked about the molten steel and fused molten concrete that kept the ruins hot for 2 months. This shows that AV gas or kerosene as an accelerant for the fires may not have been the only source.
Why did they find Nano Thermite in the dust. It goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't they use bigger planes? They could have used a Cessina (Which is what the Hijackers trained in.)

       They found isotopes related to a mini thermonuclear reaction to according to I think it is Dr judy woods.
      </p>
      <p>
       She believes it was direct energy and may have been but I do know Ra115 suitcase nuke was declassified a long time ago and upgrades on them over years could be huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use certain material with short radioactive half life's and maybe some direct energy weapon bc the building did turn to dust..not just concrete.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overhead views look like a nuclear plant after meltdown if you side by side compare and actually burned longer than a full nuclear meltdown so it definitely makes one wonder.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have very powerful nukes with small radiation half life and some with long radiation half life. Short means undetected after a few weeks or month..long means uninhabitable for 700-1000+years.
      </p>

       Did you know the two companies lockheed martin skunkworks and boeing  (iirc) wanted to do a merger but feared the public would realize the insane power they have and go against it. So they continue working as 2 separate but doing the same things. It's in the lockheed wiki buried in the text somewhere convenient and harder to find.

       That's not even including raytheon or any of these...

       I have read literally everything there is to read on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       LIHOP, MIHOP,  false flag, the Jews did it, controlled demolition, no planes, mini-nuke, space lasers, all of it.

      <p>
       The evidence points to the US government complicity with the help of Israeli, Saudi, Pakistani and UK cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The twin towers was an Israeli/US operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pentagon was strictly a US operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shanksville was unintended due to a late departure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The planes were swapped with drones. The passengers were executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The twin towers were brought down with controlled demolitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pentagon was attacked using explosives with a flyover to simulate an impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shanksville was delayed at the gate and had to be taken down before US interceptors spotted the ruse.

       What first triggered my BS meter about the pancaking effect as described was the relatively small pile of rubble compared to the mass of the two

       Dimitri Khalezov a Russian expert in Nuclear demolition came out with a convincing thesis that they used a shaped charge style nuke under the buildings.

       The amount of first responders with Thyroid cancer supports this.

       There's no plane big enough to turn a 110 story skyscraper into a pile of ash and dust. A big plane would knock a chunk out of the building to maybe even blow the top off, but it wouldn't turn the building into a pancake at ground level.

       Why do demolition crews use the methods they do?  Because they work.  If you want to bring a building down with certainty, you probably want to use methods that are tried and true.

       There's far less risk of failure by hiring a small demolition crew then there is trying to use a plane or plane + explosives to knock down a building.

       I think they knew that planes wouldn't reliably bring down the two buildings, but you can't paint a story out of a handful of terrorists systematically rigging a building for demolition.  I've heard several options on the planes whether they were real or not, but I don't think it's a crucial part of the story.  There seems to be plenty of people that seem to have seen them or plane like objects or whatever, so I tend to believe that a plane did indeed crash into each tower.  I would guess that they were flown by remote control.

       Most people report "it was a military plane" no windows matte grey blue tip..the media can do a lot with what you see.

      <p>
       Msm is connected to hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just seen a Dave chappelle comedy club act he randomly showed up at and ended up doing a 3 hr show...
      </p>
      <p>
       he says "you know who brought them towers down?"
       <em>
        hesitates and says naw I cant say
       </em>
       then says fuck it 
"Ashton kutcher brought them down"...he's not laughing with the crowd
"You just been punked?! That's what I think happened on 911"
      </p>
      <p>
       He's being serious as can be without dire tly pointing fingers or saying what he knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       He follows up with "Truth isn't a privilege in america..nobody is entitled truth. Truth is earned..and if I told you some of the truths I earned you would call me crazy"
      </p>
      <p>
       He also goes on and says "what if these rapes aren't the worst things going on in hollywood..wouldn't that be something?"
      </p>
      <p>
       He goes on to say people won't come out because the normal environment like us wouldn't understand when a headline comes out saying "so and so did this" buy doesn't include the fact people are being blackmailed,forced,slaved abd entrapped from what he is hinting at.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claimed if the public could look past some of the things that happened in hollywood abd the person who did it...and understood they did it for a reason. They may not even have wanted too..but that's not how it'll go. They will just say hey this guy grabbed a pussy and touched some woman without consent (just examples) and wichunt that person and have no idea WHY people are doing crazy things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short HW is sick and twisted but if you wanna make it you have to fit in that environment and might see or even be forced to do some things you normally wouldn't and if people knew the truth and didn't witch hunt the puppet but went after the puppeteer...people would come forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some deep shit to say and having to say it all indirectly or make it into a joke. People laugh too and you can see Dave isn't laughing like most times its like he's thinking...I'm trying to give you a glimpse of reality and you think it's funny..that's why he's so fucking good at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get your Africa tickets ready..think about how he walked away from 50mil bc of something. Rumor was they didn't want to let him run his own skits and maybe there's a reason.
Maybe that 50million contract had to be signed in blood in some way..who knows but
      </p>
      <p>
       "The worst thing to call sombody is crazy,it's dissmissive.
       <em>
        I don't understand this person so they are crazy.
       </em>
       that's bullshit because people are not crazy. They are strong people,maybe thier environment is a little sick."

       I watched his recent Netflix specials.  He is definitely trying to tell us things, but also trying to make sure he's not too direct so they don't suicide him.
       <br/>
       I bet he's slightly looser doing a show that's not being taped.  Thanks for the re-cap.

       The planes were for theatrical effect. They can not bring the buildings down on their own.

       The buildings were designed to take multiple impacts from a 707.

        These are all based on the premise that the impact of a 767 is not enough to, by itself, damage the towers to the point of collapse.

       No.  All of the 9/11 theories are based on observational evidence of what happened on that day and in the weeks and months preceding and following -- things such as molten metal pouring out of the side of the building, people being warned in advance not to go to work, Israeli "art students" in the building and outside to "document the event," renovation work, policy papers signed by administration officials calling for a "new Pearl Harbor," security lapses, denial of involvement by bin Laden, nonsensical wars, and evidence of foreknowledge in media and elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the 777 wasn't even in production in 2001.

       My kids were 9 and 11 that day. The younger one said "why didn't they crash the plane lower. So it would tip over on the rest of New York"

       I told her not to say that at school. She will get in the "special classes". Jockied by a failed psychiatric student. Great.

       I think that underground nukes may very well have been used. It would account for the collapses, getting the core out of the way, and the temperatures.

       And if it was as Dimitri Khalezov stated they would have been well contained in the underlying rock. Leaving less tritium and other traces of a detonation.
