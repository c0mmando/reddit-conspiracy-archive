       I reread the rules and this seems to be well within the guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time jewish over representation is brought up in a serious discussion I always hear an apologist claim jews have an average IQ of 115 vs 100 for whites as an explanation.  In my own experience living in LA and NYC for 20 years jews are not noticeably smarter than whites their success is due to a cultural focus on money and power and extremely high (often illegal) tribalism.  As such I looked into the source of this apparent myth.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The average IQ score of Ashkenazi Jews has been calculated to be from a range of 110–115, higher than any other ethnic group in the world.[1][2][3]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jewish_intelligence">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jewish_intelligence
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Already the 115 number is an exaggeration, however even 112.5 would be the highest in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears most of the studies that calculated this are not going entirely off IQ testing instead they are working backwards from jewish over representation to justify it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "During the 20th century, [Jews] made up about 3% of the US population but won 27% of the US Nobel science prizes and 25% of the ACM Turing awards. They account for more than half of world chess champions."
       </p>
       <p>
        USA (today): Ashkenazi Jews comprise 2.2% of the USA population, but they represent 30% of faculty at elite colleges, 21% of Ivy League students, 25% of the Turing Award winners, 23% of the wealthiest Americans, and 38% of the Oscar-winning film directors.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Other, more legitimate, studies show the average IQ to be a more reasonable number, but still tied with some of the higher IQ Asian populations.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “The Intelligence of American Jews” in 2004, says it is “only” a half-standard higher: 107.5.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This could still be used to account for a significant over representation among ivy league students vs a 100 IQ population, but while the average IQ of the US is 99, that doesn't mean the average IQ of whites is 100.  I was unable to find IQ studies for US whites alone (that would be racist), however we can look at states white are 90% white.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Massachusetts 104.3
       </li>
       <li>
        New Hampshire 104.2
       </li>
       <li>
        North Dakota 103.8
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       vs states that are less than 60% white.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        California 95.5
       </li>
       <li>
        Louisiana 95.3
       </li>
       <li>
        Mississippi 94.2
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So it would appear that the actual white average is around 104.    So 107.5 vs 104 isn't really a big deal and certainly not enough to explain away 1000%+ over representation in various fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore Israel has an average IQ of 95 despite being 2/3 Ashkenazi, for the 115 number to be true all of the other groups including Haredi jews would have to have IQs in the 65 range.  Considering that Israeli minority groups are mostly known to be in the 85-95 range this would indicate that even the 107.5 number is a bit high and that 103-104 is more reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally we know that jews were not thought of as particularly bright or scholarly prior to the 1900s.   It wasn't until there was a conspiracy among jewish owned publications to present Einstein (who was considered by his peers to be a mediocre plagiarist) as the paragon of intelligence that the idea of jewish intellectuals even existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion it appears there has been a successful conspiracy.  Most people parrot the 115 number and use it to excuse all sorts of bad behavior without ever verifying it.

       Everyone is about as smart as everyone else, it is mostly a matter of where you direct your intellectual focus. Misdirecting people's focus is the best way to make sure they are squandering their faculties.

       So, TPTB want everyone to belong to some kind of cult. It can be a social cult, a religious cult.. whatever. Something people can hyperfocus on other than corruption and fixing the system.

       This is just not true.  In everyday interactions most people may seem to be on similar footing, but once you start dealing with very abstract concepts it rapidly becomes clear that some people have extremely divergent intellectual capacity.  IQ is amazingly predictive of things like income level and criminality.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a civilizational level you see average IQ being very meaningful.   If you tell me the average IQ of a nation I'll be able to tell you with a high degree of accuracy the nature of their government, the level of crime, the level of corruption, the health of their economy and many other factors.

       Within an ethnic and religiously homogeneous society income can reliably predict both criminality and IQ.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a multicultural society things like race and religion are far more predictive than income or economic conditions.   It's very hard to separate these things because they are all interrelated.  Wealthy black neighborhoods in LA and NYC will generally have higher crime rates than dirt poor white areas of Appalachia.

       The difference between people who have had at least a cursory introduction into the literature and those that have an uninformed reaction to IQ research is outstanding. Is there anything in the field of psychometrics or any other social science with the same predictive power as

       Not really.

      <p>
       IQ is a subjective measurement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people are better at certain things than others and that speaks to specialization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there people who are smarter than other people? Yes.

       If you really want to get into it, try to look for studies that measure IQ and race.

       The point is that most people are smart enough to function in society and squander their resources.

       Meh. IQ is bullshit. I’m sure that people with higher IQs are more prone to sociopathic behavior and that most obvious sociopaths have high IQs. I’m not sure where exactly I’m going with this, but I think that median IQ plus or minus ten or fifteen points is where the vast majority of the population sits. Outliers are outliers. The majority are average and their IQ doesn’t really mean much of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The study of IQ based on race or ethnic background is really just dick-stroking for the “higher” ones and an excuse to shit on the “lower” ones. It needlessly reinforces prejudice and gives people a false sense of their use in the world, which is something that isn’t dictated by your IQ being ten points higher than someone else’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really is a cover for tribalism in this case, tbh.

       The average IQ of a population is very meaningful in a political sense.   For example a shift of only about 5 points can have a dramatic effect on people's susceptibility to propaganda and their ability to understand concepts such as the importance of freedom of speech.
      </p>

       Many people theorize that western politicians are trying to dumb down their electorate for this reason.

       I'm high IQ. I attended the 16th ranked school in the country on merit of passing an entrance exam which had IQ, math and language elements. It was both inherited and nurtured. Much behavior and ability is inherited. There is no escaping that, but practice improves the element you are practicing. A memory game I used to play as a child was pairs. You can usually tell people who are well read because their eyes are drawn closer together, some people attribute this as a sign of intelligence, but it's actually a result of the eyes practicing focus on a point - although intelligent people do tend to read more...

       A muscle is not a good comparison.    Intelligence works more like height.   Sure a malnourished person won't grow to be as tall as someone who eats healthy, but overfeeding them will not make them grow taller.
      </p>
      <p>
       Studies have shown similar results with intelligence, you only need moderate stimulation to reach nearly all of your genetic potential.

       You are considering intelligence as one thing. It is a combination, each of which can be developed like a muscle can. Memory, processing speed, pattern recognition and so on can all be practiced.

       Well, the individual is a bit false, a misnomer. You have a body, it is made by a pattern. The specifications of your body are predetermined by this pattern. One term is DNA, or you could call it the egg, sperm combination, the cell, the soul or whatever you want. The point is, that the body you have is made to follow a specific predetermined pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your parents were custodians of this pattern until they created another incarnation of it by mixing their patterns together which subsequently created your pattern which generated you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The individual you, is not really you. You are the pattern and should you have children, that pattern will live on in them. The individual you is simply the sum of environmental influence since you were born. You, don't really exist except as a temporary container, custodian of the pattern.

       I managed to get a 115-120 IQ after completely bombing on an IQ test and literally not caring.  These judgements are far more subjective than they let on, and based almost entirely on classist, racist, and cultural assumptions more than anything else.  The psychologist testing me probably couldn't accept that I was a dumbass given my background, so he was more or less obligated to put me in the above average range.  Once an initial judgement is made at a young age, future judgements are based on that initial assessment and those who have a lot of ideology invested in IQ-theory do not want to admit that their testing is flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bear in mind, I'm not even talking about the potential difficulties with gauging an intelligence quotient in the first place, I'm talking about the test-givers bias - and given how much is one the line when someone is IQ tested, just about everyone in the process is going to game the test and the system to produce a desired outcome.  I only scored as high as I did as a child because my mother trained me to the test, knowing what it entails, and it was impressed upon me that, if I failed the test, I was going to be taken out of my home and put in a place - something that almost happened on more than one occasion.

       Even the inventer of the IQ test, Alfred binet would tell this:  the test is an employee obedience test.  In his own language he defines intelligence as acquired knowledge, it was invented to help administrators decide who would adapt best to their employee training school.  those that scored low were spared schooling.  nowadays we're so well trained to be suck-ups that we're supposed to believe it's due to our smarts.

       To those that say IQ is bullshit... some tests of IQ are bullshit, sure... and intelligence is not everything. Intelligence + effort + humility = Awesome, but if you are missing any of these, someone with a lower IQ will outperform you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, when doing predictions in the social sciences, there is no measurable factor about a person that can more accurately predict performance on a variety of tasks... especially complex and abstract tasks such as engineering and chess.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot stand working with a developer who doesn't have high innate intelligence. They pick up new products too slowly, and they make far, far too many errors in implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
       At most software companies I have worked for, there is some variant of an IQ test, although they never call it that. Algorithm puzzles usually fill the gap.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last place I worked, we all took IQ tests for fun, on our own. 120+ (typically 130+) for all developers... and 110-125 for every non-developer who played along. The only person who thought it was bullshit was the dude who got 110.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most IQ tests I've taken don't even require you to know English... language is irrelevant. They typically show you 3-8 pictures with one missing piece, and they ask you to guess what the missing piece is.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my experience, the greatest factor in success is effort... but the greatest factor that you can actually gauge during an interview is innate intelligence. Almost all Silicon valley companies test for intelligence when dealing with developers. Even the sjw cesspools test you, and if you score well, you make more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not stupid. The ultra-liberals among them HATE that it predicts performance, but it does. If you have an 80 IQ, you can't even get into the Army. You're not even smart enough to use as cannon fodder.

       I find it both funny and sad when someone says "I believe in science" but then gets to reject IQ literature and it's social/political implications. It's basically the gold standard of psychometrics and the application of statistical techniques in the social sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beats whatever statistic someone pulls out of an online article to prove how their opinions are conveniently 'correct'.

       I would much more respect someone who criticizes the method out right in favor of some other way of gaining knowledge. I have a complete disregard for people who 'like science' in so far as it conveniently supports their world-view.

       I worked at Microsoft in the early 2000's. Every 4 years, the world cup would come around, and I would read a couple articles and have "intelligent" debates with real soccer enthusiasts... but they always amounted to me spouting some bullshit that I read, and relying on my rhetorical skill to make me seem thoughtful on the subject.

       Yeah I could be totally wrong here but I can also be fine with that possibility. What is important to me is to be able to ask good questions.

       Honestly anyone could be subject to this Dunning-Kruger effect. How to know when someone is actually right or full of it? Appeals to authority or any other useful fallacy don't cut it for me anymore. The best bet is to have a humble attitude and not get all holier than thou if you happen to be smart IMO, while recognizing how much of your potential is limited by the social matrix and TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways about IQ research what I find fascinating is it's actual predictive power and it's logical consistency within the framework of statistical analysis. If you think the methodology is valid (which I currently do) then IQ research provides one of the best examples of the technique in action.

       Ironically most people who criticizes christians for example claim that they are somehow better than them because they lack belief in a religion. In most cases they say that they base their worldview on 'science' (without being scientists themselves in any field). I feel that they have this conviction because they have conveniently been shielded from some  of the harder to process theories put forth by actual scientists and are glad that their cosmopolitan world view is backed by the limited science they get exposed to. Everyone likes to watch a good old 'science guy' on TV don't they?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder what would happen if they were to be exposed to some of this harder stuff such as race &amp; gender differences in IQ. It's all fine and dandy if all you look at is normal distributions of the weights of goldfish. I would like to show them a graph that would rock their world. Have them explain how they reconcile that shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record I am not Christian and I am not racist. I happened to find my first book on the subject when I was young and happened to pass through the usual filters that keep this literature in a form of esoteric science.

       I particularly enjoyed this comment. Most people who are dogmatic about science can't tell you what 'standard deviation' means, but they are completely confident in a number of scientific conclusions that I find preposterous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like... plate techtonics, global warming, and the composition of the sun. They say things like, "You know, we are living in a 9 dimensional universe, and I agree with the Copenhagen interpretation".
      </p>
      <p>
       NO YOU DON'T! You have FAITH in those things, but you can't even imagine what a 9 dimension universe even means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the conclusions of science are downright wacky. Schrodenger created a thought experiment to show just how daffy QM is, and most people think he was trying to EXPLAIN QM with the thought experiment.

       Totally there with you man. I have had the exact same experience talking about soccer with coworkers. I think that if they applied just a fraction of the attention they devote to sports ball they would progress so much faster within our technical field. Another disclaimer: I'm Latin American but I couldn't care less about fútbol.

       The other day I had an argument with a colleague and a team lead about whether or not basing your worldview on science is a form of religiosity. I asked the team lead what he thought science was and he started saying "well you have your hypothesis and null hypothesis...", now I couldn't say the things discussed in this thread but they were in my head the whole time.

       I've worked with maoists before and dogmatically they call Marxism a science. I have a live and let live attitude so I don't care if they need a godless ideology to politically justify their modern emperors (just keep that shit away from my republic). But the Marxism I saw in China was indistinguishable from a political religion to me and now I look at the west with a different perspective.

       Hahaha I also have my reservations about all the things claimed about Quantum Mechanics. By the time I saw that the people behind The Secret were using it to explain their... secret...was the time I noticed the bong breath and the hippy playing the bongos in the background.
