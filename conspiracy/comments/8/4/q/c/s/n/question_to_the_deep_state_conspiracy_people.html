       So I don't believe in the deep state theory. I believe that there is unorganized resistance to Trump by people within the government that don't believe in him, but this is from regular individuals within the government's many divided agencies that do not talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a deep state, where are the leaks? We have seen so many leaks from Trumps team, the (not-deep state) democrats, and so much more that suggests a whole lot of stuff about the government. But if you believe that there is a massive network that spans from CNN to the DoJ to the CIA (to high schoolers in Florida), then you have to assume that
       <strong>
        a whole lot of people
       </strong>
       are in on this. Where are the leaks? Even with Trump's team, there are accusations of people Trump himself put into place leaking stuff to the press. Surely the huge network of a deep state and its pawns that it uses for action would have at least one credible leak.

       The shadow government (cryptocracy, secret government, or invisible government) is a family of conspiracy theories based on the notion that real and actual political power resides not with publicly elected representatives but with private individuals who are exercising power behind the scenes, beyond the scrutiny of democratic institutions. According to this belief, the official elected government is subservient to the shadow government which is the true executive power.

       Trump documents are all over it. Especially recently. If you even care, you'd go through it, but I find most people who are staunchly anti-Trump lack the ability to the research to back up their words.
      </p>

       If you want dirt on Trump start with Mercer or Nagacorp or the casino in Laos.

       "Deep state" or "5th column" has been used in RU to turn the people against political opponents of the state. The individuals don't necessarily even have to outed as being part of a secret group or society... they just get accused of it and the state sponsored media drills it in the heads of the plebs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't the case in the US yet, but it's damn frightening hearing Trump talk about a "deep state" as if he's laying the foundation for something.

       Start with the 7th Floor Group. Theres axtually stuff you can find on them and they actually called themselves the deep state. Plus theres the Koch Bros, Soros, Gates, Zuckerberg, etc. Its not just some crazy fantasy. Big money buys big actions.

       "Deep state hiding in plain sight, Bill Moyers"
      </p>
      <p>
       So, assume you're someone who wants to "leak" something.  Do you think miraculously, you'll be given some platform to spread this leak if say, you are given the chance?  How?  In the form of Q gibberish nonsense?  On some radio station?  (all owned by billionaires).  In a newspaper?  (All owned by billionaires.)  On TV?  (All owned by billionaires, and corporations that like the status quo just fine.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ray McGovern was part of what you could call the deep state, an insider for many years, and now he's shunned and hardly gets any exposure even if he tries.  He was also beaten for simply turning his back on HRC for turning his back on her, during a speech.

       See, I firmly believe that if there was actual evidence of a deep state, anybody who has the ability to leak it can give it to Breitbart, Fox, or Wikileaks and it would go out and those organizations would have a field day promoting it. The "who would listen" argument doesn't work when a significant portion of the populations believes it or when theres large news organizations willing to publish it, like fox or breitbart. So yeah, I think your response ignores that truth.

       It depends on the nature of the leak, and who leaks it, doesn't it?  As well as the proof they can provide.  Evidence, including video and audio can be faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Breitbart?  Really?  That's funny.  I read just yesterday, that they have rabbi Schmuley Boteach as a columnist.  If you want to see a real POS in action, look that guy up.
      </p>
      <p>
       FOX, LOL! They would only be interested if it's something damaging to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks would be the only option.
      </p>
      <p>
       There very much is a "deep state".  Sounds ominous and kind of like a B movie, doesn't it?  But anyone with the capacity for abstract thought should at least be able to see by now that this country isn't run "by the people".  That means we've got a deep state, who are really people like the Rothschilds, Adelson, Lauder, the Koch brothers and billionaire families who attend the meetings in Davos, among many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know that there are literally a dozen or more lobbyists for every member of congress, and you still don't think there is a deep state?

       See, I'm not arguing with this. I'm arguing with the anti-Donald Trump deep state theory. Guess I should have been more explicit about that.

       It is hard to estimate how many there are.  Certainly not everyone, but you do not need everyone to be aware of it.  You just need to infiltrate the higher levels with Freemasons, for example, who give orders to those below them and head off any investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You only need a few dogs to herd hundreds of sheep.  The lower level people are often unwitting participants.  They just see that they are being told to do something that does not make sense and they assume that their boss knows what he/she is doing.  This is the mentality of people who gravitate towards government jobs, and it is why they are hired in the first place.  I, for example, would never be hired because I ask too many questions, and would be considered to be a pain in the ass.  I am not an order follower.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at DC, the City of London, and Vatican City, you will notice that each one are Corporations and each one has an obelisk.  The Worldwide headquarters for Freemasonry is located in the City of London.  Look at the front of the IRS building in Maryland.  They put statues in front that are related to Freemasonry.

       The different countries are also corporations.  The different states in the U.S. are also corporations.  The cities and towns are also corporations.  Pretty strange, right? Some cities and states may not be corporations.  I have not looked at them all, but some are commonwealths.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States of America is really the United States of America Corporation.  Who are the shareholders?  Who owns and controls the United States of America Corporation?  They are the ones that get our tax money.

       Maybe instead of calling it the "Deep State" we should call it the "Deep Corporations".
