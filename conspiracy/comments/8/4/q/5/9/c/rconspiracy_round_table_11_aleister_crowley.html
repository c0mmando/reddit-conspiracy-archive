    <div class="md"><p>Gunderson isn&#39;t a primary source for any of the shit he talks about, with the notable exception of the McMartin tunnel. It seems more than likely the tunnel was a hoax, and I also find it EXTREMELY troubling that he&#39;s recommending William Guy Carr as THE GO TO SOURCE for information. Carr flat out lied about some pretty heavy shit, aside from the fact that pretty much nothing in his book is sourced, at all. So, yeah, I&#39;m saying &quot;be careful who you listen to&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>also remember Aleister Crowley&#39;s role in Rocketry and the Scientology movement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After a brief involvement with Marxism in 1939, Parsons converted to Thelema, the English occultist Aleister Crowley&#39;s new religious movement. In 1941, alongside his first wife Helen Northrup, Parsons joined the Agape Lodge, the Californian branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). At Crowley&#39;s bidding, he replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons was expelled from JPL and Aerojet in 1944 due to the Lodge&#39;s infamy and allegedly illicit activities, along with his hazardous workplace conduct.</p>

<p>In 1945 Parsons separated from Helen after having an affair with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with Marjorie Cameron, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program. Amid the climate of McCarthyism, he was accused of espionage and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952, Parsons died at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or assassination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;&#39;Black magic is not a myth. It is a totally unscientific and emotional form of magic, but it does get results — of an extremely temporary nature. The recoil upon those who practice it is terrific.</p>

<p>It is like looking for an escape of gas with a lighted candle. As far as the search goes, there is little fear of failure!
To practice black magic you have to violate every principle of science, decency, and intelligence. You must be obsessed with an insane idea of the importance of the petty object of your wretched and selfish desires.</p>

<p>I have been accused of being a &quot;black magician.&quot; No more foolish statement was ever made about me. I despise the thing to such an extent that I can hardly believe in the existence of people so debased and idiotic as to practice it.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>The few times Crowley did practice black magick (which is not a part of his magical system in the least), it did recoil terribly on him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crowley ate shit, called himself &quot;the great beast 666&quot;, bragged about sodomizing his daughter, fucked goats, slit a goats throat during intercoarse with his partner, of which many killed themselves. I mean... jeez, u say &quot;the few times crowley did practice black magick&quot; - his whole life was about defaming God after his Dad died randomly as a child. He was going to be a preacher but got so enraged at his fathers untimely death that he took it upon himself to desecrate all that he could. Any decent person wouldn&#39;t JOKE with you about anything this guy does... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly, however bare in mind with esoteric symbols there are typically multiple meanings, or layers of meanings, attributed to them.  I would take any unconfirmed theories with a grain of salt, consider it in degrees of plausibility, see how it stacks up to corroborating evidence and keep an open mind. At minimum, it makes for a fascinating thought experiment, something to contemplate objectively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really aimed at proving or disproving any point in particular, rather to share the wealth of information that exists on these subjects for others to examine objectively and subsequently form their own conclusions. One point that can be taken away from the bulk of this content, while broad and covering a variety of inter-related and at times unrelated material, is the existence of certain currents or streams of esoteric (e.g. occult) knowledge passed through the centuries through key adepts, as well as their pupils and obscured often allegorically, when not utilized explicitly, by esoteric initiatory orders and secret societies. This was initially done out of necessity, to avoid persecution by the authorities of their time, and to prevent this knowledge from being abused potentially. At this point in history such an approach is no longer considered necessary, for the most part, hence the abundance and accessibly of such knowledge in the present day.</p>

<p>To quote Immanuel Kant, who apparently plagiarized the phrase from Horace I say: Sapere aude! (Dare to know!). And to quote the infamous Aleister Crowley, who had in turn plagiarized Francois Rebelais and the Hellfire Clubs who came before him I say: Do what thou wilt! Though I would add to that, as a matter of personal preference, the hippocratic oath, in the form of: Do what thou wilt and do no harm. Speaking of esotericism, exoterically or superficially the phrase &#39;do what thou wilt&#39; would appear to simply mean &#39;do what you want&#39; which can be partially accurate but misses the broader and underlying meaning of the phrase. The key word in that phrase is wilt, or will, a reference to the philosophy of Thelema and of one&#39;s True Will, that is one&#39;s true and sole purpose for existence. When taken into proper context, the phrase, as intended by Crowley and possibly those before him, was meant to be regarded as an imperative to find your True Will or purpose and to strive toward that purpose in every aspect of your life, above all other priorities, apprehensions, dogmas, laws or societal norms. Of course, that phrase can and has been misused by some who wish to rationalize their own indefensible or hedonistic behavior, which if not truly their purpose or constructive toward that purpose is something that will ultimately work against them, not solely ethically or karmically (for those who consider that relevant) but in how it reflects on their character and credibility, not just in their position in their respective community or society as a whole but by their contemporaries as well as those above them in their respective hierarchy.</p>

<p>Will doesn&#39;t mean self or your will to do something. It means actual action in this sense. As in, do what you do in love (as opposed to fear or hate). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that is not what is meant by first law of Thelema, which is the quote above.</p>

<p>Crowley was indeed a questionable character and he often didn&#39;t practice what he preached. And who knows what he truly practiced, the man&#39;s life was and still is in many ways shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>Irregardless, that phrase still holds within it one of the deepest and most beautiful spiritual truths you can utter. </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/77jnu5/finding_god_the_five_stages_of_grief/domsjnm/">I actually made a comment a while back on this topic in a thread on CST</a>. Let me copy it here (slightly edited), since it is relevant to the discussion:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Crowley&#39;s fundamental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/93_(Thelema)">law of Thelema</a> was: &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Crowley himself, as even Mark Passio once stated, is a man that one should listen to, but not copy in his actions (as he often lived quite a hedonistic lifestyle, perhaps not totally in alignment with his main teachings), this &quot;law&quot; is something I see very frequently as being misunderstood.</p>

<p>By &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; or &quot;Do what you will&quot;, Crowley is implying that every being should follow their fundamental, core will, the Will that is intertwined with the whole of the Cosmos. When you follow your core Will (which is something most people are obviously <strong>not</strong> doing, given the state of the world), you are coming from a place of Unity. When you come from Unity your will is aligned with the will of every other being, thus following this core will, or Will, is actually one of the greatest spiritual keys and practices
(this is also perhaps why he doesn&#39;t say &quot;do what you want&quot;, but says &quot;do what you will&quot;).</p>

<p>Aligning yourself with your Core Will or True Will (as he states in the quote below), which is interconnected with the whole Cosmos, is one of the main keys to any spiritual practice, if not perhaps the main key.</p>

<p>In the other part of the law he mentions &quot;Love is the Law, love under will&quot;, which is again related to what I&#39;m saying above. You could say that love and Will are in a way intertwined. The more Will is sourced from your Core, the more it is connected to and with love, even if the love is a mere spark, or perhaps more a sense of compassion, peace, stillness, presence.</p>

<p>This is another quote from Crowley that shows this is what he is actually saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Do not repress or restrict any true instinct of your Nature; but devote all in perfection to the sole service of your one True Will.&quot;
- Aleister Crowley, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another quote from him that is quite interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;IT IS WRITTEN that &#39;Love is the law, love under will.&#39; Herein is an Arcanum concealed, for in the Greek Language [Agape], Love, is of the same numerical value as [Thelema], Will. By this we understand that the Universal Will is of the nature of Love. Now Love is the enkindling in ecstacy of Two that will to become One. It is thus an Universal formula of High Magick. For see now how all things, being in sorrow caused by dividuality, must of necessity will Oneness as their medicine... Understand now that in yourselves is a certain discontent. Analyse well its nature: at the end is in every case one conclusion. The ill springs from the belief in two things, the Self and the Not-Self, and the conflict between them. This also is a restriction of the Will. He who is sick is in conflict with his own body: he who is poor is at odds with society: and so for the rest. Ultimately, therefore, the problem is how to destroy this perception of duality, to attain to the apprehension of unity.
- Aleister Crowley,</p>

<p>Well here&#39;s the problem then. If you don&#39;t believe that giving in to our own instincts is going to lead to selfishness and greed, not sure how to even discuss these quotes with you. Look around this world and tell me if people giving in to their own instincts has done any good at all. Sounds like Crowley was following these words just fine. You are being deceived, my friend. If I&#39;m wrong, show me some followers of this philosophy that are just bursting at the seams with goodness and love for their fellow man. You won&#39;t. This is the opposite of love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re still missing the point of what is meant by &quot;will&quot; in the quote.  It is not about &quot;giving in to our instincts&quot;, but about finding a deeper connection with nature, life, God, the Dao, whatever you want to call it, and allowing that connection to guide you.  Wikipedia has a pretty good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Will">short summary on True Will</a> that might help.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not meant to encourage hedonism, and I think it&#39;s unfair to let Crowley&#39;s lifestyle detract from his writings.  It&#39;s possible to understand a truth and still be unable to follow it; there are plenty of priests from any religion I could point to as example (or even my own fat ass, with all its knowledge of diet &amp; exercise).  Sometimes knowledge isn&#39;t enough to stifle the desire for a vice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense, but I don&#39;t think you understand what I was getting at. </p>

<p>Re-read my comment again. I never said one should follow their instincts, that is not what is meant by the phrase &quot;true-will&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;True-will&quot;, in this interpretation (in the spiritual and esoteric sense) is meant as your core will beyond your egoic instinctual, primal or selfish desires.</p>

<p>Beyond what you want only for yourself there are desires within you that are born as a result of your innermost nature, which is intertwined and in unity with the whole Cosmos. Your deepest desires, you will find, are actually not only your own. If you meditate, introspect and look deeply enough within, you will find a will, a source of desire that is your own and personal, yet also transpersonal. This is reflective of your deepest nature as an inntrinsic part (as well as paradoxically the whole) of the Divine web that is weaved out of all things that exist.</p>

<p>To put it simply-  what you <em>really</em> want, from a deep place within, from beyond the ego, from beyond pure separation, yet still from an individuated standpoint (paradoxically intertwined with the whole), is what the whole Cosmos, the whole of reality wants as well.</p>

<p>You are not not just a drop in the ocean, you are the entirety of the ocean. You are both the drop and the sea, the part and the whole. And coming your deepest self is also coming to your deepest will - your &quot;true-will&quot; as Crowley states it. That will is your own both from your individual standpoint as well as from the standpoint of the whole, the bigger you.</p>

<p>That is why following your true will is what gives birth to a deeper realization of yourself and your ultimate/deeper unity with the all. Knowing who you are, knowing what you truly want - all these things are connected, one realization leads to another. And all of the realizations inevitably lead to and are linked with - love. </p>

It simply speeds up entropy by introducing randomness into a system, whereas bringing order requires much more energy and skill.</p>

<p>Another problem I have with Anon is their sign-off, where they say &quot;we are Legion, for we are many.&quot;  That is straight from the Bible, in Mark 5:9, where Jesus is confronting the demon within the madman at the tombs.  Jesus asks the demon its name, and it answers, &quot;We are Legion, for we are many.&quot;</p>

<p>Demonic forces are subtle, and can operate within groups completely undetected.  I think Anon is a group of usefull, unwitting tools being wielded by a master manipulator.</p>

Pretty good cuz the comedian said if anyone else went to their job and worked in &quot;mysterious ways&quot; they would be fired lol...</p>

<p>But really &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;? Might as well work a shitty job for some rich fuck, if your going to heaven anyways right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t like the Idolizing of Aleister Crowley.</p>

<p>Fact: He died penniless and alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Although the actual dates of Crowley’s death are heavily disputed (either Dec 1st or Dec 5th) it is true that he died a heroin addict in 1947 in a boarding house in Hastings, South East England.&quot; <a href="https://listverse.com/2012/09/22/10-facts-about-the-great-beast-aleister-crowley/">source</a></p>

<p>Fun Fact: when I first read the abovementioned Fact I read,</p>

<p>He died penisless and alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>He died penniless and alone.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, and he predicted in &quot;Liber ABA&quot; that this would be the case. He exerted all his effort and money into producing and distributing his works above all else, which I daresay is admirable, not worthy of contempt. Think of all the losers in history who died after only doing things anyone else could have, and then look at the unique and bizaare reputation of Crowley, his work, etc.  </p>

<p>Also, fucking Listverse is not a good source. For anything. The first bullet is already wrong. According to Crowley&#39;s own bio in Liber ABA, he does list his first sexual <em>act</em> at 14 - with a <em>guy</em>. He lists his first sexual <em>act</em> with a <em>female</em> at 16, with a &quot;theatre girl&quot;, not a maid. Number 7 is just insulting to anyone who understands the distinction between bisexuality and homosexuality. Number 6 is completely retarded - he used the <em>symbol</em> of the Holy Guardian Angel because, according to his own description in Liber ABA, he didn&#39;t think anyone was stupid enough to take it seriously. He also didn&#39;t consider Aiwass to be that symbol until late in his life. (The HGA is actually part of the self, according to Crowley, not a literal angel.) Number 5 is completely stupid - &quot;Fact: it is <em>rumored</em>&quot; Well then it&#39;s not a damn fact! 4 is correct, for the most part, save that it makes him sound like he died of heroin overdose. He didn&#39;t, he died of kidney failure that was bound to be his death since childhood, as he had poor kidneys from birth. 3 and 2 are correct, but number 1 is again completely stupid. It&#39;s a rumor based on idiocy and Crowley&#39;s reputation rather than any legitimate source.  </p>

<p>However, <a href="/u/ToHeliopolisWithLove">/u/ToHeliopolisWithLove</a> is correct, and he didn&#39;t want to be treated as another plaster saint. I do believe he had something legitimate to teach, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jason A&#39;s youtube channel recently did a short video on Satan, rock bands and Aleister Crowley.  Warning as Jason A&#39;s stuff has religious undertones (which I don&#39;t mind, but some may) but the information is solid.</p>

<p>He discusses AC/DC, Led Zepplin, Hendrix, The Beetles and many many others who are not only quoted as saying they &#39;worship Satan&#39; or that they automatically wrote songs that they claim they did not write - but also all these bands adoration for Aleister Crowley (some knowing him personally) and his philosophies.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/r1Ge-hBfRAY">https://youtu.be/r1Ge-hBfRAY</a></p>

<p>Although Jason A has religious context, his videos are some of the best being produced on YouTube today.  He never speaks himself, but only shows lectures, sermons, news broadcasts and articles to make you think and connect the dots yourself.  You come to your own conclusions from the multiple sources he presents.</p>

<p>This Jason A sounds full of shit. None of those bands were old enough to know Crowley personally, unless you think a 7 year old John Lennon was chilling with Crowley on Aleister&#39;s deathbed. Read the biographies of these bands like Hammer of the Gods for Zeppelin and you&#39;d know these recycled 1980s crazy christian claims are moronic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jason A isn&#39;t the man giving the lecture, he&#39;s the one who puts together the videos of others speaking.  You are right that none of the bands I listed met him personally, but his teachings were very important to them (placing Crowley on their album covers and-the-like).   It does not discredit facts like Page kidnapping a 14 year old or 100&#39;s of other allegations against him (in regards to sleeping with underage girls).  He&#39;s praised yet is just as bad as anyone from pedogate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know anything about satanism, satanic cults or any recent conspiracy theories, but here&#39;s my opinion about the concept of &quot;Satan&quot; itself that is derived from the selection of conspiracy theories I consider believable.</p>

<p>The god of human evolution left Earth more than 4000 years ago, when our civilization as we know it first started. Our current god is the god of Earth. They are completely different gods, whose irreconcilable differences lead to our first god being removed from Earth by force. Neither of these gods is the god of universal creation if there is any such entity. The god of Earth might also be the god of our solar system. Unlike our previous god, the god of Earth has taken a very hands-off approach in our development leaving us to sink or swim by our own power. This compassionate god, who is now our only god, is the Christian concept of &quot;Satan.&quot; Of course Christian ideas should be based on the first god&#39;s opinion of the second, so they should be wrong. They appear to be wrong objectively too, because whatever Satan is, it must feel at least somewhat optimistic about us, because unlike our first god, it has permitted us to live here even though we are obviously objectively awful creatures. Since prehistoric times, we have generally acted like it is somehow our divine right to trash up their beautiful and immeasurably valuable planet. Since industrialization we&#39;ve been systematically destroying the planet as if that were our civilization&#39;s primary purpose. And for most of that time, our largest religions have falsely taught us that they are the definition of evil. From their perspective, such prolonged stubborn ignorance must seem hopeless and utterly irredeemable.</p>

<p>Our limited view of the rest of our galaxy—let alone the universe—might not have made it clear to us yet, but Earth is actually objectively worth more than our civilization or even humanity itself. By the standards of other intelligent life in the universe, we grossly overvalue the worth of not just ourselves but humanity itself. We should instead all feel extremely privileged to be permitted to enjoy their planet.</p>

<p>As impossible as it may seem, we don&#39;t have to remain on this planet. The rightful owner of earth is not obligated to permit us to stay. This is yet another reason that we cannot fight another global war. We cannot even continue our small wars, ethnic conflicts or smallest vendettas. There is probably no time left for fighting or hate of any form—not that that would be worth continuing even if there were time for it. We could all be extinguished much more easily than we think, and we certainly will be if we let the hate or greed of the few continue to guide us. This demise would only be our own doing. Earth&#39;s god&#39;s only role in this impending catastrophe would appear to be observing our ultimate failure with maybe some sadness but also a sense of relief that the confused and vaguely threatening mess of our civilization is finally gone.</p>

<p>We have nearly run out of time to realize that if we cannot live in harmony with nature, we cannot live on this planet. Our political choices are the most effective way to respond to the challenges we face. If we want to survive, we need to do better.</p>

<p>So what makes the second god&#39;s opinions right? The fact that he&#39;s second?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a great question. First I should say if it isn&#39;t already obvious, I don&#39;t really know who is right. This is a literal religious mystery. I am just repeating what I thought seemed like a good religious conspiracy theory especially a version from 20-30 years ago that also has certain left-centrist political implications. As far as trying to understand this religious mystery that could very well be beyond our ability to reason, it does seem significant that even those who call it Evil would tell us that the Serpent&#39;s first act of kindness towards humanity was giving us free will.</p>

<p>The god of Earth apparently doesn&#39;t want to be our god-leader like the god who evolved us was even though we were apparently intentionally evolved to think we want that kind of order. There have been snake religions throughout history that could potentially have been based on them, but none seem to have been popular in recent history. Maybe it makes them feel weird to be worshiped as our god. Maybe it draws them down to our level too much encouraging our vices in them and/or theirs in us. It&#39;s probably beyond our understanding, and they probably wouldn&#39;t appreciate our foolish speculation. But if this serpent god of Earth also gave us their infinitely valuable planet to seriously fuck up like we have been doing, it seems like their kindness transcends even our most sanguine concept of human generosity, and they obviously deserve for us to be a radically better humanity than we have been and unfortunately still are in so many ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair question. Of course I don&#39;t know but it looks like Earth&#39;s god didn&#39;t help us escape the consequences of our bad planning, which fits with its essentially hands-off approach to our development. Human greed obviously got us here. Most renewable energy was first invented from the 1890s to 1940s. The first AC power plants were hydroelectric like at Niagara Falls. Investing in renewable energy sources could have been earning any investor money from any point since then, but fossil fuels are cheaper and more marketable, so that&#39;s where economies of scale developed. We could have favored material- and energy-conservative designs like Buckminster Fuller&#39;s, but instead people got more excited by making cars more like miniature yachts. Our buildings could have radically reduced impacts on nature. There are countless ways we could have done better. Fortunately those are all things we can still do better now and are increasingly in most places, but progress is slow without successful models to follow and major political support for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hope I&#39;m not too late to the party! So a fascinating fact I learned the other day is that Charles Manson was actually sent to Boys Town as a youth. His stay there was short, but he was nonetheless sent there. My source for this is the recent Time Magazine publication on killer cults. Another interesting thing about him was all the celebrities he bumped shoulders with, including those in the occult. While on the subject of the occult, there is a film director from the same time period named Kenneth Anger who made a lot of occult videos and short movies, and who also participated in various occult groups throughout the years. He even had Jim Morrison and Anton Levay in his movies (as well as other famous hollywood stars of the time). He was also reported to have done graphic movies, as well as possible snuff films. The only reason I discovered him and his videos is because of a music video on YouTube called &quot;Duality&quot; , by Captain Murphy. It is a compilation of cult footage, as well as occult footage, all blended together for 35 minutes. I suggest watching it, as I would like to hear someone else&#39;s opinion on it considering it is a modern-day occult video. The occult is alive and well, and people are being a lot more blatantly open about it these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My 2 cents:  </p>

<p>The Franklin coverup is a fascinating conspiracy that involves government and government paymaster malfeasance. Some day when powerful bad guys are dead some witnesses are going to talk and even more really horrible truths are going be revealed but the evidence trail  will have decayed to uselessness by that point and these truths may  never be proven.  </p>

<p>Satanic cults are a real thing but they are insignificant in the systemic corruption that weighs us all down. For almost all practical purposes magic is a weapon of the weak; when the rich and powerful want to make things happen they don&#39;t waste their time with magic. Satanism is an edge case and there is a wide spectrum from the people who do Left Hand Path practices all the time to people who do so once in great while for a special project where they think it is the right tool for this job and it is not the right tool for almost all of the magic ends they usually pursue.  </p>

<p>Most occultists are, to be honest, losers. They have shit jobs and occupy dumps and drive beater cars and their magic is a largely self-delusion that they aren&#39;t such a loser. Apropos to Crowley if you live in a big city you can go to an open OTO meeting and see this for yourself.  </p>

<p>Aleister Crowley was like a lot of people who are very smart and read great books and know a lot of stuff and if they could have just paired up with a professional editor their books might be great instead of being barely readable. It is never a chore to read a great book. It is a chore to read Aleister Crowley. There is a small percentage of really great content hidden in that mess but it can be exhausting to pry it out of all the crap. The traditional explanation of it&#39;s concealed and revealed, or it has to be obfuscated to keep it away from the unworthy is bullshit. My favorite Crowley story is the one in Bennet&#39;s book where he spent a week at Gurdjieff&#39;s commune and infuriated the other guru who expected everybody to be respectful and pitch in and do their fair share of the work. G. G. was a hospitable host as his upbringing required but the minute Crowley left the instruction was recorded the  moocher was never allowed back.  </p>

<p>The only essential Crowley books are, in order, 777, Thoth, and Book IV. If you go through the hassle of reading these three books you will  have 99% of all quality Crowley. Here and there scattered through them is some really great stuff.  </p>

<p>Organized in reverse order to A. C., Satanism, and Franklin posted above as the relevance of these three subjects to this sub is presented upside down. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On further review I found a passage in Webb&#39;s <em>The Occult Underground</em> which is appropriate for people curious about the subject of black magic in high places.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Huysmans, in the words of one of his contemporaries, had a terrible tendency &quot;to believe what he read,&quot; and his suggestibility was to lead to further ramifications. The novelist&#39;s friend Jules Bois, a journalist, who shared his interest in occult matters, possessed the same credulity. He was later to print documents given by Boullan to Huysmans containing the information that at every court of Europe magical evocations were practiced, and that Prussia crushed France at Sedan because of her superior evocatory powers.  p.158-9  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Webb was a scholar and a skeptic. If you follow the footnotes in this book you may find the best documentation on the subject. That is the place where I would start.  <em>The Harmonious Circle</em> is the Webb book where you can find the dope on Crowley. Why Webb would exert all of this energy on topics which he dismissed as rubbish is a mystery, but I am glad that he did and it is a pity that he died so young.</p>

<p>We have 8,000,000,000 people living on Earth now. All it takes is 1 disaster... Could be a deadly flu, could be war/depopulation. </p>

<p>Sure it may seem ok to some, but to most of us paying attention to the real world vs reality TV see that we are headed for dark times ahead and are doing so little to prepare.</p>
