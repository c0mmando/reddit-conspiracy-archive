       This post is an attempt to criticize the media's case against Russia in the most formal way possible. Everything is to be cited and explained carefully based on specific propositions. If I do this correctly, we should see this thread sitting at no greater than 60%, and at least four comments should be calling me a Russian bot. Let's begin with establishing a simplified version of media's argument/narrative:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         (1) Skripal was certainly poisoned with a "novichok" agent. That is, there is substantial evidence that it was "novichok". Even its creator said it was definitely Russia!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (2) Russia has a monopoly on "novichok". Its usage is a smoking gun for Russia's culpability.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (3) The UK is following international protocol for dealing with a state actor's usage of chemical weapons.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (4) Russia is at fault for not bothering to respond to the UK's 24-hour request for explanation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (5) Russia has a clear motive for poisoning Skripal. More precisely, they have
         <em>
          more of a motive
         </em>
         than any other state actor. This is an important qualification that we will explore later.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (1) There is no substantial evidence that Skripal was poisoned with novichok.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is, of course, more difficult to prove a negative than a positive. We cannot prove with complete certainty that the UK government does not have evidence of novichok poisoning, because we do not know what their supposed evidence is. The UK has not presented any evidence, either to Russia or to international channels, that novichok was used. Because of this uncertainty, we must rely on probability and heuristic. Let's begin our inquiry with simplicity:
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       there theoretically possible signs of novichok when it is used as a poison? Would we be able to tell, in hypothetically perfect conditions, that it is used
       <em>
        when
       </em>
       it is used?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer, according to top UK scientists, is a flat "no".

        According to the textbook literature on Chemical Weapons Toxicology

       .  The OPCW is the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. It is a crucial organization for proper international conflicts regarding chemical weapons, which we will get to later. In one of the latest OPCW publications about "novichoks",

       Back to Robin M. Black. Guess where else he worked?
       <a href="https://www.opcw.org/fileadmin/OPCW/SAB/en/sab-20-wp03_e_.pdf">

        direct other scientists on chemical weapons toxicology
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       To spell it out: the UK's own chemical weapon's toxiology expert wrote that there is no way currently to detect the use of novichok. Although it is impossible to prove a negative in this situation, this is incredibly strong disconfirming evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the last point, that the creator of novichok said it was certainly Russia that was responsible,
       <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/russians-says-chemist-uncovered-existence-novichok-075342077.html">
        he added an important clause
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The only other possibility, he said, would be that someone used the formulas in his book to make such a weapon.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This brings us to point 2:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (2) Russia does not have a monopoly on novichok
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it is apparently impossible to detect novichok, it is not so difficult to make. According to the creator, if somebody "used the formulas in his book", he would be able to "make such a weapon." Well, how difficult is it to find this book? Was it published only a handful of times and kept in the arcane laboratories of secretive institutions? Of course not.
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/State-Secrets-Insiders-Chronicle-Chemical/dp/1432725661">
        It's on fucking Amazon.
       </a>
       And to manufacture "novichok" is
       <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/what-novichok-nerve-agent-center-russian-ex-spy-poisoning-n856001">
        simpler than other chemical weapons
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The Novichok agents are thought to be far more difficult to detect during manufacturing and far easier to manufacture covertly, because they can be made with common chemicals in relatively simple pesticide factories," the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says in its Weapons of Mass Casualties and Terrorism Response Handbook.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Russia does not have a monopoly on novichok. Not even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (3) The UK is not following international protocol for this conflict over novichok.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember what we said about the OPCW? The OPCW is like the UN for chemical weapons (although the UN is also the UN for chemical weapons, of course). There are only four UN states that are
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       signatories of the OPCW: Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan. Hence, Russia and the UK are signatories. If the UK believes that Russia used chemical weapons in their borders, what does the OPCW convention tell members to do? And if Russia believes the UK's accusation is false, what does the OPCW convention tell Russia to do? According to Article IX on Consultations, Cooperation, and Fact-Finding:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Without prejudice to the right of any State Party to request a challenge inspection,
        <strong>
         States Parties should, whenever possible, first make every effort to clarify and resolve, through exchange of information
        </strong>
        and consultations among themselves, any matter which may cause doubt about compliance with this Convention, or which gives rise to concerns about a related matter which may be considered ambiguous.
        <strong>
         A State Party which receives a request from another State Party for clarification of any matter which the requesting State Party believes causes such a doubt or concern shall provide the requesting State Party as soon as possible, but in any case not later than 10 days after the request, with information sufficient to answer the doubt or concern raised along with an explanation of how the information provided resolves the matter.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is somewhat self-explanatory, but for simplicity's sake: According to international law the UK is to give Russia 10 days to respond. It is also suggested that they make available the "evidence" they have against Russia. This last one shouldn't even need to be spelled out in a convention; the right for the accused to see the evidence against them is so fundamental to justice itself that it's almost damning that the UK thinks they can just flaunt this moral obligation. It has literally been in our justice system for 500 years. It's not trivial. It's fucking important. Russia actually spoke to the OPCW, and notably said the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In addition, in this particular case, it would be legitimate for the British side to seek assistance from the OPCW Technical Secretariat in conducting an independent laboratory analysis of the available samples that allegedly show traces of nerve agents in Salisbury.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (4) Russia is thus not at fault for failing to reply to the 24-hour ultimatum.
       </strong>
       I mean, they actually did reply to the ultimatum by essentially saying "give us the fucking samples asshole"(
       <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-lavrov/moscow-to-london-let-us-examine-nerve-agent-used-in-spy-poisoning-idUSKCN1GP19U">
        https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-lavrov/moscow-to-london-let-us-examine-nerve-agent-used-in-spy-poisoning-idUSKCN1GP19U
       </a>
       ), and can you really fault them with this?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (5) Russia's motive for poisoning Skripal is not as strong as thought. Other nations have greater motive.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the most complicated proposition. Let's go over the history of Skripal. To begin,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegals_Program#Prisoners_held_by_Russia_involved_in_the_exchange">
        Russia held him in prison on a sentence of 13 years
       </a>
       . If it were absolutely crucial that he be assassinated, they would have done this when they had custody of him. But a sentence of 13 years is hardly a sentence you'd give for someone you want dead. US gives its spies
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hanssen">
        10 consecutive life sentences in a super-max prison.
       </a>
       So if Russia hated this guy so much, why give him such a light sentence, and why give him away
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegals_Program#Prisoners_held_by_Russia_involved_in_the_exchange">
        in a prisoner swap
       </a>
       ? The other prisoners who were swapped were not assassinated. And Vil Mirzayanov, the chemist who revealed the existence of novichok and who lives a public life teaching at public universities was not assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't take a genius to realize that the motive to assassinate this 60-year-old just isn't there. Moreover, it doesn't take a genius to realize that
       <strong>
        this is the worst possible time to publicly assassinate somebody.
       </strong>
       Russia's image is in tarnishes. Russia really, really wants its
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Stream#Expansion:_Nord_Stream_2">
        latest oil pipeline
       </a>
       to be completed unimpeded.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup">
        They are hosting the World Cup in 3 months
       </a>
       . They are still in a conflict in Syria. So why would they go about assassinating a nobody? What is the motivation here?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the kind of political move you'd make in the game Civilization 5 when it's 2am and you're a little drunk. This isn't the political move that career politicians make when there is so much on the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other nations would have a motive for assassinating this man? Could it be one of the non-signatory nations of the OPCW? Could it be a nation that has a

        foreign soil
       </a>
       ? Could it be a nation that desperately wants Russia to stop defending Iran and Syria, so that it could

       Truth by itself takes no sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue at hand here is how the UK seems to convict without presenting the evidence, nothing more. If they'd show evidence linking Russia to the crime, then there would be no issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasoning May used in parliament simply is flawed and the flaws are obvious. To come back to OP's post: in the condensed version statement 1 and 2 can't be correct at the same time. Either the UK knows the structure, implying Russia can't have a monopoly, or Russia has a monopoly and the UK can't know the structure. The motive Russia has is weak and doesn't fit the MO, ...
      </p>
      <p>
       So many flaws, and we are merely making the obvious questions, regardless of who actually did it.

      <p>
       The Scientific Advisory Board of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has not recognized Novichoks as chemical weapons because it found scant evidence that they exist at all. The U.S. and the UK are both part of the organization and both agreed with this evaluation:
      </p>
      <p>
       [The SAB] emphasised that the definition of toxic chemicals in the Convention would cover all potential candidate chemicals that might be utilised as chemical weapons. Regarding new toxic chemicals not listed in the Annex on Chemicals but which may nevertheless pose a risk to the Convention, the SAB makes reference to “Novichoks”. The name “Novichok” is used in a publication of a former Soviet scientist who reported investigating a new class of nerve agents suitable for use as binary chemical weapons. The SAB states that it has insufficient information to comment on the existence or properties of “Novichoks”. (OPCW, 2013)
      </p>
      <p>
       The former Soviet scientist, Vil Mirzanyanov, who 'blew the whistle' and wrote about the 'Novichoks', now lives in a $1 million home in the United States. The AFP news agency just interviewed him about the recent incident:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mirzayanov, speaking at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, said he is convinced Russia carried it out as a way of intimidating opponents of President Vladimir Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Only the Russians" developed this class of nerve agents, said the chemist. "They kept it and are still keeping it in secrecy."
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other possibility, he said, would be that someone used the formulas in his book to make such a weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Russia did it", says Mirzanyanov, "OR SOMEONE WHO READ MY BOOK".
      </p>
      <p>
       The book was published in 2008 and is available as hardcover, paperback or for $8.16 as an electronic file. It includes a number of formulas which, Mirzanyanov says, could be used to produce those chemical agents. But neither Porton Down nor the OPCW seem convinced that this is possible. They may believe that Mirzanyanov is just full of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One customer reviewing Mirzanyanov's book remarked:
      </p>
      <p>
       [Needs] an editor to throttle back his epic "i'm an epic awesome martyr" stuff and stick to the science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reviewer wrote:

       State secrets is by far the most long winded and painfully slow novel on chemical weapons written by a disgruntled defected scientist from Russia I have ever read! If you want to hear an employ with delusions of grandeur moan about every person he ever worked with then this is the book for you, otherwise don't waste your sweet time. Seriously! Nothing happens except Vil somethingkov helps make things that kill people for 30 years, gets a (sort of) conscience, defects, and constantly whinges about.....everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vil Mirzanyanov promoted his book in a 2009 video. Shortly after he published his book he blogged an explanation why he included formulas in it:
      </p>
      <p>
       While I was writing my book “State Secrets: An Insider’s Chronicle of the Russian Chemical Weapons Program”, some people from Washington persistently advised me not to include the formulas of the chemical agents of the Novichok series in my book. 
...
       <br/>
       I asked why it would be a bad idea to publish this information, since it would be for the safety of all people. Then the governments would work to have those chemical agents and their precursors included into the Control List. They responded, “Terrorists could use them for their criminal actions.” This kind of reasoning is used all the time now to scare people and prevent any discussion. We are already used to ignoring a lot of real problems thanks to that.
Mirzanyanov further points out that experienced personal in well equipped laboratories would be able to use his formulas. State actors have such laboratories, like the British Porton Down, but terrorists do not have such capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mirzanyanov urged to included the substances he described into the OPCW list of controlled material. But the OPCW, as seen above, rejected that. Neither its scientific board nor the head of the Porton Down detection laboratory were convinced that these substances or the Soviet program Mirzanyanov described existed at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Soviet chemical weapon laboratory in which Mirzanyanov had worked was in Uzbekistan, not in Russia as Theresa May falsely claims. The laboratory was dismantled with the active help of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theresa's May claims that the Skripals were poisoned with 'Novichok' agents is highly questionable. Her claim that only Russia could be responsible for the Skripal incident is obviously bollocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of the substances as described by Vil Mirzanyanov is in serious doubt. But if he is right then any state or company with a decent laboratory and competent personal can produce these substances from the formulas and descriptions he provides in his book. That is at least what Mirzanyanov himself says.

      <p>
       I imagine that if they can accuse Russia of using it, then they must have been able to detect it and therefore probably know the structure.  If they know the structure of the molecule, then any state, or even non-state actors, could make it and make it look like it was Russia.  A molecule is a molecule no matter where it was made.

       Well I think we know what's up. And this article is getting less brigading on the comments (so far) because OP was very concise in his analysis. Better to just pretend this post doesn't exist than engage. And yes - I've seen the spike too - of all the crazy shit that's been in the news, this story in particular seems to have them rile. Can't have any viewpoint counter to the narrative, no matter how well reasoned. It's heartening to see a good amount of sensible comments in this thread however.

       Who stands to benefit the most from this type of thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       As the press coverage has said, this and other similar incidents happen in ways that leave no doubt that Russia is the culprit.  The victims are always high profile Russian critics and defectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The method of the assassination always some extremely difficult to obtain poison that Russians are known to have or manufacture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence of Russian involvement is so blatantly obvious to the world that Putin might as well have live-streamed himself shooting the victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet Russia denies any involvement every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ALWAYS happens in England.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but after these latest two assassinations I'm starting to smell a rat.  Russia has ZERO to gain from offing high profile defectors who have presumably been thoroughly debriefed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who would gain are the nations trying to isolate, put pressure on, and undermine the reputation of the Russian state.  In fact, it seems to be working pretty well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've gone from being 100% certain that these types of things are KGB operations to being on the fence about which intel agencies are doing this and for what purpose.  These ops look like what would be done by some entity that has a lot of resources at it's disposal and was working hard to put together a REALLY believable frame up.

       I particularly like this point. When "the Syrian government" decided to attack its own people last year with chemical weapons, it was also the worst possible time. I haven't seen compelling evidence from that attack and I'm sure there won't be any for this one either.

       Well the puppetmasters seem to thrive on never-ending chaos, war, fear, alienation...so maybe it's just that. There's a lot of profit in those things.

      <p>
       Or maybe the end game really is at hand, a global nuclear war because their bunkers are ready and it's time for a purge of the useless eaters?

       The average person is quite useful to them. Everybody with a job earns less money than they generate, and the money they earn is put back into the economy. Even their savings benefit the banks.

       If the powers are looking for a purge, it's because they've progressed beyond the need for the current system, and no longer need a slave class to funnel wealth from.

       And it's a huge distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chlorine is easy to make. The process has been refined for about 100 years now (or longer). Sarin is more complicated, not so much from a chemical point of view but from a military one. Sarin is thus more likely to come from a government actor (not necessarily the syrian one though) while Chlorine could be made and used by amateurs.

       Those emails were faked. There were 2, the headers for them are almost exactly the same, except the day was changed. The emails said they were sent at the exact same hour, minute and second, two months apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also have the exact same message ids, which are randomly generated. So you'd have to believe these were sent at the exact same hour, minute and second 2 months apart AND the email client generated the exact same message ID
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other issues, but those two show the headers were just copied and pasted from something else.

       Honestly, i don't think that disproves anything. Its not abnormal for a leak to have it's metadata changed or removed, and it's common practice to change them all to the same time and day for instance if they're part of the same leak. I shall look into this however.

       They defeat this point by basically claiming that the Russian leadership is just stupid. This is very convenient. If you make the audience believe your adversary is stupid and evil, you can suggest any kind of motive and hope it'll stick. Unfortunately for the West, they simultaneously claim that Russians are sophisticated enough to execute complex hybrid warfare and hacking, which you can't have if you're at the same time stupid enough to shot yourself in the foot at any time.

       That's the one point that sticks out to me. If they really wanted him dead, why would they pick the absolute worst time ever? It's like a drug dealer who knows he's under surveillance going out and getting drunk and shooting his competition. It's sloppy and stupid, and it doesn't seem like a risk Putin would take right now. He's smart, he's former KGB, he understands world politics. Nothing about this makes sense as to why he would do it now.

       The evidence you linked is presented by Edmond Mulet, the head of the OPCW. He previously served as the head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti from June 2006 to August 2007 and from January 2010 to June 2011. Take a look at the successes under his supervision:

       The entire reason the Russians created this nerve agent in 1992 was they wanted something that was undetectable by the NATO chemical weapons detection sensors. So what they do is look at physical symptoms that include
      </p>
      <p>
       Salivation - foaming at the mouth
      </p>
      <p>
       Lacrimation - tears pouring from the eyes
      </p>
      <p>
       Urination, Defecation
      </p>
      <p>
       Gastrointestinal distress
      </p>
      <p>
       Emesis (vomiting) - as the body loses control over muscles, particularly those of the sphincters
      </p>
      <p>
       Miosis - one of the key diagnostics; the muscles that cause the pupil to constrict become fully activated and the pupils become pinpoints in the iris.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doctors are taught to look for these symptoms together as a sign of exposure to organophosphates, the compound make up of Novichok.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when Putin asks for evidence, he's asking for someone to give physical proof of something that was created to be physically undetectable.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't understand is why does Russia always get false flag sympathy when nobody else seems to get the same treatment? When people see this story, they say well Putin has the obvious motive here, so it must not be him!
      </p>
      <p>
       But people don't apply this same logic to other stories. When Seth Rich was killed, nobody said "well the DNC had the clear motive here if he was the leaker, so it must not be them!"
      </p>
      <p>
       When somebody who is even remotely  connected to Hillary or her campaign dies, nobody says " Well she had the clear motive here, so it must not be her!"
      </p>
      <p>
       But whenever something bad about Russia comes up, people jump to their defense and assume that our government and all our democratic allies are lying to us, and good old dictator Putin is the only one telling us the truth. This seems absolutely absurd to me. Why are we supposed to assume we are always lying and Russia is always some innocent wholesome actor getting a bad wrap from the rest of the world?

       If this was true, May and the rest of the British Government would be lying about everything, because they wouldn't know the first thing about what was used in the attack.

       That guy has no idea what he’s talking about. It is physically detectable. I don’t even understand how it wouldn’t be. Every chemical is detectable. You can just stick it in an NMR machine. Some are just hard to know that they’re there because they may not have smell, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the exact compound used is claimed to be A-234. Obviously it’s detectable if it has a name and structure because otherwise no one would know how to make it/if they made it correctly.

       Russia is not innocent in many cases. This is not one of them. You obviously didnt read the post and started off with a false statement of "they made this because they wanted something undetected"

      <p>
       Even if that was true (which you didnt cite any source), it doesn't take away the most important and blatant fact. There is no direct evidence tying this to the russian government.

       There is a book on Amazon that details how to make Novichok you quack. The Russian government developed this no doubt, but it can be made by ANY government with equivalent infrastructure - to claim it was done by Russia because it was a Russian invention is... stupid to say the least.

       chemical detection equipment. You see the emphasis? Novichok has outlived its usefulness in the modern era and thats why it was dismantled by Russia. It is incredibly easy to detect by NMR, Mass spec, IR spec.

        well Putin has the obvious motive here, so it must not be him

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But that's the thing, he does not have an obvious motive here. The net result is absolutely terrible for Russia, and virtually anyone could foresee this net result. There's no clear reason why Putin would want some 60-something former spy dead instead of the hundreds of other former spies; there's no reason to think that Putin would even want him dead when he was jailed for a relatively small length of time and was prisoner swapped; there is not only
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       reason to do it at this time, but there's a lot of reasons why
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to do it at this time; and it helps Israel and her allies much more than it helps Russia, provided that Russia ultimately gets the blame (they did)...
      </p>
      <p>
       At a very elementary level, which is the level of popular media discourse, Russia
       <em>
        totally

       has a motive. Because Russia = bad people, and bad people would certainly kill former spies. At the level of temporal context and how politics actually plays out, this analysis becomes null. The people in charge of Russia are not 12-year-olds. They may be bad people, but they are not intellectually impaired. They would have known that this is the result, and some 60-year-old is not worth possibly hundreds of millions in net cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this disconfirms that Russia has a motive. And the fact that the UK circumvented international agencies, and the fact that Israel has had a long foreign policy plan that requires a defenseless Iran and Syria, work as a motive for the enemies of Russia to engage in the assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       To respond to your Seth Rich point, there is no sophisticated level by which another player benefits from his assassination. The only people who believe the Seth Rich narrative are already against Hillary, and his murder did not lead to new voters, diplomatic pressure, or anything of the sort.

       Would you not agree that Putin has both killed journalists and jailed his opposition in the past? He's a thug. He knows this nerve agent is physically undetectable. So he gets to sit back and claim the rest of the world is wrongfully blaming him and they won't provide physical evidence. It's the exact same way he's treated the hacking stuff. He knows our agencies aren't going to tell him how we figured out it was them, so he can sit back and claim he's being wrongfully accused without evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even want to get into Seth Rich. The point was other stories don't get this same treatment. We don't often look at a story and say "well this person is being blames, so clearly they are being framed." But with Russia, this happens every single time. We are supposed to never believe the rest of the world governments, but definitely believe what this dictator has to say about his actions.

       Right, but it doesn't benefit him to "claim the rest of the world is wrongfully blaming him". The rest of the world, by which you mean NATO, is already firmly on the Putin hate-train. There was no chance of their ever being off the Putin hate-train. Putin does not care that the rest of the world is "wrongfully blaming him" and sympathy points on an obscure Reddit thread are not worth hundreds of millions of dollars and a jeopardized oil pipeline that would result in billions of dollars and a loss in political legitimacy. And contrary to what you might think, Russian people by and large don't think that peaceful former spies should be assassinated in small British towns. It is a net bad result.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is not the form of the argument. The form of the argument is "this person is blamed without evidence and is said to have a motive, but the one doing the blaming is lying and bypassing international conventions, and the person being blamed actually has no motive, whereas the allies of the person doing the blaming does have a motive." Again, at no point is the obviousness of a motive a reason to believe that the motive is not legitimate -- that would be ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your level can only be made at a "I am only going to put 5 minutes of thought into it" level. You are arguing that one former spy, out of 500 being assassinated, is worth possibly more than one billion dollars, a smaller voter turn out for Putin, and a loss in political legitimacy. That is absolutely crazy.

       It should also be mentioned that we've lied about pretexts for war before. The Iraq War? An informant lied. WWI? The sinking of the Lusitania. Vietnam War?

       International altercations occur at a very sophisticated level and I don't think it could be understood by 5 minutes of thought and the assumption that Putin has the emotionality of a 12 year old boy.

       Okay well your first point goes both ways. If the rest of the world is already on board with Putin being an asshole, then there's no point in framing him. Everyone already agrees he sucks. Putin is very popular back home and it's in part because he blames all of Russia's problems on outside forces. He might not get much sympathy around the world for being falsely accused, but he sure does at home. He gets to go back to his populace and say "we would be doing better if the rest of the world would stop blaming us for shit with no evidence and enacting all these sanctions on us."
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin has done this type of stuff a bunch of times. Do you deny this? Do you think he's always being framed?

       There is if you want additional pressure on Russia so that a NATO coalition can be formed to "free" Syria and Iran (imho strongest possibility), or better yet, so that Russia caves and stops protecting Iran and Syria. They hate Russia, but they don't have a pretext for armed conflict. After the Skripal incident, the UK, France, and other nations are announcing what amount to new sanctions. They would not be able to do this if Putin was just defending Assad. And I can imagine that if another "incident" occurs, they would have a pretext for an armed coalition to depose Assad or even Rouhani (if Israel and American Neocons get so lucky, Trump included, admittedly).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that right now, the United States is occupying an oil field in Syria. We are occupying an oil field in a sovereign nation 6,000 miles away. Almost every single UN member state has agreed that Assad's government is the representative of the Will of the Syrian people, so why in the world are we still occupying territory in Syria? This should tell you that we have much more malice than you think we are capable of. We are illegally occupying territory 6000 miles away in a nation we do not have a right to occupy.

       And this "incident" will now become a part of that "bunch of times". In the future, people will be listing this incident as an argument that Putin "has totally assassinated a bunch of people before." Did you miss a list of Israel's targeted assassinations?

       If they did this in order to create an excuse for armed conflict, then why are they just announcing new sanctions? Why wouldn't they take this opportunity to announce they are sending troops to Syria? I don't know why we are in Syria, we probably shouldn't be. I know people have big problems with Isreal. I don't like them either. But they are an ally of ours. And I don't think it's reasonable to blame them for secretly doing all this shit behind the scenes. Isreal is doing just fine. They are still America's little brother so I'm not sure why they would need to be framing people to get us more on their side. We are already 1000% behind them. So you think Putin just keeps being framed? He's never actually said his political opponents to jail or had journalists killed?

       When you go to the doctor with a grouping of symptoms, they can often tell exactly what you're suffering from because they know this certain illness comes with this exact grouping of symptoms. As I said before, the Russians created this nerve agent specifically because it would be undetectable by the chemical weapons sensors.

       The reasoning, as far as I know, is that it is secret and therefor impossible to identify. But a russian defector published the structures in the late 80's or something. If you know the structure you can make the compound, if you have the compound, you can design analytical processes to detect it.

       They invaded Ukraine for multiple reasons. The main reason being that the US was funding groups to topple the pro Russian government and install Western friendly leadership. Was Russia at fault? Sure, but toppling governments is pretty bad behaviour. Ukraine is a vital area for Russian gas pipelines. To top all this off, the Russian government might be worried that Ukraine would be invited into NATO and would potentially have heavily armed forces, and incredible destructive weaponry on their border. Historically, Russia was invaded twice by foreign armies last century. WWI and WWII were horrendous for Russia and maybe there still exist people that don't want Western armies invading again. Putin is a horses ass and a fake populist strongman that enriches himself, but there is more to this story than is ever reported or discussed.

       So assuming "Russia couldn't have done this because it is bad for them" is just no valid argument. Russia pumped trillions of oil out of the earth and are still dirt poor. How? Bad decisions by somebody.

       Ukraine is not currently in NATO, and Crimea joined Russia. If the US had not been involved  in Ukraine maybe none of what occured would have happened. Russia also assisted Assad in Syria so as to defeat ISIL and essentially won that war and will continue to sell gas to Europe. They spend 10 times less on their military than the US yet arguably have better results. Plus Putin seems to have a great deal of support domestically (even if he is despised by many). Sanctions have prevented them from pumping trillions more oil out, which IMO is most likely what all this affair is truly about. Finally, if it is to be believed, he used a few hackers and bots to overthrow democracy in the most powerful country in the history of the world. I think Putin is horrible, and would appreciate if Russia had better leadership and he was gone but their actions are not all as you claim.

       ??? I don't claim anything about those actions. I see the country in the dumpster so I claim assuming their decision making is top notch is simply unreasonable. The conspircacy that Russia didn't really do it appears to based on "look that is bad for them why would they do that". And I showed this to be a silly argument. They have 200 million people and more land than you can imagine filled with stuff and they get nothing done. Why the hell are there still people thinking those guys have it figure out?

       Just by going the "simple capitalist" way Russia would be a major powerhouse. Can't believe people think they know what they are doing. They have zero results. They have less power they had before.

       My point was to show that many of their actions are not necessarily causing them to be in the dumpster as you say, and may show Putin is more crafty than his actions appear. The Ukraine invasion is extremely complicated and is hard to boil down to it being a bad decision merely because of what transpired after the fact.  Russia arguably suffered more than any country during the 20th century so maybe Ukraine has more significance to Russia due to them wanting to ensure they won't have NATO armed forces on their doorstep like they experienced with Western armies invading 100 years ago. Western European governments, and NATO allies know this and yet they continue to press  Russia and expand NATO nonetheless. The invasion of Ukraine could have been an economic, military, and a politically motivated protective measure from Russia's perspective. Its therefore not so simple as looking at a number on a page and saying the leaders are bad there because x instead of y economically. But speaking of economics, in the early 90s when Yeltsin was vaulted to power, thanks to US intelligence, the economy of Russia entered a phase of shock as their public owned stakes were sold to private elites. IMO, I have a hard time believing that the US went through all the trouble to essentially topple the USSR, install Yeltsin, and walk away when the turmoil began (I mean to say the US had an interest in ensuring economic turmoil in Russia). Putin rose directly from this period and has been a strongman conman ever since. So maybe he is simply following orders like Yeltsin, or maybe he uses the turmoil and tension to retain power. Either way, the internal dynamics of their current state have been shaped by a multitude of factors that stretch back over a hundred years. And I would add that Putin is not dumb. He's many horrible things, but he is a crafty politician. Could he be directly responsible for attempted murder against an ex spy? Yes, certainly - and it wouldn't surprise me. But I would add that the timing for this assassination attempt seems off and less than ideal for someone who is a career intelligence officer.

       Yes, and I would also add that NATO expansion happened in complete violation of the treaties we'd signed with Russia post USSR. We are the clear aggressors in this relationship - forcing them to act again and again but never letting the truth come out in the media.

       You have to understand that having worse economy and suffering from the escalation with the West is still arguably better for us than not having Crimea as a part of the country and having Ukraine fully join NATO. That's exactly the reason the Putin ratings are still high. The Russian understanding of the pre-2014 situation in Ukraine is that it's actually not an independent state, but something like external part of Russia that has no economy and hence is going on sale. The government overthrow in 2014 there clearly indicated that the country was sold and was going to become a very hostile puppet state on our border. The escalation with the West would've happen in any case, the new proxy was made from Ukraine, and the conflict was escalating already for quite a long time by then - the ant-gay campaign hysteria has clearly indicated that. In order to make our first truly independent move we had to act fast and support the Crimean referendum to at least counterattack the installation of a new puppet state by keeping to ourselves the naval port of incredible importance and keeping super loyal population safe (they would've never accepted working with the new russophobic Ukraine).
      </p>
      <p>
       Summing it up, the "invasion" didn't "work out fine", in our understanding it was a moderately successful defence move in a fight that was inevitable by then. You have to look at it in the context of the whole conflict. We were expecting things to go much worse anyways, and I think rightfully so.

       I already explained that I personally don't know what the agenda of those in power is. If you read one of my other replies I said exactly that, maybe their only goal is the consolidation of power and not the prosperity of their people. But then in this context, the assassination of an ex-spy is completely rational as well.

       I did my research and if the whole gross export of resources we do would've been distributed amongst all the people instead of being invested/used for infrastructure/etc, we would've had around 3000$ annually and no country. In which way this is enormous? It could've been managed better by the govt, but not 5 times better. Maybe 30% better. And we still have a corruption problem of not well established country (we're only 25 years old) that found itself in a position where it's always safer to keep your money far from home. It's slowly changing, but it couldn't change fast. The ex-USSR is not exactly booming, there's not a single state that is doing as good as what you expect of us right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of a burning dumpster fire and etc, my country is not a dumpster. I like it in here. If you take a look at all the 2nd and 3rd world and their 6 and a half billions of population, you will see that Russia is way above average in terms of quality of life. Not by your Western standards, but by the actual Humanity standards. That's not bad. And our suicide rates are at record low right now, while life expectancy is at record high, so the dynamic is not bad.

       They basically had not other choice. The crimean people were in open rebellion against Kiev (a situation twenty years in the making:

       ) and were asking for support. It's basically the russian version of a humanitarian intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should have exerted pressure on Kiev instead of course, but I think that would have failed as the ability to project soft power of Russia is more limited and both the EU and the US wanted to associate themselves more with Ukraine so Russia would have lost out.

       Russia has no real navy - their single carrier is a floating pile of garbage with a crappy diesel engine. Air force wise they have no real modern fighter with BVR capability, which means they're easy pickings for any modern air force. Not too familiar with their army, but a lot of their equipment is Soviet-era and in poor condition.

       The claim "they wouldn't have done it because xyz" is an fuckin absolute. The mere showing of realistic possiblities destroys the premisse. I don't have to show what is more likely I just showed that other possibilities exist and therefore the premise is void.

       I can show that it is possible they didn't anticipate the outcome. Well which is pretty simple because they can't see into the future and Russia is in the dumpster so the assumption of masterminds at the command is reasonable refuted.

       I showed that there are several possible scenarios in which this assassination was ordered even with the consquences it now has. So claiming this assasination wouldn't have been ordered due to the consequnences is refuted. There is nothing left to argue.

There’s also an argument that Russia’s growth has been intentionally stymied by the other world powers because of that rapid growth and the aforementioned previous government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The work isn’t in a vacuum and Russia has been the butt of every joke since their communist days. They are arguably on their way back to super power status given the natural resources and growth and that scares a lot of people for seemingly no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying they didn’t do the poisoning but there are just as many if not more reasons to look elsewhere than there are to point the finger at Russia.

       Not sure what is there to say. I can see how a reasonable person can think the Russian economic situation is anything but proof of incompetence. People realy underestimate the impact of neutral resources. Russia should be an economic powerhouse even with conservative expectations but they are just in the gutter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other countries raised cities in the desert with oil money and Russia well is Russia. No offense I think you have no understanding of how Russia would look like with proper leadership.

       No offense taken and I appreciate the time you took to actually respond with more than “no”. When I look at the Russian economy I consider the fact that their entire government literally toppled less than 30 years ago and while they are heavily vested in oil, they have made great strides economically since the fall of the USSR. Denying that is disingenuous but I can agree to disagree. Yes over the last few years their economy has been shitty but again, they depend on oil which has taken a huge hit over the last few years. Again, I can agree to disagree.

       60% of their exports are stuff they found laying around. This country does nothing but sell stuff they dug up. The country has a population of 150 million and have the economy of Canada. They are basically third world tier in terms of corruption. The people there have miserable lifes, they lead in addiction, in premature death, are high in suicides, unhappiness. People for some totally silly reason somehow romanticise Russia and Putin. The country would basically be on a Western level with moderate people in power. Just fuckin pump oil, sell it and divest.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was hard to fuck this up but they still managed to do this. They could have taken all the oil money and invest it in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half of the middle east is rich. Where is the Russian money gone? They have no technology that is noteworthy, no real exports.

      <p>
       150 million population with unlimited land, trillions in oil and they managed to fuck it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is all the money? In some lists the economy of Australia is apparently more valuable.

       Doesn't that mainly have to do with the corruption though, and not necessarily that there are profits left on the table that aren't being realized? In other words, corruption is leading all the money to be given to a few powerful hands at the top, rather than being distributed in a way that promotes a strong, vibrant economy and a happy population.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say half the countries in the Middle East are rich, but that doesn't mean their economies are necessarily booming right? I mean as far as I know, most of the countries in the Middle East rich off oil are also very corrupt, leading to most of that money being put in the hands of the very powerful, and not the general population or towards a modern economy. Wouldn't that be the parallel to Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       So rather than their main fault being incompetence, it seems to me their main fault is probably corruption and they are doing just fine money wise, not so good distribution of wealth wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we can point to their economy and say "see? They're so incompetent they can't even generate wealth for themselves." When in fact, they are generating wealth, just for a select few people and the rest of the country gets the remains.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to say that they are making moves internationally that don't benefit themselves because they are "incompetent, just look at their economy" doesn't really hold water if we can make a strong argument that their economy is mostly due to the corruption at play, rather than the incompetence. Granted there is room for argument there, but the point more so is not that it definitely
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       corruption to blame, rather that there
       <strong>
        is a legitimate argument there.
       </strong>
       Therefor, where you personally fall on that argument should not be used as supporting evidence to your claim that they don't know what they're doing internationally, because that supporting evidence (that their terrible economy is due to
       <strong>
        incompetence
       </strong>
       rather than corruption) is the subject of debate and not a solid fact in which to support an argument on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, there are plenty of countries and regimes that we would all agree to one extent or another are "incompetent". North Korea, probably being chief among them. They fit your criteria of incompetent (terrible economy). Yet even they haven't done something like this. Does this mean Russia is more incompetent than North Korea?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets keep in mind the degree to which we are accusing Russia of being incompetent here. We are saying that they are so incompetent, that they would kill a 60 year old former spy, after holding him in prison for 13 years, for seemingly no reason, using an illegal chemical weapon that has all kinds of connections and traces back to them, on another country's soil (a Western NATO backed country no less) which is highly illegal, while their current reputation is in the gutter internationally. It seems to me that there is a difference between incompetent and
       <em>
        suicidal
       </em>
       . This has such low potential benefit to them, while the overwhelming likelihood is that it would be incredibly detrimental to their well-being, that they would have to borderline-retarded to not understand the totally skewed risk/reward ratio. That would not just be incompetent, that would be either a) suicidal, or b) retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of risk/reward, and this will be my last point before I ice my fingers- a lot of the things the previous poster,
       <a href="/u/threeminuteshate">
        /u/threeminuteshate
       </a>
       , pointed out as evidence that Russia, for all their faults, had motives to do internationally (Ukraine invasion for example) undermines your theory that they are driven by pure incompetence. Yes, the Ukrainian invasion did not work out for them ultimately. That doesn't mean they didn't have a
       <strong>
        potential
       </strong>
       reward for doing it. That's the underlying point here. The poisoning of this spy had very little to no
       <strong>
        potential reward
       </strong>
       . Forget about a realized reward.
      </p>
      <p>
       This story definitely seems fishy. But that does
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       mean Russia didn't do it. All I'm saying is that we have to formulate stronger arguments. Doing something for seemingly no potential reward, while being overwhelmingly likely to be detrimental to you, is not simply incompetence. Summing it all up by saying "see? They're incompetent so they do dumb things" is just as simplistic and elementary as saying "Russia's evil. They do evil things just cuz." We have to think about potential motives for Russia here, and as of now I can't think of a single one that justifies the risk. You can say that points to incompetence, but I would say that actively committing incompetent acts for
       <strong>
        no
       </strong>
       potential gain isn't the hallmark of any country. Either something bigger than we realize was to be gained, or they had no reason to do it and therefore probably didn't.

       Sure but this as well leads to the same conclusion I have drawn before, questioning the motives of the Russians is mood. Most consequnces will likely again be against the poor. Those in power didn't suffer any losses yet so why do people claim the assasination couldn't be done by the Russians. It is the same conclusion.
      </p>

       I said exactly that. If Putin, or who else is only interested in power consolidation than the fallout from this is irrelevant likely. This refutes what OP was claiming as important premise for his case.

       You have to show that any of the consequences are relevant to them. What does Putin care about international opinion, he didn't back in 2014. You have to show that the consequnces hurt their specific agenda, which obviously means you have to be sure what their agenda is actually. If you can't do that then all this "they wouldn't have done this" is irrational speculation. You understand what I mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       How are we to judge the pros and cons of the hitjob without so little actual information. Claiming the Russians wouldn't have done this is baseless in my opinion. Again I don't know who did it.

       I have said no such thing. I made it clear in the very beginning that I don't know their agenda. I have then shown that if their agenda is prosperity they failed ridiculous hard. Since most of the repurcisions of such incidents are economic this wouldn't matter. You see what I am trying to say? Russia is in the dumpster, sadly for its 150 people, but this tells me that either they are incompetent or not interest in this. Therefore I conclude you can't say Russian wouldn't have done this. That is all. They might have, they might have not.

       In my personal opinion I don't see much players here gaining anything. People who work for Russia now know even more not betray the Russian state. May looks stronger than before. I don't believe any other state actor and proper motivation for this. The most likely thing is they offed an ex-spy to show who is boss and it derailed slightly.

       I wouldn't say corruption is the same as incompetence. Certainly not the type of incompetence that you can then extend to the reasoning behind doing something for seemingly no gain internationally. Corruption is incompetent if your goal is the betterment of your people, sure. But we know that's never a goal that leads to corruption. Corruption has a purpose, and that is to line your pockets and generate wealth for the greedy few. In that sense, if that is your goal, being corrupt is not incompetent. It is a perfectly competent strategy for lining your pockets. That's what they're doing and that is how incompetence and corruption are separate in this case.

       I do understand what you mean. It is important that we parse out how specifically this could be a detriment to them. By the same token,

        you
       </strong>
       have to establish how this could benefit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll start with me. This could hurt them economically in the form of sanctions. This could hurt them internationally by being extra justification to vote the Ukraine into NATO, which is the opposite of what Russia should want. Not to mention the generally frowned upon practice of committing an international crime on the foreign soil of a very powerful country, who is allies with the
       <strong>
        most
       </strong>
       powerful country in the world, who you are already on thin ice with. I'm not saying this will directly lead to those countries declaring war on Russia, but it certainly gives them a plausible reason for taking military action against Russia, and adds to the list that the West is seemingly compiling day by day. Why would Russia want to risk that? For
       <strong>
        what
       </strong>
       potential reward?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, now your turn. Tell me a reward they can possibly realize that justifies risking all of those things that I mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way I do enjoy these kinds of discussions, as there's no animosity here. We're just trying to figure out logically what is to be gained/lost here and why things may not be as they seem. You're right in saying none of us have proper data to come to conclusions, but there is enough data to determine the most plausible theories as opposed to the implausible ones.

       Like I said power consolidation. THere is also the argument to be made that when relations are in the shitter you can start good negotiations later on. If everybody is afraid of war you can more easily bring the  game "lets restart, we do this you drop sanctions lets go trading". People assume tensions are something new, happens all the time. This can change in a heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       They might use the world cup for a big come together or whatnot. Folks like Merkel are pretty open to warming relations. I personally think Putin and co think that they can at any given point change this around and reset the relations with Europe. I think he is right.

       Ok, first things first - have you ever been to Russia to say that the people are miserable? And suicide rates are quite low right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of "fuckin pump oil" - you have to realise that our GDP per capita would've never change if we had a different leadership. The gross oil export, which is at record high right now, would only give us around 3000$ yearly per person. We could've been Norway if we had 5 million people and the same amount of oil, but we are where we are with 147 million population that needs roads, police, medicine, etc. We tried investing in a lot of stuff and some parts of it works, but that's just slow. But we saw some decent growth and I hope we'll get back on track soon.

       Check the historic oil production. You oversimplify this to make Russia look better. Russia pumped more oil than Norway. Big amounts of Norway oil money is in their "state fund" anywways. It is not like the gave it all to the people. They have all they need and more. And Russia has nothing.

       Btw you should disregard per capita GDP it is window dressing used to fool people. A country of a handful of rich people can have quite a high per capita gdp, doesn't mean anything.

       Also, if you think that our government is that bad, what do you think of the Yeltsin's government that was installed by USA in 1996? We saw a tremendous GDP reduction during the pro-Western period 90s, does it still look better to you?

       Because Russia has a tendency to fudge every data they don't like, I hope that this now is at least common sense. This is just how it looks with no oversight. People fudge data. The suicide rate is often used to measure "well being" of countries so it makes sense to fake this data. In my opinion drug deaths like alcohol can be included in suicide at least somewhat. There is little difference between putting a bullet in your head and simply dieing because you are drunk everyday. Same underlying problem.

       With all due respect, I think you oversimplify the nature of political life. The party that controls the institutions that collect and interpret stats is always able to shred dat. In case it's the opposition, it'll just shred it to the worse. The same thing happens inside any "non-democratic" government because there are groups of influence there, almost like parties, and they shred data even before the "tyrant" takes a look. And only then he does it himself. Either way, you don't know with an absolute certainty what you see.

       I gave no value judgement at all. I merely said that I trust official government numbers less the more authoritarian the government is. Numbers get "fudged" all the time everywhere but more in Russia than in lets say the Netherlands. Pointing out number fudging in form of examples doesn't change that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faking of numbers is directly related to the amount of opposition in the country. If nobody is going to call you out you have no reason to be honest. The fact that the German employment numbers are so hotly debated is because they get called out for them all the time by the opposition. And nobody gets killed for it...

       You're statements are pretty inaccurate. The annexation of Crimea was a massive success for Putin because it provides a buffer from NATO allies and secures their ownership of Crimea's warm water port in the black sea. Therefore saying the outcome in the Ukraine was a disaster for Putin is misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Putin and his closer allies have already recouped the cost of the invasion and then some. It's difficult to take part in global trade when a ton of your assets and money are frozen due to sanction. Plus, have you seen Russia's primary trade partners? It's no wonder Russia isn't making much from their oil while countries like SA have a grip over the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Putin and his allies are stupid by any means, however I think they're very  desperate, and act like a wild animal backed into a corner.

       I mean sanctions were kind of inevitable but the Russians felt they couldn't lose the Navy access to the black sea. Its hard to say it ended bad when they knew the likely positives and negatives of what was going to happen.

       Just because we don't know what the motive is, doesn't mean there isn't a very good one. I believe the Russians thought the novichok is undetectable and if the british police can't produce a murder weapon, well then it must have not been murder.

       Except the british are ridiculously good at detecting these exotic poisons the russians keep on using (novichok now, polonium before)...

       They are saying symptoms exhibited match those known to be caused by Novichok.  In saying that Novichok is undetectable, they mean that chemical weapons detectors would not be able to detect the agent when, say, passing through airport/border security.

       I'm really not knowledgeable enough in that area to know one way or another.  However if I were to hazard a guess under the assumption that this was perpetrated by someone trying to blame Russia, I'm sure that even if they couldn't make Novichok itself, they could probably make/get their hands on some other agent that creates the same symptoms.  I do agree with OP that this whole incident doesn't really seem to benefit Russia in any way, but is of great benefit to anyone trying to move against Russia, whether directly, or their interests in Syria/Iran.

      <p>
       If you know the structure, you can design a process to make the compound. The difficulty is thus not in the chemistry (people can make a lot more complicated stuff) but in the safety issues. These are alleviated by the synthesis as a binary weapon (the two parts are less dangerous) and by taking proper precautions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media won't tell you this, and for good reasons, but it's actually not that difficult to make a chemical weapon.

       That by itself is not enough to determine Novichok.
      </p>
      <p>
       It works as an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor. The same as Sarin or VX, basically, so it shows the same symptoms. This means that, without the chemical structure you can't tell the difference between Novichok and Sarin.

       Click the link. Novichok is NOT the only organophosphate out there... there are MANY.

       that Russia is the ONLY party capable of producing Novichok... which is bullshit - and the assumption that no one else could produce and use this agent is ludicrous.

       As I have made no accusation against any particular party, I bear no burden of "proof".

       What I have done is call attention to the fact that those who
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       made such accusations have failed to present evidence that would tend to substantiate or validate said claims, let alone pronounce the accused
       <em>
        "guilty as charged"
       </em>
       , and proceed to enact punitive measures against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been around (and paying attention) for a while, long enough to know NOT to take "official pronouncements" by ANY government at face value.

       Politicians and governments lie for ulterior motives. When they do, it is not they, but the

       who pay the price.
      </p>

       <strong>
        <em>

       to get us into war with Iraq, which cost Trillions and killed hundreds of thousands.

       The UK government has made public accusations. (Target audience: THE PUBLIC)
      </p>
      <p>
       The UK government has already pronounced its verdict, and has applied effective punitive measures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question: As the accuser, has the UK government satisfied its obligation under
       <strong>
        <em>
         burden of proof
        </em>

       (Kindly qualify your response by citing any inculpatory evidence)

       First of all the guy never betrayed Putin as he was a double agent during Yeltsins tenure.

       Secondly, Putin is far more astute to kill someone so obviously. Read up on KGB assassination methods to figure out that this attempt was not done by the Russians.

       The KGB had an entire handbook on assassinating people, its in Russian and I saw it a long time ago but you can find it on rutracker as a torrent. Anyways, they talk about using umbrella guns to assissinate people (like they did in the 50's in Bulgaria) where a random guy just walks by with an umbrella and the target is dead and nobody knows how or why or by whom he died. They could have kidnapped him. Had 'thugs' on the street kill him. Put heart medicine in his coffee.

      <p>
       No. Because there are hundreds of other former spies who defected and yet none of them were killed. Also, this guy was in Russian prison for a while, they could have killed him at any time in prison and then blamed it on the inmates. They never did. So why kill him now.

       Didn’t you see the point that Russia has nothing to gain from the attack? Because they certainly don’t . Much like Syria’s gas attacks. I’m a Canadian and I certainly don’t think America and allies are the good guys when it comes to foreign policy. Often times we are the baddies - Iraq etc. You shouldn’t be so quick to trust your government because you live in a (corporate) democracy.

       </p>
       <p>
        But whenever something bad about Russia comes up, people jump to their defense and assume that our government and all our democratic allies are lying to us, and good old dictator Putin is the only one telling us the truth. This seems absolutely absurd to me. Why are we supposed to assume we are always lying and Russia is always some innocent wholesome actor getting a bad wrap from the rest of the world?

        So when Putin asks for evidence, he's asking for someone to give physical proof of something that was created to be physically undetectable.

      <p>
       Anything can be detected. But it requires knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this specific case:
NMR spectroscopy looking after the signal of hydrogen, carbon and maybe phosphorus can determine their chemical environment. If you know this, you can get the structure. Analysis typically requires a couple of mg of the product.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass Spectrometry: Looks to fragmentate the compound and measure the molecular mass of the fragments. This does not give a structure, but can confirm it if the masses fit. To use it to confirm, you need a spectrum of the compound and then compare your sample spectrum with that of the pure compound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chromatography: HPLC looks at polarity of the molecule. A molecule with the same polarity will stay on the column for the same time. It requires calibration with a known sample, because you can't properly predict these retention times though.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear that either they can determine it's structure, or they already knew it. But if that's possible, they can also synthesize it, meaning Russia does not have a monopoly.

       This is the most important post in Reddit history and nobody will read it. Our handlers want a war for energy with Russia, and they will get their war. If you look at the politics sub for 5 minutes you will see 50 posts from "Liberals" and "Democrats" demanding war with Russia and seething about Trump's lack of response to the Russians. If we don't stop this we're all going to fucking die here.

       Im not a native english speaker, but i dont think you are either. I found a few mistakes in your recent post!
      </p>
      <p>
       "I am rural California." Not a proper sentence.  You live in rural California.
"I doubt there is any where within one motorcycle tank range of a major Californian City that will be able to support 'Living of the Land'." Its "anywhere", not "any where".  Also a pretty messy sentence over all.

       “Is tarnished” mixed with “in tatters” in the mind gives you “in tarnishes”. Only a true English speaker would have enough synonyms floating around their brain to conflate the two.

       where the official narrative "all falls apart" is right out of the gate, where it has exactly ZERO EVIDENCE BACKING IT.  it's the responsibility of those making a claim to provide the evidence for it, not the other side's responsibility to prove a negative.

       It's not asking you to flat out believe a blanket statement about the news lying about everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP outlines the post very well. They took all the main points from what we are told in the media, and raised questions about them through sourced material.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is our duty as citizens of the free world to think critically about what the media is claiming. The media itself is supposed to be able to back up it's own stories, and be able to account for questions from the public. It is also the outlet with which we see events unfolding in the world, and determines the response to issues from the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when we go along with everything the media tells us without any questions or critical thinking? WMD's in Iraq was a pretty good example.

       i have an example of a case that rests on flimsy ideas which the facts don't pertain to.  the official narrative.  not a single fact has been provided to support their allegations at all, in fact.

       Then why don't you do a similar post citing sources to show that it is not true?

       actually the problem is that i
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       taken everything the government has said in to account, and that's all they have, is shit they've said.  it's not a matter of making the story fit "my narrative" (whatever that would be).  it's a matter of calling bullshit on accusations that the government has done nothing to provide absolutely any substantiation for and are thus obvious bullshit.  i'm not on the appropriate level of brain dead for buying in to utterly non validated, politically charged rhetoric at face value.  show the evidence or stfu is "my narrative".

       Lol, I should have guessed this would be a comment. Is there any common thread to my "derailing" or am I just a random troller? Or are some of you guys jumping to fantastical conclusions based on nothing?
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit, I do tend to disagree on this sub. That is because many of you knuckleheads seem to have little to no critical thinking skills. For a sub reddit that espouses open mindedness and rational thinking, many of the users alarmingly jump to calling someone a troll or a shill if they bring up arguments against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you did indeed go through my post history you will surely see the comments I made on the absolute retard who posted the bull shit about Stephen Hawking the other day. If you read all my replies, you should see I do actually value the premise of this sub. The stupid ass Stephen Hawking shit practically reaked of TopMinds fucking with you guys, AGAIN. I will upvote your comment because, it deserves just as much merit as mine in this thread.

       Oh my that clicks for me. Christopher Steel's phoney dossier is unraveling and we will be looking for his so called Russian sources but we can't if they are dead.  And they can fan antiRussian fervor again by using a signature chemical weapon and pretending like no one outside Russia could produce or use it.

It is widely reported on the web and in US media that it was Miller who first recruited Skripal. My own ex-MI6 sources tell me that is not quite true as Skripal was “walk-in”, but that Miller certainly was involved in running Skripal for a while. Sadly Pablo Miller’s LinkedIn profile has recently been deleted, but it is again widely alleged on the web that it showed him as a consultant for Orbis Intelligence and a consultant to the FCO and – wait for it – with an address in Salisbury. If anyone can recover that Linkedin entry do get in touch, though British Government agencies will have been active in the internet scrubbing."

       <p>
        To spell it out: the UK's own chemical weapon's toxiology expert wrote that there is no way currently to detect the use of novichok. Although it is impossible to prove a negative in this situation, this is incredibly strong disconfirming evidence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how you're interpreting the previous two quotes before this statement as evidence of what you claim. You've basically grabbed two quotes from public sources saying that they don't have independent confirmation of how Novichok nerve agents are created, as the only public evidence of their creation is from that former Soviet scientist. All we can actually infer from this, is that these public individuals and organizations don't fully understand how Novichok works and haven't confirmed that it exists. That's not really surprising to me, at least, as I doubt those organizations are in the habit of actually making nerve agents to confirm what the Soviet scientist wrote about.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves us with the option to either believe that UK and Western allies have classified knowledge of Novichok agents and their use, or not. Obviously everyone can determine whether they agree with that assumption or not, but I don't agree with your summary of point 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do raise good questions, however, as history shows us we should be skeptical of publicly revealed intelligence when it could possibly be used to instigate international conflicts (Bush/Iraq etc).

       The organizations cited are the two organizations who
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       have knowledge of novichok. The 2016 textbook was written by a senior scientist at Porton Down, which is the UK agency that tests for chemical agents. There is not another agency in the UK who would have knowledge if not Porton Down. The second is the international organization that oversees the use of chemical weapons, and is also written by the same author and lead scientist at Porton Down.

       I think you can pretty much guarantee that both the uk and the us know exactly what novichok agents are, how to make them, and how to test for them. Why the hell would they make that information available to everyone on the internet? That's some shit i have no problem with them keeping secret. Isn't the whole idea of this sub that world governments are keeping secrets? Popular opinion here has pedophile cults involving thousands of people staying secret for decades. They cant keep something like this secret? Really?

       Some of your premises are incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       First you imply Russia to be an smart agent with an agenda that is clear to you. This premise is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is in the dumpster and it is getting worse due to coincious decisions made by their leadership. Those actions are not in dispute. Ukraine was dumb and cost them dearly and they still did it. Your premise is invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second premise is that other state actors have the motivation to start shit with Russia. This is my opinions is one the dumbest things that came out of the_donald. Why would people want WW3? A war that will be fought with nuclear weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your interpretation of the ultimatum thing is naive. This is not a legal issue within a state. If the UK has evidence that a foreign power used chemical weapons on their soil they have no reason to share this frickin info with Russia because they know Russia knows it. This is not a legal issue. Why would UK try to convince Russia they did what they know they did? There is no judge in this case. They shared this infos with Allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       No clue why you think it is relevant if the UK shares the evidence with Russia. 80 years ago they went to war over shit like this. The UK will not expose their intelligence procedures to show Russia they know they did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not mean I believe Russia did it, I just point out that your argument makes no sense really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another premise of yours:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It doesn't take a genius to realize that the motive to assassinate this 60-year-old just isn't there.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Incorrect the motivation is the same as always when Russia/Soviet Union assassinates peoples outside their borders. To send a message. They consider this message likely more important that the repercussions. As it looks now the entire thing goes pretty bad. But well so did the ukraine invasion and they still did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to point out that while some of your points have small merit the fact that you claim the Russians had no motive at all is so absurd you are either dishonest with your attention or not able to make simple conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your first point about the nerve agent are only appearing to be strong arguments. Even if the entire world would have this nerve agent, Russia would still be the prime suspect.

       People didn't expect to die in those wars, and actually, nearly nobody from WW1 died. Executing "politicians" after wars was new. No clue why you think starting WW1 is comparable with nuclear holocaust.

       Brush up your history you amateur. Most people in charge during WW1 were at least "ok" with war. There was no kabal in the background initiating the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you don't see the difference between royalty starting wars for centuries and people trying to avoid WW3 is alarming. You noticed how there is no war between major powers since atomic bombs? You might want to check out why this is. People don't want to start wars with folks that have atomic bombs. The assertion of rich people like Clinton wanting to start WW3 shows how stupid the average the_donald user is. Utterly absurd. The first thing when you are rich as hell is starting nuclear holocaust so you lose everything?  Folks like Soros certainly want to see the world where they live like kings go up in flames. You guys lmao....

       No, because they kill people regularly. Is your post serious? I "hate" Russia because I consider them a threat to me and my family. I also think they turned millions of life to shit due to their incompetence. Eastern Europe was in the dumpster for decades. All Russia. This country has brought so much suffering to people it is hard to quantify. The Russian people got ass fucked by history big time. Their lifes are so shitty half of them dies miserable deaths long before their time. Russia is pure sadness. Still nobody wants war with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if there is a polite way to say this but comparing the outbreak of WW1 with today's situation is so mind boggling dumb.

        WW1 did not break out by accident or because diplomacy failed. It broke out as the result of a conspiracy between the governments of imperial Germany and Austria-Hungary to bring about war, albeit in the hope that Britain would stay out.

      <p>
       But it doesn't say that at all. You can take an unknown sample and put it through an NMR etc.. to identify what chemical it is. If you know that particular chemical is in the 'novichok' group then you've 'detected the use of novichok.' What he's saying is that the Russian government has not directly verified the chemical structures of the 'novichok' agents so you can only take Vil Mirzayanov's account of them. However, Russia did verify his account by putting him on trial twice for disclosing that information, claiming he had released 'state secrets'. Which makes Russia's claim today to never have had such a program remarkably Orwellian.

       These are both from Robin Black, the first in 2013 and the second in 2016. It is stating that they are unsure what the exact properties of the compound are. Maybe they would be able to identify chemicals, but they would not be able to identify them as novichok or as distinct from other nerve agents. If they do not know what the properties are, how did they discern that "novichok" was used, instead of another nerve agent?

       "Novichok" is a large group of chemicals (hundreds, I think.) Some of the specific chemicals have been described publicly by the scientists who worked on them. A chemist can (generally) take an arbitrary completely unknown sample of a chemical and determine the
       <em>
        chemical structure
       </em>
       of that unknown substance, hence identifying exactly what chemical it is. If that chemical is one of the known 'novichok' agents, then it is a 'novichok' agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every chemical has a unique structure, like a fingerprint. What he's saying is that no official body (Russia, the UN...) has published the 'fingerprints', only Vil Mirzayanov and his colleague who both worked on the novichok program. You can say the sample found in England matched what
       <strong>
        he
       </strong>
       published, but what he published is not 'official', even though he worked on the program and was tried twice by the Russian government for publishing that information, thus verifying it.

       You don't need to know the 'properties' (not sure what you mean by this in this context) to identify a chemical structure. This would be trivial to do even for an undergraduate chemist if it weren't so dangerous, and they had some idea what they were looking for. If you're claiming the chemical structure is unknowable beyond some Soviet scientists, that renders your second claim nonsense. How can you make it without knowing what it is? The black quote is just saying none of the structures of novichok have not been confirmed as effective nerve agents, but we have a good idea what they are, and can assume their hazardous nature from similarity to our own nerve agents.

       Well, maybe they don't make it up but they report on what officials make up. Before every war we have been lied to. Manning gave us the diplomatic cables that showed that they habitually lie and make up stuff even in the smallest of matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you, as NYT does, mainly rely on officials and think tanks for your foreign reporting then it's pretty pointless. Another area were we know NYT is completely unreliable is anything that deals with national security. They will sit on leaks that are not officially approved as showed with the Snowden leaks and with Operation Merlin. Further, they are completely useless when ever it involves the Democratic Party and during elections in general. Again I refer to the leaked emails that showed a relationship between the news outlet and the party that doesn't instill confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       NYT is also mainly owned by a
       <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/nyt/ownership-summary">
        Mexican oligarch who made his money in the telecom business
       </a>
       . I dont trust that person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I have a hard time to think of anything useful they have done that they were not forced to do by other publications threatening to scoop them for the last 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything dealing with the NYPD is equally suspect and useless. Not even mentioning that New York is full of mafia linked and corrupt dealing of which NYT have uncovered zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       NYT reporting and truth is only incidental. Perhaps you have areas where you find them reliable?

       You are suggesting they are fabricating the news the guy gave you entirely. I can't think of a time when they'd do that. And you actually believe mainstream reporting all the time, as that is the source of every main story in the world that you are aware of. If you are believing some site that is talking about something that happened, you only think that happened because they got if from some other straight news source.

       Main story today is about a man carrying bags and NYT claiming that it shows how he planned an attack never caught on film. Forgetting that 'plans' can't be deferred by a man carrying bags. It is speculative storytelling in service of the official law enforcement story. Which they have a horrible track record on.

       My view is mainly formed from my education of economic history, geographical area studies and engineering. To a lesser degree, I follow people with proven predictable ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a person such as Matt Taibbi who was the one that should be credited with the analysis that the US mirrors Russia, both with their oligarch centered politics and gushing admiration for government agents turned politicians; the ever steepening of income inequality and over the top militarization. But even he told me when I asked him, that there are limits to what can be tolerated of uncomfortable truths in media.

        The Real News
       </a>
       is by far the best source for news in the US. And symptomatic, it was created by a Canadian. It also function as a cross pollination between the brightest people on other outlets such as Alternet's Max Blumenthal (an apple that fell far from the tree) and Aron Mate from The Intercept, among other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Method of finding sources:
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        how often have they been right previously?
       </li>
       <li>
        do they make it easy for me to access the sources they report on and form my own opinion?
       </li>
       <li>
        do they provide understanding and not just 'facts', eg if they have an analytical explanation for how these things effect other things. Basically, an understanding of the world that are more than 'very important person said this - stay tuned for our next segment when another important person says something important!'.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
       I have had a unique opportunity the last few years as I retired at the age of 37 leaving behind a successful CEO career at an engineering company to read up and investigate the quality of our news. The US don't produce news but anger and confusion. I have lived in four different countries in my life and I have never sen anything as bad as what's going on here now. That The Real News are able to outclass NYT despite their limited resources proves to me that NYT and the likes, are not even trying to do their job. They are doing something that Mexican oligarchs are willing to pay upwards to a billion dollar to control. And it sure ain't news.

       The mainstream news has many biases. But they also view their reputation as an asset. They have ombudsmen, editors, reporters of note.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real News is getting much of its information from the mainstream media itself. That's part of my point with this.
       <em>
        They believe
       </em>
       the mainstream media gets most of the facts right. That's why they use them for their information too. Where do you think all of what we are discussing even comes from in the first place? All alternative news without straight reporting staff rely on the straight reporting staff of others. They simply have to. So if you are believing Real News, you are also believing the mainstream medias straight reporting, until you decide not to for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was unable to find any corrections page. Do they have one? When you exercise editorial control, you choose what to show and, more importantly because there's more of it, what not to show. What would you say their biases are? Every organization has some.

       Moreover, you can then confirm that the victim(s) have the correct change in levels of the target enzyme of nerve agents. If you have a) the correct symptoms in the victim b) correct lab tests c) serum analysis that shows novichok presence in the blood (depends on how long it sticks around) d) NMR or MS showing novichock on the scene.... then its probably novichok. Its likely a state actor. And the pattern of previous assassinations (Litenvenko, Nemtsov), the agent used (a Russian nerve agent rather than a western VX agent), and Russian state TV basically saying bad things happen to traitors in England...
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Russia, and Putin wants everyone to know its Russia, just like with Litinvenko they left a radioactive trail back to Moscow and they put the Litenvenko assassin in the Russian congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Litivenko poisoned with polonium, Nemtsov gunned down literally in sight of the Kremlin in a real pro hit, now this... Putin is letting people know what happens when you cross him.... and that he is not scared of the Western response... so far he is right... no real response with teeth.

       The main issue with this is that either OP's condensed version of #1 is true or #2 is true. But they are mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       To determine Novichok use, you could indeed go through NMR. It's a bit unlikely, given the amount of sample an NMR actually needs (mg range) versus the other techniques (Mass spectrometry goes into the ppb range for qualitative analysis). But the issue is the same, because you need a clue about the structure. So either the NMR gives you the structure, or you need it in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you have the structure, devising a strategy to synthesize it is not all that difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in effect: Either we can determine it's use, but it's not only Russia that can produce it, or only Russia can produce it but we can't determine that it was Novichok.

       Hamish de Bretton-Gordon is intentionally or unintentionally misguiding the readers in that article by trying to conflate the fact that the novichok agents were developed in Russia, with the claim that this was the only place they were produced. He's quoting a book by Vil Mirzayanov a Russian scientist that has released the chemical formulae for the novichiok agents, and is the source of pretty much all the information the media is siting about them. In the same book the guardian are quoting he states that the precursors for binary versions of the nerve agents can be produced by any chemical laboratory capable of producing pesticides or fertiliser. This is because the whole project was based around hiding the production of these chemicals in commercial chemical plants.

       It's definitely possible that they could have been made by someone else, including the DSTL itself. And I could be wrong to defer to the Bretton-Gordon's claim: if this is an attempt to manufacture aggression between regions or manufacture the appearance of aggression, it would make sense to hold the narrative that only one country could be the origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the surface at least, the claim that Russia is the most likely actor comes from the fact that they would have the most knowledge to make it, and the claim that they saved some portion of their stock from being destroyed. In that case, Russia would not have a true monopoly, merely a virtual one, which is why I felt it relevant to mention.

       There is no reference to this particular nerve agent in the article you cited that makes the connection to the attempted murder. The article discusses nerve agents in general and explicitly cites VX and sarin when describing the difficulty of producing nerve agents.

       Actually not that big of a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making Sarin or VX is a well-described process, Novichok is not. However, since the structure is known, it's not too difficult to design a synthesis route if you're a moderately skilled organic chemist. In that regard the difficulties of Sarin and VX are the same as those with Novichok, in that they mainly are found in the area of storage and safety during synthesis

       It's absolutely preposterous to claim that can come only from Russia, as anyone could have made it. Even so I still believe Russia is behind the assassination even if it was done by a rogue agent or anything of the sort.

       "wmd" might not be an appropriate term here, for a wide range of reasons, one of which is 15 years old. A "lesser country" triggered the 1st WW. Usually countries get fucked up in the way you think if they do not have enough military power or alliances. But I wasn't being honest earlier when I said "no", of course that it would be a very grave act, an act of war as you put it, and this is why I don't concede that Russia would be foolish enough to do anything nearly as direct as this attack. Whomever did this had to do it in such a way that could NEVER trace back to the real origin of the order.
Obviously, I am of the opinion that Russia is deliberately being framed for this attack.

       I have yet to hear anyone mention that Skirpal was originally recruited around 1990 by an MI6 station chief in Tallinn, Estonia, named Pablo Miller and that his main contact in Moscow way back then was none other than the same Christopher Steele who put the dirty dossier on Trump together for the cabal of Trump's political enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skirpal was also still feeding information directly to Steele after he was promoted to the Russian desk in London years later. All in all as Skipal confessed at his trial in 2006 that he had been helping British agents for more than a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also known that Skirpal and Miller are still close friends who both reside in Salisbury just a stone's throw away from the UK's Porton Down bio-weapon and chemical warfare lab which is certainly suspicious in and of itself  in light of him being poisoned by a chemical weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skirpal has been living "in retirement" in Salisbury for the past eight years since he was exchanged for a captured Russian agent in what was one he largest swaps to ever take place between Russia and the west that involved a great many more besides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skirpal also seems to have a great deal of money and appears to be comfortably well-off according to his neighbours.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just to make things a little bit more interesting, Pablo Miller is listed as the only other member of the company that Steele has registered and sold his investigative services to the various cabal members under.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rather interesting set of past and present connections to more recent events that it seems only too likely Skirpal would know all or something about through Miller if he wasn't directly involved and played an integral part in them himself, given that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there some danger that he might spill the beans or was threatening to if certain demands of his own weren't met that could have led to the incident or simply the fact that he might if they were ever traced back to him?

       <strong>

       ... He is clearly referring to the Russians here... but who said the manufacturer had to be Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowhere in that article does he unequivocally state that
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       Russia could have made this agent. He chose his words very carefully. Saying the agent was only made in one place in Russia, does not mean it was never made anywhere else... at Porton Down, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact "they have no more anywhere else" (referring to the Russians) and "every country has it" could both be true statements, without contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the source, I have to assume this choice of wording was not a mistake. He made sure that he couldn't be called a liar if it was determined that other nations had also made this agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh... and he has nothing at all to do with the OPCW.

       So let me get this straight,
       <strong>
        the
       </strong>
       guy to consult on chemical weapons and toxicology in the U.K. has stated that he doesn't know of any credible literature suggesting how to identify Novichok's use, right? That was the most important part to me.

       Mirzayanov, who first leaked knowledge of Novichok, and who worked at the facility where it was initially developed, seems to think it very possible that other states have since acquired Novichok.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The British could certainly have synthesized it on the basis of the formulas that I published in my book,” Mirzayanov said in the

        interview

      <blockquote>

        The UK is not following international protocol.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The protocol you cite isn't a hard rule, and the circumstances around this specific individual elevate this case above suspected chemical misuse in another manner. That said, Article X states that the Convention doesn't impede on rights to defend against attacks, which you could make a strong argument that this falls under. In addition, the UK says it will cooperate with the OPCW.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sure but if we are going to regard anything as a standard for dealing with these sort of things, we will adhere to the guidelines set forth by the OPCW, not the U.K.'s whim. Russia was under no obligation to abide by the U.K.'s 24 hour request unless the U.K. were to back up their request with a threat of war or some similar act of violence by which Russia would be forced to respond.

       The very first thing you should think is this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you worked for the Russian Secret Police and were tasked with murdering an ex-Russian agent who was now in Britain what would you do?  Would you a) Use a nerve agent that can be directly linked back to Russia or b) just stab the cunt, a few hundred times, in the middle of the street, steal his phone and wallet and run off?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when you finally reach your decision to use a nerve agent that can easily be traced back to Russia and you present this plan to Vlad Putin, how do you think he'd react?  Do you really think he'd say 'this is good, they can see that we have done this', or do you think he'd say 'don't be a prick, just stab the cunt and make it look like a street robbery'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheep normies think we all live in a fucking James Bond novel.  Why run the risk of bringing a powder through borders (where you could be caught), then dispersing this powder where a gust of wind could blow it back at you?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, you go to Britain, nip to a department store, buy a Global G2 cooking knife, tart up the stock, then stick it right in his heart (it's also sharp enough to cut his head clean off, like cutting butter).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope.... we'll go the powder route!

       Everyone is assuming that they hated this guy and wanted him dead. But maybe it's not about that. Maybe it's about making a statement that leaves all Russia's enemies in no doubt - we are untouchable and will get you wherever you run to.

       Yes Russia is stupid and has and continues to do stupid things. Sloppily poison a man? I just don't see it. Also didn't they have the guy in custody, in Russia, before? Why wait until he got to the UK?

       It's McCarthyism 2.0. It worked for them then to pump money into a military industrial complex with no clear enemy to defeat post WWII, and they think it will work for them again. It might - for people who don't delve really deeply into this sort of fuckery, there's no reason for them to distrust the narrative.

       Superb post - tip of the hat. You might consider posting this somewhere it could get more exposure like Medium. Just like the bullshit accusations of gas attacks by the Syrian gov't, we have to keep pushing back against this because it's the sort of thing that can start a hot war with Russia. Thanks for putting in the time and energy to investigate and for having the smarts to put it together in a digestible format.

       Just wanted to say thank you for this post. I was so disgusted listening to May speak to the house of commons the other day...how she just said the Russians used sarin in Syria as if it were a proven fact...and all the useful idiots chanting "here, here" as they agreed to everything the war mongers said.

       I agree in that the UK played the blame game too fast and without providing any solid proof. I’m not exactly sure yet that Russia wasn’t involved somehow but that’s something only time will tell.

       This is about the most sensible opinion you can have on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was Russia, then the UK has to show proof of that. If it wasn't they have to hunt the real culprits. But both take time and May basically took the opportunity to try and score a couple of political points. She takes it from Thatcher's book, obviously, but we are no longer in the (internet-less) 80's...

       Doesn't bother me - i'm fairly convinced the majority of users that post that sort of bullshit response are either on their way to being brain dead, payed posters or bots. Some people will read it, but i get your point - and it does hurt to see such a response.

       Make it impossible for them to own any property in civilized countries.  Personally, as a cherry on top, I'd just confiscate (via special taxes with property liens) all owned Russian property, period.  They could get it back when they give Crimea back to Ukraine.

       We sanction them for every little thing and lack evidence that they did any wrongdoing to deserve the sanctions. It’s the people decision to join Russia. Why should the US care about something that doesn’t matter to them thousands of miles away from its homeland?

       In regarding point 5 (the only important point), everything you stated is inane.  They didn't kill him while he was in prison, simply so they could use him in a prisoner swap.

       In regards to this being the worst possible time, Id argue that this is the
       <em>
        best
       </em>
       possible time.  Putin demonstrates to the world and to the Russians that he can act with impunity.  The elections are a foregone conclusion.
Remember a few years back when he invaded Ukraine?  There were Olympic events happening while this happened.  Putin has a track record of commuting nefarious acts while  important events are happening.

       Well you're judgment is clearly flawed.  Not wearing a bra will cause you to have flapjacks later in life, no one likes flapjacks.

      <p>
       As far as Ukraine goes, TPTB misjudged Russia's reaction when they stoked the uprising in Ukraine.  Assuming he'd he distracted with the Olympics.

       They were attempting to overthrow Syria were very upset by Russian protection of Assad.  Now Assad has one the Western backed civil war and there's no way Russia will allow the overthrow of Iran.

       They need to build international coalition of support for actions they are preparing for.  These little ham fisted dings against Putin will be used to further this agenda.

       Bingo - if the US is to control the totality of the Middle East, they need Syria and Iran. That means they gotta get past Russia. It's clear the CFR or some other string pullers have decided we're gonna do this, whether it means nuclear war or not.

       Judging by the amount of suspicious deaths of previous kremlin defectors, which went unpunished btw, Im more willing to believe Putin is responsible for this one to. And if out of all these suspicious muders, this one was the only one that was not ordered by Putin, at least my guess was not a totally uneducated one.

       From that article:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Mr Williamson will use a speech to Policy Exchange, a think-tank, to make the case for increased defence spending to meet the growing threat from Russia and other hostile state actors. The Ministry of Defence is facing a £20bn shortfall in funding over the next 10 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        “In the face of intensifying threats, we must prioritise investment in military capabilities,” he will say. “We cannot sit back and let events overtake us.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The attack in Salisbury has raised questions about whether the government should invest more in its programme to deal with chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is a motive right there - a profit motive.  Reminds me of Iraq and Cheney's investments, or just American weapons manufacturers and all the endless conflict they reap profits from.

       Great post. 
A simple rule of thumb is:
IF a person disappears then it could be that the person was fed into a grinder and is no longer alive
IF a body is found and evidence points to a certain person or power it is a set up.

       Just like the idea that Syria would gas their own people at the point in the war when they had no need to do so.

       OP made it clear why: undermine Russia's standing with the publics of Nato members to further increase sanctions, expulsion of diplomats and sequestration of assets. The aim is to build an iron wall around Russia and isolated totally from the world economy until it buckles and retreats from the Middle East.

       no. i am saying that any punishments meted out on Russia should be consistent with punishments meted out to other countries for similar misdemeanours. tThat is a basic concept of justice. Anything else is pure discrimination against a polity. That smells of bigotry and racism.

        Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

       Regarding item 5, it doesn't make much sense to compare prison terms in Russia with those in the US. According to Russian criminal law, the maximum punishment for high treason (with which Skripal was charged) is 20 years, and the minimum is 12. Skripal's relatively mild term is explained by the fact that he cooperated with the investigators.

       If novichoks are relatively easy to produce, there's probably a handful of state actors that would benefit from increased friction between US/UK &amp; Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire McCarthy-era anti-Russia narrative has steered the US into dangerous waters and has done serious damage to the US.  Its clear some media outlets have become reckless and irresponsible with what their 1st Amendment rights and 5th estate privileges allow. Aren't the media outlets that persist with the McCarthy-era anti-Russia hysteria and flame-fanning basically shouting, "FIRE!!" in a crowded movie theatre?

       I can see this event being used as a rallying cry and that this is all faked, but no one here can explain how a potential war with a nuclear power is in anyone's interest. Proxy wars, say in Iran sure, but not WW3 that everyone is claiming. It's silly to think that's what the powers that be want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't get the big defense of Russia here (I mean on the sub in general not necessarily OP as he does bring up some alternative explanations.) Russia isn't some poor little country being picked on. It's a corrupt oligarch ran by a thieving murdering former KGB agent. This poisoning isn't some unheard of thing for Russia to do, I personally think that Putin wanted to send a message or at least someone in Russia as they had it out for the guy based on Putin's statement's about him in the pass after the prisoner exchange and they got cocky and that they didn't expect this blowback to happen. Countries make mistakes all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has it's own goals, such as the destabilization of NATO and to regain influence in old Soviet areas. I think they thought that by showing that in numerous ways such as this poisoning, the election interference in the US, and with their invasions of Ukraine and Crimea that they are a force to be reckoned with and that NATO isn't as solid as other countries who may think of joining up with them would like to believe and may reconsider angering Russia by joining.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way good write up! I just think that everyone's fears of WW3 is extremely silly and that there's a lot of AstroTurfing going on in this for Russia's defense.

       Russia is not really the anti-NATO aggressor. The US and others broke our non-expansion treaties with Russia and have repeatedly rebuffed attempts by Russia to engage in meaningful dialog and disarmament. Over and over Russia is on the record trying to dial back nuclear arms, extending invitations to work with us on anti-terrorism, etc. Hell, Putin just did this a couple of days ago in the interview with Megyn Kelly. If you're going to understand this issue, you have to be able to view things from their side - Russia is a relatively poor country that spends 1/20th of what the US does on defense and has a very small footprint outside their region. Compared with our 1000+ bases that we know about. Russia sin is being in the way of our scheduled wars in Syria and Iran.

       I understand Russia has their own interests. Putin can say he wants peaceful talks all he wants. He's a crooked politician who steals from his own people. Like most politicians including our own I'm not going to take his word on anything as what he really truly wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can paint this rosy picture of Russia all you want, but Russia is led by gangsters whose corruption runs so deep it could make our own corrupt individuals blush. Sorry but I'm not going to take anything they say at face value.

       Yes it's just a big coincidence that all enemies of the current Russian government end up poisoned with polonium, novichok, commit "suicide" or just get gunned down in the street.

       Putin made his career as a spy in the secret police of a totalitarian state. How dumb do you have to be not to realise that he's still behaving like a KGB agent consistently lying, manipulating, assassinating, using covert warfare, using cyber warfare, etc.

       Piece all of this together, and you get zero reason why Putin want this guy killed in this fasion. It's costly, inefficient, and awfully complicated. Putin isn't a dumbass to do that type of shit. It's more like sbd else try to drum up a war with Russia.

       The number of years do not matter. It's about the message that you will never be safe. Again, classic secret police KGB tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemical poison is perfect because everyone knows it's Russia but they don't have to admit it publicly. If you have someone yelling die traitor it gets pretty difficult to deny it was related to Russia. Plus the knife attacker will have to go to prison, which doesn't benefit anyone. Chemical poison will also get much more news coverage which emphasise the message that Russia can kill whoever they want without anyone being able to do anything about it. It's all about projecting power to the world, to the UK, to the Russian opponents, which is a very important objective for Putin.

       It's flimsy bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin PERSONALLY let him go, so he has zero qualms with the guy. If he want the guy dead, he would have killed the guy when he is in a Russia prison. Less risk and more message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin doesn't need the "You can't touch me" message since the Russian has already flatten ISIS, which is more than enough to get the message out. This is just excessive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin also don't want NATO to choke Russia into place, and this sounds more like an excuse for NATO to do just that. It's bad for Russia, and it's bad for him too.
      </p>

       This....... actually looks more like a Russian wet work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dude have a grudge with the Russian Intelligence, is an exile (which means he's either defected and get away, or getting his civilian revoked when he was in hiding), has good amount of intel to flip over to other Western country, and probably already leak some.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there's still a good amount of possibility that the CIA or the MI6 did the assassination, but the FSB are more likely to do this given past history, timing and motiv. Also strangling sbd isn't really that flamboyant, cost little, and practically untraceable to tying up loose ends compare to sth like nerve gas since rat poison would've work with the same effect with 1/20 the cost if they want to poison sbd.

       Yes, London might be jealous about Russian money, but on the other hand Russia surely doesn't need those bastards back home poor and Russia's part of the deal is still unclear.

       No, he doesn't.  We're not in court.

       And he's not blaming; he got to Israel by simply asking which (other) countries stood to benefit the most from the attack, and pointed out who has a history of this type of thing.

       I'm not convinced Israel did it, but I'm very skeptical of anything that follows the "rush to judgment, but slow-walk the "proof"" textbook.

       A few things I've noticed:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The attack happened in Salisbury, a town about 10 miles from the UK's biological weapons research facility at Porton Down and one of the few places in the world that might hold stocks of Russian nerve gas.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Sun, a UK tabloid not known their high journalistic standards, claims a
         <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5789398/salisbury-nerve-agent-attack-woman-black-face-mask-police">
          women in a face-mask was seen acting suspiciously on the day of the attack
         </a>
         . They also published another article speculating the daughter of the victim might have been the real target.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1992 one researcher doubted that novichok exists:
         <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-09-16/news/1992260123_1_chemical-weapons-new-nerve-gas-developing-chemical">
          Lora Lumpe, a chemical and biological arms control researcher at the Federation of American Scientists, expressed doubts. "I would say it's spurious," she said. "It's hard to imagine a nerve gas 10 times more lethal than VX. I suppose it could be higher, but there haven't been many innovations."
         </a>
         . The same researcher now
         <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/people/lora-lumpe">
          works for the Open Society Foundation
         </a>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Craig Murray has written a few blog posts starting
         <a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/03/russian-to-judgement">
          with this one
         </a>
         claiming it's all false flag by the UK or Israeli government. Maybe a couple of interesting arguments but otherwise his articles are just speculation.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Of course these are just random little oddities and I'm assuming it was the Russian government behind the attack, as the UK, French and US governments are all sure and they presumably have more information than is currently public.

       Well, it's clear as day what framing Russia in this case achieves, isn't it? Provocation after provocation and people still buys whole "evil empire" bullshit? Wake up! West was provoking Russia for years now.

       Great post! Given the anti-russia context and the response (with no real proof/investigation) and how stupid it would be for Russia to do something like that, it is so obvious it is a false flag. I'm surprised not to see more people seeing that (not that you'd expect mainstream media and normies to question anything). This is a conspiracy with potential enormous repercussions.

       I mean, the assassination of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in 2015 was pretty sloppy and obvious, and Putin didn't even bother having it investigated to even pretend like he didn't do it. In fact he had the guys house raided and confiscated all his computers and documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Garry Kasparov hasn't eaten eaten or drank water in public since 2004 for fear of being poisoned. This absolutely seems like something Putin would do.

       Except that in this case it is not food/water poisoning. Using a nerve agent is a lot messier (unsure, collateral damage, international condemnation, ...). If Russia wanted the guy dead this is the last method they would have used. Like the OP demonstrated, pretty much anybody could have made that agent and the automatic blaming of Russia without proof is a giveaway it's a setup.

       Boris Nemtsov was shot four times in the back of the head, he wasn't poisoned. Putin already tried to kill this guy once with Polonium, he's a known sadistic killer, the fact that he decided to finish him off after he was connected to the Steele Dossier seems more probable to me.

       The point remains the same, using a nerve agent is the most stupid way to assassinate the guy. Shooting/poisoning/suiciding/accident/... are just many of the cleaner and standard ways to do it.
The major problem here is that, probable or not, there is no evidence yet linking this to the Russian government and the response is completely premature, unfair and reckless.
With that type of response without evidence, it is a lot more probable that this is a western intelligence operation.

       You definitely have a point. When I weigh the benefits to each side, pushing the narrative of a nerve agent attack on foreign soil moves a lot more gears than the testing an assassination technique narrative. I just worry about outrite dismissal of things. It's pretty eggregious to attempt to assassinate a political figure you've given assylum to, and I would say doing it so close to a chemical weapons lab or whatever it is is pretty sloppy considering it's not like distance matters, but there's definitely grey area.

       My understanding is that chemical weapons development was conducted by the then Soviet Union in the 70s and 80s at a location in Uzbekistan.   The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (responsible for had destruction of chemical weapons) accessed this location as did the United States and her allies after the fall of the USSR.

       “If you really wanna keep something secret what you do is this. Build a bloody great secure fortress in the middle of a massive field around which there are fifty foot high electric fences fabricated from razor wire.

       Armed guards help to increase the perception (and reality) of how secure this place is.

       In the middle of the fortress you install a massive armoured steel safe with 3 feet thick steel walls. Time locks. Bio-metric locks. You get the picture.

       This place is really really secure, right? Of course it is.

       It just occurred to me you were perhaps not being ironic when you called me comrade.  The fact you would request proof in RUSSIAN means you speak RUSSIAN.  Now, that alone does not prove that you are a Russian sockpuppet account, but it sure doesn't help.  Just in case you are I will give you a hint, no one in the west says "comrade".  If you see people say it on Reddit it is because they are usually being ironic.  Your welcome.

       i sometimes browse through the conspiracy pages, but get kinda lost in some of the stuff, but what the poster has put on here is what the media should be asking, im in the UK, and its shocking just how hard the official story is being pushed. 
Pretty much nobody is asking questions, and there are lots of questions, it seems that anybody who questions the official line is called out pretty much as a traitor. Freedom of press is a joke if nobody in the press is asking questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own view, it could well be that the official story is true, i really dont know. But i know i doubt im told the truth on lots of things, and thats what for me is the big issue of all of this, i dont trust my government  to tell the truth, and when the trust has gone that has to represent some level of failing either by me, or some level of failing by the government, for me my only failing is to ask questions. ..... i guess i have other fallings.... im far from perfect .. well not that far... its the internet i can boast if i want....
      </p>
      <p>
       But back to the point, the relationship between the government and the people should have trust, and things like this when its pushed so hard one point of view, thats not trust, thats trying to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, thanks to original poster

        (5) Russia's motive for poisoning Skripal is not as strong as thought. Other nations have greater motive.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the most complicated proposition. Let's go over the history of Skripal. To begin, Russia held him in prison on a sentence of 13 years. If it were absolutely crucial that he be assassinated, they would have done this when they had custody of him. But a sentence of 13 years is hardly a sentence you'd give for someone you want dead. US gives its spies 10 consecutive life sentences in a super-max prison. So if Russia hated this guy so much, why give him such a light sentence, and why give him away in a prisoner swap? The other prisoners who were swapped were not assassinated. And Vil Mirzayanov, the chemist who revealed the existence of novichok and who lives a public life teaching at public universities was not assassinated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Russia did not hate him that much back then, only recently when it was found that he was a source for the Steele dossier.

       Not so, that article only establishes that Skripal and Steele both worked for MI6 at the same time period, years ago, which is not new. There is no indication that Skripal was a source of Steele on the so-called 'dossier'.
Besides isn't that dossier total discredited garbage anyway, hardly the stuff you'd kill someone for, and a bit late no?

       Uh nothing in the dossier has been discredited so far. Nothing is 100% proven but not discredited either. And lets remember there was a big purge at the kremlin upon the dossier's publication by the media. Look it up.

       I think your post was well-thought out, but you're really discounting how things work in a country like Russia. Literally stamping out regime opponents is a thing, and people really do get scared into silence. People like Manning, Assange and Snowden would be long dead if Americans were eager to kill their own "traitors", let alone allowing the opposition party to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't even matter whether Skripal had recently given up, or planned to give crucial information, or maybe was plotting something with other traitors/defectors. Killing him is about sending the message that no matter who you are and where you are in the world, if you snitch/betray Russia you are fucked. This is actually a very important message to send in times of heightened tensions and power consolidation by Putin; it seriously discourages potential defectors from following through and dissidents abroad get scared even more. Using a nerve gas instead of sending thugs means no one is safe from Putin, even if he's somewhere without a significant Russian population. In fact, it's actually the most inconspicuous alternative - so long as Russia has some plausible deniability (as showcased by this very thread) no Russian will find it troublesome, or be too afraid to speak.

      <p>
       The story this relates to is part of the narrative designed to strike fear into the British public.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Murdoch-owned Times pretends it doesn't do sensationalized headlines and is still considered by many to be the 'paper of record'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story was written by three senior journalists including their crime correspondent John Simpson. It's not some blogpost or tabloid and it carries weight and wields influence and is referred to by MPs in parliament.
      </p>
      <p>
       No corrections have been made and the article is still up unchanged. It's part of the propaganda campaign much like the state-funded (and

       You might also want to add that at the Porton Down centre (7 miles from where this spy incident took place) young British servicemen were put in a chamber, told it was a trial for a cure for the common cold, and then had the nerve agent Sarin administered on them, to see what the effects were. Same with Mustard &amp; CS Gas.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (1) There is no substantial evidence that Skripal was poisoned with novichok.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, we have to take the UK's word for it. But unless you're under the impression that UK leadership wants to start a fight with Russia out of thin air, it seems plausible this information is true. Secondly, poisoning of Russian ex-pats in exile is the kind of thing the Kremlin does under Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is more believable than the alternative--that the UK is lying to us for some unknown agenda.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (2) Russia does not have a monopoly on novichok
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is this verifiable? I don't think so, but the OP's point is taken that it's a recipe that's out in the world. So, it's possible to make it outside Russia, but why use it unless some big superpower was trying to implicate Russia? Especially when the spy in question was disloyal to Russia and loyal to the UK? Seems possible but unlikely that any one else besides Russia was behind the murder.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (3) The UK is not following international protocol for this conflict over novichok.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nothing here seems odd: the UK determines the use of novichok--which is like Russia attaching a note to Skripal's body saying "we did it. what are you gonna do?" So they call out Russia. Russia drags its feet and cries about "following the rules". Aside from the mechanism of murder, we've all seen this movie before.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (4) Russia is thus not at fault for failing to reply to the 24-hour ultimatum.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is just a restatement about (3).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (5) Russia's motive for poisoning Skripal is not as strong as thought. Other nations have greater motive.
What other nations would have a motive for assassinating this man?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Unless you have information that the rest of us don't, there's only one country that gives a shit enough to kill this guy: Russia. All you have here is some cursory speculation, along with acknowledgement of Russia's disdain for Skripal. In all your speculation, how were you unable to imagine a scenario where Putin learned after his release that Skripal's purpose had run its course: i.e., that he served his function in the eyes of the Kremlin? That fits the available data the best at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if your speculation were substantiated by some newly discovered information, then sure, maybe it makes sense that some intelligence service wanted to make Russia look bad, but until that information arises, we should be speculating along the lines for which we have the most evidence. That means Russia, specifically, Putin, wants to prod the UK and see what it does when he has a traitor killed on their soil. He's testing the boundaries.

       So if it is so obvious that the use of this gas must be Russians, then the Russians would not have used the gas and it was used just to make it seem like it was them. Duh... seriously you think any country would be that dumb? Do we go kill people with the Joe Smith Virus?

        Independent investigators from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will arrive in the UK tomorrow to kick off their investigation into the nerve agent used in the attempted assassinations of Mr Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury on 4 March.
       </p>
       <p>
        The team from The Hague will meet with officials from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and the police to discuss the process for collecting samples, including environmental ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        These will then be despatched to highly reputable international laboratories selected by the OPCW for testing with results expected to take a minimum of 2 weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the next step in the process to independently verify the analysis carried out by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. Last Wednesday, the Prime Minister wrote to the OPCW to formally invite them to verify the government’s analysis of the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack. Subsequently the UK’s Permanent Representative to the OPCW wrote to the Technical Secretariat inviting them to come to the UK to take a sample, under Article 8 of the Chemical Weapons Convention.

       Would we know if they knew with certainty that novichok was used? As in, would they release that information to the public? I feel that because of the parties involved, there would be some information they would attempt to keep completely private for the time being.

       Posts like this only make me believe the whole Russian online troll bot things more. Russia/ussr has a long history of killing its former spies in similar poisonings. They are essentially the only actor to have a motive aside from saying the west tried to kill this former spy to pin it on Russia which would be a bit of a leap even for me. Putin/ Russia refusing to comment on it and pretend it didn’t happen doesn’t point to innocence. If they were being framed they should and would present that case not play it passive aggressive. How anyone can think there is anything to Russia didn’t do this is beyond me...

       Boris Nemtsov, Alexander Litivenko, and Glushkov were all murdered in suspicious circumstances with ties to Russia.  You don’t have to be James Bond to form a link.

       It is a rather impressive list of coincidental deaths.  The mental gymnastics you have to go through to not see Putin for what he is is quite impressive.

       As a chemist, can confirm #2:
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know the structure, you can design a process to make it. The main difficulty lies in the safety issues. The resulting Novichok agent would be highly toxic, even though it's basic building blocks can be handled safely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, to analyze the samples from the crime scene, you'd need a reliable analysis method. This would require samples of the stuff in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in effect, claim #1 and #2 are mutually exclusive. Either you can't determine it's Novichok OR Russia's production capacity is not exclusive.

       Except that it's always the worst time for Russia to do something nefarious, because the standard Western diplomatic posture towards the Russians is always one of nebulous accusation.  Depending on who you ask, Russia's reputation is either always in tarnishes, or never in tarnishes, because the nature of the game hasn't changed in a long while.

       Hey man, I'm a little late to the party, just lurking through random subreddits, but I actually see your points for why russia might not be responsible for these assassinations. I like the ideas they sound interesting, in general though I would say I have no power over how things develop and that's pretty much it. Regardless of who killed skripal, it looks unlikely to be explained. It seems to be a case of he said she said between major states of the world, which probably isn't a good idea. On the other hand if the UK ignores such an assassination it could possibly construe weakness in the eyes of other states and organisations, particularly at a time when I believe unity is important. With brexit just around the corner the world is pretty fucked, thankfully I like many others, do not believe this is an assassination important enough to start ww3. thank fuck. I like your ideas though and weird as some of these conspiracies seem, I think I will subscribe.

       But Russia has loads of motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 - They likely killed him now to send a message to the hundreds of former, and more importantly current/potential spies  that the Motherland never forgets so don't even try it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also tells countries around the world that they take no shit and give no fucks about killing people on your soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - They could be testing their weapon in the field, the guy is low level in terms of protection. The fact he is a former spy let's them flip the narrative back home to being framed again by the west as he is so obvious a target.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 - Russia enjoys testing other countries. They routinely buzz air and sea defence systems to judge capability. This could be used for judging a response to assassination, state sponsored terrorism, future chemical attack, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       The west/NATO/Majority if the UN hate them and are sanctioning them anyway, they have compartively little to lose at a top level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanctions hurt the populace not the oligarchs, Putin gets to play that as oppression and increase his power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea they have everything to lose reflects a misunderstanding about the Russian power elite and the country's internal politics.

       Yeah, but once you get into speculative motives, it could be anyone.  For all we know, it could have been some country like Luxembourg or Andorra, who did it because they thought it was fucking funny that they could do something like that and get away with it, because everyone would think it was Russia and nobody would suspect them.

       My take is old guy younger daughter found basically comatose on a park bench is truly strange and doesn't have some kind of innocent explanation.

       out of the ordinary happened here. As to what that something was, Kremlin taking revenge on an ex-spy seems in the cards, but killing the daughter for no reason doesn't make sense.

       I think you can pretty much guarantee that both the uk and the us know exactly what novichok agents are, how to make them, and how to test for them. Why the hell would they make that information available to everyone on the internet? That's some shit i have no problem with them keeping secret. Isn't the whole idea of this sub that world governments are keeping secrets? Popular opinion here has pedophile cults involving thousands of people staying secret for decades. They cant keep something like this secret? Really?

       My point is that per person it's way less. And we have state fund for oil money too.

       It's a lot more oil per person, but also history and geography. Those are very important too, don't you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you think that our government is that bad, what do you think of the Yeltsin's government that was installed by USA in 1996? We saw a tremendous GDP reduction during the pro-Western period 90s, does it still look better to you?

       Because Russia has a tendency to fudge every data they don't like, I hope that this now is at least common sense. This is just how it looks with no oversight. People fudge data. The suicide rate is often used to measure "well being" of countries so it makes sense to fake this data. In my opinion drug deaths like alcohol can be included in suicide at least somewhat. There is little difference between putting a bullet in your head and simply dieing because you are drunk everyday. Same underlying problem.

       It just occurred to me you were perhaps not being ironic when you called me comrade.  The fact you would request proof in RUSSIAN means you speak RUSSIAN.  Now, that alone does not prove that you are a Russian sockpuppet account, but it sure doesn't help.  Just in case you are I will give you a hint, no one in the west says "comrade".  If you see people say it on Reddit it is because they are usually being ironic.  Your welcome.

       Echo chambers are cheap to fund, good investigative journalism is expensive and often falls on deaf ears.

       No it isn't. To consider it refuted you'd have to assume that these oligarchs think the sanctions won't hit them or hit them favorably. We can't make that assumption.

       Main story today is about a man carrying bags and NYT claiming that it shows how he planned an attack never caught on film. Forgetting that 'plans' can't be deferred by a man carrying bags. It is speculative storytelling in service of the official law enforcement story. Which they have a horrible track record on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what you say NYT show today is just more proof of what I mentioned.

       On Trumps new tariffs on China, they only parrot officials. Useless. How can they charge readers for this shameless propaganda lacking any analytical or critical substances?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you have a specific story that you think can be a better example of what you are talking about?

       The mainstream news has many biases. But they also view their reputation as an asset. They have ombudsmen, editors, reporters of note.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real News is getting much of its information from the mainstream media itself. That's part of my point with this.
       <em>
        They believe
       </em>
       the mainstream media gets most of the facts right. That's why they use them for their information too. Where do you think all of what we are discussing even comes from in the first place? All alternative news without straight reporting staff rely on the straight reporting staff of others. They simply have to. So if you are believing Real News, you are also believing the mainstream medias straight reporting, until you decide not to for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was unable to find any corrections page. Do they have one? When you exercise editorial control, you choose what to show and, more importantly because there's more of it, what not to show. What would you say their biases are? Every organization has some.
