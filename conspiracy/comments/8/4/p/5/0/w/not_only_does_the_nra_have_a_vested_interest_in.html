        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I had a teacher and friend explain this to me the other day: yeah, arming teachers is good for the NRA and their buddies, but the real beneficiary is Betsy Devos. </p>

<p>Think about it: we turn schools more and more into prisons; armed guards, unpenetratable walls, yada yada.. no parent wants to send their kid to “jail” everyday! If only there were other options and somewhere where I know my kid will be safe....</p>

<p>Ehem. Online education. And one of the most well known online charter schools, K12, sits on the board of the American Federation for Children, a dark money group that promotes school privatization, was started and bankrolled by the DeVos family. Betsy DeVos also invested in K12. </p>

<p>No politician actually thinks we should arm teachers.. militarizing schools is just a way of scaring parents out of public education to get more tax dollars to go to for-profit alternatives, which many Republicans, like DeVos, have a financial interest in expanding. </p>

1 : an interest (such as a title to an estate) carrying a legal right of present or future enjoyment; specifically : a right vested in an employee under a pension plan
2 : a special concern or stake in maintaining or influencing a condition, arrangement, or action especially for selfish ends
3 : one having a vested interest in something; specifically : a group enjoying benefits from an existing economic or political privilege</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one of the underlying issues is the brainwashing of the population to believe they are constantly in danger. The fear mongering is crazy. I mean it&#39;s not really militarizing schools, if an individual has CCW license they should be allowed to bring them into school. When I go to my college lectures I leave my pistol in my car. I am just for hardening targets, &quot;gun free zones&quot; should at least not be publicized to prevent an individual from willingly targeting it and add an uncertainty to the possibility of receiving fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100%. There is fear mongering from both sides trying to take advantage of the shock and awe to push their agenda through with each mass shooting. That being said, I&#39;m sick and tired of mass shootings and something does need to be done.

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t a rallying cry because they don&#39;t care. Anti gunners just want to hear that guns are banned, they don&#39;t care if they actually are. They&#39;re like crackheads that need their hit of outrage towards nameless groups of people they can feel superior to. If there were a gun bill passed called &quot;The Comprehensive Gun Ban on 20XX&quot; they&#39;d have an orgasm until the weekend ends. It wouldn&#39;t matter if that bill made all guns and gun accessories legal except for .22s, wouldn&#39;t matter if mass shootings went up or down, wouldn&#39;t matter if people became more or less free, all that&#39;s matter would be that their favorite brainwashing TV station told them what they wanted to hear.

    <div class="md"><p>See I wish people actually could have conversations about this it&#39;s a shame. So the NICS system is currently used and any federally licensed firearms dealer must use this background check system. The gun show loophole is a misnomer. Legally a private citizen can sell a gun to another without going through a background check because it would be tedious to ask for the individual to bring it to a licensed dealer for them to then sell it to the other individuals. It was generally meant for selling to family members or other people who that person is close to. But I do believe there is a possibility for it to be abused, but now that we look at the factual basis of what this law is we may be able to deal with it. I think the reason that there are so many people opposed is mostly do to lack of definition and poor terminology. For example I have no issue outlawing bump stocks, yet I can&#39;t support a law that defines a bump stock as a rate increasing device, as this may be applied to all semi auto weapons or many other things not intended. I hate the demonization of the everyone because historically dehumanizing individuals has lead to great abuses on them. </p>

<p>&quot;Can you see that at all?&quot; I can see you&#39;re full of shit and have no integrity whatsoever lmao. Last time you brainlessly responded to me you called me some alt right fox news watching Trump supporter afraid of liberals taking my waifus. You act the same way to everyone else who disagrees with you, assuming they&#39;re the lowest idiot consuming the lowest media and believing it all. Yet here you are, believing the dumbest shit that the leftist MSM tells you to, and feeling angry and superior to faceless people just like you&#39;re supposed to.</p>

<p>People disagree with me all the time on this sub and I have good conversations all the time. Rabid idiots like you arent interested in a conversation and you arent tricking anyone anymore than any other rabid liberal tricks anyone with their disrespectful animalistic online behavior.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/21714">When terrorists attacked a school in Maalot in 1974, Israel did not declare every school a gun-free zone. It passed a law mandating armed security in schools, provided weapons training to teachers and today runs frequent active shooter drills. There have been only two school shootings since then, and both have ended with teachers killing the terrorists.</a></p>

<p>Gun free zones have failed. Let&#39;s at least take the signs down. </p>

<p>And if a teacher is trained and proficient, let them carry their weapon. No need for any gov funding. Plenty of liberty and child loving (not in a Podesta way) teachers who would sacrifice small financial loss, to protect their students, and Ultimately theirselves. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t ask the Gov to pay for my rounds. I shoot thousands of rounds a year, never got it subsidized. I can imagine there are a fair number of teachers who already own guns and ammo (anectdotal)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got in a heated debate last night about this exact discrepancy. He seemed to think the proposal on the table was the Gov would be providing guns and bonuses to all teachers even though there is supposedly no room there for school supplies. I countered that some of these teachers already carry outside of school, they&#39;re obviously not violent people or they would lose their license, but the law prevents them from carrying at work so they don&#39;t. Offering some bonuses to anyone who would take some regular classes doesn&#39;t seem like a terrible idea, but he kept referring to it as &quot;fucking retarded&quot; without a really valid reason why. Having multiple points of defense that are spread out and have a shared understanding of how to react would be a much more effective form of defense than spending six figures on a single resource officer (who didn&#39;t do shit in Florida while teachers acted as meat shields) or upgrading the windows and adding cameras. Sandy Hook apparently just had a security upgrade but Lanza (by the narrative) just shot his way through the window and we&#39;ve never seen cam footage of him inside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as the Founding Fathers favored an armed citizenry over a standing army, I favor armed teachers over a police-state control school. </p>

<p>Which is exactly why the state doesn&#39;t want armed teachers, they want schools to be prisons. First you use the shootings to disarm the population, then when the shootings till occur, lock down the schools and get the future generation used to a total police state. </p>

<p>Heavy Police presence, metal detectors,  locked doors (to keep the dealers out). Heavy control over the individuals behavior to stop the students from destroying the class room. </p>
