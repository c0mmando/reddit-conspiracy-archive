       A Russian spy was poisoned with a soviet era nerve agent. Ignoring for a moment why you would kill anyone with such an esoteric weapon, that could so easily be traced to the country of origin. It just so happens that the UKs oldest and large chemical warfare research installation (Porton Down) sits just outside of Salisbury, the place where Sergei Skripal was exposed. Porton down has a long history of testing chemical weapons including nerve agents on people.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From 1945 to 1989, Porton exposed more than 3,400 human "guinea pigs" to nerve gas. It seems probable that Porton has tested more human subjects with nerve gas, for the longest period of time, than any other scientific establishment in the world.

       Wow what a coincidence. And which lab was responsible for confirming that it was a soviet era nerve agent? Well of course Porton Down.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The chemical was identified by experts at the defense and science laboratory at Porton Down, Mrs May said.

       But if you see a false flag in the past and a legit event happens next you might be conditioned to see the next one as a false flag. So it goes both ways.

       It's weird but
       <em>
        WHY
       </em>
       is it significant? He lived nearby. Do you think it was accidental exposure? Why couldn't they just transport the poison somewhere else? How far from the lab was he killed? Did they put him nearby so they could kill him later?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they just got lucky that someone they wanted to kill lived nearby, then by that same token it no longer becomes significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did they choose to kill him because he lived nearby or?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you argue that someone wouldn't commit a hit that was so obviously traced back to them...doesn't that include killing someone right outside your nerve agent factory?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your arguments are contradictory: you claim that the location of the hit in relation to the lab strongly suggests foul play but also claim that no intelligence org would act so obviously - so which is it? Are the british just incompetent or?

       And as has been pointed out could have supplied the glyphosate nerve agent themselves.  Somehow they were able to "identify" Novichok without any time even required for lab testing.  We are supposed to believe that they knew it immediately.

       I have thought that was very interesting since I first read someone comment and make that point. And that's really the most fishy part for me. I read Russia replied and said something along the lines of, "we don't even have it to compare but you guys must have it if you identified it in the first place". I thought that was pretty funny.

       Far more likely to me for this to be Russia because 
a) They've done this before, linked elsewhere in this thread.
b) They didn't deny it.
c) You'd think if they didn't do it, they would maybe draw the same conclusion you did, and present it publicly, in the face of all their sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it is at ALL weird that Russia would attempt to kill a traitor of theirs to send a message.

       There is no actual denial in this article that Russia didn't poison these people. The closest thing to it in the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I want to state with all possible certainty that the Soviet Union or Russia had no programmes to develop a toxic agent called Novichok,” Ryabkov said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and right below that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He said the claim was made by people who moved to the West; he could have been referring to the fact that Novichok is a nickname, not an official name, for the nerve agent.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The first quote is called a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-denial_denial">
        <strong>
         Non-Denial Denial
        </strong>
       </a>
       , and it is a very common linguistic tactic used in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, shortly after the poisoning, Putin gives an interview in which he says:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7swxH6RjBY">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7swxH6RjBY
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         those who serve us poison will eventually swallow it themselves
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, the statement was not said explicitly in reference to the people who were recently poisoned, but Putin has been on the public stage for a long time. If he was sincere that Russia had nothing to do with the attack, and wanted to distance himself from it, don't ya think he would have chosen his words differently?

       Honestly? Not really. Again reads, to me, like a non-denial denial. Kind of like "Well, it's not OUR fault that he's a spy and deserved to die!"
      </p>
      <p>
       An actual diplomatic denial would look something like: "Reports that the Russian government, or any parties related to or directed by the Russian government, had anything to do with these attacks on British soil are categorically false. The Kremlin does not condone, and vehemently denies the attack, and we our intelligence community is conducting our own independent investigation."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let me state for the record that I'm not saying it's impossible that the attack was done by someone other than Russia, but given the evidence and Russia's lack of a strong response against it, I find it HIGHLY unlikely.

       Now why would that really be? Citing a violation is just an excuse. Not helping (or cooperating with) the country solve this case, actively fighting
       <em>

       against the country trying to solve it, and antagonizing them. Hmm? Followed by all kinds of sanctions and shit against Russians.

      <p>
       This. Then all the countless murders of russian officials abroad within 12 months. Banning Russia from the Olympics (as if every country didn't have dopers, and I'm suspecting those were planted too). The whole TrumpRussia -BS on the media, world wide. Accusations of both "russian hackers" and "russian troll farms". And much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like someone wants a war with them. Poking the hornet's nest. I wonder what's up NEXT? Russia has managed to stay calm but I have a feeling these psycho-warmongerers are not gonna stop until they get what they want.

       Skirpal's daughter had just arrived from Moscow and who's to say what she may have secretly brought along with her that one or the other of them was careless about how they carried and handled it and accidentally exposed themselves to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course since they're both Russians it isn't exactly incorrect to say that "the Russians did it." without bothering to say which Russians or "to themselves". Given Skirpal's untrustworthy past, the potential for him to get up to something of a clandestine and criminal nature is something that would be entirely in keeping with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that's what actually happened but there's no real proof that it didn't or couldn't have happened that way, either.

       Skripal did it to himself. That's your honest suggestion? Let me ask you... Did you take yoga classes in order to stretch like that? You do realise how rediculous and not credible that makes you and your viewpoint sound right?

       Hell, maybe Stephen Hawking did it. He died in the UK too, and I don't think they've released a cause of death yet. There's no real proof one way or another that he didn't do it, and fuck the scientific method, right?

       That's simply a bit of frivolous speculation that you should have recognised as such but obviously failed to, nor appreciate that it is no more frivolous or lacking any credibility than what we're being fed by the British government about this, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use you head and don't be an ass, if the Brits know and can precisely identify what the poison is they also know exactly how to make it themselves and so do countless others that can, too who can either use it for a similar purpose to dispose of someone for reasons of their own and "blame the Russians" for it or in order to create some kind of an antidote for it if it happens to turn up getting used on anyone in their own respective countries by anyone else that's capable of making and using it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way no one has actually been reported as being "dead" or murdered at this point. Serious condition, yes, dead no, as of this date and I have no idea what you are referring to in terms of the so called "scientific method" or how anyone on the outside looking in could possibly apply it to all the inconclusive drivel that's come from the current British government that the opposition party in their parliament has been just as critical of as I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that something was known to be invented by someone in another country over thirty years ago doesn't automatically imply that any case of it suddenly being used at this point in time must always be attributable to that same source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Polonium, for instance, has been infrequently used to poison people and former Soviet agents were often suspected of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What most people don't know and don't bother to research is that Polonium was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie and was named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland. It's derived from uranium 238 the most natural and commonly occurring form of uranium.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has only a few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity and consist of heaters in space probes, antistatic devices, and sources of neutrons and alpha particles and any country, or any individual that is directly involved in those kinds of activities or nuclear research are all potential sources and possible users of it for other and nefarious purposes.

       My statement about the furor over the lack of any serious evidence being presented to the British Parliament and May's government making bold accusations and taking a completely hostile attitude towards the Russian government without it speaks loudly and clearly for itself. Perhaps you should read up on that and recognise that those objections aren't coming from people with no credibility but merely a few members and one election away from forming the next government.

       Lol the Conservative/Tory party in Britain is like U.S. Dems/Repubs, a bunch of worker-hating zionist NWO NEOliberal shills that don't even give a fuck about the homeless in their own country. They expect us to believe they're concerned because a Russian got poisoned. Pass me the crocodile tears lol. It's pure political opportunism. That said, I don't know if Putin actually did the poisoning or MI5/6/CIA/Mossad. These warmongers just want war with Russia it seems.

       I honestly thought war with Russia was an actual possibility even before Trump got elected because Russia is supporting the Syrian government and the us and allies are supporting the opposition rebels. All it would take was someone to get shot down over a no fly zone. The media have been working on over drive to reignite the cold war and get the general public afraid of Russia again.

       Russia does have a history of deliberately thumbing their nose at people by leaving a calling card that suggest them, but doesn't prove anything definitively. Even if you claim all of the incidents of Russian action in the last 50+ years are fake or misreported it's
       <em>
        stated explicitly
       </em>
       in a lot of their strategy and military/political manuals which makes sense because it's effective and intuitive. Sun Tzu would have loved it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes strategic sense: for one it fucks with people and throws them off. Russia can't handle a direct military confrontation with the full brunt of the US power but he also knows that they're not gonna do that without pretty good reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are they gonna do? Slapping more sanctions on him will hurt, but with some time and effort they can be somewhat neutralized and he may get more out of it than it hurts at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, have an opinion on what happened in various incidents but I'm sick of hearing this argument about how "russia wouldn't use a weapon tracked back to them", especially from a lot of the same people who claim "seth rich was murdered and they made it look like a hit on purpose"

       I have two friends that live on opposite coasts, Virginia and California respectively. Without communicating with eachother AT ALL, they both planned trips to the grand canyon for the same day, and the same time. They bumped into eachother AT the grand canyon, as my one friend was walking out and the other was walking in. What in the world are the chances of that? Yet things with impossibly small odds happen all the time because the dice are constantly rolling.

       What i posted is not proof of anything. But the coincidences make me question the 'official' explanation. Porton down seems to be connected to ever part of this story and comes out with a financial win in the form of millions in investment from the government for new facilities. Would they have got that without the attack? It seems possibly not from what i have read. The proximity is interesting also. Maybe you don't want to travel too far with a dangerous bioweapon.

       Yes but WHY do the coincidences make you question it though? Why are they inconsistent with the story?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it makes sense after a chemical attack to step up research doesn't it? Do you have any evidence that this investment is unusual? Do they normally get a much smaller amount? Are they more rare?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the proximity interesting? Again...both he and the lab have been in that area for
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       ...so what are you suggesting? What is the order of events?
      </p>
      <p>
       They noticed he lived close to a chemical weapon lab and decided to use him for their false flag? They forced him to live there so they could kill him later?
      </p>
      <p>
       Shorter travel distance makes sense generally but we know that chemical agents are routinely transported for attacks so it's not like it's really that big of a deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're talking about coincidences why not the fact that his daughter recently returned from Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just list a bunch of coincidences, they don't mean anything because if you dig through any significant event you will usually find a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to explain why these particular coincidences suggest something one way or another.

       The exact opposite of what you have been saying can also be posed. So sure, this is your opinion, and sure, it's possible it's all a coincidence. But what you fail to take into account is historical context. This shit has been taking place repeatedly throughout history (by the accusers) and so the liklihood that these aren't coinidences is much greater.

       No, see that's exactly the point I'm making. That's the flaw in your reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with the underlying idea that the UK may be lying about the attack, or may have done it themselves. Ofc many state actors have a history of doing shady terrible things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem comes in when you just start collecting a bunch of vague "coincidences" and using that to justify some shadowy notion that "not everything is as it seems"
      </p>
      <p>
       It just becomes an inkblot everyone can use to justify their personal ideas...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not USEFUL for anything...cool, you think it's "weird" there's some coincidences around this. What are you gonna do with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       You already didn't really trust what they said. knowing about these coincidences doesn't help you either...you have no idea why they killed him and for what purposes...and at the end of the day it could all just be a freak accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind there's plenty examples in history of everyone assuming some conspiracy was true and later on through genetic testing or whatever we find that it was totally false.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to start connecting the dots or else you're just wasting your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and really even all of that is fine, but the problem is when people don't admit that their theory is weak. If you want to keep your vague cloud of coincidences...fine! You just also have to keep considering other options, because you really don't have the evidence to make your pet theory any stronger yet.

       Do you really not see that your response is another verbose rambling that actually reinforces what I posted in a few lines? This is just your opinion. Fine. No problem. But just because you say these are vague coincidences doesn’t make it so. You say that others are not considering other options is also completely wrong...how do you know for example I don’t think there are multiple possible explanations to what happened? And your post is essentially you doing exactly what you’re saying; not accepting a possibility because you “think” it’s a coincidence. I find the OP’s post interesting, and it is certainly food for thought. It’s more info that will help me paint a picture of what happened since nothing concrete has been supplied by the British.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean honestly I could take your post, change your vague assertions to what you are saying and essentially reply to you:

       They are vague coincidences because nothing suggests they aren't. They're not coincidences because I say so, they're coincidences because YOU haven't provided any reason they're not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can try to make a false dichotomy and play the game of "well science is a religion too"...and yes, that does have some small degree of validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       However it doesn't go very far, and is usually used ineptly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point remains that you can't just list a bunch of things that "feel" or "seem" significant to you. You have to start developing actual theories and then explain how those facts match your theory, you need a model for how it all works, and then you need to test it to the degree that you are able.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people want to just say "I'm not sure I believe the MSM narrative" and then list a bunch of things they think sound suspicious or unlikely. They can never explain WHY it is suspicious or unlikely though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that nobody I've seen here has been able to advance any coherent theory as to what did happen or why this is in conflict with the accepted version of events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it meaningful that it happened near a chemical weapons lab? It's interesting sure, but it could easily be random chance. Even if it's not that doesn't mean that it conflicts with the accepted version.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this guy was working for the UK to assist their research and that's why he lived nearby. Maybe he was spying for the Russians and trying to access intel about the lab.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I have is people are starting off with an idea "the governments story is false" and then just cherry picking little bits of info...and the real kicker is they do this dishonest thing where they make assumptions and don't admit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In their minds they are taking the fact that the lab is close by as evidence...they are assuming that something from the lab actually killed him. Or they think that it somehow makes that more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't admit that though, they just say they're "asking questions" and that's a problem because if they were honest they would see it doesn't actually hold as much weight as they think it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not the contrarian one. I am the one standing on science and reason and thoughtful analysis. I don't claim that those always ensure a correct outcome or can provide all answers but that doesn't mean all bets are off.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not really any particular reason to believe the official UK version is off. Surely we can say they are probably not saying everything, and might be misstating some things...but that's neither here nor there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to try and contradict their version for whatever reason, fine...but you have to actually do it...not just throw a bunch of things at the wall and see what sticks.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're providing a great demonstration of how dunning-kruger works. You hear something that you feel "contradicts" the UK narrative...or is somehow unusual.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not true though, you are mistaking the fact that you are not able to mentally explain or connect them with some actual contradiction or anomaly. Then you go to an echo chamber with a bunch of other people and reinforce each other without meaningfully exploring any of it.

       I can only simply say you are projecting your world view onto my comments. Again, I said "I find the OP’s post interesting, and it is certainly food for thought. It’s more info that will help me paint a picture of what happened since nothing concrete has been supplied by the British." And again, I am entertainiming all sorts of possibilities given the now even more ridiculous claims being put out by the British gov't.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as more information is coming to light, it has only made the official story even more suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I am not the contrarian one. I am the one standing on science and reason and thoughtful analysis." Sorry, I don't see any science. And while your analysis is fine, I have no problem agreeing to disagree, you're actually once again doing the exact same thing that you are so utterly against. You are simply another victim of the binary thinking that has been conditioned into most people.

       You know what, let me respond to you in a different way. The truth is on reddit, there's rarely a lot of well thought out exchanges, and I appreciate you actually taking the time to reply. I actually see your perspective, and I can understand where you're coming from. It's definitely healthy to not jump to conclusions or sometimes even entertain possibilities when there just isn't enough logical evidence to support it. That line of thinking is really just glorified imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this particular incident, not the info the OP posted but the case as a whole, there are a ton of unanswered questions and lots of information being released by the british that are full of issues and illogical. Anyways, that's another thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for me, any information shared on this forum is welcome. And the information that the OP shared is interesting. Again, it could be a coincidence, it could relate to specific nefarious deceptions, it could be...many things. Not everyone is cherry-picking, but it's the same issue when you toss it out without consideration as it is taking it in wholeheartedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still feel that you are generalizing way too much. And I have to disagree in one area in particular and say that there is plenty of reasons to believe the UK version is very off. By logically examining their various claims, there are tons of holes and issues with their claims. I'm sure you've been keeping up with the news and information released and you simply must question their story if you analyze the information logically and scientifically/forensically. Not releasing everything is one thing, but releasing information that is false is another. But then again, we are both only speculating and making assumptions at this point. We're all going on the same limited and possibly incorrect information that is being pumped out.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly I just wanted to add while I see where you're coming from, your assertions about my thinking is just plain inaccurate. I can't speak for others but I do not feel any of this is "contradicting" anything or is "somehow unusual". In fact it's the opposite - in context of similar events in the past, it's highly normal. And I'm not going into an echo chamber for reinforcement either. You are in this case, as I'm sure you would be able to tell since you wrote about it, making assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm sure this case will continue to unfold with even more head-scratching information. Thanks for taking the time to discuss, and hopefully for a change, the truth will come out as to what really happened.

        Likewise, Russia (and a lot of countries) have a history of deliberately leaving a calling card. It makes total sense strategically - it muddles everything and throws people off guard. It's not like anybody is gonna drag Putin in front of a trial judge and while more sanctions would hurt it seems Trump at least isn't going to enact them and even if he did they wouldn't be a killing blow. With time and effort they can be worked around.

      <p>
       Sorry but you'd have to provide some proof or at least even a really good argument to back up your statement that countries like Russia leave calling cards or blatantly assassinate people in rival countries using weapons easily traced back to them.

       Admittedly I don't have Putin's signed confession but if you look at it from the angle of him saying "if you defect I will kill you in the most horrible way imaginable even if you think you're safe" it does make a whole lot of sense both with Litvinenko and in Skripals case.

       I don't mean literal calling cards, but they're not shy about leaving evidence. Look at their famous hits like Litvinenko.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you don't believe that those were actually carried out by Russia, the theory is still sound. If you look throughout history people do in fact "send a message" regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while it's interesting, it's not as if the fact that something can be traced back to a murder means they couldn't possibly have done it. That just doesn't logically follow.

       That's just it though. You need evidence. We can make up all the accusations and theories that we want but without actual evidence, it's circumstantial and shouldn't be treated as solid proof that they're guilty.

       "figure out how statistically"
Now people need to understand string theory to make loose associations?

       You want people to run tests on their arguments. However, you seem like the type to lambast those that actually did research on pizza related napkins.

      <p>
       That's a pretty ridiculous exaggeration.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, what you call "associations" often have to do with statistics. The problem is you're making statistical arguments but then copping out when it comes to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just statistics though, again nobody has explained why the research lab being nearby means anything considering he lived near it in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is you can't just throw up a bunch of things YOU think "sound funny", you have to do some work to figure out if they are as unusual as they sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's "interesting" that it was nearby WHY? Did they force him to live near it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way it's meaningful AT ALL is if they picked him based on proximity, or picked the weapon based on proximity. You've brought up this fact, if you consider it meaningful you have to follow it's implications. You don't get to cheat and just say "there's a lot of stuff that sounds fishy to me" because that will never get you anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you think it's meaningful that the lab is nearby then...fine...that's viable. They wanted a news story, they saw a guy near their lab and decided to bonk him...great. Or maybe he was doing secret work there and knew too much...I dunno.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, they needed to off him and decided to use chemical weapons since they had a lab nearby...cool. That seems kind of weird, considering people keep swearing up and down that someone doing a political hit would never do it in a way that so obviously tied but to them, but ok...
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, now you are actually getting somewhere.

       If you're Putin, why protest the allegations? He's looking like a bad ass than can fuck with the two most powerful NATO countries at will. He can order trolls to get Trump elected, and now he can put a hit on people that crossed him anywhere in the world. Including a police state like the UK.

       If you're Putin observing all the hysteria and frenzied attempts to seriously harm your economy and all of your people that way and seen what they've already done to create untold havoc and harm throughout the Middle-East and beyond you'd stay just as cool, calm, collected and reasonable in the face of it as he has been in calmly facing it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's prepared for whatever is to come and won't be pushed around. Russia is virtually self-sustaining at this point and growing stronger and more determined to stand it's ground come what may.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that more than half or the EU's energy supply already comes from Russian natural gas companies that the state owns the controlling interest in and that includes a similar amount of liquefied gas that they export to the UK that could cause complete havoc and soaring prices for all other forms of energy if he or the Russian Parliament ever decided to suspend any further exports to the UK to really put their foot down if push ever comes to shove.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the world is watching and certainly isn't blind to any of that. If it wasn't for the seriousness of the consequences and the completely ridiculous nature of those accusations the entire situation would be completely laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       May's government is in serious trouble over Brexit and numerous domestic issues that it badly needs something to create a major distraction away from them and that is precisely what this is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremy Corbyn the Leader of the Opposition who is handily three times more popular than May, at this point has denounced what she is doing and her failure to genuinely substantiate any of her accusations in Parliament against the Russian government or the completely hostile nature of the actions she is pursuing over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's your best guess, here? That Putin deliberately did it to rescue May from her mounting problems or that she had MI5 arrange an incident that she could use as an excuse to try and project an image as strong and determined leader standing up to big bad Putin and Russia over it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's a real question it's how much patience Putin has left before he takes some serious actions of his own against these attacks that no can seem to provide any genuine evidence for and what those might entail?

       We could go on with all kinds of "maybe's" that are no more or less possible than the ones the accusations against Russia are based on without providing a shred of hard evidence to prove that they are true.

       Not true. Apart from hate speech and the obvious restrictions(treason, terrorism) we can say what we want.

       Actual knives are restricted in public, definitely not butter knives. You can have what you want in your home.

       You don’t need a tv license to own a tv, only if you watch live tv on it. All the money goes to the BBC, so it’s more of a subscription fee than a licence.

       Overall, poor effort. Our police aren’t even armed. From my point of view the USA is more of a police state: you’ve got police shooting civilians all over the shop,  police armed with military equipment and tanks, and millions of people in prison.

       It's one hell of a coincidence. According to wikipedia Porton Down is one of only a handful of places globally that have ever tested nerve agents on people, and they did it on a massive scale. Not only that they have a disclosed history of testing on the unaware general public in the local area. They also developed VX nerve gas and other 'fun' poisons. Apparently they are also one of the few places globally that could even identify the toxin used. They were also involved in the cleanup operation. And like magic they get a cash injection for a brand new facility. And get this

       Holy crap that is fast. Normally it takes months (if not years) to plan this stuff. Not begin building immediately. Apparently I was wrong, the Russian is not dead, just critical on life support. The news was vague on the actual details of his condition. But the cynic in me thinks a place with a track record like this would happily create some false flag event for a massive cash injection, and perhaps decades of guaranteed extra jobs.

       So after my refresher I just want to say, honestly, that this sounds similar to how I believed the trump-russia situation to be for a while (I'm more back in the center than I previously was on that) in the sense that I believed Russia could have been being framed in that case also, with the spark being the emails and the gucciferv2 stuff. With another similarity being the "detection" of supposed hacking with something that very obviously points to Russia, even though the action was said to have HAD to be either state level or approved by the state, because it was more or less a sophisticated enough attempt that whoever did it wouldn't dare do it without said approval.  I also want to note here that recently I saw linked an article which totally tried to sidestep this, saying it could have just been a subset of Russians or individuals while still trying to hold Russia accountable and uphold the Trump-Russian collusion narrative. Because if they softened on Russia that narrative would crumble. And the independent research about Gucci2 files I have never in my life seen discussed or even mentioned on msm, and it seems solid to me in stating that the evidence which points to Russia is likely to have been planted. Because one more thing, why would someone or some team so adept at hacking, leave such an obvious footprint pointing back to themselves? And by that point we haven't even discussed the WikiLeaks drop that, regardless of WikiLeaks bias or lack of, shows us verified documents of CIA circulation showing various tools, one of which has a main function that specifically involves planting fake digital forensics so as to make it seem someone from another country did something. Just fishy to me is all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I'm not sure how I currently feel about that because of how things have seemed to pick up with the investigation, and I do now feel that Mueller may have something that is worth a damn that connects Trump. But thats just how I've been taking in the news lately, and I feel this correlates with that whole line of thinking. As others have already stated, why would they use a method that would instantly lead back to them? That's not covert at all. I do think someone had a point with May them just being brazen, but I can't see that for the other situation I outlined above with the supposed State level hacking that was claimed at first. And it's like over the past year they have just kept doing it other places and keep getting caught. I'm not saying they aren't hacking but I feel like some of these instances that we actually here about may be them getting set up. And I also feel that way here, I just can't see this being good for them, I'm also slightly thinking someone may be staging a coup over there. Not that I think Putin is a saint or anything I just don't believe he is the dumb or obvious type.

       In my opinion the Trump Russian collusion narrative is totally ridiculous. Hillary lost because she was a weak candidate. The idea of the investigation was to dig up any dirt in his life to use to impeach him, or failing that discredit him politically so he will never get re elected. The fact they have been under investigation for a year now and all mueller has found is crimes manafort committed years before the election. Not to mention he was fired from the trump campaign. The latest idictments for the memes posted on Facebook has to be one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen. All they were talking about was 1 or 2 ads. The rest were either anti trump or pro Bernie.

       But back on topic. Porton down had means to carry off such an attack. Talking about a place that invented vx nerve gas. And they had the motive, which was to secure additional funding. The 48 million they got from the government will be used to build a brand new facility and no doubt secure jobs for decades. Building starts next month! That means the plans for the facility must have been in place for months or years, and they were waiting for extra funding to make it happen. What motive does Russia have at such a heated political time?

       Very true. The precedent exists for what each individual believes already happened.
