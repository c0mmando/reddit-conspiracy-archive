       Where are all the people that were screaming he couldn't be trusted with the nuclear codes?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about him being anything but a stable genius.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumors are flying that Kelly and McMaster are about to be fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tillerson was just fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to our mainstream media the White House is in complete shambles due to Trump being on a rampage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, despite no evidence being provided by the UK government Trump has publicly stated that he agrees that Russia is responsible for the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would think with all of this going on they would be worried that Trump would use this as an opportunity to nuke Russia to cover his tracks by getting rid of everyone that he colluded with to steal the election.

       It wasn't on our soil. I get the NATO policy of "you attack one of us you attack all of us" but this incident shouldn't escalate into war. Look back to last year when NK had KJU's brother assassinated in the Malaysian airport with VX. A lot of hollering but nothing came about from it.

       Possibly...actually very likely. But there might be another explanation.

        So, is it possible that Skripal was one of Steele's informants used in the creation of the dossier? Is it possible that certain people were concerned that Skripal was going to reveal certain things about the dossier that were going to damage it's credibility? Yes, it's possible.

       Is it possible that he was going to reveal things about the dossier that would enhance it's credibility? Yes, it's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that a certain US intelligence agency that specializes in covert operations contracted Timothy Cunningham to produce a variant of the Novichok nerve agent to use as a means of not only assassinating Skripal to prevent him from revealing what he knew..(this includes forces acting on behalf of Trump as well as those acting against him) but to also further demonize Russia and specifically Putin as their election draws near?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes,  I am glad that was posted,  its something I was wondering but not going to say out loud at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I tell you,  I am sure the Russians are looking into the matter,  they would be crazy not to,  unless they really were stupid enough and had the motive to take Skripal out,  which is highly dubious.

       well, Russia has already demanded that the OPCW become involved immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then..if I understand you correctly...yeah, Russia is going to be working the streets and back channels to figure out what the hell went down if they didn't do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's become apparent that the Novichok nerve agent has never been officially recognized as existing nor has any ever been obtained.

       That ups the interest level in this whole thing.

       This is old hat,  Russia also demanded it in the case of the Syria episodes,  which was good,  but the US media and government could give a shit.    Seriously,   the US is so corrupt,   lawless,   and "exceptional" (yeah,  in the wrong way!)  that they blow off anything that doesn't fit with more military spending and further damnation of all those who are the "enemy" of the day,  its such a damn sick way of politics that has been going on in the US for more than 100 years,   going back to the lies of the Indian Wars,  the Civil War,   the lies of the Cold War,   McCarthy,   J. E.  Hoover,   the way the games are played in the insular culture that has developed in the US is so toxic and accepted.    Its really scary,   we never come clean,  we just kick the can down the road until a new generation and a new regime wipe out all the memories.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look for it you can see how dirty its been for so so long.   Was just watching how Eisenhower stabbed Marshall in the back to humor McCarthy,  whom he hated,  just to get elected.   There was no way for the American Mythology to ever come clean,  ever tell the truth about anything,   except in its own way,  like the way that some of black culture has progressed,   but there is so much work left to be done,  and its hard to address.   We have a high level of expertise in poisoning any possibility for real dialogue,  and try to draw out our adversaries in ways that make them look even worse.   Putin is one of the better chess players we have ever been up against.

       By the way,   western interests have had the opportunity on more than one occasion to come into possession of ex Soviet chemical,  biological and other weapons systems during and after the downfall of the Soviet Union.    Most anything was available for a price for the longest time and Skripal would also have known this as well as anyone and may have even dealt in this kind of corruption.

       That’s not what my neighbors said on Nov 9th 2016. They specifically said he was going to nuke Russia and NK. Tears were being shed, so clearly it’s a serious concern.
