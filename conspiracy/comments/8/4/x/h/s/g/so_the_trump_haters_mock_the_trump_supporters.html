<p>... and then they go on explain that the reasons Robert Mueller hasn&#39;t busted Trump yet because Mueller is taking his sweet time making sure he has a solid case against Trump </p>

<p>and they are quite sure that Robert Mueller&#39;s foot dragging is no indication that Robert Mueller doesn&#39;t have a case</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are the two things related? Why compare the head of a criminal investigation to a head of political office?</p>

<p>do you think Trump needs more time to drain the swamp? I’m genuinely confused here. Take the CIA Director position, did anything stopped him from appointing an outsider? He could’ve appointed anyone else, he went with a career CIA official who has a very sketchy past</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the short answer is the idea that timetables and deadlines is good enough when it comes to draining the swamp (while still doing the job of POTUS and enacting 65% of his campaign promises already) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and the anthrax letters </p>

<p>in the 14 hours since you wrote your comment, </p>

<p>Former FBI deputy Director Andrew McCabe was Fired by AG Jeff Sessions</p>

<p>late on a Friday night, (Friday Dump) </p>

<p>Sunday is McCabes birthday, and he would have been eligible for full pension</p>

<p>for people who are following FISA gate, this is a huge development</p>

<p>especially because it will draw in new audience who had not previously been following this story of FISA gate</p>

<p>according to the newspapers, McCabe was fired for authorizing the FBI spokesperson to comment on Clinton investigation, </p>

<p>and to deny the rumors that McCabe was deliberately foot dragging on the Clinton investigation </p>

<p>and to assert that McCabe was actually working very hard to expedite the Clinton investigation </p>

<p>this was called &quot;lack of candor&quot;, which is a fireable offense at the FBI</p>

<p>but this transgression seems kinda mild compared to what else he is involved in, </p>

<p>including FISA gate, which seems to have been glossed over with the more mild allegations </p>

<p>will have to see what all happened with Clinton investigation to appreciate the significance of the official reason given for firing </p>

<p>even then, the name Clinton attracts an audience, so this story will float, and has legs as they say </p>

<p>a rule to not let others change the topic.</p>

<p>i have made a comment before that basically says the same thing but its not as polite</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my personal policy is to never let an idiot dictate the direction of a conversation </p>
</blockquote>

<p>but since i am OP, lets say we revert to the OP </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of us never expected much from Trump; never have, never will.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a narcissistic frat-boy trust-fund kiddie, and quite possibly a full-blown [Cluster B.](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_B_personality_disorders">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_B_personality_disorders</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is anomalous in the US political/business class, I just think he&#39;s clumsy &amp; blatant with it.</p>

<p>Mueller has already gotten a few people around Trump, like Flynn and Manafort.</p>

<p>One is obviously making progress while the other is moving away from the stated goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump seems to be doing a fine job of draining the swamp. </p>

<p>The swamp is practically draining itself.</p>

<p>Trump has fired dozens of cabinet members, state department employees and White House staff.</p>

<p>The entire upper management of the DOJ and FBI have been fired or forced out over the FISA abuse scandal.</p>

<p>Several members of Congress have been forced to resign over sexual abuse scandals.</p>

<p>The Podesta Group folded.</p>

<p>Lots of good news.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rest of his cabinet is packed full of scumbag military intelligence and banker swamp creatures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired last night, late on a Friday evening</p>

<p>and it seems that CBTS_Stream may have been banned to coverup Tillerson firing,</p>

<p>or maybe CBTS_Stream was banned because their cover had been blown. </p>

<p>that is to say that <a href="/r/CBTS_Stream">/r/CBTS_Stream</a> was a &quot;parody&quot; or &quot;satire&quot; sub set up by <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> aka <a href="/r/SMISC">/r/SMISC</a> </p>

<p>oh, and theres a new Grassley bit about wanting a Special Council to investigate FISA gate </p>

<p>(its happening) </p>

<p>for the record, Carter Page has been an undercover FBI/CIA asset for many years, and was deliberately sent into the Trump camp as a mole, conveniently bringing his FISA warrant with him, so that the warrant could &quot;hop&quot; to the Trump camp </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking Horowitz is the guy to watch now </p>

<p>when Robert Mueller takes his time, its because good reasons</p>

<p>but when Trump takes his time, its because bad reasons</p>
