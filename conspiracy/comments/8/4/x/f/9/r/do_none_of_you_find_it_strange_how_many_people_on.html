<p>I&#39;ve even seen people attempting to downplay his &quot;dictator&quot; label and make it out as if he is some sort of hero that is fighting off the globalists.</p>

<p>I also keep seeing the same silly argument: &quot;Why would they use a nerve agent that was developed in Russia?&quot; </p>

<p>When the answer is simple: Putin doesn&#39;t care if the world knows it was him. These kind of assassination attempts are a simple reminder that Putin can reach anyone who decides to betray him.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one of the points that really doesn&#39;t pass the smell test..for this reason:</p>

<p>The spy was in prison in Russia..he was released early in a prisoner swap.</p>

<p>And it happened something like 15 years ago.</p>

<p>Just doesn&#39;t add up imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems you&#39;re correct, it seems he had taken up intelligence lecturing for the British which may have made him a target. </p>

<p>There is a 3 question survey to read this article, sorry</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/46eb6414-22f8-11e8-ae48-60d3531b7d11">https://www.ft.com/content/46eb6414-22f8-11e8-ae48-60d3531b7d11</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sources have also dismissed reports of a link between Mr Skripal and private intelligence groups, including Orbis, the company jointly run by Christopher Steele, the former MI6 spy who compiled the infamous Trump-Russia dossier.</p>

<p>The most plausible theory to emerge so far is that Mr Skripal was the victim of a revenge attack for handing over Russian secrets to the British.</p>

<p>There are few other clues to go on. A friend of Mr Skripal’s daughter, Yulia, said he had worked as “a lecturer” but did not disclose where. </p>

<p>This would tally with accounts from the security officials that he may have given occasional presentations and talks to UK military and intelligence personnel. It is not clear where these lectures took place. </p>

<p>The Defence Academy, a Ministry of Defence college in Shrivenham, 45 miles from Salisbury, which is responsible for postgraduate education for the UK armed forces, said it had no record of Mr Skripal being employed as a lecturer or giving presentations as a guest speaker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thinking was more along the lines of Putin is going after defectors, traitors, Etc. because he is going to make a move to further consolidate his power soon and wants anyone thinking of turning against him to know they will never be safe if they choose to do so.  Alternatively this may have been an opening play in what I&#39;m theorizing to be the next evolution of global conflict, Financial Warfare.  Britain needs Russian money more than Russian needs British money and creating a small event to kick off tit-for-tat escalating sanctions and sap British government resources during a crucial juncture of Brexit negotiations would be a somewhat low-key tactic.  In a month or so this will be old news but Britain will have been dealt a blow while they&#39;re down and Russia will still be riding high.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t the nerve agent designed to be undetectable?

<p>Why is Russia the only country that gets a benefit of the doubt for getting caught doing shady shit when it would be so obvious that it was them why even do it? </p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t this apply to the Seth Rich conspiracy, if he was ACTUALLY the leaker, wouldn&#39;t the DNC just be placing a bullseye on them if they killed him in such a ridiculous manner (staged robbery with nothing stolen, I  mean really?)?</p>

<p>If we are talking &quot;things that make no sense&quot; why the fuck would the UK fake the killing? Does the West need any more pretense to sanction or fuck with Russia? We have Ukraine, election meddling, Syria, cyber attacks, etc. etc. </p>

<p>Mueller confirmed this and brought a sample seized at a border and nobody is touching this story with a ten foot pole.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton put together a deal that was intended to allowed uranium onto the black market because the intelligence community wants the population of every country to always be afraid of the end of the world.

<p>as if Putin would never ever attempt to poison an ex-spy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>please continue.   do you have a case on how this would help him more than hurt him?   is he that much of an idiot that he would leave the traces that are claimed?   that he would pick this time of all times?</p>

<p>Putin is a chess player.   He may not be a nice guy but yeah,   he does have a lot to lose and a lot to gain,  and is not looking to fuck himself or his country.</p>

<p>How did killing Sergei Skripal benefit Putin?</p>

<p>Better yet,  how is it being used by the west?   The west is much more likely to manufacture evidence to further their aggressions as they did with Saddam and others.     Hell,  just look at Waco Texas,  or any number of suspect incidents that the FBI and CIA have been involved in.</p>

<p>The deep state is acting a lot more desperate than Putin is.</p>

<p>I made a post asking a question tho. If this poison was something that never left the Russians lab, how is it that the UK is able to identify it? Or conversely, if the UK spied, or otherwise had access to the poison to know what it is, then that means that the Russians are NOT the only ones with access to it, and while this does not necessarily shift the blame away from Russia, it certainly would mean that there could be other culprits. </p>

<p>Where am I?</p>

<p>&quot;Blame Russia&quot; started like clockwork when Trump signaled a desire for detante.</p>

<p>75% of the claims about Russia turn out to be provable lies within a month of the claim. The other 25% are probably lies, but they can&#39;t be proven.</p>

<p>If you agree with CNN, go to CNN. There is plenty of Russophobia over there. I grew up in the 70&#39;s/80&#39;s, and I&#39;m not falling for another red scare / missile gap hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is &quot;fighting&quot; NATO and E.U./American hegemony and trying to hold his ground against their aggressive policies. But he is a totalitarian leader. Sure, Russia was in the gutter before he became president and some could say he improved living standards but yeah, Russia has its oligarchs, including Putin. </p>

<p>I have to admit that I jumped on the Putin wagon a couple of years ago. I admire his actions in the Middle-East and his well-spoken manner addressing journalists. </p>

<p>Regarding the killing of Skripal, I would like to point out to the chemical gas attack in Syria. Who the hell would believe that Assad would poison his own people? When the war was almost won and he knew the international community ( NATO/U.S) were watching ever so closely and tried to spin everything in a way that would justify their proxy war, it&#39;s just so naive. And the facts proved it to be a lie.</p>

<p>Same goes for this assassination. Skripal isn&#39;t relevant, hasn&#39;t been for a long time. There is no reason for Russia to kill him. The nerve gas can be produced by a good biochemist, not just a Russian one ( who would believe that nonsense, fucking hell ).</p>

<p>But it does hype up the Cold war mentality and distracts from the child grooming story.</p>

<p>So yeah, I am not jumping to conclusions just yet. If it is proven by a non-govermental body, I would not defend Putin. Why would I? But given the 80 years or so, I am almost inclined to say that this is just another ploy by some Western intel agency trying to stir some shit up.</p>

<p>There is a 3 question survey to read this article, sorry</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/46eb6414-22f8-11e8-ae48-60d3531b7d11">https://www.ft.com/content/46eb6414-22f8-11e8-ae48-60d3531b7d11</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sources have also dismissed reports of a link between Mr Skripal and private intelligence groups, including Orbis, the company jointly run by Christopher Steele, the former MI6 spy who compiled the infamous Trump-Russia dossier.</p>

<p>The most plausible theory to emerge so far is that Mr Skripal was the victim of a revenge attack for handing over Russian secrets to the British.</p>

<p>There are few other clues to go on. A friend of Mr Skripal’s daughter, Yulia, said he had worked as “a lecturer” but did not disclose where. </p>

<p>This would tally with accounts from the security officials that he may have given occasional presentations and talks to UK military and intelligence personnel. It is not clear where these lectures took place. </p>

<p>The Defence Academy, a Ministry of Defence college in Shrivenham, 45 miles from Salisbury, which is responsible for postgraduate education for the UK armed forces, said it had no record of Mr Skripal being employed as a lecturer or giving presentations as a guest speaker. </p>
