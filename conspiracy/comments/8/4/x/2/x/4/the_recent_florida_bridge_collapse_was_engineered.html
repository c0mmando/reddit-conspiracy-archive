        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: The engineer of the failed collapsed Florid pedestrian Bridge is a Woman. I have seen, in quite a few engineering forums, actual engineers criticizing the design of the bridge, and wondering how the hell this thing got OK&#39;ed.</p>

<p>Now, the STEM fields (especially Engineering) have a disproportionate amount of Men over Women in the field, and for a long time, before all the SJW/Feminsim movements, no one really cared or said anything about this until the last 5-8 years.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why this is so, studies show biological brain differences between the genders, psychological differences, and many others. Actually, an Engineer at Google got fired for circulating a Memo showing and explaining the difference between genders and citing various studies as to why there are less women in STEM fields and that its ok:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Damore’s 10-page memorandum accused Google of silencing conservative political opinions and argued that biological differences play a role in the shortage of women in tech and leadership positions. It circulated widely inside the company and became public over the weekend, causing a furor that amplified the pressure on Google executives to take a more definitive stand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The conspiracy here is that, the majority of women are ill equipped biologically/cognitively(Logic) to be competent engineers as is reaffirmed in STEM field numbers, but because of SJW/Feminism, schools and Organizations are pushing for more women to be in STEM, creating graduates who are ill equipped and incompetent to be Engineers leading to failures like this bridge</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Said Leonor: “It’s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter, because I think women have a different perspective. We’re able to put in an artistic touch and we’re able to build, too.”</p>

<p>Use it to your advantage fellow human. Triggered people are just people that can not cope with living in the reality we have created, even though it seem to not be the reality we want.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, since less women have built bridges who have failed, but also participate less as engineers, I&#39;ll bet the numbers will reflect that more male designed bridges have failed. This is based on the sheer volume of bridges built by males in the last 2000 years. </p>

<p>Though, if we want to lesson the time of builds to say, two years. Then the numbers will probably show &quot;males&quot;. --There have been over two dozen bridge failures in the US in the last five years. Only ONE of those bridges designed by a woman collapsed, and that is this bridge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s his point. There are <em>no excuses</em> for <em>anyone</em> designing a bridge that ends up failing, male of female. Both sides must take responsibility.</p>

<p>According to the news, MRA rage mostly comes from the fact that the media is now either claiming that this bridge <em>wasn&#39;t</em> built by mostly women after the collapse, or trying to act like they <em>aren&#39;t</em> responsible for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, this is going straight to the top of every sub that loves to bash on us so put on your Sunday best and stop playing in the mud. To reiterate, we are under scrutiny and we need to shape up. If you present a decent argument you have a high chance of it being seem by someone who disagrees and maybe making them think. </p>

<p>Alright, let&#39;s figure this thing out. First of all OP is either a troll or a sexist bigot no question there. That&#39;s why you aren&#39;t getting any decent discussion btw, no one wants yo talk to you. </p>

<p>OP posted a lot of links and then garbled the meanings into supporting his own theory. I&#39;m not and it doesn&#39;t look like anyone else is saying your links are bad or sources are false. You are just misquoting them. A hammer and a sledgehammer are different from each other, just like men and women have biological differences. It doesn&#39;t mean one type of hammer can&#39;t hammer nails or the other can&#39;t break stuff, they are just predisposed differently. A small sledgehammer works great at nailing nails. </p>

<p>Similarly, humans have individual differences. On <em>average</em> men are different from women. That doesn&#39;t mean all men are better than all women at some tasks. What PC culture gets wrong is we push that everyone is exactly the same. And we aren&#39;t. We have individual differences. Some women can be great engineers. Some men are never going to be engineers. What we need is equality of opportunity: so that <strong>women who <em>want</em> to be engineers can become engineers</strong> and women who <strong>don&#39;t</strong> want it aren&#39;t pushed where they won&#39;t thrive. Yes, we will likely see more men in stem on average. That won&#39;t be a bad thing when our society is better. </p>

<p>Right now we have more men in stem than women because women can&#39;t get in- it&#39;s a good old boys club that excluded women historically. But pushing to the other extreme for a 50/50 ratio or even female majority isn&#39;t any better- if we end up with people who aren&#39;t doing what they are best at and want to do its still loss. </p>

<p>I want the best engineers possible. Some of them are women. They should have an equal chance to become engineers. Everyone who won&#39;t become a competant engineer, shouldn&#39;t be forced into it though. Am I making any sense here? </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t read this much here&#39;s a video of a much smarter professional explaining it to an interviewer.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>People should be hired based on competency, skill and merit and not just to meet a quota.  Men or women, black or white.</p>

<p>But take a look at this interview Leonor did.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.fiu.edu/2018/03/community-gathers-to-watch-950-ton-bridge-move-across-southwest-8th-street/120395">https://news.fiu.edu/2018/03/community-gathers-to-watch-950-ton-bridge-move-across-southwest-8th-street/120395</a></p>

<p>First they claim that she was the lead engineer for this bridge and how because she&#39;s a woman, even she can go into STEM and build a bridge.</p>

<p>After the collapse, they backtracked and said &quot;Oh no, she didn&#39;t work on the bridge.  When she meant she wanted to show her work to her daughter and what she has accomplished, she just mean her work in <em>general</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s one of two things.  She either lied and tried to attach her name to something she had nothing to do with and push her feminist views and has now backtracked after the failure OR she was ill-equipped to design this bridge suggesting she was hired because she was a feminist engineer, instead of an engineer.</p>

<p>Hire ENGINEERS, not Feminist Engineers or Male Engineers or Asian Engineers or Gay Engineers.  Lives are on the line.  I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a female, male, asian, or gay.</p>
