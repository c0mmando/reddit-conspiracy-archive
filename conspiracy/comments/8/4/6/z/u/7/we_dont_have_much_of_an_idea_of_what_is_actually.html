       Something interesting I like to ponder... and just like outer space; we're told what to believe is going on and how it works and anything else is ridiculed or dismissed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how science makes it's best guess: observations of topography and bathymetry, observations of rock in outcrop, samples brought to the surface from greater depths by volcanoes or volcanic activity, analysis of the seismic waves that pass through the Earth, measurements of the gravitational and magnetic fields of the Earth, and experiments with crystalline solids at pressures and temperatures characteristic of the Earth's deep interior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth's Depth:  6,371 km
      </p>
      <p>
       How deep we've actually gone: The Kola Superdeep Borehole SG-3 retains the world record at 12.2 km in 1989 and still is the deepest artificial point on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've literally only scratched the surface (we got a drill down 0.19% of Earth's depth) and are guessing about the rest based on methods that are similar to medical imaging. That said, I can agree with the data and the findings...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to just throw it out there...
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if our planet is actually a 'dirty star' of some sort. Our core could actually be a portion of a star or something along those lines. The temperature at the inner core's surface is approximately 5,430 °C, which is about the temperature at the surface of the Sun.

       It's pretty much impossible to drill lower than that. They had to stop there because the ground gets really fluid at that depth. It's like trying to dig a hole in water. We just don't have the tech to go lower.

       Just standard science bullshit to say:
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually scientists don't highlight how little they know about the subject they happen to be studying. Bad for grants. Instead they fill the basket with details that they CAN get at and accumulate, and that's the case here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's another very serious strategy: make a model. Once you have a model and some data, you're off and running. A model of the earth might be as a great big iron magnet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have the model, you put all the actual readings and measurements into it. Surprisingly, they always seem to fit right the first time. Sometimes the facts don't fit. Then they either ignore them, or make a new model.

       I think one of the defining features of a planet, as opposed to a star, is that planets aren't massive enough to reach thermonuclear fusion.  The temperature you gave is the surface of the sun.  The core is 27 million degrees. How would a covering like  earth's crust withstand that kind of heat?  I'm not exactly sure what your theory is and maybe neither are you, maybe you're just thinking and want to hear what others think, which is cool, it's fun to think about.  Are you thinking along the lines of maybe the star is at a stage in its lifecycle where it's not so hot?  Like a white dwarf?  I'm not an astronomer but it's interesting to think about.

       Yeah! I'm just putting it out there because its absolutely unknown really. I know it's a huge stretch of the imagination to think it's some kind of a star at the center of our planet... but it's really interesting to think about. I realize (just like so many other things) we barely have an idea and yet get very set on how it is.

       IMO this is the grand conspiracy of all, we are looking for other life form anywhere in the universe but don’t even know what beneath our feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all the Dumb scatter everywhere, or Fking deep cavern like Krubera cave or even old  tunnel and passage like south america or the Giza plateau, They probably know something that would change the way we see our planet or plane whatever your beliefs are and keep us in the dark with theories like the molten core, tectonic plate etc.

       Breakaway civilization from the old times or for a upcoming massive event ? We don’t know for sure but damn this is so interesting, even more high as fuck.

       The problems with looking into the middle of the earth are technological, not political, in nature. The problems with exploring caves and underwater features are partly monetary, partly technological as well. Researchers in China recently found species of flowers they thought were extinct, that somehow survived in only some caves in really remote parts. Other researchers recently found a novel mineral encased in diamonds which were created under very specific circumstances. Shit, just last week we found the USS Lexington after 70 something years underwater off the coast of Australia. Kinda neat to think about all this stuff.

       I think it’s actually fairly well accepted by the scientific community that there is nuclear
       <em>
        fission
       </em>
       going on in the earth’s core. Kind of like you hypothesized; just not with fusion.

       It seems pretty likely that the heaviest elements are in the core, and that would suggest fission occurring there.

       It's pretty much impossible to drill lower than that. They had to stop there because the ground gets really fluid at that depth. It's like trying to dig a hole in water. We just don't have the tech to go lower.
