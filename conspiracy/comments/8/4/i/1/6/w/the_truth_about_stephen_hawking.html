       his work wasn’t that remarkable
he only reason he was famous is because he was a freak show
he spent his adult life shilling in favor of atheism
he was a leftist shitbag with a chip on his shoulder because he was disabled
He was a shill for the globalists to push atheism, nihilism, and communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen Hawking is in hell now for taking money from the globalists to blasphemize God on television.
Stephen Hawking, the foolish doubter and satanic shill is now in hell after the physical universe he spent his life researching is long gone.

       A creator maybe. A tweak of the genes here and there. Hell this place could just be a human farm for all we know.

       But an omnipotent singularity? Meh. Even Catholic dogma dances around that.

       We have studies the history of religion. We have watched the evolution of it throughout the ages. It is as obvious as the advancement of pottery or metallurgy.

       Yeah I've watched a couple Scientology docs. I mean maybe this a prison planet for our souls. So basically hell. Which would make sense. Considering the war, famine, disease, violence that plagues the earth when it doesn't need to. There is enough technology and money to fix every problem for every person. Someone/something doesn't want it that way though.

       I just don't get it. Most religion baffles me. I don't see how people can sign up to fantasy. But Scientology is just a joke. Like the actual story. Zenu and the volcanos and shit. Hard to swallow.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we have people signing up for burning bushes and manna from heaven... funny those two came up for me. Both have a possibility in reality. But I digress.

       Why can God not be real if the devil is real? In religion the devil rules over the earthly plane. It's our job to deviate away from the sins that he has created in this place. Do good, maybe you go to the next level. Do bad, maybe you restart again. Or maybe you just die and your brain turns off like a computer. We will never know.

       Logically. If the devil is untouchable then God isn't omnipotent. If he is and doesn't give this fallen angel the heave-ho he has placed it here in purpose. So Hell is owned by God and the devil is just the manager.

       Well toying with Abraham like that is a dick move. An omnipotent omnipresent God could not want the blood of a child spilled in his honor and even if he was just messing with Abraham it is still really a dick move.

       much like Einstein, their impact was much more within their field than broader public ... But his image did help popularize science. Despite his opinions regarding religion and NWO, his position (both physical and academic) lent him free discourse over very sensitive subjects

       The irony here is that Hawking did lead to breakthroughs in his field. But he himself downplayed them in his books. He was super humble about his background. He even admits that pop culture took a liking to him only because he's disabled and it came off as some sort of savant thing.

       As for the atheism debate, I refuse to waste my time with another one of you people ever again. Anyone who considers themselves an atheist must therefore be a scientific fundamentalist, a religion in itself which does not have answers for everything yet in it's arrogance (just like any other religion) presumes it is the one infallible explanation for everything with no proof to back it up.

       Even pretend. This is a great point about (typically) Christians. Thehrish in the idea of torture and eternal pain for some. Enough of cloud their judgement and stifle any actual effort to help others.

       A creator maybe. A tweak of the genes here and there. Hell this place could just be a human farm for all we know.

       But an omnipotent singularity? Meh. Even Catholic dogma dances around that.

       We have studies the history of religion. We have watched the evolution of it throughout the ages. It is as obvious as the advancement of pottery or metallurgy.

       Logically we can only state as fact what is quantifiable. All else is postulation.

       Well toying with Abraham like that is a dick move. An omnipotent omnipresent God could not want the blood of a child spilled in his honor and even if he was just messing with Abraham it is still really a dick move.

       Seems more like a tale a bronze age goat herder would make up rather than a real recorded action of an all seeing all knowing deity.

       The old testement is really really violent. So many smoted in

       How come god tells everyone they are the chosen ones? Shouldn't at least one tribe have it down that those people over there are gods favs?

       Or let it be known that we are all his favorites and we need to get along. Like one time? Just once tell your kids to stop fighting.
