       Does anyone think there is a massive conspiracy to stop people reading books? These days I hardly see any young people reading. It's Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat this and that. Dumbing down our kids. Why aren't people reading? TPTB afraid of people discovering people like Terence McKenna? Afraid of discovering that voluntaryism and Anarcho-Capitalism are perfectly adequate replacements to the tyranny that oppresses us today? Me thinks that TPTB are more than happy seeing us chained to our phones. How funny it is that knowledge is more accessible than ever before yet simultaneously so distant...

       They want us to have one source of information, the internet and it is being purged and history is being re-written all over the interne
and many documents that contradict 
the new official history are hidden or behind paywalls or require organizational membership to access.

       Did you know that with your library card  you can listen to audio books for free. I use mine for some kinds of material.
      </p>
      <p>
       For other materials I like to have the book and the audio because some ideas need a "pause time to consider," and that is easier with a book.

       Feelz ya... We should start an island or piece of land for those of us in the know of all the evils around us so at least we can be around people who get it. I feel so lonely sometimes when I know I can't talk about real shit with co workers, friends, or random strangers. It's a rare gem when I find someone who gets it and is living an authentic life,  it's always a beautiful connection,  if even for just a few minutes. It's truly namaste and I realize there are more of us to fight for and I re-energize and am able to go on another day.

       Well I hope you find some light on your life add well;  they want us to believe it's all shit and to stop caring and stop fighting,  but we have to push on! At least you know why you're medicating with alcohol, hopefully you can find something to make you want to do it a little less.

       It's like the matrix, you have the red or the blue pill, or opposite ends of the energy spectrum, when awakening to this type of truth it is just like Neo waking up out of his body in the pod, everything weak and eyes hurting. But the truth is the truth so the key is to start over your life and change according to the new knowledge you have now become awakened to, this requires aligning your physical red masuline action aspect and the loving compassionate feminine aspect of ourselves which leaves us with the center balance point, or heart. Love transcends this evil world.

       Reading opens the horizons of ones mind...it allows one to see the perspectives of others while never leaving their living room. "Teach" a kid that reading sucks and they'll abhor it the rest of their lives....a dumbed down citizenry allows the Elites to do what they please.

       I don't think it's a conspiracy, I think it's a sad byproduct of a culture focused on instant gratification and social media, but I don't think it's a conspiracy.

       I read 25-35 books a year still even though I'm busy with work, probably half fiction half nonfiction and I'll teach my kids the same some day, knowledge is good.

       If there is a conspiracy here it’s replacing physical books with digital. You can change or delete a digital book without the person even noticing. You want to change history, poof restrict history just change a couple things around. The average person isn’t going to go find a physical copy of some book from 50 years ago

       The real info, to the extent that it is published, is in scientific journals. They are so expensive and so technical that you cannot afford to read a lot of them and even if you could, the jargon is so specialized that you cannot understand it.

       My family and friends read more now than we used to. Kindles are everywhere. Vacation time relaxing is usually people hanging out reading in between activities. Having hundreds(endless amounts actually) of books at all times is amazing. Sharing books has never been easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       People started reading less when TV happened, then video game, the phones, and computers, etc, but now I'd say they're back on the rise.

       I do all my book reading through audiobooks, you'll never see me with a book. I also listen to a lot of podcasts, and these podcasts cover material that I would have read about in newspapers or magazines if I was born decades earlier. And all of this is driven by Internet content on my phone. There are dumb people who are exactly like you describe too, but there have always been dumb people.

       No conspiracy, just market forces at work. There's an oversupply of books and good ones get hidden by all the shitty ones. Then there's not enough time to read them.

       I too don't have too much time and I resort to listening to audiobooks while I drive and walk. Right now I average 1 full book per week. Sometimes two.

       Well our local bookstores are filled with shitty drama thrillers and wannabe stephen kings with no sign of critical thought. My generation is only interessted in thoughts that will enhance their social status within their "faction". On social media they pretty much just read the propaganda of their own choice. They belive. They don't think. They are cultists.

       I still read, a lot. I buy mostly used books, I hate reading books on my phone. A lot of millennials read still, one way or the other. I do think you’re on to something though, but it’s mainly because everyone has so many other options to soak up information now.

       I think I've read more books in the last 2 years than I have over the rest of my life. As you can see by my username 1996 was my birth year, so I'm young. I'd say it's something like a 50/50 - 60/40 split with people my age in regards to whether or not they read books. I don't know how it is with kids younger than me though, because I know that people my age were still being read books while we were little, whereas a 4 year old today is more likely to watch some videos on YouTube than be read a book. My generation (+/- a year) just about spans that gap of "people who grew up without an Internet and were introduced to it" vs "people who grew up with the Internet always being a thing".
       <br/>
       If I were to make a speculative guess, I'd reckon that as a byproduct of growing up with the Internet, the younger generation don't have as much of a natural incentive to read actual books when all the information is readily available online. Whereas those who knew what it was like to regularly come home to a house without Internet and had to actually go to the library to read books to get information have that incentive. That physical act of going somewhere to seek out physical information leaves much more of a psychological impact than having information simply being fed to you via a screen. When you put in that effort, expend real energy and then finally get the information in the end your brain sends out the relevant neurotransmitters to complete that emotional reward system we have naturally wired into us. Internet information generally doesn't do that for.
