    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve definitely run into each other before. Thank you for the kind words. </p>

<p>My story is maybe a cliche of the abused kid that pulls himself up by his bootstraps and becomes successful due to hard work and sacrifice. I&#39;ve still got plenty of baggage however I&#39;m  well stabilized by a wife of 18 years (as of tomorrow) and I&#39;m fortunate enough to realize the amount that I know decreases every day.</p>

<p>The first rules in my house are integrity and respect. We speak truthfully and kindly to each other. My kids never see their parents fight and we make sure to gross them out with plenty of PDA to set an example of loving parents since it seems to be hit or miss among their peer group. </p>

<p>Beyond that, I&#39;m fortunate to have some technical skill and my primary function is providing computer security knowledge to the Federal Government. That puts me in the DC area and provides me with some high visibility neighbors that are getting some headlines today. Even though my first red pill was years ago, I&#39;m still somewhat in disbelief of the timeline we&#39;re living in and I think it&#39;s only going to get better. </p>

<p>I think a lot of things are on the upswing right now, including this sub, so please keep the faith, keep spreading truth and stay positive. Things are just getting good. </p>

<p>You said &quot;both&quot;, but what you posted were a list of related words all ultimately dealing with little more than ignorance, so I&#39;m still confused.  Both <em>what?</em> . Ignorance on one hand (illustrated by the list of words you used), and <em>what</em> exactly on the other?</p>

<p>There is proof of such <em>now</em>.  It&#39;s already happening.  It&#39;s just perhaps not happening anywhere near as quickly as you or others (or even myself for that matter) would like.  It&#39;s still definitely happening, however.</p>

<p>No.  You won&#39;t.  You won&#39;t see shit.  It&#39;s super slow and gradual.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s absolutely happening nonetheless.</p>

<p>We evolve.  Definitely.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s absolutely growing and moving and evolving dynamically nonetheless.</p>

<p>We evolve.  Definitely.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Wait a minute...are you saying that there&#39;s tons of data showing both evolution and devolution?</p>

<p>If <em>that’s</em> what you’re referring to in terms of “there’s tons of data showing both”, then that&#39;s totally 100% correct.  There <em>is</em> in fact tons of data showing both evolution and devolution of the human species (and every other species on the planet as well, believe it or not - everything is all connected).  Yes.  Absolutely.  We had been devolving for millennia, as a matter of fact.  Now we are officially beginning the slow climb back up through an evolutionary/upward cycle, however (as opposed to the devolutionary cycle we were said to be on previously).</p>

<p>Regardless, however, the point is that the comment that aleister previously made that “Humans have not evolved and they never will” is, as I said in my initial comment, patently false and incorrect.</p>
