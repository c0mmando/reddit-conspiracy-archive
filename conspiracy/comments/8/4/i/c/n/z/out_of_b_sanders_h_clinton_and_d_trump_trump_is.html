        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just posted a comment reply in a conversation I was/am having with <a href="/u/RMFN">/u/RMFN</a>, and felt that it wouldn&#39;t be a bad OP to put up here.</p>

<p>SS:  Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t say this is a direct conspiracy per se, as it&#39;s not necessarily involving any direct, purposeful chicanery by two or more people against another group, but I still think it&#39;s very worthy of this sub by virtue of the fact that it gets us to think a bit more critically and deeply about what&#39;s going on and helps us read between the lines, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to post the response I made in that other post here [with a bit of editing to make it more to the point here], as it explains what I&#39;m meaning in my OP heading:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fuck Hillary Clinton for sure, and fuck Donald Trump too (before anybody gets any ideas that I support &quot;this&quot; <del>candidate</del> shit head or that shit head).</p>

<p>You know what? I think that between Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump, it&#39;s Donal Trump that is actually the absolute best choice out of all three of them when it comes to actually waking the masses up.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because with absolute war monger Hillary Clinton, she would have forcefully kept TPTB going and continue warring and bombing across the world as much as possible. That would have been horrible.</p>

<p>With Sanders, well...<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/84hk0k/escorted_by_armed_guards_bernie_sanders_attends/dvpnq62/">I already explained how he&#39;s nothing but a sayanim above.</a></p>

<p>With Donald Trump, however? Donald Trump is already hated so much by so many people that his actions are actually causing people to actually wake up and pay attention to just how much of a loser not only he is, but the whole system is really.</p>

<p>Israel, for example, is actually getting a bit more critical reception now than ever before because of the very fact that Trump is promoting them and giving them more $, etc. Because so many people hate Trump, it&#39;s like they&#39;re starting to reflexively look critically upon whatever he supports...and since he supports the hell out of Israel, Trump haters are actually beginning to (again, reflexively) take a closer, more critical look at Israel in manners that they weren&#39;t before. Such scrutiny definitely wouldn&#39;t be happening under Clinton, and BIG TIME DEFINITELY would never happen under Sanders.</p>

<p>It might be for all the wrong reasons for sure, but Trump might be the best thing to happen to the United States in recent times, honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your pessimism is fully understood.  100%.  However, I&#39;d say this:</p>

<p>People aren&#39;t born suckers.  They&#39;re born impressionable - which makes them <em>easy to turn into</em> suckers by those who are themselves unscrupulous and/or ignorant.</p>

<p>The more people wake up, however, the less people will be ignorant, which will make the impressionable individuals that are born much less likely to be turned into suckers because they&#39;re being born into a world where more and more people are waking up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more difficult to turn the impressionable into suckers when they&#39;re surrounded by more and more people who are actually waking up and beginning to understand.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty horrendously pessimistic as well.  However, more than being a general pessimist, I try to be a critical thinker, and in striving for such, I try to be as objective as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is apparently about to hire John Bolton as National Security Advisor. The same man who has been thumping the war drums against Iran since about 1985.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. We are currently involved in, what, five wars? And those are the ones we know about publicly.</p>

<p>Afghanistan
Iraq
Syria
Yemen
Nigeria (not sure if this qualifies, but American forces are dying there)</p>

<p>What about the secret wars? I am certain we have forces on the ground in the border areas of Pakistan, but I suppose you could call that part of the Afghan effort.</p>

<p>And now, what&#39;s next? Iran? North Korea? Trump was dangling a possible invasion of Venezuela in the wind a couple months back.</p>

<p>Is there a political leader in existence who is <em>not</em> interested in starting more wars? I want that person to be the next president. Wrap up all this useless killing, find a way to stabilize things, and bring our troops home while still keeping an overwhelming force projection worldwide for the security of ourselves and our allies.</p>

<p>Maybe that is too large of a dream, but it is what I have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What crimes did Hillary and the DNC commit, please be specific. </p>

<p>A screaming and fast typing band of bots and conservative paid and Russians calling Hillary a criminal does not make Hillary a Criminal.  </p>

<p>(I was a strong Sanders supporter who did vote for Hillary.)</p>

<p>I know which party was doing the voting registration removals, removing polling places, shortening polling times, the red states. </p>

<p>Like Arizona, not enough places to vote. a very Republican controlled state. </p>

<p>The NY incident, was probably a paid off operator, who unfortunately was let off the hook for removing the NYC voters but then again those NY Democratic are nearly 100% third way libertarians.  </p>

<p>The ones so strongly promoting the both parties are the same and who have been doing as much as possible to make it true. 
And the ones both Clinton&#39;s belong to. 
Business friendly wage suppression sobs. </p>

<p>The tide is starting to turn on social media networks (Facebook/Youtube with their recent And rampant censorship), and the media is just in a freefall from all sides. People will either stop listening, or rise up. Either way, change is inevitable. </p>

<p>Bernie didn&#39;t bow out so much as he got the nomination <em>stolen</em> from him by Clinton, no?</p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t seem to me that Clinton &quot;went soft&quot; so much as it was that so many scandals she was involved in and responsible for kept coming up more and more that she was ultimately <em>pummeled</em> into &quot;softness&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say in amazement &quot;Where did you get this nutty idea from?&quot; But I know the answer. This is the kind of submission that passes for original thinking every time someone posts it. Guess what? There is nothing clever or original about your comment. I would be so embarrassed to elevate such familiar junk to submission level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... (before anybody gets any ideas that I support &quot;this&quot; candidate shit head or that shit head ... Trump that is actually the absolute best choice ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, declarations of &quot;the best choice&quot; would indicate a level of support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because with absolute war monger Hillary Clinton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Were you around when Richard Nixon made similar claims about Lyndon Johnson, promised peace and then widened and extended the Vietnam War, or when Ronald Reagan pressured Democrats to hold the line on spending, promised fiscal restraint, passed giant tax cuts only for the rich, then quadrupled the debt while building the military, or when George Bush took that shiny new military and started the 27 year conflagration that is now the Middle East, or when George W. Bush stole an election to implement a secret plan for three large scale wars at the same time? </p>

<p>And Hillary&#39;s the &quot;absolute war monger&quot;? As I recall, it was Hillary who played a major role in brokering peace with Iran -- the very peace that Donald Trump is trying desperately to break.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump is already hated so much by so many people that his actions are actually causing people to actually wake up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They said this about Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and George W. Bush. IT didn&#39;t work. It doesn&#39;t work. Once these oligarchs do their damage, it is very hard to come back to the modern world -- outrage or not.</p>

<p>You should go look at the video of George W. Bush on his inauguration day. That was serious outrage then, much like what we see now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel, for example, is actually getting a bit more critical reception now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the big war starts, this won&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>What you are doing is gambling with all of our futures. Put some terrible person in  so that things will get so bad that people will wake up and correct the direction. IF only such a thing worked. IT can work, it may work, but most likley, based on recent history, it will just make things worse for real people and give Democrats cover to become more like Republicans. Lose-lose situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your whole argument is that Trump <em>might</em> cause people to look at American ties to Israel?</p>

<p>The American left has been against funding the Israeli military for decades, the American right has been in support of it, and American politicians on both sides have been in support of it. Trump&#39;s base doesn&#39;t support arming Israel because of Trump, they support it because they&#39;re evangelical nut jobs who think that there&#39;s going to be some kind of holy war there. Anti-Trump people never supported paying Israel&#39;s arms bill in the first place.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s pretty much bunk. If I had to name one positive from Trump I&#39;d say -- tentatively -- that his incompetence pushed South Korea and North Korea closer together and made them realize they should go bilateral at first, so maybe no nuclear war. That&#39;s all pending, though.</p>

<p>And on the flip side, what about everything else? You know, all the other stuff that Trump has said and done - the 99.9% that didn&#39;t involve Israel? The expansion of the imperial presidency beyond Bush II or Obama&#39;s or even Nixon&#39;s wildest dreams -- &quot;the president can&#39;t have a conflict of interest,&quot; -- rapid acceleration of federal crackdowns on marijuana users and dispensaries (and the death penalty for them soon? probably not, that was probably just an Alzheimer&#39;s moment), appointment of a radical theocrat to the SC, private sales of public parks, killing net neutrality regulations, attempting to gut the Clean Water Act (among other environmental regulations - this one is still in court), openly supporting neo-Nazis and Confederate LARPers and pedophiles... and now he&#39;s just nominated someone known mostly for torture as head of the CIA. </p>

<p>And then of course the trillions of dollars he helped steal from taxpayers and the unborn to pay bonuses to his international banking buddies.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ll take your &quot;sayanim&quot; any day. What&#39;s the worst case scenario there? The same policies as Trump towards Israeli weapons but none of the other bad shit? Sounds golden.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Various people have.  It involves not only citizen coalitions and people coming together supporting each other, but ultimately standing up a PTB that will absolutely fight to take down those coalitions that work independent of their grip.</p>

<p>That’s ultimately part of the problem.  No sooner do good ideas come up for people coming together than TPTB undermine things and/or find some sort of bullshit reason to come in and disband the efforts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just saying the 2 party system is corrupt and we need to change it sounds like we&#39;re advocating for civil war or anarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A) I wouldn’t say that stating “the 2 party system is corrupt and we need to change it” sounds necessarily like anyone’s advocating for civil war in the least.</p>

<p>B) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Bv2MKY7uI">Anarchy is nothing like you (and pretty much all of us) have been indoctrinated to believe it is.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no cohesive vision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A big part of the reason for that, as I stated above, is because TPTB make sure and brake up cohesive visions when they do occur (and cohesive visions absolutely do occur).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coming together sounds like a wonderful idea, but whats the end goal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, not living in a land and civilization of war and death and violence and attrition for starters?  Living in a world of great advancement spiritually, physically, and technologically?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What and how do you imagine this united citizenry to function?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean?  I don’t imagine it functioning much different than any people who actually get along with one another without resorting to unnecessary violence or argumentation.  People can come at a situation with differing perspectives and still not be going at each other’s throats.  This conversation right here is a good example.  There seem to be differences of perspective here, yet we’re not going at each other’s throats.  No reason why a united citizenry can’t include people like you and me right here and now - just on a nation-wide level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You wanted to make this about Hillary being a warmonger and Trump being the best thing that could happen to us because it might force us to wake up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entirely incorrect.  I didn’t want to make this about anything.  I was simply pointing out that A) Hillary absolutely <em>is</em> a warmonger, and B) Trump actually <em>is</em> better compared to Sanders and Clinton - psychotic as that seems on the surface level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m simply pointing out there is nothing good about this situation when we&#39;re relying on unpredictable madmen with nuclear weapons to show restraint because our President can&#39;t stop himself from threatening nuclear war over Twitter.</p>
