<p>He tried to speak out about this and was killed due to our, the public’s, in action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.</p>

<p>What he is saying aligns with my theory about whats been going on,except for one small detail.</p>

<p>Imo, its not so much the goverment that has been infiltrated by the illuminati, but  instead it was the Freemasons, the group that created our goverment, that were infiltrated and co-opted by the illuminatti. And what we are seeing now is a big house cleaning by the masons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He does videos about the Freemasons. They were infiltrated as well. He covers lots of topics.</p>

<p>Most fraternal orders, and groups that use secrecy, have been infiltrated by this negative group.</p>

<p>He does a great video covering &quot;Pawns in the Game&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gunderson was NOT &quot;Former FBI director.&quot;  This is purely false.</p>

<p><a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2005/07/interview-with-jackie-mcgauley-part_19.html"><em>Here is an interview with one of the mothers</em></a> <em>who credits Gunderson with being COINTELPRO.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did Ted Gunderson enter both the investigation and your personal life? How long did you live together?</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to clear up the misconception that gunderson (I never capitalize his name) was involved in the investigation. He was never formally hired or paid in any way. He simply stuck himself in by offering to do things. Who wouldn&#39;t trust the retired chief of the Los Angeles division of the FBI who introduced you to senators and former State Attorney Generals? Some things we allowed him to do but many of his ideas and attempts to take over were rejected.</p>

<p>He was a persistent presence. He became so annoying that <em>eventually the parents would not talk to him</em>. I always thought in some way that he would help our cause. He was present at the Archaeological dig as often as he could and he talked to the ever present media as the rest of us were exhausted or did errands for the crew. At the time we did not know what he was up to and did not think it would be harmful to let him talk, as we thought he said positive things.</p>

<p>I want you to know that allowing him to be involved was the demise of any credibility we had.</p>

<p><em>His reputation was well known by law enforcement, but he is such a slick con man that we had no clue what we were getting ourselves into.</em> I have to say that it was mostly my fault for letting him be involved. <em>Later I found out he was COINTELPRO.</em> Years later when I read the description of that program it all made perfect sense.  I met ted at a California State Social Services Hearing ion San Diego, where I was formally asked, by an invitation I got in the mail, to testify. He approached me in the hallway because I was known then for keeping a file of documentation on the issue. I had appeared on several news programs and talk shows.</p>

<p>How he wormed his way into my home is a rather long story. Basically he tried to hire me to not only work with him, but do research for attornies, which I did maybe twice, then started hanging around our apartment. I had just been diagnosed with malignant melanoma and while waiting for results of the test, was told I may only have three months to live. He got into a nasty fight with my downstairs neighbor and my landlord doubled my rent. I had thrown him out once because of his nasty temper towards the neighbors. While looking for another place to live and still communicating with him, he found a big house one block from my children&#39;s school. Needless to say the children loved the house. Against my better judgment, I agreed to let him move in with us and share expenses. This was almost immediately after we finished finding the tunnels at the preschool. I was not only exhausted, but I had contracted Psittacosis (parrot fever) which can be fatal. My temperature was so high seemed as if I were cooking from the inside. I was very sick for weeks, ted refused to help me. He took the checks I had made out to pay bills and told me he had to give his daughter the money. That was just the start of almost 4 years of my decent into debt and serious health problems.</p>

<p>Gunderson praised J. Edgar Hoover until the end of his life, which would be at odds with the decades-long elite pedophile cult that Gunderson claimed to have battled.  Hoover, of course, famously <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hoover+no+such+thing+as+organized+crime&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;oq=hoover+no+such+thing+as+organized+crime&amp;amp;gs_l=heirloom-serp.3...151516.168350.0.169395.39.8.0.18.0.0.323.401.1j3-1.2.0....0...1ac.1.34.heirloom-serp..38.1.77.ItLO0ZpEMos">said there was no such thing as organized crime</a> (even while he was cultivating relationships to it) and used sexual blackmail on politicians &amp; officials.</p>

<p>Ted Gunderson was one of the <a href="https://glomardisclosure.com/2016/07/06/ted-gunderson-from-cointelpro-planner-to-criminal-and-conspiracy-theorist/"><strong>architects of COINTELPRO</strong></a>, and was the Los Angeles FBI Bureau Chief.  </p>

<p><em>Ted Gunderson single-handedly destroyed the investigation into the 1984 McMartin preschool pedophile case</em>, which was prosecuted by Gunderson&#39;s pal, Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner.</p>

<p>Gunderson is not a reliable source.</p>
