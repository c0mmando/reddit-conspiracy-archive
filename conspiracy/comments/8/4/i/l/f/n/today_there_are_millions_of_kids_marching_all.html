    <div class="md"><p>Hello.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to agree with you that light arms, not matter how advanced, are a poor response to heavier military equipment.  All the ARs and AKs you want won&#39;t protect you from a Hellfire missle or an light tank division.</p>

<p>However, you can&#39;t argue that asymmetrical warfare against a native population has been non problematic for modern militaries.  And you can&#39;t argue that those opposition forces would have been as effective as they were without modern light arms.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the simple fact that these conflicts have been against a much smaller population than the US civil war you envision, and in a much smaller geographical area.  Much smaller.  And the US military will be smaller if there&#39;s a civil war.  And many US military personnel would to be on different sides, and they would be able to acquire and command some larger equipment.  And in the case of a breakdown in the US, the domestic enemy will not be their only threat ... we&#39;ve made a lot of external enemies, who do have serious military gear.  So internally, it becomes much less likely that every engagement will be as lopsided as you imagine.  Also, supply lines.  The path from American factory and depot to Iraq, or Afganistan, or Vietnam, these are very secure supply lines.  That&#39;s not the case in an internal conflict, not even vaguely.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s a small analysis of your chosen perspective, citizens against an hostile government, and I hope we can agree that&#39;s it&#39;s not as cut and dried as you were thinking.</p>

<p>However, all that is just one issue.</p>

<p>What if the govt doesn&#39;t wage open war against the people?  What if, for any number of possible reasons, there&#39;s a crash, and society breaks down, and the government just withdraws to protect &quot;itself&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s people&quot; - the very wealthy?</p>

<p>What would happen if the half the power was out, half the stores were unsupplied, and the police and military withdrew or were ineffective?  Or let me put it to you another way.  You and fifty friends are going to be dropped into Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan tomorrow.  Choose, for your group, ten AK47&#39;s and five thousand rounds, or ten Winchester 30-30&#39;s and five dozen boxes of cartridges.  </p>

<p>As far as the political climate goes, that&#39;s a much larger subject that I&#39;m happy to discuss, but for now I&#39;ve got to run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m not a gun person. never owned one, never will. but the school massacre with assault rifles narrative is like the terrorist narrative, a black swan the size of the sun.</p>

<p>not only is the likelihood that anyone will ever be in a school massacre, or any other mass murder, infentessimal, it has been rapidly declining for my entire life, and i&#39;m 46. there were more in the 80s and 90s. the 1990s were the hey day of mass murder. </p>

<p>you don&#39;t legislate for the unlikely, but the likely. </p>

<p>no one should be shot in school. no one should be shot by cops. no one should be shot as a matter of course.</p>

<p>people care about these episodes because they are affluent white kids. poor black kids are shot everyday going, coming, and while in school in south chicago and camden. not too many walks out. and no bernie sanders campaign rallies disguised as solidarity with dead highschool students.</p>

<p>fwiw, hand guns have been used in the past. if assault rifles are banned, handguns will be used again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guns still kill 96 American people a day on average. For what purpose? Protection from the government? Unless these people are buying anti tank and air systems (which they&#39;re not allowed too anyways) the American people would not stand a chance against the american military, and why should we? The military if full of the American people! </p>

<p>Whataboutism. So it is predominantly white people getting shot. Dont we want white people to not get shot? And while were now on the subject, do you want to help these poor black kids from being shot in the street? How do you propose to do this? </p>

<p>As to your point on handguns, i agree that banning rifles will surely motivate people towards handguns, but handguns on average have slower bullet velocity and less magazine capacity and accuracy. They are objectively less deadly in a school setting than a semi/automatic rifle.</p>

<p>And what&#39;s to stop a &quot;crazy&quot; from murdering people with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_shooting">a pair of easily concealed pistols</a>? More legislation? Should we take away everyone&#39;s handguns too? Because making it illegal to kill people in the first place has proven to be an effective way to stop people from gun terrorism, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what about my crazy anecdotal story god dammit. This happened that one time and it was crazy!</p>

<p>As a 2nd ammendment proponent, i hope you know that its near impossible to fure two pistols accurately at once and rifles have much more sustained killing potential b/c of magazine capacity. </p>

<p>Huh, what else, little slippery slope here, little whataboutism there... no hope arguing w that... Oh! Thats a little diamond in the rough! I would think that you guys would be proponents of teen activism because it shows a commitment to improving society in the next generation, even if you dont personally agree w the goals. Think about this, the people who organized this rally have made more political sway than this subreddit has in all the years its existed, and both are run by teenagers. Isnt that at least a little worthy of admiration?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was in HS, a few actually concerned students published their own newspaper (pre-internet) when the school newspaper wouldn&#39;t let them run a (paid) advertisement opposing war generally, and campus military recruitment particularly.  </p>

<p>The school did their best to collect the papers.</p>

<p>Then, when a big helicopter was scheduled to land on the football field to stiffen all the pubescent pricks into military attention, a relative few people who cared got a bunch of people who just wanted something to do to walk out and stop that from happening.  And they did.  </p>

<p>But back in those days, the media wasn&#39;t doing such a good job at making an apple look bigger than an apartment building and keeping your attention away from the orchard.</p>

<p>What about the rights of students to be safe in a school environment?</p>

<p>If a person wants to murder a bunch of kids, no amount of legislation regarding guns will stop them. It&#39;s already illegal to murder people, and people still do it, so how do you think you&#39;re going to stop them by making it illegal for them to commit murder in this way? What&#39;s to stop someone from building a bomb using common chemicals? What&#39;s to stop someone from going in to a school with some knives? Hell, they could just go down to the liquor store, pick up a few bottles of booze, and firebomb a school with molotov cocktails. If you wanna get more complicated than that, it&#39;s not difficult to build a full-on flamethrower from equipment available at any hardware store.  </p>

<p>Not to mention, what&#39;s to stop them from using a smuggled gun from the black market? There are more guns in the USA than there are human beings, no matter what legislation there might be, if someone wants a gun, they can get a gun. If someone wants to kill innocent children, they&#39;re gonna do it. Making it a crime to murder children won&#39;t stop them from doing it, it&#39;s already fucking illegal anyway. </p>

<p>How does taking away <em>my</em> firearm affect that?  You can&#39;t just be a fascist and demand people give up rights because some person grew up troubled and murdered people (murder is already illegal, btw).</p>

<p>It comes down to the people, and truly broken homes and mental health issues are the things we should be focusing on.  People are stressed, depressed, and fail to see the value in human life.  That&#39;s the real issue here.  Stop trying to take away <em>my</em> firearm.  It&#39;s not my fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree with that. The police and fbi definitely should have followed up. But what realistically could they have done? There was no crime committed yet. They couldn&#39;t lock him up nor could they force him to get psychiatric help. He was an adult at the time. Also, expecting the system to work 100% of the time is not realistic. People make mistakes and there are no precise rules that always work to identify people who commit these kind of crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re assuming that every journalist plays by the same ethical rule book as you and unfortunately this isn’t the case. It’s likely they presented the case however they wanted to and shot footage on “both sides” and edited them out to either agree with each other (ie both sides finding a common ground that guns=bad) or they edited it to show more conflict than already existed (sex sells and when there’s no sex, sell conflict!). Ethics stops at the line where you need to put food on your table, and some guy in a film editing room is editing your footage without you, and your boss wants to drive something home. </p>

<p>Have you taken an ethics class yet? If so, did you discuss the separation between a journalist and management? This is a pretty common topic in most ethics classes because a manager doesn’t necessarily hold the same ethical standards as you and they don’t answer to your ethics. They answer to the money people who fund the projects/company. Those people have an agenda and couldn’t care less about your ethics or what you actually believe in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are a journalism major ... have you ever heard of Edward Bernays? He was Sigmund Freud&#39;s nephew,  applied his uncle&#39;s theories to the field of propaganda.   He developed a template for manipulating a free press in a democratic society,  and called it &quot;public relations&quot; because &quot;propaganda&quot; sounds bad.</p>

<p>Very interesting man,  and his techniques remain in common use almost a century later.   I feel that everyone should at least understand how he engineered the Guatemalan coup of 1954, as every American war since has been sold on similar grounds to the American people. </p>

<p>The BBC documentary,  The Century of Self, is a great place to start.   Free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Increasing purchasing age to 21.- why should a legal us citizen not be allowed to purchase a firearm to defend themselves before turning 21? They are considered adults at 18...can vote, go to war...?</p>

<p>Full background checks - including checks for mental health-     to the best of my knowledge this is already in the process...if the individual is flagged and entered in the system it&#39;s a no go...the process and system has failed numerous times but it&#39;s applicable </p>

<p>Getting rid of loopholes like some states have where &quot;if after 3 days a background check doesn&#39;t come back, the sale can be completed.&quot;  (This particular loophole has allowed more than 1 mass shooting to happen)-     that&#39;s a state vs federal issue...couple that with marijuana prohibition on a state vs fed level...people can gift a firearm to another and there is 0 checks...how many times has this contributed to an incident? How many criminals go through a background check? Checks are good and dandy but doesn&#39;t fix issues present...</p>

<p>Getting rid of the gun show and private purchase loopholes. Like for private purchases, both parties have to meet at a police station to complete a gun purchase transaction, logging the sale with the police department-     hate to go all guns are just tools, and people kill people...but...how would this fix anything?</p>

<p>Mandatory safety courses-    most states already have this...FL, CA, NY, IL just to name a few...Albeit generally for concealed carry</p>

<p>Banning high capacity magazines. (Over 30+ per clip)-    why? People who want to increase capacity of ammo will always find a way to do so...restricting it will only diminish a free persons ability to defend themselves...</p>

<p>Allowing the new fingerprint lock technology for guns, where only the owner can use the gun (pro-gun nuts objected to this, btw)-    what if a gun needs to be used by a non owner in the event the owner is under duress, incapacitated, or unavalible... </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why the government doesn&#39;t address the root problems, why do people commit this acts, what drives them to it? Why do the fact most of these shooters have a history or SSRI use? How is it that when these people have been reported and &quot;looked into&quot; by the authorities slip through the cracks? Why does the government continue to think that prohibition will correct these problems (ref. Alcohol, drugs, expression of ideas{think crack down or &quot;hippy&quot; mentality by FBI and CIA in the 60s/ 70s}, and firearms)...</p>

<p>I was a little off on the numbers, but the point remains. Over 70% support for banning ALL semiautomatic (this includes basically all handguns). 39/41 over total repeal, but I don&#39;t have the data and I&#39;m not sure if that only includes the two extremes of support (it goes 1-7, with 4 being not sure, 5/3 somewhat, 6/2 agree/disagree, and 7/1 strongly). It seems to only include the 6 and 7 values, which is not accurate. It&#39;s a yes-no vote, so it should include all past the 4 IMO.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure. Every issue has its extremists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gun violence today is actually LOWER today than it was in the 90s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and its possible that Clinton-era legislation on gun control was a major contributing factor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not really &quot;out of control&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is still out of control when compared with other countries. Mass shootings are by and large an American phenomenon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, the USA is involved in multiple wars, that&#39;s creating a lot of gun violence that didn&#39;t exist before. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overseas war casualties do not affect gun violence statistics at all. Totally different metric.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or how about the amount of unarmed people killed unjustly by police? Maybe we could do something about that easily preventable gun violence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely agree on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m in that camp and that&#39;s not a &quot;popular fear.&quot; We&#39;re concerned about the government becoming tyrranical and turning on its citizens, which happened over and over and over again in the 20th century. </p>

<p>No one is concerned that if the citizens lose their rifles, like the Chinese will come marching in. That&#39;s idiocy. </p>

<p>Mao rounded up and killed 70 million of his citizens. Stalin around 20 million, and if you don&#39;t think it can happen here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contingency plans by the US Government for rounding up people perceived by the government to be subversive or a threat to civil order have existed for many decades.[7] For example, from 1967 to 1971, the FBI kept a list of over 100,000 people to be rounded up as subversive, dubbed the &quot;ADEX&quot; list.[8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_84">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_84</a></p>

<p>You can safely bet that that list is much bigger today (in fact, this is just the number from one list from one gov&#39;t agency 48 years ago). Ironically, ADEX was comprised primarily of lefties, who are now pleading for Big Brother to take their weapons. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a leftists, and, back then, the ideology wasn&#39;t composed of pussies. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a poster The Weather Underground made. Interesting group if you&#39;re unfamiliar: they bombed the pentagon, broke Tim Leary out of prison, organized profoundly against the war and corrupt government in general, etc:</p>

<p>This is a false statement, and I&#39;m pretty sure you know that people are in fact trying to repeal the 2nd Amendment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re trying to restrict access to powerful weapons that facilitate death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main target of the supposed bans is not more powerful than many other guns that are currently common and not subject to a potential ban. AR-15s are not a high caliber rifle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re trying to keep the weapons out of the Hands of dangerous people before they murder a theater.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is completely different from banning a weapon. The simple fact is that the existing laws should have banned this guy from owning a firearm had they been enforced. They were not. People should be focusing on Scott Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re trying to improve critical mental care so people can seek help when they need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the solutions are simple (unconstitutional) gun bans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Coming for your guns&quot; &quot;going to ban firearms&quot; are mindless statements regurgitated to keep you afraid and loyal to the GOP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they aren&#39;t. Many people are in favor of a total repeal or repealing certain incredibly common guns. Stating otherwise does not make you correct.</p>

<p>What the Pew research does not account for though, is that household firearms ownership hit a high again in the 1993-1994 timeframe where household gun ownership exceeded 50% according to Gallup polls. The Gallup polls further show that household firearm ownership currently exceeds 40% and that the long-term trend is a sharp decline in polling for stricter gun control laws. Lastly, Gallup polling has consistently been over 65% against, when asking whether there should be bans on possession of handguns.[26]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting you refer to guns as &quot;powerful weapons that facilitate death&quot;. 
Alcohol and nicotine are both deadly, and are both taxed and regulated by the government, AND contribute to death on a much more massive scale. Those deaths include second hand, non-consenting parties. 
Where are the marches to put a stop to this? 
No, instead we see marches that coincidentally ficilitate TPTB&#39;s agenda, as we have for countless other questionable qonquests by our government. 
To top this all off, you refer the bashing Trump™ as some political tactic? 
Holy cow buddy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand perfectly. The weapons in question are seen as devices used solely for efficient killing, and people think that regular citizens shouldn&#39;t have them. I get it.</p>

<p>My issue is that the definitions by which they are using justify taking them away. &quot;Semi Automatic&quot;, &quot;Assault&quot;. etc,. What happens in 5 years when they come for &quot;Semi Automatic Handguns&quot;? &quot;Assault Shotguns&quot; and the like? </p>

<p>Paint any gun all black and suddenly it&#39;s &quot;military style&quot; or &quot;Tactical&quot; and a scary, efficient killing machine.</p>

<p>Point is, all guns are fucking dangerous. All guns are efficient killing machines. Most guns today are semi automatics. More handguns kill than rifles or shotguns, but they&#39;re coming after AR15&#39;s because its the weapon of choice for mass killers.</p>

<p>Its cliche for me to say &quot;slippery slope&quot; and all that but it fucking IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE. People who want to kill are going to find a way to kill. SUre, we can reduce how efficiently they can do it, but at what cost? Removing people&#39;s ability to defend themselves? How do you play out a scenario where guns are banned and someone is getting robbed at gunpoint? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Make it a criminal offense to own a gun so that if a gun is seen anywhere your gun gets removed. Before the hard ban is put in place, have a &quot;buy back&quot; period where you can sell your guns to the government for cash so you&#39;ll have cash in hand if you really need money and your reason for turning to crime is because you need financial help and can&#39;t get it. If someone is breaking and entering into your home, you have two options for how you want to store your gun.</p>

<ol>
<li>Store it with the bullets in it, somewhere where you can get it easily when someone is breaking and entering. From what I&#39;ve heard this is illegal, and if not it is plain bad practice and a safety issue if you have anything like kids. Not viable if you want to be a law abiding citizen.</li>
<li>Store it with bullets in case. I think this is also bad, but you would need to get to your gun case and find your keys to get the gun to shoot the guy, and if he had a gun you&#39;d already be dead. </li>
<li>Store it without bullets out of case. It takes a bit to load the damn thing, and this seems illegal too. Any added time onto the process of getting a gun makes murdering a man unviable.</li>
<li>Store it without bullets in case, which is the most law abiding option. It&#39;s also completely unviable because you&#39;d be dead where you stand trying to find the keys to unlock the case even before you run over to the other side of the house to get the bullets.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly most of the problems with our government in our modern lives come from a watering down of our constitutional protections, not adherence. Privacy? Fully abrogated. Monopolies? Rarely broken up. Speech? Only in designated zones, at least on important matters. Separation of powers? not if there&#39;s a war on. And police actions that become 10 year clusterfucks don&#39;t count as wars, btw. Oh, and where&#39;s your permit for that peaceable assembly, citizen? Speedy trial, no excessive bail, due process, assumption of innocence? Not if you&#39;re poor, not if you&#39;re muslim, especially not if you&#39;re brown poor AND muslim.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m betting if anyone came gunning for any of that in your constitution you&#39;d be out in the street, but for some reason the guns thing is just outmoded. Well I think the founders were pretty smart, and they had good reasons for the second amendment, reasons that, like the other amendments, stand the test of time.

    <div class="md"><p>The founders wanted the public armed because they considered it an explicit defense against tyranny. They had no illusions about the nature of humanity and the necessary implication is if you arm everyone the good outnumber the bad. I do not doubt for a second that if they were around, and you showed them the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/">fatal force statistics for the police in this country</a>, they would not say the second amendment had become unnecessary.</p>

<p>Obviously we don&#39;t want individuals with nuclear arms. Just as obviously I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of social pressure behind the idea of disarming people who live in rural areas with predators, or who hunt for a good portion of their calories. Somewhere we should codify what is a good idea for individuals to own. But personally I see no reason to ban a gun, <em>any</em> gun, used by a police force, national guard, or other law enforcement agency within the confines of our country. I also think it&#39;s completely futile to ban something that is easily importable from Mexico, or easily modified at home. Extending magazines require simple tools that anyone has in their garage and a few hours. And we have such a history with all these weapons, and so many, that banning them just moves a few onto the black market. Any law that&#39;s plainly unconstitutional, or unenforceable, or futile is a complete waste of time. You can&#39;t bubble-wrap the world. Guns are a simple technology and impossible to eliminate completely. </p>

<p>I feel the same way about gun laws as I do about shoe checks at the airport: it&#39;s a fucking stupid waste. Time and energy should be spent on doing things that achieve results, not symbolic gestures designed to put a segment of the population back to sleep.</p>

<p>You can also easily stop all the shootings from roadrage etc.</p>

<p>And you can stop selling ammo to kids!</p>

<p>Stopping these obvious things, is not much of a slippery slope. It is the only sensible thing to do. No kids need fucking ARs or to be able to buy ammo when they&#39;re under 18 (or 21 for that matter).</p>

<p>When I was in highschool I knew many &quot;thugs&quot; who had illegal fire arms either from people they knew or they bought them off of the Dark Web when SilkRoad was still a thing.</p>

<p>Most teens don&#39;t know thugs, you must have been in a bad neighborhood. For most teens it will be a scary experience to try to contact some gangbangers to buy illegal guns. They will be too afraid to get mugged etc. </p>

<p>Secondly, after gun-control, the price on illegal weapons will explode (pardon the pun). So this will further discourage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the criminal underworld will still have them, however they will be more expensive and much less of them. This can&#39;t be bad right? Also criminals/gangmembers tend to be shooting mostly at each other so who cares if one gangmember shoots another?

<p>Very bottom chart. Sure homicides reduced but again not by a lot. You even saw a homicide spike after the gun ban in 99 when the gun ban was in 96 for Australia. </p>

<p>Youre telling me France the worlds most gun restricted place on the Earth yet people still some how was able to get fully automatic AK 47s and RPGs. They got a grenade launcher in France. I mean cmon now.</p>

<p>Sure they went through terroist and gun connections but its crazy what a man the the armed forces like Navy Army Marine Corp or Air Force that works in an Armoury can get you. Fully automatic guns and actual military grade gear. Go ahead and ban. These people will be here to sell you your tax dollar equipment back to you. These are schemes still going on now a days. Recently a group was caught doing this but after he made a small fortune and was doing for years at many bases he was stationed at. Fuck in my old military town someone gut the gate and stole a loaded AT4 rocket launcher from the base. Base was shut down and on lock but they person still got away. I wonder where it is now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet the teen in Utah recently skipped guns and went to bombs. Ok another example is in France when someone decided to use a truck on a crowd. Or here in America when someone used a Dodge Charger to hit a mob. Or in New york when someone decieded to drive on the sidewalk and run people over. We have more than enough regulation on cars might as well make them illegal.</p>

<p>Cars kill the most in the US. People talk on their phones, text, go on social media, etc etc. People drive without insurance, license or registration. There are many drivers like that on the road.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/676783/Calais-migrants-armed-dangerous-gun-bullets-wounds-police-France">https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/676783/Calais-migrants-armed-dangerous-gun-bullets-wounds-police-France</a></p>

<p>So the refugees they are willingly taking seemed to be coming into the country very armed. Makes you think if these laws will help protect against more mass shootings like the Charlie Hebdo attack because ALL mass shootings are alike and can be avoided if he skip the tool part and see what the root problem is.</p>

<p>No i didnt &quot;make it&quot;. I live simple, modest, and try not to get things I dont need. Many people now a days are too into consumerism and everything else to distract them than what actually matters. People are willing to pay thousands for a phone but dont care they could have spent that somewhere else. People are willing to buy BMWs but refuse to spend that somewhere else. </p>

<p>People talk about guns and violence instead of addressing why people are resorting to violence instead of trying to make actual change?</p>

<p>Why do people rather loot and rob their own neighborhood stores than actually rob and loot people that are the actual cause of their problems.</p>

<p>People say fuck the police but as far as I know many people call the police when they feel like theyre being wronged even the people that say that. Because of this no one wants to be a police officer thus putting strains on the police force making theme choose calls, over work themselves, and cause further strain on a society that we dont need at all.</p>

<p>Why is income inequal for all? What is the root? Its not guns thats for sure.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it doesn&#39;t work!
I said only the most determined people will have guns. I&#39;d much rather a few gangmembers have guns than my crazy neighbour... I don&#39;t regularly come into contact with gangbangers so I would be much safer. And this is what it would be for most people.<br/>
Secondly, if there is strict guncontrol like in most of the world, then a burglar/robber won&#39;t even have a gun because he knows the homeowner doesn&#39;t likely have one either, so why should he go though the trouble/risk/expense of obtaining one? it&#39;s not necessary. 
This is also why until recently regular police in the UK didn&#39;t even carry guns at all! (they do now afaik due to &#39;terrorism&#39; BS).</p>

<p>So yes, it DOES work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Determined people having guns when they are not allowed to means that gun control doesn&#39;t work (absolutely). Sure it may mostly work because most people obey most laws, but if you wanted to get a gun then you could. I&#39;d rather neither your crazy neighbor or a gang banger have guns, but if they want them they can get them. </p>

<p>If only gang members and determined criminals have guns, why wouldn&#39;t they expand their area of operations? The reason they don&#39;t now if because there is resistance of some sort. Less resistance means lower barriers to expansion. They&#39;d go through the effort to get it because it would be a huge force multiplier and there would be very little chance that it would be matched. </p>

<p>The &#39;terrorism BS&#39; kind of proves my point. Police weren&#39;t carrying guns and then a whole lot of bad shit started happening so they needed to carry guns. Little resistance, bad outcomes, correcting to try and stop more bad outcomes.</p>

<p>Cliche but &#39;guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people&#39; is still true. People kill people mostly due to socioeconomic factors. The way to lower murder is to try and fix these things. Ban guns and leave the underlying situation in a bad spot and people will just kill each other with illegal guns or some other means. </p>

<p>Replied elsewhere but I think that article only includes support and strongly support, not somewhat support. IIRC, it was 51 when including somewhat supports. Maybe I heard the number somewhere else and mixed it up, but it&#39;s near as makes no difference: 39/41 support total 2nd repeal. Over 70% support banning ALL semiautos, which includes basically all handguns.</p>

<p>The Democrats want to take guns. The &quot;no one wants to take your guns&quot; thing is a lie. At bare minimum, nearly 40% of Democrats want to take my guns. That&#39;s basically the same size or bigger of the Bernie wing of the party.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the FBI, in 2014, there were 8,124 total firearm-related homicides in the US, with 5,562 of those attributed to handguns.[7] The Centers for Disease Control reports that there were 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. in 2010.[9] The FBI breaks down the gun-related homicides in 2010 by weapon: 6,009 involved a handgun, 358 involved a rifle, and 1,939 involved an unspecified type of firearm.[10] In 2005, 75% of the 10,100 homicides committed using firearms in the U.S. were committed using handguns, compared to 4% with rifles, 5% with shotguns, and the rest with unspecified firearms.[74]
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#Homicides">Sources</a> and the following subsection dives into [Mass hootings].(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#Mass_shootings">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#Mass_shootings</a>) which goes on to say:
Deadly mass shootings have resulted in considerable coverage by the media. These shootings have represented 1% of all deaths using gun between 1980 and 2008.[115] Although mass shootings have been covered extensively in the media, mass shootings account for a small fraction of gun-related deaths[16] and the frequency of these events had steadily declined between 1994 and 2007. Between 2007 and 2013, the rate of active shooter incidents per year in the US has increased.[17][18]</p>

<p>A cop with a normal bullet proof vest is relatively safe from someone with a pistol, but stands no chance against someone with an AK- unless he is wearing a vest rated 3a with a heavy steel plate in it.

<p>Suggest reading up on that. </p>

<p>Compare the damage an AR-15 and a 9mm handgun can do to the human body: “One looks like a grenade went off in there,” says Peter Rhee, a trauma surgeon at the University of Arizona. “The other looks like a bad knife cut.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bullet from a handgun is—as absurd as it may sound—slow compared to that from an AR-15. It can be stopped by the thick bone of the upper leg. It might pass through the body, only to become lodged in skin, which is surprisingly elastic.</p>

<p>The bullet from an AR-15 does an entirely different kind of violence to the human body. It’s relatively small, but it leaves the muzzle at three times the speed of a handgun bullet. It has so much energy that it can disintegrate three inches of leg bone. “It would just turn it to dust,” says Donald Jenkins, a trauma surgeon at University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cherry picked one thing i said and missed the entire point. I said that in these school/close quarters/public mass shootings, a pistol is just as DEADLY. Yes, obviously, a bigger faster bullet is going to do more visible DAMAGE, but in the situation being referred to, actual damage done doesnt matter. It may look worse to the eye, but either way,  a pistol shot at close range to the head or body is typically going to be deadly. If you&#39;re dead, you&#39;re dead. You can&#39;t be more or less dead.</p>

<p>Again, the rifles that everyone is up in arms about and wants to ban, are the least used guns in these shootings. Just like in my Virginia tech example. As a matter of fact, the same thing took place at Sandy hook. The shooter brought a bushmaster ar15 and a saiga 12 ga shotgun, along with 4 pistols, to the school. He left the shotgun and rifle in the trunk of his car, and shot up the school with the pistols (even though the majority of the bullshit you read nowadays says he shot up the school with the AR...seems pretty fuckin fishy to me).</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/TNKPLoOBaY0">https://youtu.be/TNKPLoOBaY0</a> </p>

<p>Proof that the rifle and shotgun were left in the car. There are tons of initial reports confirming that the pistols were the only weapons used at the school. There are even videos where you can literally see them pulling the rifle out of the trunk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moving goal posts? You derailed this discussion with your first response when you ignored my point. Why is everyone trying to ban/severely limit access to &quot;assault rifles&quot; when that is statistically the least used weapon out of all mass shootings? Or when there are equally as powerful bolt action hunting rifles that shoot the same round? Pistols are used in the majority of shootings and overall have more deaths attributed to them, even though they shoot a smaller round.</p>

<p>People that aren&#39;t educated when it comes to firearms swear like throwing a bolt takes so much longer. It takes a fraction of a second to throw a bolt and chamber the next round, it&#39;s not a fuckin musket that has to be hand loaded with powder.</p>

<p>So, again, if AR style rifles arent the #1 firearm responsible for mass shooting deaths, why is that what everyone is in a frenzy to ban?</p>

I&#39;m not going to continue this discussion after this post because you obviously have no answer, and continue to cherry pick what I&#39;m saying and divert the discussion to prove a point that I never tried to prove.</p>

<p>I never said a rifle round does the same amount of damage to flesh. I said that shooting unarmored humans, from what basically amounts to point blank range, with a pistol, has just as much chance to kill someone as using a rifle. It&#39;s like saying if you threw a grenade into a crowded room, versus a bomb, obviously the bomb will do more collateral damage because it has more force behind it, but at that range, the people are going to die regardless. And since pistols are used much, much more frequently than rifles in these situatuons, I ask again, why are  rifles specifically getting the attention? I doubt you will answer, but maybe the third time is a charm. Good day.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, maybe. You don&#39;t come off that way. </p>

<p>I have answered your question repeatedly, but I will restate the answers as you apparently missed them:</p>

<p>AR-15s are being targeted in particular because they have been used in so very many mass shootings and the populace associates them with mass shootings. Google &quot;mass shootings ar-15s.&quot; I don&#39;t care if you have some youtube videos saying one particular school shooting ddn&#39;t use an AR. A lot of them inarguably did, and, moreover, we&#39;re talking about why they&#39;re being targeted so the only thing that matters is what the populace believes. </p>

<p>Contrary to what you stated, they are much more deadly when striking a &quot;soft fleshy body.&quot; As I showed you, a 9mm slug can be stopped by bone whereas a .223 will turn that bone to dust. </p>

<p>Cops are logically intimidated by them as they&#39;ll punch right through their vests and many people believe law enforcement would have entered scenes of mass shootings if they didn&#39;t know they were totally outgunned. </p>

<p>Ar-!5s can cycle through many rounds per minute, have a high capacity, and reloading is a simple easy process. Maybe you weren&#39;t alive during the last &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban, but the number of rounds a rifle or pistol could hold was a major point in the bill. </p>

Yet you CONTINUE ignoring that, and picking other things I said to try and refute, and then go on to tell me some bullshit like &quot;Google ar 15 mass shootings&quot; as if that is supposed to prove something.

Look at the numbers and tell me why ar15s are the issue if they are only responsible for about 3% of shooting deaths from firearms, while pistols make up over 70%? Deadliness/damage/whatever else you keep whining about is a non-issue because rifles are RARELY USED in comparison. More people still died at the hands of pistols, and more shootings have occurred with pistols.</p>

<p>Yeah, handguns kill more ppl than rifles.</p>

<p>You&#39;re in a thread about kids walking out of school due to <em>school shootings</em>. Asking why people want the <em>Ar-15</em> banned. It&#39;s because <em>Ar-15s</em> have often been recently used in <em>school shootings</em>. </p>

<p>Also the bunch of other reasons I gave you. I stated this already as well, it doesn&#39;t matter what statistics prove or what &quot;the truth&quot; is- <em>it&#39;s what the populace believes that matters</em>. </p>

<p>Maybe we should find out who really killed JFK or who was really behind the obvious psyop in Las Vegas before we give the government a monopoly on &quot;powerful weapons the facilitate death&quot;.

<p><strong>Every semi automatic gun, including semi automatic rifles and most handguns, fires 1 round per trigger pull. That&#39;s why they&#39;re called <em>semi automatic</em>.</strong></p>

<p>The difference between a semi automatic rifle and a semi automatic handgun is that rifles have a higher ammunition capacity, shoot higher caliber rounds, and they&#39;re a hell of a lot easier to accurately aim than a handgun (plus they&#39;re frequently cheaper, and the big/black/scary stereotype helps with the whole terror thing). Handguns are limited in capacity, limited in caliber, have relatively poor accuracy, and require much more training to use to its full potential.</p>

<p>The same is true for rifles though. More people are stabbed with knives or beat to death each year than get killed by rifles. The AR-15 is much better for home defense than a shotgun or handgun. The Sutherland Springs church shooter was stopped by a private citizen with an AR-15.</p>

&quot;We&#39;re trying to keep the weapons out of the Hands of dangerous people&quot;</p>

<p>These extremely, extremely vague goals are what worries most people. Much like the mindless statements you pointed out, they are meaningless. What is a powerful weapon that facilitates death? Any gun can fit that description. Who are the &quot;dangerous people&quot; that we must be worried about? Again, depending on perspective, that can be anyone. I do agree that we need to take steps to provide better care for those suffering mental health issues, but what separates a little situational anxiety from, say, psychosis besides the judgement of another person? You have legit goals, I&#39;m just worried about how you&#39;d try to achieve them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very excellent points. I think we need to consider factors of the weapons like muzzle velocity and energy of the round. We need to consider legitimate applications like hunting as well. If you&#39;re hunting large bears or need defense against bears, a fuckin .22 ain&#39;t gonna do you a lot of good.</p>

<p>By dangerous I mean to say mentally unstable mostly. I think we have to accept that our culture is going to produce violent tragedies regardless of our actions, but we can at least shore those numbers up by researching the issues and limiting the likelihood or effectiveness of attacks. Be it gun, bomb, or poison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting point about the .22- even though it is a rediculously weak round, it is favored by many assassins, for lack of a better word. The bullet actually has a tendency to tumble and cause damage more likely to kill than, say and assault rifle round that might just punch through you doing less damage. To further the point- a .45 caliber round transfers more energy to a human target than a 10mm would, even though the 10mm is much more powerful. So you can see how much of a mess it is to tell the difference between a man-killer round and a legitimate hunting round. The lines get blurry. </p>

<p>I agree that these tragedies are a symptom of our society, and also agree that information is the best way to combat it. We&#39;re at an interesting time where we can share information but for some reason certain people just don&#39;t want to. We also have to beware of labels, which the powers that be seem to be pushing hard. It&#39;s the &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;white nationalists&quot; and &quot;the militant left&quot; we have to worry about. But these groups are made up of real people who turn to radicalism because there is something wrong in their life. Much like the guns, the lines are blurry. But there is an underlying problem that everyone is suffering from to push them to the point of radicalism. If we keep talking, it becomes more and more apparent what connects us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go look at a chart that lists gun murders from the 80&#39;s to the most recent time you can find. Then you can determine yourself if an uptick in gun murders over the last few years would change the trend. The key word is TRENDING. And it looks like I was wrong about mass shootings. The US government uses 3 kills as the minimum for a mass shooting so thanks to major cities like Chicago and Detroit those are trending up. The point still remains that the vast majority of guns are not used in crimes, the majority of gun owners do not commit gun crimes. Most gun murders are related to gang/drug activity in inner cities too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it is. It&#39;s restricting those rights that we currently have. If you have the right to go out and purchase an AR-15 right now, changing it to ban the sale of them is losing rights. Just because it&#39;s only part of a right doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t something you couldn&#39;t previously do, eshrined by the second amendment. </p>

<p>We keep talking about what is and what isn&#39;t taking away rights in the name of safety. What if we &quot;restrict&quot; other rights, such as freedom of religion to just the ones one party felt were safe? Would you be okay with that? What if we restricted speech to outlaw anything that could radicalize people, including anti-government or negative speech towards the government? Would that be losing rights or would it be restricting them for safety?</p>

<p>You are likely to come back with the whole &quot;we are talking about guns&quot; rhetoric here, but we are talking about rights and what it means to restrict/lose them in the name of safety. I know you likely don&#39;t want to approach the topic this way, but it&#39;s a reality you simply are going to have to face.</p>

<p>So what youre suggesting is that I dont need military grade hardware because in the unlikely event that the government decides to attack its own civilians the military which is made of American citizens will defend us?</p>

<p>Seems like youre advocating for the removal of military grade weapons and weapons not intended for self defense or hunting. </p>

<p>No, but they have drones that can sit 1+ miles above your home and very accurately hit you with ordinance. Why cant I get a way of defending myself from that very real possibility? How many handguns or AR15s = 1 SAM?</p>

<p>Of course I think its retarded to get a SAM system to protect myself. </p>

<p>If we really interpret that to mean &quot;Mount a capable military force to challenge the nations standing army&quot; then logic dictates we need to be similarly armed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean if they really wanted to they could be breeding kids by the thousands in some hidden facility and raising them to be stone cold killers. I know that&#39;s some next level super paranoid conspiracy but if the government really wanted to they prob could, and if that happened and we didnt have guns then were fucked. Also besides that I&#39;d say that guns are less of a defense in an actual government kicks down everyone&#39;s door scenario and more of a preventative to stop the government from being able to cross the line at all in how they handle our rights. Like for example if they tried to limit freedom of speech to a point that we become outraged, the simple threat of an armed militia could prevent the government from actually pushing that line in the first place, as the last thing they want is armed, unpeaceful riots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of the constitution is that it should be very difficult to change. We don’t want tyrants strolling on in and convincing a generation to “get with the times” and give up their rights. </p>

<p>I plan on shooting anyone who might try to do harm me or my family. I don’t want to, but <em>plan</em> on the possibility that one day that may include my own government. That’s the very point of the 2nd amendment.</p>

<p>Let me illuminate a few things for you. You’re right, many people in the Wild West carries guns. However, gun violence was very low (despite how many movies you’ve seen). You know why? Because people had a pretty good understanding that if they pulled a gun on someone they stood a pretty high risk of getting shot and killed themselves. Makes sense right? Now look at a city like Chicago. Most strict gun laws in the country. Would you assume that means low gun crime? You’d be wrong, it’s actually the worst because of the same logic. If I’m a criminal, I know I’ve got an advantage over a place where I can be pretty certain my victims aren’t going to be carrying a weapon. Now extend the same logic to the government.</p>

<p>Number of countries with a constitutional right to bear arms: 1
Number of countries with a constitutional right to free speech: 1</p>

<p>That’s not a coincidence.</p>

<p>The way you Americans go on about free speech you&#39;d swear the rest of the world was living in some Orwellian dystopia. They&#39;re not.</p>

<p>Let me illuminate some things for you. If you think owning a gun is going to stop the US government from kicking down your door and doing what they want then you&#39;re sorely mistaken. What are you going to do? Kill every federal officer yourself? Come on.</p>

<p>This weird fantasy of evil people or the government coming to get you and you being able to shoot your way out has got to do. It&#39;s delusional.</p>

<p>Constitutions are supposed to be hard to change. And it&#39;s good that they are. But that&#39;s not an argument against any specific change that should be made. Its the equivalent of saying &quot;no. That&#39;s too hard to do so I won&#39;t do it!&quot;</p>

<p>I feel sorry for you to be honest. You must live in so much fear. I&#39;ve never felt the need to own a gun or any weapon and I&#39;m thankful that most people around me don&#39;t have one. That&#39;s not the society I want to live in.</p>

<p>Total Individualism has failed. It has raised generations of nut bags who think they need an automatic rifle to be safe.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not alone. The world isn&#39;t out to get you. Put down the weapon and break bread. If everyone in america stopped looking out for number one all of the time it&#39;d be a much nicer and safer place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me tell you a little story.</p>

<p>There’s a heartbreaking tale about a Jewish man who lost his whole family to the holocaust. He was the lone survivor. He was one of the many who believes the Nazi’s would never escalate to the point they did and they went along trying to appease them step by step, including handing over their weapons. I know about this story because he made it his mission to spread it as widely as he could after he learned that another ghetto, who collectively decided to resist and not hand over their arms, held out against every resource the Germans had to extract them from their homes for over 4 months. Just that one ghetto. He lamented for the rest of his life what could have been avoided if all the Jews had the courage and foresight to do what that one ghetto had done.</p>

<p>You have no foresight and you’re mistaking your ignorance for virtue. And I’ve got news for you dood, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/R9aikuX.jpg">free speech is in pretty short supply</a> right now in some surprising places. </p>

<p>Law abiding citizens want guns in case they need to defend themselves from people who want to harm them. That&#39;s not fucked up, it&#39;s self defense. You say get with the times, but the fact is many people look at your country and feel that it is fucked up. An abundance of surveillance cameras, or detaining political activists for trying to interview a controversial figure do not fit in with American ideas on how to live. You know what&#39;s fucked up? That the mass exploitation of children in your country didn&#39;t spark people to act. I don&#39;t mind if someone keeps an inanimate object in case they need to defend themselves. Violence is a reasonable response to someone who intends to victimize you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah. Hold back on the assumptions there buddy. The UK is definitely moving towards a police state but I fail to see what that has to do with me or guns laws in america, since I&#39;m neither British nor was I ever defending their government.</p>

<p>Both the US and the UK is fucked up for different reasons. I don&#39;t want to live in either.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to convince you guns are unnecessary and you&#39;re never going to convince me that they are. I grew up in a country with minimal gun violence, extremely restricted access and well, guess what? I feel safe. I feel happy. I&#39;m free to go where I please and say what I want and I&#39;m not so insecure that I need to back it up with a tool for murder.</p>

<p>I could ask all other 4.5 million residents if they feel the same way and I&#39;m pretty sure 99% would agree with me. The rest would be farmers and seasonal hunters. And I support their rights to have access to the firearms they require for those jobs. So long as they go through the proper channels and meet whatever criteria we have in place.</p>

<p>But keep going on with the whataboutism thats irrelevant to the whole thing.</p>

<p>Is my government perfect? Far from it. They&#39;re as corrupt as any other. But there&#39;s no agenda here to institute a police state and take away the freedoms of individuals. That&#39;s some weird post colonial fugue that America sadly never got over.</p>

<p>But whatever. If you want to live in a country where people are armed to the teeth and paranoid enough to think they need to carry around something that murders people to feel safe then that&#39;s your prerogative.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re what, Irish?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The UK is definitely moving towards a police state but I fail to see what that has to do with me or guns laws in america</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was assumption of mine based on your post history. I saw that you have posted in UK news threads and used the word &#39;bin&#39;. But now I see that you are in fact Irish(little ironic you think the US needs to get with the times). It&#39;s not what it has to do with American gun laws, but what it has to do with people from other countries thinking that they know what will work in the US to reduce gun violence. Many people from other countries have their own major problems that they overlook or fail to consider. Where countries don&#39;t have as many problems you&#39;re almost always going to see a society that is better off in general. A lot of people don&#39;t realize that there are plenty of countries out there with stricter gun laws than the US with more gun crime. There are many variables that influence the rate of gun crime, that&#39;s just a fact. You cannot ignore those variables and pretend that gun control is the deciding factor, and that&#39;s not just my opinion but the opinion of several statisticians as well.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not going to convince you guns are unnecessary and you&#39;re never going to convince me that they are. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re making the assumption that I view them as a necessity when really I just support peoples right to own them, I don&#39;t own any guns myself. I view them as a tool that serves a purpose. I also view the proponents of gun control to be ignorant in a few ways, mostly that they are ignorant about crime and gun statistics, and that when proposing gun control as a solution they make the mistake of using a univariate analysis based on gun control alone rather than a more accurate analysis that takes into consideration the many variables that influence gun crime. I also think that many people are ignorant of the many violations the US and other countries have committed against their citizens, which is the entire purpose for the second amendment in the first place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But keep going on with the whataboutism thats irrelevant to the whole thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not irrelevant, you live in a different country, you are ignorant of what it is like to live here, and you are ignorant of the realities people in this country face. Case in point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But whatever. If you want to live in a country where people are armed to the teeth and paranoid enough to think they need to carry around something that murders people to feel safe then that&#39;s your prerogative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go do a comparison between crime in Ireland and crime in the US. The US has much more crime per capita in many different categories across the board. You call it paranoia, I say you are ignorant of the realities that many Americans face. People live in crime ridden areas, and they want the option to defend themselves. Some people live in areas where crime is less prevalent but still there is a possibility they could become victims of crime and so they wish to have the ability to defend themselves too. That&#39;s without considering the actual purpose of the second amendment.</p>

<p>Another thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>something that murders people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firearms are inanimate objects. Maybe in Ireland tree sprites come out of the woods and possess things, but in America we don&#39;t believe that kind of nonsense(joking). Sick people kill others, not inanimate objects. You can argue that if there were no guns people wouldn&#39;t get shot, but you try working out the logistics of confiscating over 300 million guns while trying to prevent black markets from rising up at the same time. 
Could gun control help? Possibly but I and many others are opposed to ceding any ground to idiots who think the solution is a stream of endless regulation while continuing to neglect that gun murders have been trending down for some time, and that most gun crimes are committed with illegally obtained guns. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you&#39;re all fucking nuts though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think you as an individual are uninformed and have not really thought this issue through.</p>

More laws for banning weapons are put in place.  People still get killed.  Eventually the last step is to take away guns from everyone.  Guess what?  People will still get killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>valid viewpoint. some would say it&#39;s not an issue about law enforcement though. if somebody wanted to commit a mass killing right now, it&#39;s very easy for them to, and if it gets to the point where law enforcement is called its usually too late. even a response time of a couple min can be deadly.</p>

<p>so it&#39;s like.. how do we stop a mass killing? an in progress one, more guns by trusted ppl to subdue the assailant is one way. another is better screening/mental care. Maybe another is decreased access to high capacity magazines and long rifles.</p>

<p>I think all of these options make logical sense, but they all have huge confounding issues. better mental care is always said, but our healthcare is already so damn expensive and inefficient. guns in teachers hands sounds reasonable to some, but can we really advocate for increased funds for that when teachers already make shit pay (leasing to many apathetic, unqualified teachers), our scores compared to other countries is terrible, and attrition is super high? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge complex issue and somebody that postulates they know <strong>the solution</strong> is full of shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that there&#39;s next to no way of stopping all mass killings.  The only way to limit them, outside of becoming a total police state, is to make sure potential warning signs are followed up on.  Ensuring that all applicable data is added to the NICS and allowing a process for citizens to challenge said data if there&#39;s a possibility of it being faulty is absolutely necessary.  That includes any potential &quot;firearms restraining order&quot; laws that may be passed.</p>

<p>As for&quot;arming&quot; teachers; simply getting rid on gun free zones and allowing faculty that already have CCW permits to carry if they choose makes done sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strict gun control is ineffective. They will either have to take away ALL guns (criminals will find a way to obtain some) or actually back the laws they already have on the books.</p>

<p>For instance, there have been multiple incidents where domestic violence abusers retained their guns or obtained new ones even though their convictions or orders of protection were supposed to prevent them from having guns.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a law on the books, federal and usually state. Does the federal government or the states put teeth behind those laws and charge and convict those abusers who violate those laws? Almost never. Should they? Of course. It&#39;s an easy law to follow. Either they were in possession of guns or not. If they are, then they should be charged and convicted.</p>

<p>Point being- CRIMINALS DON&#39;T CARE ABOUT LAWS. THAT&#39;S WHY THEY ARE CRIMINALS AND NOT &quot;LAW ABIDERS&quot;.</p>

<p>So when you take away guns from law abiding people, you leave them defenseless against criminals who will use guns despite the laws against them.</p>

<p>Strict security would help dissuade people from trying to mass murder. There&#39;s no point in trying to shoot up a place if the fast defense response is going to ruin their master plan of devastation before it barely gets started.</p>

<p>Better access to mental healthcare would help dissuade people from trying to mass murder. We are making strides, but we have ways to go.</p>

<p>Better proactive responses to problem situations would help dissuade people from trying to mass murder (30+ calls to law enforcement for the FL shooter and warning tips to the FBI were freaking neon signs).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess if thats what you want to believe. My school walked out to remember those who died in Parkland. I don’t believe in taking away anyone’s right to own a gun, but that right shouldn’t be more important than a minor’s right to live. 
But, we need to address this problem with an open mind and see that this is an issue of loose gun laws and mental illnesses. Yes Nikolas Cruz could have killed with a knife, but it is a lot harder to effectively kill a large amount of people with say a knife or a bat before getting tackled and overpowered by other people. At the end of the day, weapons are weapons, it’s just some are more effective at killing than others, which is why those that are the most efficient should be harder to obtain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, time to remind everyone that banning 1 specific type of weapon does not equal &quot;taking my guns&quot; or &quot;being stripped of my rights&quot;.</p>

<p>This argument is nothing more than slippery slope fallacy.</p>

<p>Also, a few people with pea shooters aren&#39;t going to accomplish anything against a government with tanks, armored vehicles, attack helicopters, drones, fight jets, missiles, chemical weapons....and the list goes on.</p>

<p>Heck....even for those people that we know the government killed....how many even saw their attacker?  They can hack your car, poison your food, arrange an &quot;accident&quot;, crash your plane....so many ways they can kill you, and having a gun won&#39;t matter for any of them.</p>

<p>For a bunch of reasons, one of which is fucked up rules of engagement. If the gov went full totalitarian they wouldnt abide by the same rules we see in Afghanistan. </p>

<p>It would be more like Vietnam, large scale bombing and use of incendiary and chemical weapons. </p>

<p>I can tell you right now that Steve in accounting is not going underground and living in a hole in the ground for several years. Steve didnt grow up under brutal conditions and started fighting in a war at 14. Steve has a hard time hiking and camping for more than a few days. Steve has never had to ruck 50 miles with a 100 lb pack. Steve is a fatass who like shooting guns, Steve will never fight against the government because then he wouldnt have access to cable TV. </p>

<p>Americans are not the same breed of person as a afghani goat herder or a Vietcong. Thats a good thing, not a detriment to us. </p>

<p>THe reality is 99% of the population is too apathetic and ill trained to do anything but protest. </p>

<p>The other 1% will be tagged by drones flying too high for an AR15 to hit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The founders could have never envisioned printing presses capable of churning out thousands of tabloids a minute. They never could have envisioned unrestricted and unregulated mass spreading of information from uneducated, unlicensed, and non-property-owning people claiming to be &quot;journalists&quot; through the Internet. We need <em>common sense</em> speech reform.</p>

<p>I support the First Amendment. Look, I grew up around newspapers. Reading is a part of my traditions and heritage as much as any of you. But the Founders never could have dreamed of the ability to rapidly spread dangerous and inaccurate ideas! The First applies to manual block printing presses, not fully automated machine presses that churn out thousands of copies per minute! Fake news is destroying lives and the internet is fueling the deaths of thousands across the country due to hate speech. <em>We need to do something</em>. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m proposing <em>common sense</em> speech regulation. Nobody needs more than 20 mB of data per month to send messages to friends or do business! The government needs to require strict license programs for anyone who wants to be a journalist. Finally, we need background checks for anyone who wants to make a newspaper, commentary show, or blog. </p>

<p>After all, it&#39;s for the children!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing? Perhaps you do not realize it but this youth are a direct threat to you and your families safety,prosperity,and future both mentally,physically,and spiritually. I would say dangerous - not amazing.
60% of millennials actually want socialism. Socialism,Leads to Marxism,and then to Communism. The straigh transition from capitalist to communist doesn&#39;t work. You have to soft kill the patient. These younger generations do not want to work and hate capitalism. These are the ones that got trophies for doing squat and who were never told &#39;NO&quot;,and never held responsible for their own actions. Free everything sounds great but too stupid to realize what happens when the people who are pushing the wheelbarrow get sick of it and dump those riding in it out? 
 This has been a 3 to 4 generation slow frog in boiling water agenda at play. They have been brainwashing kids to be brownshirt fascists all through the 3 stages of &quot;education&quot;, more like indoctrination. 
All that time waiting for the older smarter generations to die off. Then it&#39;s only a matter of time before the numbers start to even out and those mislead start to outnumber the ones that understand how communism ends. This is why True History has been replaced with the false song of globalism in schools. Now in their defense these younger generations (not all all ignorant,gullible,lazy and naive) are bombarded by teachers,movies,music,fake news,etc to get their daily does of everything anti-American poisoning. It becomes so saturated that eventually many fall into it. Repeat a lie enough and it becomes true. Saul Alinsky&#39;s Rules of Radicals 101. The flip side to that is there are a ton that are too far gone and cannot be reached and that is where it becomes dangerous - NOT amazing.</p>

<p>Even Karl Marx has said that we should never give up our fire arms. &quot;The workers must be armed and organized. The whole proletariat must be armed at once with muskets, rifles, cannon and ammunition… Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>The people who need to be disarmed are the military who murders innocents abroad. Decent citizens owning fire arms are not the cause of gun violence in this world. I&#39;d even say that we should disarm the police like the UK has before we forcibly take away decent citizens&#39; Constitutional rights. </p>

<p>You gotta understand, however, that this country has been at war since 9/11. We have a fresh generation of young adults attending college, driving, starting families and beginning to raise the new generation who have never lived in a country where they knew any freedom as children, were not at war, were not completely coddled by nanny state measures and sensibilities. They have no notions of these things you value to the extent you would die for.</p>

<p>The problem is everyone is terrified. They&#39;re terrified of being scathed. They&#39;re terrified of independence, freedom and self determination. They&#39;re so concerned with what others have that they might not have that they fail to recognize what they do have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this the fucking truth though? All I remember about his election was how he would bring forth a new America free from racial prejudice and all that has happened after his 2 terms was everyone being more divided. I&#39;m not even sure where the blame lies, I think Obama has something to do with it but I&#39;m sure there are outside forces at play. To add to it, 3rd wave feminism rising in the middle of his term and reaching it&#39;s full popularity just about the time of Hillary&#39;s candidacy seem entirely orchestrated.  They used the intersectional angle to group all &quot;marginalized groups&quot; with a heavier focus on women (half the population) to promote having a female candidate. Well that shit didn&#39;t work because they didn&#39;t anticipate a growth of rational people from both sides of the isle going out of their way to call them out [quick aside, the one thing that seems to bring all sides together is intolerance for bullshit]. Now that Trump has won, as you out it, the twilight period is in effect and now there are still hardcore elements out there that are very motivated by manufactured racism. </p>

<p>I mean there were warnings about this dude, but he could still buy a gun. The shooter in Texas <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/06/politics/texas-church-shooting-bad-conduct-discharge/index.html">should have been banned</a> but nobody bothered to actually put him on the list.</p>

<p>I mean, you have a valid point about warning signs. But blocking people who exhibit red flags is quite literally gun control, and any attempt to block people like that from going to a gunshow and purchasing a gun without a background check is shouted down by people who for some reason think it&#39;s unreasonable.</p>

The same people calling for gun control are the ones saying cops shoot innocent people and yet they want only the “corrupt” police to be armed??  I’ll tell you what, if there was an active shooter anywhere near me they’d be dead before they could kill anyone....so until the root causes (mental health issues) of these shootings are addressed we need armed citizens now more than ever...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is really not though.  You walk out you miss your tests or face your disciplinary action or whatever you face when missing a day of school.  You&#39;re there to prepare for your career not make political statements.</p>

<p>Regardless, without fail, the majority who walkout do so because their friends are doing it, their parents are saying they should, or they just want a free day.  Very few are actually protesting anything, which is why I find it a poor means of civil change.</p>

<p>Also, no offense but a teenagers opinion on the world is, frankly, naive.  Go provide for a family pay a mortgage, navigate the wilds of the workforce THEN have your protests.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly three paragraphs more than I honestly care about the subject to be honest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At 49 years old you didn&#39;t go to school with weekly stories of kids your age being shot in the face with military type weapons sold legally to clinically insane people. You didn&#39;t have the FBI and other federal agencies drop the ball regularly and allow these psycho&#39;s access to high cap mags and the ability to walk straight into school and start massacring your best friends.  You grew up in a different time, and you have no way of understanding what these kids are going through in their daily lives.  What I find more &quot;mind boggling&quot; is that teenagers today can organize a NATIONWIDE protest at 18 years old or younger. Pretty fucking clever. That shit was never done in the 80s or 90s. The times they are a changing. These kids vote in 2020. And you&#39;re going to see a whole generation of kids that want safety over their uncle&#39;s hobby on the weekends. </p>

<p>How else do you get people to believe to towers collapsed upon themselves from burning jet fuel? That “mentally unstable” radicalized youth can carry out massacres with military level precision. That nearly every war fought has been justified and necessary. Lies on top of manipulation on top of more lies on top of more manipulation. They need to control the narrative so the same five corporations buy up all the MSM media outlets putting out the same message over and over. They keep you distracted, entertained and consuming on 24 hour basis. Your own mind is their greatest weapon but also their biggest fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Joe Rogan once tweeted about how our country has a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem. He&#39;s not inaccurate, but I believe we have three separately identifiable problems that unfortunately evolved together to form a huge clusterfuck of a problem today. We have a rising mental health problem that still gets a stigma that it&#39;s a choice rather than a disease; an evil multi-billion dollar collaboration between lawmakers, healthcare professionals, and pharmaceutical companies that are largely uninterested in other sustainable treatment methods due to higher financial profits from constantly pumping the public with pills full of serious long-term psychological side effects; and finally we have a firearm ownership issue that is a little more complicated than the first two problems mainly due to the possibility of losing a constitutional right held by doubtful citizens who are understandably cautious of being disarmed by an untrustworthy government that has on their easiest disposal, the best military-grade equipment and heavily armed military personnel the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>We like to take a look back at history to help us solve current issues, but this are three unprecedented problems that we humans have never seen before. Finding the solution won&#39;t be easy, nor would it be quick. Things will probably get worse before it gets better. But publicly open discussions need to be started so we can start putting pieces together for a realistic solution that the majority can agree with. I don&#39;t have kids but we owe it to the younger generation to leave this place better than we found it. Right now it&#39;s a fucking mess. No ground-breaking innovations with cellphones, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, or any scientific technology can possibly make up for an increasing likelihood that in the future there is a good chance your kid might not get home that day. That&#39;s a very grim reality that we should all be losing sleeping from.</p>

<p>Here is a website that shows a slowly increasing number of mass shootings and children (age 0-17) harmed or killed by gun violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I recall correctly Ron Paul predicted this. It&#39;s a repeat of history. Soon we&#39;ll have another socialist party rise and the left will push in a man who will be exactly like Hitler the stage is set for it. Even if Trump gets re-elected they will bide their time till after he is gone to put that individual in place. That individual will burn the Constitution on the front steps of the White House.</p>

<p>If the US doesn&#39;t end up in civil war it is a guarantee at least 100 million Americans will die. Those who do not want to obey a socialist radical system will be killed for not supporting it just like how Adolf killed everyone who didn&#39;t support his socialist paradise.</p>

<p>You conquer a nation by separating people and dividing them by class and race. Which has been very well done by the Democratic President the last 8 years. He has made white people demonetized to the point white people on MSM and to some people are no longer deemed human and that true &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; is a world without whites.  </p>

<p>The world has been separated by class this is how socialism comes in. When you get people to believe all the rich men are evil and against you and they should be taxed that is in itself a rich man trick. The rich will become politicians and bureaucrats and there will be no &quot;greed&quot; they will control the money and you will get what they chose to give you. </p>

<p>True, real democracy and capitalism is a threat to the wealthy for the fact it generates wealth and wealth can be spread. Socialism guarantees wealth is controlled by the government and those in power it is a great thing for the 1% for socialism to take over because they can control everything in the background and all the money. They will always remain rich and you will always remain poor socialism is always the end game.</p>

<p>The world will end when the US falls to socialism. Many sensible leaders know this, even though I heavily disagree with Communism, Putin understands history and Russia hates socialism, there is a video I recall Putin talking about how the US must always remain a true democracy for the balance of the world and if it was to fall to Socialism he would rather wipe out the US than let it fall to socialism like Germany. Putin&#39;s friend who served in the Kremlin mention if the US wanted war with Russia it would have to fall to Socialism and Russia understands very well you never trust a Socialist, Russia made the mistake of trusting Adolf they would never trust or allow another massive socialist state to exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think <em>all weapons</em> is the goal. That’s certainly not possible. However, i think the goal is to eliminate all unnecessary weapons that are more likely to produce a high body count. Idc if a mass shooting was done with a glock, the point is an AR-15 or something similar produces a greater <em>chance</em> to produce a higher body count. And if everyone who is against banning assault rifles explains that we need them to fight the government, I’ll just say: “Well...you were just explaining how the entire VT shooting was committed with just handguns...won’t those do the same damage against the government if that’s what you’re claiming?” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in England and no one has guns here. Apart from farmers. So it&#39;s an issue I&#39;m detached from, but likewise, I see what a society is like without guns, and I can say conclusively that it is safer for children and members of the public in general. If I walked down the street knowing people around me were armed it would give me great anxiety. </p>

<p>Knives, gasoline and trucks all serve a purpose. You could make that argument with anything. I could use a tampon as a weapon if I really wanted to. The point is guns are specifically engineered people killers. Nobody has massacred innocent school children with knives or trucks. The way I see it, wouldn&#39;t you give up some of your freedom for the sake of the safety of innocent people? I know I would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that Pandora&#39;s box is already wide open. There are hundreds of millions of guns in the US. They absolutely cannot be accounted for if they are required to be turned in. The criminals will keep using their guns, like they already do, and now innocent people will be helpless to defend themselves. </p>

<p>China had a series of knife and hammer attacks on school children a few years back, killing dozens and injuring dozens more. A killer is a killer is a killer. </p>

<p>I would happily give up all guns if every single guns was destroyed, including the ones police use. But we all know the police in America would never give their guns up. I&#39;m not suggesting a battle or civil war at all. History has repeatedly shown who the biggest killers of innocent, unarmed people are, it&#39;s not that hard to figure out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be hesitant to draw comparisons to the holocaust for any reason. I think the likelihood of a country like the UK, most western countries in fact, to be overtaken by a totalitarian dictatorship is very unlikely. The general level of education is so good that a dictator would struggle to gain support. People are very proud of democracy, shallow as it may be in its current form. The risk of an invasion from outside entities is pretty much nulled by the current nuclear state of the planet. Even if we all had guns, first of all the ration of extra deaths compared to the risk of being taken over as a nation is very slim and so morally not right to arm ourselves for that reason. Even if it did happen and we had guns, it would still be a bloody mess. </p>

<p>The round up and elimination of the banned guns will be relatively easy.  Make any violation of the ban--mere possession or the attempt possess banned guns or ammo--a strict 20 year prison sentence with no parole.  You&#39;ll see gun crime clear up in a hurry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In that case the 1st amendment would only apply to hand-cranked printing presses. Miller and Heller basically say the 2nd amendment applies to common weapons that are suitable for military use, which oddly enough might not include muskets anymore, but almost certainly does include semi-automatic rifles. </p>

<p>How that works is the bullet isn&#39;t traveling fast enough to break through bones so they bounce off of them. What many rounds have done is go into the body and then the bounce around a bit hitting more organs than they would of hit if they have more power.</p>

<p>Its part of the reason hunters don&#39;t want to use smaller arms because it can ruin the meat of what you shot.</p>

<p>Check out this article. It has insight from an army medical doctor comparing the injuries from high caliber weapons compared to smaller arms. He has seen first hand that the assault rifles shatter bone and the fragments are sent through out the body cavity causing much greater damage. That’s before you factor in hollow points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea actually, you do. Thats kinda what the whole &quot;the right of the people to keep and bare arms shal not be infringed&quot; part of the second amendment means. It doesn&#39;t say &quot;the right of the people to keep and bare arms shal not be infringed unless someone really bad does something really bad.&quot;</p>

<p>We have the right to keep and bare arms because the government had just fraught a &quot;well regulated militia&quot; and while they realised that a militia was &quot;necessary to the security of a free state&quot; they also realised that that militia could also be used against the people. Because of this the people need the right to keep and bare arms as well.</p>

<p>Now for some quotes:</p>

<p>“When a government betrays the people by amassing too much power and becoming tyrannical, the people have no choice but to exercise the original rights of self defense – to fight the government.” – Alexander Hamilton</p>

<p>“The ultimate authority resides in the people, and that if the federal government got too powerful and overstepped its authority, then the people would develop plans of resistance and resort to arms.” – James Madison</p>

<p>“The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.” – Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>“This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.” – Abraham Lincoln</p>

<p>Weather you agree with it or not, the founding fathers wrote the second ammendment so that we would have the arms needed to defend from or even overthrow the government, this includes AR15s with 100 round .223 capacity magazines.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The First amendment does not protect you from shouting &quot;FIRE&quot; in a crowded theater when you don&#39;t believe there is a fire, this is true. But can you think of any other cases where the FIRST amendment is ignored? How about the 3rd, 4th, or 5th?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Second Amendment does not prohibit ALL regulation of guns. Do you think Bazookas are legal? .50 caliber machine guns? 105 Howitzers? We may need them to &quot;overthrow&quot; the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In theory the Second Amendment does prohibit exactly that. &quot;The right of the people to keep and bare arms shal not be infringed&quot; is pretty clear on that. Now, in reality, Bazookas are actually legal, you only need to register and pay tax for them. </p>

<p>.50 caliber machine guns as well as all other automatic firearms, are not legal to the general public, but you can get a licence to purchase and own them. </p>

<p>105 Howitzers I&#39;m not exactly sure on that but I am reading that in some places you can in fact own them too.</p>

<p>What is interesting to me is why people think that 100 rounds in one magazine is some how more dangerous than 100 rounds in ten, 10 round magazines. Or four, 30 rounders. Even if we get rid of magazines and only allow 5 round bolt action rifles (which are generally the &quot;acceptable&quot; guns). If someone walks in with a bolt action rifle and 100 rounds in a bag, they are no less dangerous than if they had an AR-15, AK47 variant, M4 variant, or any other rifle with 100 rounds.</p>

<p>If your goal is to remove the danger, then we need to get rid of every single gun. There is no &quot;is this safe? is that acceptable?&quot; it has to be either &quot;all guns are protected by our rights and we can have any gun we want&quot; OR &quot;Every gun needs to be gone, No more beat cops having guns, no more BB guns, nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, Just like you are prohibited from yelling &quot;Fire&quot; in a crowded theater unless you believe there is a fire due to the massive risk to others safety. You can be prohibited from owning firearms if you are a risk to others. the key here however is that YOU must be a risk to others. It is not a firearms fault that you want to harm people, and it is not my fault that you hurt people. So why take it out on me and on Firearms?</p>

if you think the military could stomp out an insurgency in a rural part of America such as, say, Appalachia, you’re crazy.

<p>I respect your opinion on guns and your beliefs, but not your attitude. It is not &quot;mind boggling&quot; to want a different level of gun control than the current level of gun control.

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible to restrict access to guns. There are more and less intelligent ways to do it.  The restrictions do affect a person&#39;s probability of being able to obtain a weapon, both legally and illegally.</p>

<p>Nobody can just decide they want to do an illegal thing - they have to have the opportunity. Nuclear weapons are illegal, and the only black markets for nuclear weapons were in North Korea, Pakistan, Iran, former Soviet Russia, and those were shut down as far as you and I are concerned. AR 15s used to be banned. It&#39;s possible you could have obtained one back during the assault weapons ban, but it would have been much more difficult, with a much higher chance of failure.</p>

<p>Nobody thinks gun free zones protect anything other than a person&#39;s right not to be intimidated by law abiding gun owners. To protect from criminals getting access to guns, you need restrictions on markets.</p>

<p>My whole thing with it, is these KIDS aren’t even old enough to go to Walmart and fill out the paperwork on getting a shotgun so there is 0 way they know anything about gun laws regulations or the process of legally acquiring a firearm. </p>

<p>So underage folks who are ignorant to an issue are marching saying take away rights we have that we don’t understand. </p>

<p>When I was 18 I went and purchased a handgun. I went to a shop and presented my ID, 20 minutes later I left with a gun. </p>

<p>Vermont has some of the laxest gun laws in the country and they are resoundingly liberal</p>

It&#39;s democracy. When the majority is smart, you get smart laws, and when the majority is stupid, you get stupid laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from a country that doesn&#39;t really have any guns, I don&#39;t get the obsession. So what if it was part of the constitution, times change and so should laws. What do you think would happen if the government was completely corrupt and wanted to kill all of you? You think your ar15s would stop a lazy old 500lb bomb? What about a nuke? What about biological weapons? They could just poison the water supply, stop all essential services, stop the food supply and there&#39;s nothing the public could do about it, job done. This would kill the majority of people. It would take alot of bad folks in the government and military for this ridiculous scenario to occur but there&#39;s no way any militia/ group of individuals could defeat the military anyway. You have the most powerful military in the world. I understand the complexities with all the gun crime and with all the guns that are already circulating in the system, id be hesitant to get rid of them as well. There&#39;s just no point in arming yourself against the government, theyre too powerful. On another note, I don&#39;t like the idea of teachers having guns but if I was one of the students of a school shooting, I&#39;d be praying my teacher was armed and I had a little hope of survival rather than being murdered in cold blood in my classroom. </p>

Instead they&#39;re being brainwashed with progressive propaganda, so as you said, they are literally marching and begging to have constitutional rights taken away.

(Hijack and fire) The second amendment is long overdue for some serious reviews as to what should be allowed and not, who can own and who cannot.  Reasonable rules and regulations do not mean elimination, it means public safety is needing a little push in the right direction.  You don&#39;t need guns that can spray bullets, they aren&#39;t for &quot;protection&quot; in any definition of the word.  And if you want to get technical &quot;well regulated militia&quot; doesn&#39;t mean any insane lunatic should be afforded the same access as someone who is well rounded...

    <div class="md"><p>There is so much wrong with this I&#39;m not even sure where to start. First, they aren&#39;t siding with the establishment. The establishment has constantly sided with the NRA in opposing and blocking almost any meaningful gun reform. This is, actually, an anti-establishment. Or, at least, anti-the-dominate-side of the establishment.</p>

<p>Second, most of these kids aren&#39;t calling for all guns to be gone.</p>

<p>You have to realize that a lot of people view the second 
amendment is ridiculously outdated.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, at the time it was written, the fastest reloading was about 15 seconds to reload a single shot musket, and about a minute for the more accurate rifle. Those were the commonly available arms of the day. It was widely considered that a single person with a bowie knife was far more dangerous than a single person with a musket or rifle. Let that sink in, a man with a knife was more capable of killing many people than a man with a gun.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m torn on the matter. I get that a well-armed citizenry would be harder to handle for a tyrannical government, but with the way guns are now, it is far easier for citizens to become victims of tyrannical individuals. The idea of the second amendment is for safety from the government, but at some point we have to accept that the safety from other individuals who may deprive of us <em>life</em> outweighs that.</p>

<p>And I think most sane people agree to a matter of degrees. I&#39;ve only really debated with one person who thinks that the second amendment protects the right to own nuclear weapons. Most people who consider themselves literal constitutionists struggle with this coming up with ridiculous arguments why they don&#39;t count as arms.</p>

<p>And this is much like these kids. I think the majority opinion is to put a restrictions on the type of weapons that are commonly used in these kind of mass shootings, and to expand background checks. While it is certainly a significant group, it is still a minority that wants to confiscate all guns. Most just want the expansion of what is considered not reasonable for an individual to own (like how we treat nuclear weapons now) to more things, or to actually implement meaningful background checks to help keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn&#39;t have them. So it is unfair to claim these kids want a removal of the right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will just say this - almost everyone at that school knew why this happened, and those people have to know they are in part guilty for that taking place.  The reasons why this happens ought to be obvious.  It doesn&#39;t help that fascists (the white nationalist type) are coddled and liberal society has no answer or willingness to fight fascism; indeed I believe the powers that be are perfectly fine with white nationalists as a tool to suppress resistance, and to direct ire at the wrong targets and propagate a moronic worldview.</p>

<p>It really isn&#39;t about the guns, it&#39;s about coming to a consensus for more threats, more terror, and to justify the regime and social hierarchy enforced by the school system and by the present society.  If this was about guns as a defense against tyranny, we would ask why the people who are most vulnerable, who actually have their rights and dignity stripped away from them, are the first ones to lose their freedom - who have, at least legally, already lost their freedom and live as legal sub-persons.  And when you look at what happens, TPTB don&#39;t really care whether those people have a gun and maybe shoot a few dozen people; they&#39;re more interested in making sure such people stay in their designated social rank, that they are denied meaningful employment, that they cannot defend themselves in any legal manner whatsoever against any aggression, that they are conditioned into a state of learned helplessness.  Great expense is taken to make sure the underclasses stay in their place, and that the underclasses tear each other apart and internalize their place in the greater hierarchy, and their place in the hierarchy amongst the lower orders of society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>✔ Enact Gun-Free School Zones (1990)
✔ Your children are now getting shot to death at school because good guys with guns are banned
✔ Brain wash your children to disarm everyone.
✔ Your rights have been infringed &amp; you are now fucked. The elites of the world have won. Enjoy your future. History repeats itself, civilizations rise and fall, ours will fall unless you stand up and protect your rights for the present and the future. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>✔ Enact Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Introduced in the Senate as S.3266 by <strong>Joe Biden(Democrat)</strong> on October 27, 1990. <strong>Ban guns that could protect your children from said ban guns.</strong></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>✔ <strong>Rick Scott(Republican)</strong> stated his support of raising the minimum age to purchase any firearm from 18 to 21; currently in Florida, 21 is the minimum age to buy a handgun, but rifles can be purchased at age 18. In March 2018, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act which incorporates many of the issues Scott supported. It raises the minimum age for buying firearms to 21. <strong>Shall not be infringed, has just been infringed.</strong></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>✔ It doesn&#39;t matter if your a Republican or a Democrat, black or white. We are all being controlled by which only truly matters, the top elites vs non elites(us). They are going to make us fight each other and make us disarm ourselves and disarm our rights.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>✔ <strong>The Enough! National School Walkout</strong>* was a walkout planned by organizers of the <strong>Women&#39;s March(ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME, LINDA SARSOUR IS A BOARD MEMBER)(Woman&#39;s March Organizers are all Obama Administration era social justice warriors, these people are not Americans, they have no american values and are mentally fucking ill, they are brain washing your children.)</strong> , that occurred on March 14, in response to the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The protest had students, parents, and gun control supporters leaving schools for seventeen minutes (one minute for each person who died during the shooting) starting at 10:00am in their respective time zone.</p>

<p>An estimated 3,000 schools participated in the protest. Thousands of students gathered outside the White House, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Nearly 200 U.S. colleges committed to defending #NeverAgain added their names to #NeverAgain Colleges, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University, and the University of Florida. The colleges will not penalize high school students that take part in peaceful Never Again MSD protests, and will protect students who face disciplinary action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re assuming that every journalist plays by the same ethical rule book as you and unfortunately this isn’t the case. It’s likely they presented the case however they wanted to and shot footage on “both sides” and edited them out to either agree with each other (ie both sides finding a common ground that guns=bad) or they edited it to show more conflict than already existed (sex sells and when there’s no sex, sell conflict!). Ethics stops at the line where you need to put food on your table, and some guy in a film editing room is editing your footage without you, and your boss wants to drive something home. </p>

<p>Have you taken an ethics class yet? If so, did you discuss the separation between a journalist and management? This is a pretty common topic in most ethics classes because a manager doesn’t necessarily hold the same ethical standards as you and they don’t answer to your ethics. They answer to the money people who fund the projects/company. Those people have an agenda and couldn’t care less about your ethics or what you actually believe in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are a journalism major ... have you ever heard of Edward Bernays? He was Sigmund Freud&#39;s nephew,  applied his uncle&#39;s theories to the field of propaganda.   He developed a template for manipulating a free press in a democratic society,  and called it &quot;public relations&quot; because &quot;propaganda&quot; sounds bad.</p>

<p>Very interesting man,  and his techniques remain in common use almost a century later.   I feel that everyone should at least understand how he engineered the Guatemalan coup of 1954, as every American war since has been sold on similar grounds to the American people. </p>

<p>The BBC documentary,  The Century of Self, is a great place to start.   Free. </p>

<p>Check out this article. It has insight from an army medical doctor comparing the injuries from high caliber weapons compared to smaller arms. He has seen first hand that the assault rifles shatter bone and the fragments are sent through out the body cavity causing much greater damage. That’s before you factor in hollow points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible to restrict access to guns. There are more and less intelligent ways to do it.  The restrictions do affect a person&#39;s probability of being able to obtain a weapon, both legally and illegally.</p>

<p>Nobody can just decide they want to do an illegal thing - they have to have the opportunity. Nuclear weapons are illegal, and the only black markets for nuclear weapons were in North Korea, Pakistan, Iran, former Soviet Russia, and those were shut down as far as you and I are concerned. AR 15s used to be banned. It&#39;s possible you could have obtained one back during the assault weapons ban, but it would have been much more difficult, with a much higher chance of failure.</p>

<p>Nobody thinks gun free zones protect anything other than a person&#39;s right not to be intimidated by law abiding gun owners. To protect from criminals getting access to guns, you need restrictions on markets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are already restrictions to get guns. Criminals arnt going through the legal ways to obtain them.</p>

<p>Everyone has the opportunity to be a criminal. The deciding factor is a risk assessment. If the rewards out-way the risks then boom criminal. </p>

<p>Restrictions on markets will not stop violence. If someone wants to injure or kill someone it doesn&#39;t mater that they cant get a gun they will use knives, rocks, acid or sticks. </p>

<p>I feel sorry for people that are intimidated by law abiding gun owners but then again you have a higher chance of being killed from a shark then a law abiding gun owner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think <em>all weapons</em> is the goal. That’s certainly not possible. However, i think the goal is to eliminate all unnecessary weapons that are more likely to produce a high body count. Idc if a mass shooting was done with a glock, the point is an AR-15 or something similar produces a greater <em>chance</em> to produce a higher body count. And if everyone who is against banning assault rifles explains that we need them to fight the government, I’ll just say: “Well...you were just explaining how the entire VT shooting was committed with just handguns...won’t those do the same damage against the government if that’s what you’re claiming?” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ban all guns but for hunting muskets.  The same sort of guns for which the 2nd Amendment was authored.  That is constitutional bc it is not a complete ban on guns.</p>

<p>The round up and elimination of the banned guns will be relatively easy.  Make any violation of the ban--mere possession or the attempt possess banned guns or ammo--a strict 20 year prison sentence with no parole.  You&#39;ll see gun crime clear up in a hurry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In that case the 1st amendment would only apply to hand-cranked printing presses. Miller and Heller basically say the 2nd amendment applies to common weapons that are suitable for military use, which oddly enough might not include muskets anymore, but almost certainly does include semi-automatic rifles. </p>

<p>In any case the round up of banned guns would not be easy. In the best case there are going to be a lot of dead people, in the worst case it would lead to an all-out civil war.</p>

<p>Very bottom chart. Sure homicides reduced but again not by a lot. You even saw a homicide spike after the gun ban in 99 when the gun ban was in 96 for Australia. </p>

<p>Youre telling me France the worlds most gun restricted place on the Earth yet people still some how was able to get fully automatic AK 47s and RPGs. They got a grenade launcher in France. I mean cmon now.</p>

<p>Sure they went through terroist and gun connections but its crazy what a man the the armed forces like Navy Army Marine Corp or Air Force that works in an Armoury can get you. Fully automatic guns and actual military grade gear. Go ahead and ban. These people will be here to sell you your tax dollar equipment back to you. These are schemes still going on now a days. Recently a group was caught doing this but after he made a small fortune and was doing for years at many bases he was stationed at. Fuck in my old military town someone gut the gate and stole a loaded AT4 rocket launcher from the base. Base was shut down and on lock but they person still got away. I wonder where it is now?</p>
