        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The walkout took place at the beginning of my 3rd period, as our schedule was actually adjusted to make time for the walkout(our break was moved from after 3rd period to after 2nd period, and was shortened from 30 minutes to 10).</p>

<p>Before the walkout started, my teacher said, “If you are going out there, please know what you are doing this for. If you want to own a gun some day, stay inside and don’t be a hypocrite.” I believe that the 2nd amendment should be protected, and I expected many of my classmates to believe so as well and stay inside, but all of them EXCEPT ME left the classroom. It was just me and the teacher(since teachers have to stay), so I left to a class that i knew a friend was in so I could wait for the 17 minutes to be over. Surprisingly, about a third of that class stayed inside, which was refreshing. </p>

<p>This helped me see that there is a silent portion of students at my high school that knows banning guns will not solve the problem of school shootings. Unfortunately, the loudest kids are the ones who want to ban guns and leave no room for other solutions. Many of the students I know who participated in the walkout, including my friends who I was sitting with before it started, didn’t even support banning guns, they just did it to get out of class. I know my generation was born into propaganda and was easily convinced that banning guns would stop school shootings, but there are many of us who know that isn’t true. </p>

<p>It’s just disappointing to see how some kids at my school genuinely think that banning guns will help, thanks to the stuff they see on TV. So, please be aware that the loud portion of high school students do not represent us and how we feel. </p>

If you want to own a gun some day, stay inside and don’t be a hypocrite.” - Is ridiculous because simply &quot;owning a gun someday&quot; is not on the table, that&#39;s the extreme position the NRA wants the public to believe is at stake, but isn&#39;t. Your teacher sounds like you actually as you keep mention &quot;banning guns&quot; in your post...is anyone actually recommending full authoritarian disarmament of the populace?</p>

After that happens let’s amend it to a nation wide ban on clips and magazines that hold anything above 7 rounds... how long until a person fires 28 shots with 4 rifles... well shit that didn’t work how about we blanket ban rifles and only handguns?

    <div class="md"><p>the whole narrative is a farce - look at the ages of the killers on these lists... </p>

<p>A vast majority are over 21 on this list: (sort by country for US)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers_(Americas">List of rampage killers (Americas)</a>)</p>

<p>Nobody even under 30 on this list: (sort by country for US)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers_(workplace_killings">List of rampage killers (workplace killings)</a>)</p>

<p>And about half are under 21 on this list:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers_(school_massacres">List of rampage killers (school massacres)</a>)</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t guns, or the age you can buy them - it&#39;s the severe lack of treatment for the mentally ill and the failure of law enforcement to identify these individuals and prevent them from carrying out these attacks. We&#39;ve got ticking time bombs running around on all kinds of psychoactive drugs, doing who knows what to their brains, causing all kinds of mental/emotional imbalances, and we want to throw a fit when one of them pops off. All of this shit is irrelevant to the 2nd Ammendment and private gun ownership. All the gun-grabbers can fuck right the fuck off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve been indoctrinated by the NRA. Really I thought this bullshit would stop with a Republican president and Congress. People actually believed for 8 years that Obama was going to confiscate all their guns. Of course that was never going to happen and it sure as hell isn&#39;t going to happen now but the NRA is nervous that gun control legislation might happen now. How do they help manufacturers sell more guns?  Start up with the confiscation hysteria again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you! </p>

<p>Back in the early 1970&#39;s I had two teachers that were encouraging their classes to do a protest for Native American Land rights...the pitch was going pretty good until they said we would be asked to wear a Black Armband and remain silent. Then they really threw down and said that all who participated would get extra credit for an off school event.</p>

<p>It was no doubt the crazy train with two avowed Communist teachers. My arguments fell on deaf ears. My step-father went full Korean Rambo!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That teen walk-out is just another well orchestrated operation. 
They are being used because it is emotional and exciting and they get a lot of attention. </p>

<p>There have been past efforts, get all the African Americans to &quot;march against guns,&quot; get all the mothers to &quot;march,&quot; against guns, etc. </p>

<p>The same fuckers have been trying to tell all Democratic they are anti-gun when back in the 60s it was all Republicans who wanted to get the guns and a gun bill in Congress was only supported or upheld because of 100% Democratic upholding gun rights. 
Some Democratic voters are sincerely opposed to gun ownership, I have never been. </p>

<p>I am strongly opposed to the messages the Republicans and conservatives have sold hard for 40 years now.  </p>

<p>That guns will be necessary to solve cultural and social issues. 
That guns are necessary to protect oneself form a person of another skin color or religion or national origin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise a great point in that if you want an idea to catch on, You target the youth. A walkout sounds like a blast to a high schooler. If they had made a walkout to support the 2nd amendment instead, plenty of kids would walk out... who wouldn’t want 17 min outside with the rest of the school.  It’s tribalism being used to support an idea and force thoughts on children who probably have never really given the topic some critical analyzing of their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check this out man: I was in highschool during the Iraq war. Our teachers gave us the option to walk out of class to protest with a gang of other people who were walking out. Did I? Yes. Did I do it coz I really felt strongly about the Iraq war? No. Did I do it to get out of class for a day? Yes. Did I ACTUALLY think the Iraq war was wrong? Yes. Was that the ACTUAL reason for me walking out? No.</p>

<p>Maybe your classmates are as cynical as I was and were viewing this as an opportunity to not be in a lame ass classroom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it kinda worked on me. I felt very uncomfortable staying alone in the classroom with my teacher after what she said, so I left into the hallway and stood there for a bit before going to the other classroom. There was no way I would be part of that walkout even with the pressure on me because if I shared my viewpoints, I’d most likely be attacked verbally and/or physically.</p>

<p>I might be misinterpreting what&#39;s happened here, but I suspect that the 200+ kids who are getting detention might be counter-protesters - honest-to-goodness, organic counter-protesters. Note that the article says nothing about why these kids walked out instead of attending the assembly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Allentown Morning Call reports Pennridge Superintendent Jacqueline Rattingan announced the punishment against the 225 Pennridge High School students in Bucks County who walked out of school instead of attending an in-house assembly remembering the 17 killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was this a counter-protest in support of the second amendment? If so, it is extremely telling that the media isn&#39;t covering it as such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why kids aren&#39;t allowed to vote. They&#39;re to open to influence, lack bigger-picture context, and are easily used for political purposes. No offense to you though, you sound like you have decent perspective, but most of your peers don&#39;t yet. </p>

<p>I get that they&#39;re trying to affect policy that makes they feel safer. Ultimately that&#39;s the adult&#39;s job though. The inference is that the adults aren&#39;t doing their jobs, so teens need to raise their voices, reinforcing the trend of using emotional outrage to get what you want, rather than working within the system. Or more fundamentally, that the system is broken because it doesn&#39;t agree with your feel-feels. </p>

<p>On top of that, it&#39;s not a protest if it&#39;s government (in this case school administration and faculty) sanctioned. It&#39;s a political rally. </p>
