       The FBI maintains that Stephen Paddock — the reported lone gunman — was a mystery man and his motive for killing dozens and injuring over 500 people still has not been pinpointed. Those assertions are simply untrue, FBI officials confirm. Lies. Here are various parts of an investigation into the shooting that paint a portrait of the events leading to the shooting and Paddock’s likely accomplices and associates.
      </p>
      <p>
       The major, shocking revelations include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        When FBI brass was provided with forensic evidence of multiple gunmen, they told agents to stand down and focus on Paddock only. Even a key internal audio captured by a hotel guest of multiple rifles firing from Mandalay Bay went ignored, covered up.
       </li>
       <li>
        When FBI brass was provided the names of persons of interest who likely assisted Paddock, agents were instructed not to interview the individuals. One would-be target was never pursued despite pleadings from intelligence officials and agents that he was possibly the second shooter.
       </li>
       <li>
        The FBI uncovered specific evidence showing that Paddock was anti-Trump and had an affiliation with ANTIFA, though it never was divulged to the public and agents did not follow such leads, per orders of their superiors.
       </li>
       <li>
        When FBI brass was given evidence that the shooting was possibly linked to ANTIFA radicals working with an ISIS-linked terror faction — including the full identities of some of the suspects with ties to both radical groups and at or near Mandalay Bay the night of the deadly shooting — agents were never instructed to follow up on the investigation and pursue the suspects.
       </li>
       <li>
        When intelligence officials approached the FBI and LVMPD with external evidence that Paddock was only one member of an organized terror cell — which included as many as five gunman who planned to fire from the Mandalay Bay suite — the compelling evidence was covered up. Never pursued.
       </li>
       <li>
        When FBI brass was provided with forensic evidence that Paddock’s death was not a suicide, the intelligence was never pursued by the FBI and LVMPD. FBI sources said Paddock suffered two gunshots. His autopsy report only details a single bullet to the head. FBI sources maintain Paddock’s autopsy was doctored and is a fraud.
       </li>
       <li>
        When an ISIS-linked “businessman” from Turkey was pinpointed in the investigation — and found to be residing near Las Vegas at the time of the shooting — FBI agents were not instructed to follow up and pursue intelligence leads showing possible links to the massacre.
       </li>
       <li>
        FBI and intelligence officials believe Paddock and associates chose to strike the Las Vegas country music concert with over 22,000 people because they likely supported President Trump. FBI agents said they were instructed to keep that key motive quiet too.
       </li>
       <li>
        When MGM refused to share cctv footage from Mandalay Bay, FBI agents were threatened by superiors that any whistle blowers divulging such revelations to the media would lose their jobs. The FBI still has never been provided all the camera footage from the Mandalay Bay, FBI agents said.
       </li>
      </ul>

       It's English slang, used by journalists all the time. it's origins are based in the military but it's now used frequently to refer to high ranking officials in corporations and businesses as well as military and law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The word
       <code>
        brass' is actually a shortened form of
       </code>
       brass hat', and this was the term used by enlisted men in the late 19th century to refer to their commanding officers. It was during World War II that
       <code>
        brass hat' became
       </code>
       top brass'. As time went by, the expression began to be used in non-military contexts; important individuals of an organisation began to be called
       <code>
        top brass'. The term
       </code>
       the brass' can also be used to refer to such people."

       hey, it's a conspiracy sub. The most obvious reason, a nutcase with a lot of guns went on a killing spree, seems just too crazy. Remember, this is trump's FBI, CIA, NSA, congress, etc. There is no deep state pulling the strings. It all stops at the white house. And they are fucking with us and most are eating it all up while still defending trump.

       Lots of statements on what the FBI did and didn't do, what "intelligence officials" discovered, etc. but where is the evidence of any of this?

       Take your first bullet point. The FBI was provided with forensic evidence... by whom? How do you know this?

       These were the bullet points from a recent true pundit article. The writer claims to have anonymous FBI sources and intelligence officials leaking info about the shooting. Apparently they're going to slowly release info from their investigation over the next few weeks, and these are some of the main points they'll cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all anon sources though, so...

       Ah, okay was wondering where they came up with all that. Paddock being involved with the FBI as either an undercover, informant or person being surveilled always seemed to be a better explanation of why the cover up. Not sure why'd they'd go to such lengths just because of Antifa ties or whatever. I'll be interested to see what they're releasing in the coming weeks though.

       Yeah... op must have forgotten to link the article. That's a lot of speculation to come up with off the top of your head lol

       But same. We'll have to wait to see if any of these claims are validated but honestly I'm happy to hear any theories of motive at this point... ya know since we haven't really gotten any yet

       Any evidence at all? This honestly reads like a piece of disinformation propaganda. It contains details that could be relevant down the line and questions that need to be answered but all along side truly ridiculous speculation. Trump, Antifa? No mention of a certain gulf nations powerful family members in the immediate proximity of the event? Come on....

       Not every agent at the FBI is in the know.
FBI brass likely found FBI fingerprints and were doing damage control.

       FBI is never gonna fall on a sword to satiate our morbid curiosity in this case.

       It was an undercover FBI arms deal gone wrong, it was supposed to catch a certain Saudi Arab operating out of the four seasons above the MGM in the act either to arrest or blackmail them. FBI didn't expect the "buyers" guards to scan for surveillance equipment first before he even got to the room, when they found the camera in the hallway and inside the room they killed Paddock and opened fire on the crowd as a distraction and a "Fuck you!" to FBI while the target escaped.
