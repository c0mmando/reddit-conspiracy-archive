<p>Simce when has a Presidential administration obeyed and enforced the laws?  The consequence of Trump enforcing the laws means that about 75% of Congress ends up in prison.  The government would fail and there would be chaos.  </p>

<p>The problem is that, the more time it takes, the more kids end up molested and ritually sacrificed to Moloch.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most American&#39;s Don&#39;t even know why we are in Syria. It isn&#39;t to help the people. It is for natural gas pipeline.  We have turned into the biggest bully and have lied why we are / were in other countries for years. Everything on mainstream media channels appears to be far fetched with an agenda of making an enemy out of Russia. Why is this!? What is their purpose? It must have trickled down from the top of our Government and encouraged to be placed on the front line of every news media channel.  I feel as if there is an agenda here in which it wont stop until we get the resources from certain countries or another country pushes back and there is war. </p>

We don&#39;t have to be the good guys, and I shouldn&#39;t try to make excuses for foreign governments attacking our soil/populace.

<p>If a 300lb body builder throws a rock at you do you start swinging at him? No you run away. Russia is starting to swing at us, they may have a gun in their back pocket, but so do we, and we will both get shots off before one of us collapses. </p>

<p>If a 300lb body builder starts throwing rocks at you, you don&#39;t swing back you run and maybe get the police (international community) involved. You may have a gun in your pocket, but you know he does to, and you will both get shots off before you collapse. But Russia has lost all credibility with the international community and is 1/10 as powerful as the USSR, which is the o my reason they still have veto power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, look up how bloody the 1800s were and every century before that. Hundreds of millions of people died in the first half of the 1900s. I didn&#39;t say world peace, but small scale regional conflicts are much preferred to what war was like before.</p>

<p>This is still the most peaceful time period in the last 2000 years. Without America, Europe would be Germany at war with the USSR right now. Or just the USSR, who knows.</p>

Pipeline through Syria = oil to East Asia which is currently getting it from Russia.  See why Russia might wanna fight “ISIS” in Syria?  See why Russia is “evil” (for now)?  Truth is, both sides are evil.  One (The US’n’Friends) wants a pipeline so bad they’re willing to lie to their own people, fund insurgency in a sovereign nation which hasn’t attacked them, and kill shite-loads of innocent people.

    <div class="md"><p>Putin is most certainly against them, but then you&#39;re basically supporting one set of totalitarian oligarchs from the East to oppose another set of totalitarian oligarchs in the West. It&#39;s a lose-lose situation.</p>

<p>As for Trump? I&#39;m sure that he was/is against it, but is too weak of a person to do anything. That and his narcissism is undoubtedly used by the people around him to manipulate him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very rarely is there a perfect choice in the real world.  I look at how they behave.  </p>

<p>People like Merkel, May, and Macron have committed treason against their own countries.  They have allowed unrestrained immigration into their countries, which is creating a lot of taxpayer debt and the crime rates are skyrocketing.  </p>

<p>Duda of Poland, Áder of Hungary, Putin, and probably a few others are resisting the flow of the immigrants because their loyalty is to their own people.  This is reasonable and this is what the leader of a country is supposed to do.  Right?  </p>

<p>Yes, the Western Powers (i.e. the International Bankers) are responsible for the bloodshed.  They have bombed the crap out of certain countries, and this needs to stop.  The people in those countries need to be allowed to build they lives they want without interference from greedy bankers.  The War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity need to stop.  </p>

<p>I understand what you are saying about Trump, but a lot of people disagree. Trump is what we have to work with at the moment, and he is certainly better than Hillary.  </p>

<p>The Bank of England and the Vatican have been stealing our tax money, and they use it to wage war and worse.  They traffic in drugs and children and commit the most evil acts imaginable.  All this needs to stop.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we are in agreement here; good points overall.</p>

<p>For people who do not believe in the forced immigration you are talking about, I refer them to <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/migration/migration.htm">this UN report on Replacement Migration</a> and <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-1219-newsbud-roundtable-on-the-migrant-crisis/">this Corbett Report/Boiling Frogs Post roundtable discussion</a>.</p>

<p>I agree Putin has actually been talking a LOT of sense, especially in his scathing remarks against US false flags (i.e the repeated &quot;sarin&quot; gas attacks) and NATO aggression. However, he HAS surrounded himself with oligarchs, and there HAVE been suspicious deaths around him. Like you said, not a perfect choice but he does have his merits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  I was surprised the first time I listened to Putin in an interview.  I was expecting the typical politician responses.  He was direct and to the point and did not try to evade the question.  This was surprising.  I think he does not even ask to see the questions beforehand.  </p>

<p>Turn off your TV, stop listening to twitter and Facebook, and realize that you&#39;re only helping to divide this country further. Once you stop listening to the MSM, you&#39;ll quickly realize that 90% of the country is pretty close to the middle, and that the media only focuses on the two extremes of the spectrum.</p>

<p>People that voted for Trump were sick of the bull shit system that has always been in place, simple as that. Obama had 8 years and didn&#39;t do shit except continue a war and start another one, and implement a shitshow of a healthcare system that fucked most of the country and only helped the bottom 5%.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t vote for Trump, but I damn well would still rather have him than fucking Hillary Clinton. Get your head out of your ass and realize that neither side of this system gives a shit about you, so stop treating one side as the &quot;good team&quot;.</p>

<p>Jesus, how utterly ignorant. We&#39;ve been living in a fascist nation masquerading as a democracy for about 4 decades now. Maybe you should learn about the first attempted fascist coup led by Prescott Bush <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/episode-123-meet-smedley-butler/">that was prevented in part thanks to Smedley Butler.</a></p>

<p>Maybe you should learn about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0882791346/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;me=">Council on Foreign Relations</a> and how they&#39;ve had a vice grip on every president and his administration (except for JFK) since Woodrow Wilson.</p>

<p>Maybe you should learn about the <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-794-g-edward-griffin-unmasks-the-creature-from-jekyll-island/">secret meeting at Jekyll Island</a> which turned our economy over into the hands of international bankers.</p>

<p>This is complete bullshit. Look at any mainstream news outlet and tell me where you are seeing this intense propaganda for Russia/Putin. If you actually believe what you are saying, you are so far beyond bias that its actually pointless having any sort of conversation with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Labeling a claim/story/rhetoric as “propaganda” is meant to discredit the claim without addressing the underlying merit.  You’ve avoided engaging in a substantive argument at every turn.  The issue is whether any of this “propaganda” about Russia is true?   You write:   </p>

<p>You claim the purpose criticizing anti-Russian rhetoric is to prevent a “war.”  You avoid addressing whether the claims against Russia have merit, rather condemn the mere notion of criticizing Russia.  What has Russia done to deserve such a passionate defender?  If the claims against Russia are true, is “war” even avoidable at this point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, you&#39;re on a conspiracy forum. Assuming shills are at work is par for the course. If not, imma have to ask you to hand in your tin foil hat.</p>

<p>Consider game theory. Information warfare gives any one party a huge advantage over the other. If my competitor uses astroturfing to shill online by posting fake Amazon reviews or whatever, that puts me at a huge disadvantage. Conversely, if I hire people or bots to shill for my product,  and my competitor doesn&#39;t, I&#39;m going to get much better sales. So at worst I&#39;m maintaining equilibrium and at best I&#39;m making more money. The <em>worst</em> choice I can make is to <em>not</em> hire shills, because unless I fully trust my competitor to also not do this, then I&#39;m setting myself up to lose.</p>

<p>Ergo it&#39;s a pretty safe assumption that all major world powers are engaging in online astroturfing as propaganda. Including Russia. Simply because it would be <em>pretty stupid</em> of them not to.</p>

<p>1:54:45- &quot;Wait until the people find out that the United States of America is a corporation, a religious non-profit chartered by the Roman Catholic Church out of Delaware. Jesus!&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yyE9Dpww2Ls?t=6880">https://youtu.be/yyE9Dpww2Ls?t=6880</a></p>

<p>I think the people of Russia do not have the Right to Own and Bear Arms, but we do.  Totally different situation.  We need to stop these people from stealing our tax money so we can rebuild our infrastructure, and build world class education and healthcare systems.  </p>

<p>To tell you the truth, I trust countries like Russia, Poland, and Hungary more than I trust Germany, France, and Britain.  I am talking about the politicians and leaders, and not the people.   </p>

They also recently illegally invaded a couple of countries which has led to crisis after crisis and the deaths of hundreds of thousands. Did anything happen to the US when they invaded Iraq? Or when they commit war crimes?  Russia is a bad guy for the reasons you mentioned but be careful in what punishment should match their crimes as the West&#39;s actions are far far far far far far more destructive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American government greatly assisted (through covert means) Yeltsin attain &amp; retain power. As a result of this meddling, (and I&#39;d imagine US supervision) the Russian people were subjected to a maddening sell off of major state holdings into the hands of a few well positioned elites that we now gliby refer to as oligarchs. The Russian people have suffered as a result. From this grisly situation, Putin portrayed himself as a strongman who will protect Russia. Unfortunately for Russia, he is a self serving liar. Putin is a bully and a corrupt politician and an agressor and I don&#39;t support him nor do I defend him. I don&#39;t admire his cunning treacherousness. But the United States&#39; role in shaping the current climate in Russia can not be ignored just because Putin is mean. I wish historical context could come into play for those that are kept in the dark on these issues but that would require reworking our failed education systems and media monopolies so we can all have background information to current situations. Nevertheless, we may all very well have the United States government, or her agencies more specifically, to thank for Putin&#39;s ascendancy and his death grip over the country which is horrible for many obvious reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are lots of beneficial reasons for the IC and (therefore) the media to portray Russia to us as the bad guys. Long story short they need to plant the seed in our minds now that they are some hostile aggressor because there may come a time in the future when we have a direct conflict with them, military or otherwise. </p>

<p>In no way does that mean they are the &#39;good guys&#39; or that they&#39;re innocent of wrongdoings themselves. Putin is woke and unafraid to call out our own BS. The media will censor and ridicule him every chance they get. He may well be the leader of the last country able to stand in the way of complete financial domination by the west.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zog and its Allies (the US, EU, Israel and Saudi Arabia - the true axis of evil) are getting their arse handed to them in Syria at the moment by the Iran/Syria/Russia coalition. </p>

<p>They are desperate to drum up hostility against Russia in an attempt to sanction it and restrict its ability to support Assad. They&#39;ve tried every fake news &#39;war crime&#39; in the book, but the general public is too war-weary to care and it hasn&#39;t been very effective with Russia&#39;s veto vote in the UN Security Council. So they&#39;ve moved on to step 2. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for Theresa May and her puppetmasters, the UK is in no position to do anything much but sabre-rattle at Russia. Their economy is groaning under the weight of parasitic non-Whites, they have thousands of muslim extremists in their midst, a disintegrated public service and a metric ****-tonne of violent negroes to worry about. They also rely on Russia for their gas.</p>

<p>The real question will be Donald Trump. He&#39;s a loose cannon and surrounded by far too many Zionist jews for me to ever be truly comfortable that he will make the right decision. We&#39;ll have to wait and see. </p>

<p>In the meantime, Assad has broken the back of the US-backed terrorists in Syria. Good news for anyone who supports true freedom. </p>
