       Poverty is manufactured and maintained.  money works differently to how you have been led to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is not a finite amount of money.  it is infinite...   money is created in massive amounts daily and is deleted (banked) in massive amounts daily.   debt is use to control. mortgages  (deathpledge) are used to tie you to an area for many years.  our leaders know this and they use this sleight of hand to enslave all of humanity.   let me be clear - their is plenty for everyone on the planet at least 10,000 times over!
every country is in debt to the same mafia cabal... but its all just a con.  compound interest is the reason certain groups maintain power and others remain poor and in slavery.   we are their debts slaves that keep them in power...   there is none so hopelessly enslaved as those who believe they are free.. we are not free!  we are free range!  we all have to work, we all have to pay taxes under threats of violence, to the MAN.  unfortunately most cannot see this, because we are born into slavery.  indeed take away most peoples need to work, and they will be lost. such is the institutionalization we have been subjected to.
      </p>
      <p>
       all is not lost. there are options.. we can do somethings...  but first the knowledge of the cage, will lead to freedom from it.  freetime is what we need.  we cannot be free till we have our own free time! so we can work for us, and our loved ones..imagine what you would do if you had enough money so you didn't HAVE to work for them.  your birthright has been stolen.  do you want to get it back?
      </p>
      <p>
       they killed jesus because he tried to tell people this... the only time he ever lost his temper, was when he found out about the moneylenders...  shortly after they killed him.  (if you believe in the bible)
      </p>
      <p>
       usury has always been illegal and unlawful.. yet we now find all the countries in the world are practicing it on its people?   so strange hmmmm
      </p>
      <p>
       please share this knowledge....  each one teach one.   :D   peace be with you.

       Good post, I’m not a huge buyer into these type of conspiracies because often there is a barely concealed anti-Semitic agenda. (I’m not Jewish, or rich FYI)

       I'm not totally familiar with the reasons, but 'the Jews' are right up there with 'Illuminati', 'Freemasons', and 'Bildeburg' when it comes to alleged perpetrators of mass conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believed all of them you could be forgiven for thinking all Jews are technologically advanced shape-shifting lizards who live in a prehostoric paradise in the center of the earth, emerging from their Antarctic surface portal to control humanity with VR, holograms, and good-old-fashioned espionage so they can either eat us or just kill us all and take the planet.

       I want to say something terribly mean to you for posting that. But i am not sure why i am upset.
      </p>
      <p>
       While part of your post is true......its the fact that its true is exactly why so few people will wake up and realize that some conspiracy theorists are not nutjobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do 100% believe the OP's original comment is based on alot of hard facts and truthful statements........i dont think many (or maybe not any? )of the things in your post are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you ask the common man what do conspiracy theorists think......their answer is - all the stuff in OPs post and all the stuff in your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       So because its all lumped together people assume alot of it *(or all of it )
is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because a group of people say alot of crazy stuff......does not mean everything they say is crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP posted it in a conspiracy forum because he knows we will read and listen. But no one else will listen because the people outside the conspiracy forums think we are all nutjobs who think jews turn into lizards and eat babies at child prostitution rings in pizza parlor basements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its so hard for me to make a point cause i am confused how to say what i mean to say. Ugh.

       If you're referring to the cabal being primarily Zionist and that shredding light or speaking against said cabal is considered "anti-semetic" then I understand what you're getting at...
      </p>
      <p>
       ..but most here know that Zionism and Judaism are diametrically opposed and that same victimized camaraderie they attempt to take advantage of is used to make any dissenter seem a insensitive monster
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Jews are greedy and should be cast out of society" is anti-semetic
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       "There's a group of bankers that have certain ideological beliefs that they are genealogically advanced compared to the rest of humanity therefore should rule over them and manipulate/coerce them into a system that enslaves them and is based on keeping them ignorant, and that's fucked up" is recognizing a messed up pattern and attempting to bring it to others attention so that it can change
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "Anti-Semetic" is thrown around much too loosely as a blanket term to describe anyone who disagrees with/opposes Zionism and that's a blatant tactic so try not to fall victim to it

       Antisemitism is just as justified as Islamophobia. Both religions are supremacist. Both teach their followers that non-believers are inferior. Both teach a high degree of nepotism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would we have people who can't integrate into our society, and think themselves superior to the native peoples? We don't need Jews or Muslims in our societies. Both of these groups have their own homelands.

       Yeah that's a psyop in itself in the same way the term "conspiracy theorist" was coined by the CIA to discredit those who seek truth and threaten to expose the secrets and pull back the curtain

       The "let's call it racist" attack
       <em>

       gets old.  Let's just bury our heads in the sand, shall we, and not search for the truth, even if it is sometimes distasteful.  To find who rules you....find who you cannot criticize.

       The Jews have created an environment where society is formed from multiple protected minorities. This allows the Jew to be safe, because otherwise they know that

        whites will revolt

       against (excerpt from the article I linked above) them for what they have done.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews don't want to genocide whites for the sake of genocide whites. They want white genocide because it would create a

       All true except I would re-phrase that last statement.  There is no intended meaning that I know of for the races.  What could be said, however, is that due to differences among the races, especially IQ, it is therefore difficult for them to live in harmony when in close proximity.  (different goals and ways of achieving goals.  Differences in delayed gratification, and therefore crime and punishment. etc.)  IMHO.

       Hippy liberal lurker checking in. Great post OP. Not everyone should live like Bill Gates but there is more than enough resources and money for everyone to live like a lower middle class American. We(the world) have the resource for every human to have a roof over their head, electricity, running water and 3 squares a day. In return those individuals (who are able) can work 40 hours making the world a better place.

       Okay. If we ever invent the technology like iRobot/star trek we won’t need to work and universal basic income and other things will be required. It’s scary to think that robots could take 99% of all jobs and people could either live comfortably or die in squalor.

       I don't think basic income is going to be the final outcome.  Once we have free-energy and a box that spits out fully formed things money will cease to have any meaning at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think Basic Income only really makes sense under the capitalist system, where only a few are capitalist and the rest are out of work laborers.  Better solutions would work towards fair ownership of the means of production.

       The current monetary system is failing you then.  There are plenty of unworking leeches living it up.  If your hard work was rewarded, then you are the exception to the rule.  Plenty of us work hard and are not rewarded like the parasitic lazy upper class.

       This is true, but the difference is that
       <em>
        usually
       </em>
       the person "living it up" off of the system, usually will not have anything of value their entire life....there wont be anything to hand down to their kids, no money in the savings etc etc
Yeah they are living large on our dime now, new tv, new Escalade, newest smart phone etc etc but they aint buying a 4 bedroom house on a couple hundred acres....there may be 1 or 2 that can do that, but the average dirtbag that mooches the system drinks and smokes their money away while scrapping $$ for rent in a shit hole apartment building or a section 8 house on the other side of town

       I think lazy people aren't really a huge part of the problem.  I think the biggest part of the problem is our debt-based fractional reserve monetary system that creates a no win situation for those on the bottom because they can never escape their debt.  There is an artificial burden on every person that consumes a large chunk of our working energy and it doesn't need to be there.  A huge chunk of our taxes go exclusively to paying off previous debts or just the interest from debts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, a huge amount of our energy is siphoned away to the government and is used very inefficiently, in black projects, or in blowing people up, or whatnot.  There's also a ton of people that are middle men, which are providing services that we don't really need.  Just imagine all the working hours that could be saved by replacing bankers with a digital system, or the financial industry with simple index funds that are automated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, most of our work is BS work which is highly demotivating.  If society made a conscious effort to eliminate BS work and in placing people in jobs that better fit their internal motivations, people would be more inclined to want to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       People that just sit on their couches smoking blunts and playing video games aren't living very satisfying lives, those are crutches because real life is that sucky.  If we make real life better for everyone, they will want to participate.

       Also.... let's be fair, it's very rarely ever just 40 hours a week, especially if you're working in a big city. I used to do a lot of recruiting for the high tech industry and I can tell you that most of the roles I filled were with people who routinely worked 50-60 hours a week. On top of that, you have the commute which everyone loathes.

       Well it was more along the lines of lavishly wealthy. Being the hippy baby killer I’m accused if being any conversation about universal basics income or wealth redistribution, etc ends up with people “why does everyone have to be a billionaire”

       to OP's, about how insufficient spending on social programs is bullshit because the excuse of limited "taxpayer money" is a sham. Worth a read; hard to TL;DR.

       Why does anyone need to work at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think adam and eve worked? Nope. They walked around like dogs and cats......as free as a bird. And they never worked a day in their life. If they were hungry they picked berries and ate them. And surely they didnt live to be 90 yrs old and have advanced medicine for pain. They didnt drive a tesla to the store and get mcdonalds. Because they had fresh fruit anytime they wanted it and they didnt need to go to a store.
      </p>
      <p>
       **adam and eve is used here as a figurative term for early man.
      </p>
      <p>
       We only habe to "work" if we want to have cell phones and internet and space shuttle flights. If we went back to 400000 yrs ago.......the people didnt have to work. They werent quite as safe from animal attacks or famine or heavy weather storms. But they didnt work a day in their lives.

       That would be nice but most of us are stuck because we were born into it. Unless you can leave your entire family behind and give up everything you've ever known. The way schools and media mess up our minds start from day 1 hard to escape that kind of mind control and social programming.

       I think we are talking about money not specific religious belief, although they are deeply intertwined.

       Churches and their teachings aren’t even conspiracy “theories” it’s the damn truth when it comes to controlling our society through fear.

       Listen, there are tons of subs for you to speak about those “theories” though. I think you will be better received there.

       It ties into what happened with the first man who was created without the genetic defect of sin, since everyone else are children and inherit this defect another had to come to balance the scales as the only life that could balance the perfect life lost, is another perfect life.

       Well you can believe whatever you want to believe, that's the beauty of free will. But from my experience our reality is very different than modern scholars and scientists will tell us and actually deceive us about many things. So for me personally I've become much more aligned with the ancient system and teachings as I know the truth about our reality. Love is the key as many of the ancients taught.

       Money has intrinsic value, that value is the work cost of producing the item for sale.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something takes time and resources to produce, it has value which is what money is.

       Printed money only has applied value. It’s really only worth what we agree it’s worth. 
A $1 bill and a $100 has no legitimate difference in material value. We just say it’s worth more because the number is bigger.

       It’s not rare or precious, it’s nothing. Its worth nothing  more than we are told it’s worth.

       Still though, inflation of value of printed currency is also implied and holds no real genuine stock or value. It’s only what we say it’s worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what I’m saying doesn’t really mean anything, there’s not much that can be done about it.
Unless we change what we use for monetary value into something that has real world worth.

       How about yes.  Money has been reduced to nothing but 0's and 1's on a computer screen.  The American dollar was taken off the gold standard when the Federal Reserve was created in 1913.  From there it was obstensibly tied to oil, but in reality it's backed by debt - by OUR work, by OUR labor.  And the Fed can simply add more 0's to their tallies whenever the hell they want.  Where do you think the money for the bank bailouts came from?  They created it out of digits on a computer screen.  If you want a crash course on where money comes from, and the start of this scam, start

       Are we saying that there was no poverty before the fed?
       <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/World-Poverty-Since-1820.png">
        The reality is that poverty is at all time lows right now.
       </a>
       Why did we see poverty before the fed, and poverty constantly drop since the creation of the fed, when the fed is what creates poverty? How is this being "aware?" It seems like, to hold this position, you have to be completely unaware of the actual numbers.

       So are you saying you're okay with a private corporation "printing" our money at interest.  The thing is now that they don't even actually print anything they type in a number.  Why do we need a private Corporation to type that digital number?  And if you're responsible for printing a country's money you know they're never going to throw you in jail for anything.

       Yes, there was poverty before the Fed.  There's always going to be some poverty.  But there's a difference between some poverty and 80% of the richest nation in the world populating having less than $500 in their bank for emergencies.

       It's not a private company. It is a private-public partnership, for good reason. And, yes, I'm okay with it. We saw numerous boom and bust cycles throughout the 1800 hundreds, with large recessions (drops above 10% and often even above 25%) every other year. The economy was very unstable, and the fed system was developed to steady this out. We had our biggest bust right after its implementation, but then the economic busts were much smaller and further apart (around 3-5% and only every 3 years or so) throughout the 1900s.

       It seems to have worked.

       People have more access to food, more access to healthcare, more access to housing, more access to education, than any other time in history. I'm not arguing that everything is perfect nor that we aren't on a bad path, but the idea that the fed, which follow its implementation led to a better economy for the average joe and a decrease in the share of the wealth of the top 10%, doesn't make much sense.

       I'm not okay with it.  The government says "I need $10".  The Fed types $10 into a computer and now the American Tax payers owe the Fed $12.  That's ridiculous.  The Fed didn't create anything.  They didn't do anything.  The "money" is created out if thin air and I don't want to pay them for it.  It's bullshit weather you believe we're better off now or not.

       That would be ridiculous if it worked that way. If the federal government needs more money than they have already collected from taxes, they borrow it by issuing Treasury Bills and Bonds (and even U.S. Savings Bonds). Those who buy the treasury bills and bonds are simply loaning money to the government, who then pays it back with interest.

       Yes so the government goes further in debt, the money supply is inflated, and the public is left footing the bill. At least the money was used to benefit our country as a whole and not just given to the banks who risked their solvency out of greed and needed to be bailed out by the public /s. The Federal reserve act, going off the gold standard and the repeal of Glass Steagall is simply wealth distribution from the plebs to the ones controlling the system.

       Anyone who understands economics would downvote it. But you don't need to understand economics to look at evidence from around the world. The financial system in European countries is the most efficient in achieving prosperity. Some countries like Pakistan have banned interest on lending - this is self sabotage, its inefficient. Loans and debt are good things because they facilitate economic activity and enable people to buy their own home instead of having to save up for decades. Without these system we would all be much poorer.

       Loans and debts means you have to pay double for everything big. The system is backwards. I have a natural right to claim VB land and build a dwelling. But the banks and governments own all the land. We are kept poor for a reason.

       This is because of the risks involved for the lender as well as the lender needing an income for themselves to make it worth their time. As long as there is strong competition in financial services, the interest rates offered will always be reasonable.

       You can do this in many countries but in all the highly developed countries there are land shortages so its not possible. Land is a finite resource. Planning permission needs to be granted to ensure its used effectively. In most developed countries, all citizens have a right to free accommodation provided by the government.

       I think you forget that a private group controls the money supply and can print on demand. They can (and do) devalue your dollar over night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our system is broken. 2008 and the aftermath (QE) prove that the financial system we have all been forced to participate in is a corrupt scam that only benefits the people controlling it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does our country have to borrow money from a private institution instead of controlling the money supply for the people (essentially by the people).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, a basic understanding of economics shows that our system works. Once you dig deeper, it's obvious that the system is in place to enslave the population.

       I agree. But why do we allow a small group of private individuals to decide when and how much is printed?

      <p>
       So you supported the bank bailout and QE?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know when the majority of our middle class was suffering and getting kicked out of their homes, the heads of the banks that caused the crisis were taking home record bonuses? We, the people, have no control or say over the creation and distribution of our money supply. They can devalue your dollar by 30% while making a few currupt bankers even more wealthy than they we're.
      </p>

       Since the Fed is essentially private, we have no say over the future of our wealth and our savings.

        The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets monetary policy; it consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at any given time: the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year terms. There are also various advisory councils. Thus, the Federal Reserve System has both public and private components.

       The ECB is extremely currupt and thanks to Draghi's hellicopter money, won't last long. Neither are good and neither have the intention of the Citizens in mind whatsoever other than to convince them that "everything is awesome", which is only true if you don't look down or pull back the curtains.
      </p>
      <p>
       The central banks have been devaluing their currencies at an extreme rate. Since they're all valued against each other, the currencie's value doesnt appear to be free falling because they're all falling. We only value currencies relative to the others. Therefore if all central banks devalue, the public will be too ignorant to notice. In other words, the central banks are colluding to devalue all currencies and essentially devalue your income and savings in the name of economic prosperity. They're robbing the poor to pay the rich.

       This is not true. The value of a currency is how much goods it can be. For example how much food costs. Inflation can be tracked and inflation has been pretty low in Europe. The only thing which has had very high inflation is house prices in the most successful countries.

       theres a reason property tax exists though.
      </p>
      <p>
       the land you own isnt on a completely isolated island. Its connected to the world around it, there are roads, schools and other services that the city provides that add a lot of value to that land.
      </p>

       property tax is really just a fee to cover the costs of all the services your land has access to.

       I think you're misunderstanding the OP.  In fact, I think you need to take a remedial conspiracy class.  I posted a link above on where you can start learning why our current fiat currency is illegitimate, and serves to only make sure we are all debt-slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The short of it is, our money is magically created on computers by the federal reserve, which is a PRIVATE corporation created in 1913 by shady cabal types, and snuck into law during a friday news dump.  It took us off the gold standard, and allowed a private company to create the currency we use as a country, and loan that currency back to us, with interest.  Which means the government will always be in debt, not to other countries, but to this monster they created, because there will never be enough money to cover the interest of the money this cabal is creating.  And this cabal can create money whenever they want, or whenever their head wants.  The money used to bail out the banks after the housing crisis didn't exist until it was needed.  Our money system is based on debt, and we pay off that debt by enslaving ourselves to corporate masters with ties to this cabal.  I shared this above, but Aaron Russo starts explaining the problem well in this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzdauRnKFA">

       Not accurate, it is a public private/public hybrid, for good reason. If it was completely public, it would be far too subject to the political whims of congress and so policy wouldn't be made based on what the members think is right, but based on the political pressure applied to them.

       Not accurate either. It was hotly contested, debated over, modified and changed all through almost all of 1912 and 1913. This idea that it "snuck" in there during a single day is nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first two points you make are just blatantly factually incorrect. There are many legitimate criticisms of the fed, but you should probably understand the basic facts of the system before pretending you know anything about it.

       I think by definition greed is the love or wanting to hoard material items. The weird thing to think about is that money in off itself is just a representation of what basically?

       I couldn't disagree more. How do you equate freedom to the LOVE of money? Freedom is to be able to pursue your own dreams and aspirations. Freedom is to be able to express your ideas and not be unjustly punished or imprisoned for doing so. Freedom means to be able to make decisions on what you personally value and do so in open society.

       In some places they define poverty as something like $1 a day in income. Then in some areas they have managed to rise to 2$ a day! woohoo! Out of the poverty statistic, but all it really means is that the man in that household simply spends 1$ more every day on beer.

       that's extreme poverty, which is distinct from the poverty i was talking about. additionally, extreme poverty is less than $1.90/day, and the rate of that extreme poverty has also collapsed in the past few decades. IIRC, we're both at the lowest percentages of humans in extreme poverty,
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       , and the lowest total number of humans in extreme poverty in the past couple centuries (probably since we've passed 1 billion world population)
      </p>
      <p>
       furthermore, obviously $1.90 means a lot less to you than people who live in areas that were in extreme poverty in 1980 or so. to ignore that; that is, to speak of it in such an asinine way ("it just means they spend more on beer?" the fuck are you on about?), more or less instantly discredits whatever point you were trying to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what to say to help you get to the "starting line" of this conversation. you understand that cost of living varies wildly between new york city and the slums of mubai, right? that the value of $1.90 is entirely contextual?

       This is actually from decade long experience in sub-saharan Africa. In many rural areas basically the woman works the field and the man sits at home (in the mud hut) doing practically nothing or very little.  If this family earns $1 a day and somehow manages to earn $2 instead then what is almost guaranteed to happen is that the man will use that extra $1 on buying a beer that day. Seriously. I'm not kidding. These rural people don't need (a lot of) money as such anyway, because they live off the land and don't pay rent/mortgages etc. So it's not like they're out on the street if they don't make any money in any given month. Trying to classify such people in poverty statistics that include also people living in cities make little sense but this is what is happening. So rural people (which is most of the worlds population) are not suddenly lifted out of 'poverty' because they escape some statistic that is meaningless anyway.

       It is still an ideal that others strive for though.  I would much rather live in a world in which neighbors took care of each other than stepped on the dead bodies of their children to get ahead.  But as long as we perpetuate the cycle the latter will always be the reality.

       How can you say eye color is just an attirbute? It's clearly meaningful. For example, blue eyes are more sensitive to light, which allows for better night vision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race is the same. Look into race and IQ. Look into the race and the MAO-A gene. Look into race and skull shapes. Look into race and testosterone. Look into race and body fat percentage. And there is many more.
      </p>
      <p>
       These aren't meaningless attributes. They are very very meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason why Sub-Saharan Africans have never built a coherent civilization. There is a reason why when the Europeans first discovered them, they still hadn't built a two story building, nor the wheel, nor created an alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genetics plays a huge factor in our lives, but people today want to believe that genetics don't matter.

       supremacist = ethnonationalist.  Unless you believe that a civilization's flaws and benefits depend uniquely on the perspective of the observer (meaning that they don't have inherent value in and of itself) then you believe there is one race that is superior to all the others, so your a supremacist... it just may not be your own race.

       Natural selection has halted within the human race.  Primarily because of our own bias to things like us (instead of mutations that benefit the entire culture).  Further proof that nurture is more dominant than nature.

       FYI, don't bring up IQ.  It is an outdated measurement of worth that has been long abandoned by the scientific community.  It causes you to appear ignorant.

       Only if you allow it to.  We have become more self aware than any other animal.  Due to this only the most animistic of us still depend on genetics to differentiate our worth.

       We didn't get pottery, blacksmithing, art, etc. until it took less than everyone working on food and there was surplus time.  And we as a whole benefitted.

       “The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from its profits or so dependent on its favors, that there will be no opposition from that class.” . . . “Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.” - Mayer Amschel Bauer Rothschild
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       "If all the bank loans were paid, no one could have a bank deposit, and there would not be a dollar of coin or currency in circulation. This is a staggering thought. We are completely dependent on the commercial banks. Someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation, cash, or credit. If the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous; if not, we starve. We are absolutely without a permanent money system. When one gets a complete grasp of the picture, the tragic absurdity of our hopeless situation is almost incredible -- but there it is." - Robert Hemphill
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       "Once a nation parts with the control of its currency and credit, it matters not who makes the nations laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognised as its most sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of parliament and of democracy is idle and futile." - William Lyon Mackenzie King

      <p>
       "There is nothing left now for us but to get ever deeper and deeper into debt to the banking system in order to provide the increasing amounts of money the nation requires for its expansion and growth. Our money system is nothing better than a confidence trick... The "money power" which has been able to overshadow ostensibly responsible government is not the power of the merely ultra-rich but is nothing more or less than a new technique to destroy money by adding and withdrawing figures in bank ledgers, without the slightest concern for the interests of the community or the real role money ought to perform therein... to allow it to become a source of revenue to private issuer's is to create, first, a secret and illicit arm of government and, last, a rival power strong enough to ultimately overthrow all other forms of government. ...An honest money system is the only alternative." - Frederick Soddy
      </p>

       “If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered….

      <hr/>
      <p>
       "The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it back again...
Take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for then this would be a better and happier world to live in. But if you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit." - Sir Josiah Stamp

       “When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes… Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain.” - Napoleon Bonaparte

      <hr/>
      <p>
       "Throughout the ages,the devices of cunning men have turned money to their nefarious purposes. Money, beginning with private enterprise as a means of escaping the limitation of barter, soon developed the cheat to exploit the honest trader who, in an effort to protect himself, turned to government for protection, only to find that now he had two thieves, the private money changer and the political plunderer working hand in glove against him. By this combination the money changer gained the prestige of political sanction through legislative license and the state secured a deceptive device for laying taxes upon the citizenry (by means of the hidden tax called inflation). It was and remains a vicious alliance." - E.C. Reigel
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       "The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks, which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank...sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world." - Carroll Quigley

       "Some people think Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions. 
They are not Government institutions. They are private credit monopolies which prey 
upon the people of the United States for the benefits of themselves and their foreign 
customers; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers; and rich and predatory 
money lenders. In that dark crew of financial pirates there are those who would cut a 
man's throat to get a dollar out of his pocket; there are those who send money into states 
to buy votes to control our legislation; and there are those that maintain an international 
propaganda for deceiving us... that will permit them to cover up their past misdeeds and 
set again in motion their gigantic train of crime . . . Mr. Chairman, we have in this country 
one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. The Federal Reserve 
Board has cheated the United States out of enough money to pay the national debt... Mr. 
Speaker, it is a monstrous thing for this great Nation to have its destiny presided over by 
a treasonous system acting in secret concert with International pirates and userers. Every 
effort has been made by the FED to conceal its power. But the truth is the FED has

Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.

       This is a great collection of banking quotes. I think most of them are generally correct, although I could nitpick on a few details here and there.

       Those individual people who collect government benefits, welfare, food, housing, HEAP, retirement, whatever -- are not in any way prevented from opposing governmental actions. For example, if you are over age 66 and you are entitled to retirement based on the rules, you get it regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
       This notion is dangerous because a casual reader may conclude that we should oppose our own programs for people -- poor people, old people, disabled people, people living in economically oppressed areas, etc. If that's the conclusion, the elites gain exactly what they want and the people suffer. I suggest you take this quote out next time you post.

       He's referring to the smart and educated people who see the system for what it is, and his point is that those people will either be greedy and buy in to it, or be poor enough that they can't do anything about it.

       Interesting view. I disagree. What exactly do you think they should have done/would have the power to do? What have you done with this information?
 They've held education events for MPs which I think are quite useful, explaining to them how money is created (and why that's a problem). They also have grassroots events all over the UK educating people about money creation.

As I said - what have you done to change things since you realised what a scam money creation is? At least they are out there raising awareness; that can't be bad. The more people who know about it the better IMHO.

       i'm not saying that for one second.  what i am saying is that property and renting (in fact all cost of living) are kept artificialy high while they steal the value of our wage with no other reason but to keep us working as long as they can to extract as much energy as they are able.   ie we are slaves on a plantation.   housing should not take 25-30 years to secure.

       In 2007ish fannie may et al secured loans for federal housing interest discounts, letting banks sign on risky loans so housing demand skyrocketted and with it prices and derivative mbs's. Values inflated, the big wallstreet players took their cut, fannie may et al went insolvant, massive foreclosures (banks land grab) and houses valued at far lower than they were bought at. The commercial banks did get thwomped but unclesam cut some big checks which were paid back. All around fabricated douchebaggery by the money holders that destabilized the 1st world for years. Now the fed (taxpayers money) pays them interest to keep money out of circulation to thwart hyperinflation.

       It's possible to buy out a lot of land and treat it as a holding just like any commodity. If it's in an area that's desirable enough, you can use that to your advantage to jack up what it's worth. It's a problem in a lot of coastal cities with a decent level of employment.

       Most of time you could rent a place, which would be cheaper than getting a mortgage and then paying it off, and then investing the difference in deposits, bonds, shares. With mortgage you're paying for like 2-3 houses you actually get, whilst with rent you're not. Presumably your rent would be based on local average, which would factor in the time to pay off the investment in a particular real estate object. This could be anywhere between 5-15 years. But still, for the owner it's the time enough to cover the cost of
       <strong>
        ONE
       </strong>
       object (house in this case).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgage is when you pay essentially for 2-3 houses over the course of those 15-25 years you take it on. So the difference between paying rent for 15 years, saving the rest of the money you'd otherwise spend on covering the mortgage, and paying the full mortgage is one full house that you will afford in the end anyway. Difference is, with rent you can move to a different place, can avoid property risks (if it all crashes, you're good, you've got liquid bonds, deposits and shares). Sure, you're losing out on appreciation of housing over time, but you're not exposed to the inherent risks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you compare the numbers, it's more value to not get the mortgage and rent, while investing the difference. So by having more financial knowledge and educating oneself of those other financial tools at your disposal you could escape the debt prison you're all so worried about.

       Were people not in poverty before the fractional reserve system?
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, there are fewer people (by percentage) in poverty right now than in any other time in human history. We have been steadily declining poverty over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is certainly something to be said about the wealth accumulating in the hands of the few, but this is not the result of our banking system, it has been an issue throughout human history. It is something that has constantly ebbed and waned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that our fractional reserve system has created poverty is downright absurd based on the facts. Poverty in the world is way less than it was 100 years ago.

       Poverty is a complicated term to operationalize.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is obvious that if you use a stringent understading of what poverty is then you're correct. We're doing better than ever.

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're using the standard defintion of poverty then this is the correct answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do interpret OP's post in a slightly different way. I think he talks about relative wealth and then the picture is very different.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are currently in an age of rapid technological and economical growth. We produce more goods than ever before by a large margin. But the surplus is absorbed by a very small percentage of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is especially notable in countries like the US, where we see that the average wages has gone down while productivity has soared.
      </p>
      <p>
       (source:
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/17/higher-productivity-used-to-mean-higher-wages-has-that-broken-down/?utm_term=.0e93e6dc2e43">

       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Not having the economical means to enjoy the fruits of a highly developed economy can certainly be interpreted as poverty. You might not starve to death, but you are excluded from many of the prime functions of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if we talk about relative wealth instead of poverty OP makes more sense.

       I disagree. You only have to go back to 1916, right after the founding of the fed, to find a wealth distribution like we have today. It steadily declined until about the 1980s, where it shifted around. If the fed were responsible for this, why did we see such a drop following it's enactment? Not to mention, there are many points throughout history where the wealth was heavily
       <a href="http://time.com/money/3977798/the-10-richest-people-of-all-time/">
        concentrated in the hands of the few.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wealth concentration is not a creation of the fed, it's always been around.

      <p>
       Notice how the rise of the wealth concentration coincides with the rise in automation and globalization, and about 70 years after the foundation of the fed. It's silly to point to the fed as the primary driver of this.

       I disagree. This isn't "poverty" by any stretch of the imagination. Is it profoundly unfair? Sure. Is it a recipe for social unrest? I believe so. But poverty it is not. That has a very specific meaning. If we want to say "relative wealth" then we shouldn't use the incorrect term "poverty."

       You are misunderstanding the post. There are fewer people living in poverty by percentage, but it isn’t about poverty, but the control of people through controlling the narrative of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was done in the past by sheer brutal force, enslavement, draconian autocratic laws, etc. but that wouldn’t work now due to the explosion in population, tech, etc. The establishment of the banking and fractional reserve system was a more sophisticated way of doing the same but at an even larger scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, less people live in abject poverty now, but those loving in debt has risen dramatically. That’s the control. That’s the conspiracy. That people don’t recognize this. That throwing everyone a bone so that they can afford a car (again this is only in a fraction of the world) and live in this consumerist society is enough to pacify us and let us blindly follow along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any wonder why the rogue countries who do not have the “correct” banking systems installed are so throughly vilified and need to be “saved”? This banking conspiracy extends to the whole world. It’s why much of South America still cannot recover.

       Don't get me wrong, I think there is a big problem with wealth concentrating in the hands of the few. However, I think trying to blame the fractional reserve system is ridiculous. After the founding of the fractional reserve, the amount of wealth in the hands of the top 10% followed a downward path to the bottom until the mid 80s, and then started to ramp back up. If the federal reserve is responsible for this, why did it take over 70 years for the wealth to start concentrating? Are we suggesting that the people who were in on this conspiracy were doing it to no benefit of themselves? It seems so silly to me.

       Typing on my phone so hard to get into too much detail, but Chile and recently Libya come to mind. I would also argue that those calling the shots are certainly not 10%, that club is much smaller. The concentration has certainly moved forward continuously for the handful of well known and less known banking families.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also point out that raising the living quality of the average population does not mean the system is not designed to further control the masses and use debt as its main tool. These are not mutually exclusive. Just like medical science in many areas have improved and child mortality rates have overall fallen, but it doesn’t mean the pharmaceutical industry and food industry isn’t using special interest and lobbyists to inflict incredible health issues and dependencies by the public. It’s not the best analogy but I’m trying to point out that binary thinking is a standard way of controlling the thought process.

       Sorry, I just can’t type that long on the phone, so just jotting down some quick thoughts.

       Easy. We went off the gold standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve couldn't have full control over the money supply while we were on the gold standard for obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you keep saying we have seen a decrease in poverty since the Federal Reserve act. Could be true, but correlation does not equal causation.
      </p>

       Who's to say we wouldn't have decreased poverty at an even higher rate if we didn't have the FR controlling the money supply.

       It create debt. Debt is passed to the people. How can you say we're less impoverished? You think the Fed and "poverty" statistics are in a vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       The increase of technology should allow people to get the same standard of living for working less. 50 years ago a family of 7 could live comfortably off of one parents salary, while owning a home and not taking on any other debt besides the mortgage.
      </p>
      <p>
       How are we less impoverished now? We're not. And yes, the Federal Reserve Act, repeal of glass steagall and the gold standard, fractional reserve banking all played a part. Our prurchasing power and standard of living has constantly been in devalued. If you think we're actually financially better off than we were 50-100 years ago then you're looking at things in a vacuum, and not at the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really think the Federal Reserve is something that benefitted the public?

       Money is not a cause nor a goal, it is just a tool. And indeed one that is warned about if it were used in the combination with interest on debt. We have now arrived at the part of the "tale" where we can more openly see and/ or experience the fruits of our labour and the labour of some influencing humanity behind the scenes. This is al reveiled slowly now for those willing to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       While our global econonies and monetary systems are slowly but surely breaking down some are already desperately calling for a "savior" and are forcefully grappling on to straws while they are looking for ways to preserve their view "reality" and way of living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckely for them the first "savior" has appeart on the horizon, Crypto currency is it's name. This will be followed by more and more people, completely convinced it is THE way to go. Until a certain point is reached where there is so much invested that some are ready to pop the bubble and some discover a thread to the safety of all the current Crypto's.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will cause chaos and will make loose some people all they have world wide. This will be the catalist and it will be used to present the next "savior" of humanity and the new "forced" globel crypto blockchain designed by AI. This AI is the second "savior" of humanity and will be followed by many until forced on almost all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AI Crypto will draw the world in furter until some are ready to get completely invested and are desperately wanting the "mark of the beast" placed into themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the acceptance of the mark of the beast, the rfid chip that will be implanted and willl be used for more and more until it becomes impossible to "live" without.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 5G cell networks, blue tooth, wifi and the internet of things is being rolled out and like always, some people are ready to jump on it and want to play with all they new toys. Very soon now people will start to get implanted cell phones and "led" contact lenses those things are already possible and our consumer products are just the tip of the iceberg of the tech that already exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where does this AI come from? Well, this is already running behing "the" and our screens. It is in the process of mapping everybody and evrything so it can make personal files on everything and know more about you then you yourself. The AI and d wave will be brought as our saviors becouse it will provide the ultimate global "solutions" for humanity. And when the AI is installed in the open and accepted by almost all people it will be used agains humanity in a way some can't even imagine now.
      </p>
      <p>
       We create our reality, when we observe something with our sensec WE manifest it in extistence and our reality. We do this with always, many, many, many times a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obeservation -&gt; thought -&gt; emotion -&gt; reaction -&gt; action -&gt; creating -&gt; observing -&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       An never ending cycle that goes on inside us all and represents our interactions between this reality, our body, our consiousness, our subconsiousness and our spirit. And we who can be in complete controll if we learn how to focus ourselves and consiousnesses are often not aware of this cycle becouse we are to distracted to notice it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity creates this world literary, the AI and those using it know this and are influencing and playing humanity for ever as seen from our perspective. We have a free will, so we need to give our concent before something can be manifested as real.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the moment our ego and mind determin if we want to actively play, or if we just want to ride along while somebody or something creates through you. Free will, ignorance, fear, indifference and many more things are making people more or less arware of the mechanics and games behind the screens. Ofcourse many tech and other manipulation is already used against humanity so we can give away our creative powers happely unaware or unknowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could AI make it worse? Well if humanity would allow every inch of their life monitored... their thoughts known through tech and media... their location, mood and all what is making them real... ALL the time....
      </p>
      <p>
       Well then AI could easely "hack" our connections between mind, body, soul and spirit and make you think what IT wants you to think and create while IT is able to observe and experience IT's desired reality through the tech. It will be using us as the creator while being the mind and observer through tech and programms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity is on the verge of being converted into drones that create the desires from some behind the AI, or even the AI itself and some will be cheering while it happens. The AI is the second anti-crist and the beginning of an end as is foretold by some.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE have the power, "they" can't create so they are using fear and our ego's against us. Keep us in duality and chaos, in misery and dispear, so we don't even want to find out the power WE all have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth, Forgiving and Love will set everybody free, but we all need to realise we can only change our reality in this moment the best. We need to face our own fears to re-unite with ourselves again and the more whole we get, the more we re-unite us all. And most important, don't forget to be honest to yourself and forgive yourself fo any mistakes, becouse they are only mistakes if you miss the teaching moments they gave you or somebody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't led fear or anger to tech get you, everything is just tools, you have the chose to use them for service to self, or service to others. But you always have the choise wether you want to learn more of these tools or stay asleep, this is free will at your service.

       trite i know.  but seriously you you never own land you are a tenant.   they can take it from you anytime they like.  same with your house.  if you look on any mortgage it even says tenant.

       Land is taxed as well.  Good point.  Not only that, the concept of living off just land, IE "off the grid", while idealistic and utopian sounding, isn't the way our world works anymore... If it ever worked like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are, for better or worse, a social animal.  We survive via societies that we create.  One cannot merely just live off the grid and sustain themselves or family.  It just doesn't work like that anymore.  The economy won't even allow it.  You will need income in order to buy the land, you will need income to maintain property taxes, where do you get that income?  It's just no feasable to think you can just live off the land like a hermit anymore.

       Nothing has ever been free. Ever. Even when there was no money, you paid with sweat. Which is the exact same thing I am talking about. This "free" you are talking about is sort of a myth. You are always working for someone, whether it is yourself, your family, your livestock, the land itself or the "man". Don't work in your fields, don't hunt, don't bring in food, your family will leave your ass whenever they want. In Native American tribes, when they were "free", if you didn't contribute to the group, your ass was out, whenever they wanted to toss you. The chief didn't like you, your ass was out. If you could name one time when humans were "free", I would like to know.

       The nomadic lifestyle was more free. (And this is the way nature tends to do it, with various great animal migrations.) It regards the land as mostly tending to itself, and you just go to where the excesses are before moving on when they're gone. It also doesn't try to consume all the resources, nor hold onto ones it's not using. It's when one group of people settles to one spot and blocks others moving to wherever the plenty is that causes issues.

       Say I borrow $100 from you. Now you say I owe $110. Where did that $10 come from? No value was created. It's just a leverage of unequal power. You used your money to "make" money. How?

       i get that, but that time with the hammer has value does it not? the value of that time is equivalent of that $10, so when you only count the money it sounds like its imbalanced.

      <p>
       time and services have value, and services performed don't actually put any money into circulation, yet are still worth something, this is what balances out the debt.

       You're missing the point, trying to nitpick the example. In real life every tool sits idle the vast majority of the time. Your block has 20 idle hammers and it needs just a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point was not about hammers but the theory of your economic system. If currency can be exchanged for something tangible on a fixed basis that keeps the economy grounded. Money at interest is made from thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask a bank for $1,000,000 for a big house. They agree. The bank needs only $100,000 to grant this loan, which is money that actually belongs to the other customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       30 years go by. I have repaid the $1,000,000 that went to wealthy landowners and construction companies. I have also "repaid" $1,000,000 in interest. Hey, that's a "good" interest rate! :/

       Like in my example earlier the loaned hammer is the same as the loaned $1million. The bank is charging you rent on that $1mil just like some one might charge you rent for usage of a hammer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In both scenarios, the owner of the desired item (hammer or $1mil) lends it out for a specified time, and wants the item back plus an extra charge for services rendered which in these cases is the rental fee for the hammer or the interest for the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       you are too hung up on the extra money being generated from nothing since you are selectively choosing where your economic system starts and ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used the hammer example to show that time and services may not be tangible things, but do indeed have monetary value. Just like working a job, you put in time and perform some sort of service for money. Obviously that money isnt created from thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest is not money created from thin air, its a fee for services provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively (and i think this is ultimately what you are getting at so hopefully you read this far into my ramblings) you
       <em>
        CAN
       </em>
       create debt out of thin air. If a kid comes to your house and you ask him to mow your lawn for $10. Once hes done hes essentially added $10 of debt to the economy out of thin air. Think of the kid mowing the lawn like the bank giving you the loan, and the $10 as the interest.

       Except the cases where it is. When a rent levied against something is more than the real value of that something (including value generated through its use) it causes problems. Basically you get economic singularities that have no real way of being paid off other than defaulting and clearing from the record.

       You are renting money. You have to return that money at the end of the rental period along with the cost of the rental. The extra million dollars is the cost of taking someone else's million dollars away from them for 30 years.

       It's your fee for loaning capital. Ideally your debtor uses the money to create something which creates money and pays you back. This is a pretty fair form of loaning. But if he didn't pay you back in time and you decided you need his car, that would be considered unfair.

       I completely disagree with the fundamental notion that the whole world is a conspiracy against common folk. This post is exactly that. The world isn't holding you down, you can climb up the system if you work hard enough and smart enough. Or if you can't do that in your life time you can set your kids up for success by teaching them the right values and core competencies that are required to succeed. Critical thinking is one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is an excuse to not do anything: "Oh why bother, all those crazy oligarchs are out there to enslave me. I amount to nothing
       <strong>
        only because
       </strong>
       those people exist." This kind of mentality shifts the locus of control onto those very people that you seem to be so against, those wealthy bankers, corporate CEOs etc that exist within this undoubtedly broken system. This is not the way to approach the problem, not by a long shot. You have to keep the control in your own hands, forge your own destiny, strive for own success. Nobody is reponsible for what you are except yourself. If you choose to get mortgage that you'll be paying off for the rest of your life, that's your choice. There are alternatives, you just didn't bother to learn them. Every little shortcut you take: "oh I'll just get this payday loan just this once, I'm sure it'll be fine", or "I'll just grab a beer and chill at home, instead of doing my personal finances this time, I'm tired"; all those shortcuts are your own choices, which end up enslaving you. Social media - you get addicted to likes, ruin your life, become miserable. That's your own choice. You invest into a ponzi scheme, because you can't think for yourself and messed with something you didn't understand. Sorry to break it to you, but 99% of what's happening to you is
       <strong>
        your fault
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't blame everybody else for your shortcomings, educate yourself, learn to think critically and get atop of this broken system to try and fix it.

       I think you make a good counter arguement.  There is section of the population that, based on hard work, studying, etc, can rise above.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's true.  But, the fundamental issue is still that the system is protecting the owning class.  What's worse is that over the last 35 years or so, the system has been working even harder to expand the power and wealth ownership of the 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a class war and you and are are on the losing end of it.  Can we break through it?  Some of us can.  Work hard, go to school, and you can get a job within the system and make in into the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       But getting into the ownership class becomes harder and harder as corporations consolidate and make the barriers to entry into markets as a business owner harder and harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the point, I think the OP is trying to make.  Your point is also valid, but your point allows for only a small group of the 99% to get by.  The rest of the 99% continue to see thier wages stagnate and their wealth to be transferred to the 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's statistically factual.  You can see the wealth transfer that has been going unchecked for decades now.

       Consolidation of power is a problem, I agree, but it isn't irreversible either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem with consolidation right now is that it comes from information control. Information is the true wealth right now and people give it away for free. People sacrifice their privacy for convenience and that's what destroys them as a class right now. Facebook can be facebook because it has all those people sharing information, which facebook promptly monetises. Understanding that is very difficult and most people don't want to, so they are stuck within this cycle. And there's hardly anything that we can do except educate them on why they should protect information and don't let the government be in charge of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worrying trend of consolidation of power has become even scarier due to the fact that before, humans were the source of labour, hence the absolute necessity for those with power. Basically, nothing can be done if you don't have people on your side. So all those who usurped too much got punished in the end by the angry mob. The situation right now is that we can build robots that do everything that humans used to do, and they do it better. Now this centralisation of wealth is more dangerous, because people matter less and less, up to the point that a small army of robots will just crush any resistance, should it arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, in order for people to stop being slaves they have to liberate themselves by giving up everything non-essential, like social media (great means of controlling people, btw). Decentralisation is a great effort to ensure that nobody is significant enough to dictate how the life is to be. So once again people have to educate themselves of that, incorporate these principles in every job they do, even minor ones. Coding is particularly good, because it's easy to implement decentralised storage/processing/etc. and it has it's own very beneficial use-cases. Within an organisation one could make each team more autonomous, should one hold enough weight inside an org. All those things add up and form the mindset that we don't need one big governing agency to sort everything for us, because that's what breeds corruption. Centralisation of wealth happens because everything else is being centralised as well, we give that away voluntarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the final point I want to make is that people are people in the end. We can be easily corrupted to join the elite in their conquest to control, wealth and centralisation. Basically the scenario is as follows: you have a poor guy, who is sick of being poor, so he works really hard, achieves great results, becomes financially independent. Keeps building on to his success and becomes richer ever so steadily. Every buck that he makes brinds him closer to becoming engulfed by this idea of making a little bit more at some poor guy's expence. And so this poor guy who was once a victim becomes the abuser itself through his journey to the top, because he's feeble and succeptible to the temptation. This shit happens all the time and that's why this war will never truly end. Corruption is a virus that cannot be erradicated, so we must strive to the top,
       <strong>
        whilst keeping a strict ethical position regarding this climb to the top
       </strong>
       . This is something that needs to be taught and focused on through critical thinking. This isn't easy to teach, because the person has to be able to come to this conclusion on one's own. Compassion, empathy are very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, sorry for the wall of text, it's not really well-structured, just thoughts and conclusions that I've come to. Basically it all comes down to conciously striving to the top of the system while maintaining this perspective of what the true struggle is. It's also absolutely vital to build a functioning system of checks and balances to keep yourself in place. This way, you'll better the world and not succumb to the corruption. But this is all wishful thinking, I fear that dark times lie ahead.

       It's important for the next generation to begin to turn the tide, as you mentioned it comes down to being properly skilled, but more importantly it's about being able to properly analyze the world around you.

       You're a boot locker who has been programmed to suckle from the propaganda of the ruling class tit to feel alright. Debt has historically been used for the aristocrat class to keep themselves in power and suppress the poor people below them. There are instances when governments disallowed usury and the predatory nature was put at bay, but rich merchants start to influence governments and strip laws away allowing for the concentration of capital. Once concentrated, they create a system of near slavery for their people as they lock them into debts of certain forms with unreasonable ways to pay it back. This generally will cause revolutions, as a main tenant of a revolution is absolving debt.

       Theres nothing wrong with money,loans and inflation, if you look at money as just an accounting tool,used to detrmine if something is worth producing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the idea of money goes bad is when it gets turned into just another commodity to be bought and sold. Especially when people are taking it out of circulation by hoarding it

       It's not actually possible for there to be infinite money for everyone.  If money doesn't have a constraint on supply ( like bitcoin or gold) there need to be artificial restraints, or it quickly loses all value.  Yes, currency is made out of thin air, and the elites take advantage of their privilege and use currency to accumulate real wealth and productive assets.  But if you just give large amounts of currency to everyone, it isn't worth anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       There could be prosperity for all, yes.  But elites do their best to thwart that, and a large percentage of people are not willing or capable of doing what they need to do for a decent existence even if they had the opportunity.

       I agree with many of the concepts here, but the economy is much more complicated than you are making it out to be.  The value of money in an economy is based upon confidence in that money, and upon production of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone having money is great, but it won't help anything without production and distribution.

       The only problem with your theory is inflation.  If everyone had enough money to pay for everything, everything would cost a few hundred times more after enough time has passed and everyone would be in the same caste.

       I remember in 11th grade when my teacher was explaining how America was "trillions of dollars" in debt to China and I just found that instantly so absurd. I had a couple thoughts such as....
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         How could anyone ever get trillions in debt?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the person lending these trillions out why would they continue to lend?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         HOW IN THE FUCK would ANYONE (short of war) attempt to get that loan back?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How would we even pay it back? Write a check "To China .... Thanks - USA"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why can't we just print more money? --&gt; THIS ONE got me a lot of flak from my teacher. He acted almost insulted by the concept. I tried saying that all money REALLY is....is just green paper. YOU CAN'T JUST PRINT MORE MONEY JUGGERNAUT!!! - uhm......yeah sure we could. We print money daily.

       I remember how I kept questioning my teacher after he explained we went away from the gold standard. I was saying that if our money had no exact standard of worth, what was to stop the feds from fucking with the value of the dollar to keep us in poverty? And I was just told I wasn't getting the concept and to stop asking questions.

       <em>
        How could anyone every get trillions in debt?
       </em>
       By borrowing more and more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        If the person lending these trillions out why would they continue to lend?
       </em>
       Because the borrower is a good customer. That trillions is not one lump debt that is never paid back. It is an enormous number of small loans that are constantly being paid back with interest. Since the borrower constantly makes good on its obligations, and the lender constantly makes money, why wouldn't the lender continue to loan money to the borrower?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        HOW IN THE &amp;
       </em>
       %$ would ANYONE (short of war) attempt to get that loan back?*
That is right on the money. Short of war (economic or military), no one is foreclosing on the U.S. government. The real threat is if the government didn't pay its debts, no one would loan it any more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        How would we even pay it back? Write a check "To China .... Thanks - USA"
       </em>
       Essentially, that is exactly what happens. The U.S. government is constantly writing checks to pay off all the many loans it has taken out. Also, those loans are not just to the Chinas of the world; many of those loans are to pension funds and mutual funds. Even ordinary citizens of the U.S.A. can and do loan money to the government by buying Treasury Bills/Bonds and U.S. savings bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Why can't we just print more money?
       </em>
       Lots of people have asked this question. The basic problem is that money is not value in and of itself. It is just a way to represent and track value. In a complex modern world, there is no way a pure barter system can realistically work. What individuals (and companies) produce is too large or too specific or too abstract. Instead, everyone receives an accounting and record of the goods and services they produce. This is an accounting of the
       <em>
        value
       </em>
       added by the individual or company. Now, when someone wants something (food, housing, to employ someone, etc), they give away a part of the accounting of the value they have produced in exchange for what they want. In the old days, before computers and banks, the representation and accounting of value needed to be something reasonably portable and hard to produce (so no one could just create their own). Precious metal coins, for example, were a decent way to do that, and money was invented. Once banks became common, it really wasn't necessary to have the
       <br/>
       representation of value have any intrinsic value of its own. The accounting ledgers of the bank did the job of storing and tracking the changes in each person/company/government's value. And paper/fiat money was born. Today, in the wealthier parts of the world, many do without any physical money at all. How do we even do that? Remember, the physical money was just a way to represent and track our value. Now all that can be done much better with electronic records. When we buy, we subtract from our records of our store of value. Whey we sell (goods or our time and labor), we add to our records of our store of value.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Wait, you never said why the government can't just print more money to pay off the loans to China!
       </em>
       You are right, at least not directly. Sorry. Printing paper money is no different than just adding more zeroes to the end of the number in the bank account. The problem is that those extra zeroes aren't representing any value created by anyone. "So, what!?" you say. Well, if the representation of value increases, but there is no extra value lying around, what you are really, really saying is that each unit of representation is really representing less value. In other words, more dollars, same amount of stuff, each dollar just represents less of the stuff. Essentially, you get hyper-inflation. If each dollar is worth less, pretty soon, that loaf of bread is going to cost you $1000 dollars, because each dollar doesn't represent nearly as much value as it used to represent; you need a lot more of them to get the same value.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole discussion is why economist often talk about the U.S. government debt in terms of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. GDP is a way of adding up the total value produced by everyone in the country. Since the U.S. government gets its "money" by taxing us, they are taking a share of the value we created to be used (in the best case) to provide services back to us. As long as the U.S. government sticks to using the value they took from us or borrowed, and doesn't go about "magically" creating "money", the accounting of our personal value doesn't get negatively impacted.

       That's not much of a problem... it's not like the other countries acquire that money (unless they right out steal the money of their customers.... which wouldn't be a good business practice).  The real issue is that they don't have to pay taxes on this wealth, so the millions if not billions that are now unaccounted for is distributed to the rest of us.

       Putting money in a bank is effectively lending the bank the money. So lending an offshore bank the money means that a foreign bank has to pay the interest (if any) on the loan and that a foreign bank can expand a foreign currency by fractional lending. The U.S.A. generally does not tax wealth (except inheritances), but the U.S. does tax earnings by U.S. citizens even if the money is earned outside the U.S. Of course, there are offshore "tax havens" that don't report earnings, so the U.S. does not receive any taxes from those sources.

       Imagine a world where nobody worked. Who would grow all the food you eat? Would you have as much variety available to you if you did it yourself? Would you have any modern conveniences? A car, a computer, a television, indoor plumbing even? No thanks, I'll keep doing my job as long as others do theirs and I value the contributions they make. Society works because everyone is doing their part. Are there parasites? You bet your ass. The banks, CEOs, and stock traders. They are the real problem. Take and take is all they do.

       Banks are basically the unelected government and the rich are the welfare leeches. Plebs spend their whole lives working hard to pay off loans with interest to the banks, and then the banks give away the money to the rich just because they are rich.

       Yes, the world is very unfair, unequal, and corrupt. However, if you live in the USA and make at least minimum wage, you are still basically enjoying all of the benefits that we get from tricking the rest of the world into manufacturing our goods, and the beaurocratic indirect plundering of the world's resources through our imperialistic economic and political policies.

       I bought my house in 2012 when the market was down. $70,000 for a 4 bedroom house on an acre of land in Los Angeles. It has almost quadrupled in value in the last 6 years. I rented it out for 2 years. I stopped working and lived off the rent money I received while I lived at my parents house. I helped them pay off their house and now they own it. They have no mortgage holding them down. My mortgage is $580 a month in Los Angeles county!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone has to actively participate in the rat race. It is possible to walk thru it like me. Do you think that by earning $50,000 to $150,000 a year you are really living better than someone on welfare? Is your $60,000 vehicle, small $750,000 house in Los Angeles or San Francisco with no yard, and health insurance really worth commuting over an hour every weekday to work 40 to 60 hours a week to come home, eat, shower, and fall asleep? That's not living. I think its better to focus on the $10,000 boat rather than the $1,000,000 boat. They both float.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, you can cut out the middleman and retire before you are 35 if you can settle for a cheap lifestyle.

       Money is not infinite.  There is a predetermined amount of natural resources in the world and (due to supply and demand) everything is worth a fraction of that wealth.  Fact is, you are just putting too much emphesis on money... which is only a promise that others will give you things if you spend it.

       More than a few people have been on welfare for two to three generations, they have nothing but "free time" yet they create nothing, have horrific family values (if any values at all), have been entitled to the point they feel the world owes them a completely free ride including everything that people who work their asses off have.

       This smells like a bad psyop. Infinite currency is not infinite value. If you print too much money, you devalue all of the other currency in circulation. In fact, this is how you're being controlled. Not because of OP's childish "omg print me some money too!" explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bank fucks over the people by printing money and giving it to themselves and then charging the government (taxpayers) interest on the "loan" they just created. Of course, the government has to want to do that, but since the bank essentially owns the government, it's always happening. The net effect is that not only do you as a taxpayer owe more tax to pay for this "loan", your existing currency in your bank account or wallet is now worth less than before as well. Meanwhile, a banker somewhere gets paid a nice bonus and a Rothschild is paid interest for money he created out of thin air the instant he decided to "loan" it to you.

       There is not an infinite amount of money. Sure they can print whatever they want, but inflation and the cost of living are constantly on the rise. The more money printed, the less it's worth. Quantitative easy will reak havoc on future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are locked into this system until it is reformed, or deteriorates I reckon. When it does, a global currency may emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, money is considered tertiary. It has no value, it is a measure of wealth.

       Thanks for the post. I've been researching this kind of stuff since I was 18 or 19. I'm quite familiar with the basics, but my mind can't wrap around the big picture. It's too dynamic for my brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think of myself as a realist, but most people would call me a pessimist. From my limited understanding of things, I have no idea how we are going to continue on like this. I've even questioned if I should have children based on the way society is headed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose all I can do is keep my head up, and enjoy my limited number of days here. I like George Carlin's words. "When you're born into this world, you're given a ticket to the freak show. If you're born in America you get a front row seat."

       Hippy liberal lurker checking in. Great post OP. Not everyone should live like Bill Gates but there is more than enough resources and money for everyone to live like a lower middle class American. We(the world) have the resource for every human to have a roof over their head, electricity, running water and 3 squares a day. In return those individuals (who are able) can work 40 hours making the world a better place.

       i'm not saying that for one second.  what i am saying is that property and renting (in fact all cost of living) are kept artificialy high while they steal the value of our wage with no other reason but to keep us working as long as they can to extract as much energy as they are able.   ie we are slaves on a plantation.   housing should not take 25-30 years to secure.

       Most of time you could rent a place, which would be cheaper than getting a mortgage and then paying it off, and then investing the difference in deposits, bonds, shares. With mortgage you're paying for like 2-3 houses you actually get, whilst with rent you're not. Presumably your rent would be based on local average, which would factor in the time to pay off the investment in a particular real estate object. This could be anywhere between 5-15 years. But still, for the owner it's the time enough to cover the cost of
       <strong>
        ONE
       </strong>
       object (house in this case).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgage is when you pay essentially for 2-3 houses over the course of those 15-25 years you take it on. So the difference between paying rent for 15 years, saving the rest of the money you'd otherwise spend on covering the mortgage, and paying the full mortgage is one full house that you will afford in the end anyway. Difference is, with rent you can move to a different place, can avoid property risks (if it all crashes, you're good, you've got liquid bonds, deposits and shares). Sure, you're losing out on appreciation of housing over time, but you're not exposed to the inherent risks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you compare the numbers, it's more value to not get the mortgage and rent, while investing the difference. So by having more financial knowledge and educating oneself of those other financial tools at your disposal you could escape the debt prison you're all so worried about.

       As a parent I'm already considering how to implement coding into my kids education.  But my wife and I are already instilling empathy and compassion into their lives.

       It's important for the next generation to begin to turn the tide, as you mentioned it comes down to being properly skilled, but more importantly it's about being able to properly analyze the world around you.

       All true except I would re-phrase that last statement.  There is no intended meaning that I know of for the races.  What could be said, however, is that due to differences among the races, especially IQ, it is therefore difficult for them to live in harmony when in close proximity.  (different goals and ways of achieving goals.  Differences in delayed gratification, and therefore crime and punishment. etc.)  IMHO.

       So what happens when people take money and value and move it out of the country using offshore accounts?
      </p>

       Shouldn't this problem be fixed especially when the Paradise papers came out and showed how many people are getting away with moving money around?

       That's not much of a problem... it's not like the other countries acquire that money (unless they right out steal the money of their customers.... which wouldn't be a good business practice).  The real issue is that they don't have to pay taxes on this wealth, so the millions if not billions that are now unaccounted for is distributed to the rest of us.

       Except the cases where it is. When a rent levied against something is more than the real value of that something (including value generated through its use) it causes problems. Basically you get economic singularities that have no real way of being paid off other than defaulting and clearing from the record.
