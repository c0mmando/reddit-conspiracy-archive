<p>We are basically told their society the greatest in the world at the time simply fell apart due to immigration and in fighting in addition to barbarian hordes</p>

<p>Not a bad explanation.</p>

<p>Why is it that no civilization prior to us developed industrial technology? Electricity?</p>

<p>It is known that Egypt and Rome were working together during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius,</p>

<p>Both these societies have an unexplainably high standard of architecture and an unimaginable level of detail in their statues maybe i am underestimating their artisans but is it not odd that both of the most successful ancient civilizations seem so much more advanced then we are taught they were, we are to believe they used chisels to make mathematically perfect statues.</p>

<p>What I am getting at is what if the Egyptian and Roman ruling class decided they wanted long term world domination? Not an unusal desire for narcissistic dictators.</p>

<p>They had the most advanced societies in the world at the time.</p>

<p>So my theory is they intentionally collapsed their own societies and made sure all of their most important innovations and knowledge and technologies and of course wealth were kept safe in areas only accessible to selected Elites,</p>

<p>This would plunge humanity as a species back decades maybe centuries technologically while the elites would stay at the level they were before the collapse of their societies,</p>

<p>This would ensure for the rest of human history the elites would have the wealth and knowledge and such a headstart on technology that they would be impossible to defeat financially, and militarily they would have a private force with weapons decades to centuries more advanced than anyone that might challenge them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like it may at least be in the right ball park. No idea whether you set any store by it, but the Bible says that the Rome world power remains in control until the end. Although it evolves into something quite different to what it started out as, it is still the same basic entity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sure it has deep ties to the &quot;Roman&quot; Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The Vatican is a labyrinth of deception, a known haven of pedophiles (a Roman tradition, they were very hedonistic) with extreme influence both politically and on over a billion individuals, </p>

<p>Not to mention the Vatican is the organization which censored Galileos work for over a century and banned him from ever teaching or writing again. Intentionally holding back important knowledge from the world.</p>

<p>The Vatican is known to maintain a &quot;Secret Archive&quot; which contains 53 MILES of shelving worth of documents going back to the 1600s (and that&#39;s just when the archive was started so it likely contains documents much older than that)</p>

<p>And thats separate from the Vaticans limited access library of over 1.2 million books and documents.</p>

<p>Here is the Wikipedia description of &quot;The Holy See&quot; (All-Seeing Eye?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he Holy See , also referred to as the See of Rome, is the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome, the episcopal see of the Pope, and an independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the Catholic Church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes.</p>

<p>As an independent sovereign entity, holding the Vatican City enclave in Rome as an independent state, it maintains diplomatic relations with other states. It is viewed as analogous to a state while administered by the Roman Curia (Latin for Roman Court), similar to a centralised government with the Cardinal Secretary of State as its chief administrator, and various dicasteries, comparable to ministries and executive departments.</p>

<p>Diplomatically, the Holy See acts and speaks for the whole church. It is also recognised by other subjects of international law as a sovereign entity, headed by the Pope, with which diplomatic relations can be maintained.[2][3] Although it is often informally referred to as &quot;the Vatican&quot;, the &quot;Holy See&quot; is not the same entity as the &quot;Vatican City State&quot;, which came into existence only in 1929 because of the Lateran Treaty; the Holy See, the episcopal see of Rome, dates back to antiquity. Ambassadors are officially accredited not to the Vatican City State but to &quot;the Holy See&quot;, and Papal representatives to states and international organizations are recognized as representing the Holy See, not the Vatican City State. The creation of the Vatican City State was meant to ensure the diplomatic and spiritual independence of the Pope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s definitely those out there that believe basically we can renounce our legal fictions (UPPERCASE NAMES) and be recompensed for money stolen from us by &quot;alien&quot; fictional entities.  There&#39;s a law from the late 1600&#39;s in the U.S. that deals with it, and some people claimed you could even set up a bank account with the Federal Reserve personally and withdraw money directly under your actual personhood, not legal fiction.  </p>

<p>Come on, before making a non-sense theory, read some history articles. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science</a></p>

<p>Boltzmann did hang himself while being depressed, because other physicists and philosphers were making fun out of his atoms+molecules theory. This was proven to be a real scientific fact just 3 years later in 1909.</p>

<p>OP, I hope you understand that people in the past were probably even more ignorant  and stupid. And how much of the science is new. Of course, most of it was created in countries with the right conditions. You can&#39;t create science in a dogmatic, fanatical environment.</p>

<p>Many of the great physicists and mathematicians actually wrote some of their most important articles while being in jail...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, what were the literacy rates in these times? While passing by knowledge through word of mouth is good for some things, it&#39;s not good for more complicated things. If only 5% of a people can read/write <em>their own language</em> what are the chances that complex things like architecture and arithmetic are passed through word of mouth for hundreds of years?

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that human civilization has occurred again and again, with natural disasters being the greatest determining factor as the “reset” button. </p>

<p>For example, if our civilization were to suddenly collapse — there wouldn’t be much archeological evidence to figure out why, as all our data is now stored on computers, discs, and in the internet. It would seem as if it “vanished suddenly”.  Do you think a human thousands of years in the future, presumably in a future civilization (not necessarily more advanced) would know what an iPad was if they dug one up? How would they explain the similarities to all the excavated McDonald’s across the world?</p>

<p>So if prior civilizations were extremely advanced such as ours, it will always seem puzzling to the archeologists of the future. It’s hard to determine something outside of your understanding of society/civilization. Imagine explaining a CD to someone from the Middle Ages. It would require ridiculous amounts of background context to even begin to explain. </p>

<p>I don’t believe that Rome collapsed on purpose, but I do believe there were some people that definitely benefited from its collapse (in a regionalist direct power sense)— as there will be with the inevitable collapse of the West. </p>

<p>Imagine human civilization is like the movie “mother!” </p>
