        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT: My headline is slightly mistaken.</p>

<p>*There is NBC footage online from right around the assassination attempt, BUT I am searching for their Anchor John Chancellor reporting the dinner date Neil Bush had scheduled with John Hinckley&#39;s brother the next day or so after the assassination.
*</p>

<p>Take a look into trying to find information from NBC regarding the Reagan assassination attempt by Bush family acquaintance John Hinckley from a rival energy company family.</p>

<p>Scan the internet looking for NBC commentary on the March 30th 1981 (The day of the attempt).</p>

<p>You will only find footage of the actual attempt with zero commentary from NBC or anchor John Chancellor.</p>

<p>Every other US channel has representative commentary from that day available online except NBC. Why?</p>

<p>Reagan had only been in office for 69 days at that point &amp; the next in line was CIA Bush Sr.</p>

<p>During NBC&#39;s commentary national anchor John Chancellor makes a &quot;That&#39;s incredibly strange&quot; raised eyebrow pause when he reads that John Hinckley&#39;s family were acquainted with the Bush family.</p>

<p>I have seen it before but after many years I wanted to download a copy for myself &amp; keep for historical purposes. To my surprise after many hours of searching I couldn&#39;t believe that ALL NBC commentary footage <del>from</del> about that day is unavailable via google &amp; youtube searches.</p>

<p>If anyone has it.....please contact me it would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>MUST WATCH******
I recommend watching the whole thing but put the timestamp link to get to the point about Bush/Hinckley association.</p>

<p>Here is a difficult find from ABC source republished by someone archiving difficult to find historical footage:
It is not the footage I set out to find, BUT talks about the Bush Hinckley association from a network television source.
<a href="https://youtu.be/l_mvsF42PQ0?t=3m13s">https://youtu.be/l_mvsF42PQ0?t=3m13s</a></p>

<p>Newspaper articles published about the association between the families seem to be impossible to reference anymore via search engines.</p>

<p>&quot;Hinckley&#39;s reportedly know the Bushes&quot; article Boston Globe will only appear as a book reference &amp; nowhere else.
Houston Post original articles were taken offline and maybe available thru microfiches at the Houston Library.</p>

<p>Trying to confirm articles on March 30 or 31st 1981</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I don&#39;t see it in this video. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty certain that it was initially reported on the day after the assassination attempt when the original newspaper articles came out &amp; Chancellor reports it on the news.</p>

<p>My wording in OP may be confusing. I am looking for the commentary about March 30th, 1981 where he does it, but it doesn&#39;t have to be from the broadcast on March 30th, 1981. Hope that makes better sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And now another civilization topside is referring to us as a conspiracy theoried hidden hollow world that the Americans were rumored to seek out pre WW2 in Antarctica after exploring and naming part of it NewSouthland. 
Sounds reasonable. It would explain all the echoes.</p>

<p>All fun aside, I&#39;ve never heard of the Bush Hinkley connection, but I can say, it is less surprising than I wish it was. Political connections connecting dots to critical decisions and events are becoming more evident as time passes, and yet there is this elusive grey area just off the horizon that is always blown out of proportion so as to lead us on a goose chase that, although equally sinister to what will actually happen, allows others to label people who know that such connections exist as liars and even ,quite truthfully, conspiracy theorists. I hope that with more and more dots appearing, this too, will change. But as a circular history shows, it might come at a minute too late to do much about it.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t hurt trying though.</p>
