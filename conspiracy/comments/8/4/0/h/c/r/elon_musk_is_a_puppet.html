    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, somethings are interesting, but very obvious the author has no concept of how business or science works. He really lost me at the end when talking about the falcon heavy rockets landing. “Rockets don’t land like that, it was a take off reversed.”   Well that’s where you’re wrong there buckaroo. Rockets DO land like that, it’s a result of technology.  Anyway, some interesting points thrown in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a thread awhile back with someone asking if  Elon was legit or not and mentioned he also mentioned Tony Stark.  I&#39;ll repeat my response again here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SpaceX is a fraud just like NASA. They are supposed to be the &quot;Independent private sector&quot; space agency but they get $ billions from the tax payers and are closer to a Hollywood agency than a space agency.</p>

<p>So long story short, to me Elon is just the spokesperson pawn playing the role of the &quot;Iron Man&quot; type character.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SpaceX doesn&#39;t just &quot;get&quot; billions of $ from tax payers, SpaceX provides a service to NASA by launching their equipment and soon people to ISS.</p>

<p>They are paid because they won the contract for these services - and importantly was and is far cheaper than other aerospace companies for these services - thus have actually saved US taxpayers money compared to competitors.</p>

<p>While SpaceX was about to go under if not for the original COTS program award by NASA, the majority of their current funding is from launching services for private telecommunication companies, in addition to national security, and NASA missions.</p>

<p>Far as the original OP, you clearly haven&#39;t been following SpaceX/Musk all that long to see the progression as it happened (with many setbacks) and only basing your view in hindsight of your ignorance.</p>

<p>If there is anyone who is a spook its fucking Mr. CIA Bezos with Blue Origin.  Or any of the other aerospace companies (like ULA which is a Lockheed/Boeing - aka deep military complex - company and was raping US taxpayers for years on ballooning costs.</p>

<p>Lol,  Yes that is what they tell you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and soon people to ISS.</p>

<p>Sounds legit.  Apparently you have never researched just how fake &quot;people on the ISS&quot; are.  It&#39;s literally a joke to believe people are living on the ISS going around earth at 17,000mph.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>thus have actually saved US taxpayers money compared to competitors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol &quot;saved taxpayers money&quot;??  Do you realize how dumb that sounds?  How is faking sending stuff to space saving anyone money?  I think you are missing the point.  Space X is a fraud just like NASA.  They are not sending anything to space so they are not saving taxpayer money, they are stealing it.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are the one that has blind trust in them.  You don&#39;t even care how bad the CGI is you still trust them without question.  This latest &quot;car in space&quot; stunt was so ridicules even Elon publicly said &quot;you know it is real because it looks so fake&quot;  Lol and you believe him because &quot;Elon would never lie to us&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So seeing something in the sky that you perceive as the &quot;iss&quot; proves people are living inside that object?  I&#39;m sorry but that is poor logic.  You have no idea what the object is you are seeing, how far away it is, the size of it or if it is even a solid object at all. </p>

<p>All that being said I really doubt that you personally have &quot;clearly&quot; seen the &quot;iss&quot; through a telescope.  If so did you photograph it because most of the ones I see look very fake.   </p>

<p>What is his evil agenda? Electric cars, space travel, and decentralized power grids? Seems pretty much like the ultimate populace movement to me...he&#39;s battling guys like Warren Buffett in Las Vegas to create a rooftop solar revolution...where&#39;s the conspiracy?</p>

<p>He&#39;s getting where he is because his tech out-competes conventional tech in our capitalist System...he can do what NASA etc want to do at a much lower cost, that&#39;s why he gets so much funding.</p>

<p>He can&#39;t be president because hes not born here. He&#39;s leading the discussion/research efforts about the dangers of AI, and hes undeniably improving our science base in this country. What about him seems evil?</p>

<p>Instead of pontificating about him being part of the problem, maybe you should realize his career is a model for what we need in this country: better science education for young Americans. If there were more musk&#39;s out there, maybe oil and gas companies wouldn&#39;t have a monopoly on engineering in higher education and maybe we would have more disruptive technology to put the oil-ogarchs out of business.</p>
