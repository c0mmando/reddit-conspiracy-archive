       SS: Why is this sub suddenly so overwhelmingly anti-Russia? 'Russiagate' skeptics get downvoted into oblivion while those supporting the mythical Russian collusion narrative get big upvotes. What gives? It's not normal for members of this side to bandwagon onto one side of a political issue. This doesn't seem organic at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, see
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8443cc/tillerson_says_exspys_poisoning_in_uk_clearly/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8443cc/tillerson_says_exspys_poisoning_in_uk_clearly/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Comment stating "It's pretty obvious that Russia has something on Trump" gets 50 upvotes. Those offering an opposite/alternative perspective get bombed with downvotes. This pattern is repeated over and over in Russia-centered posts on this sub and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still believe most organic /conspiracy sub followers are genuine, skeptical free-thinkers. The anti-Russia bandwaggoning reeks of shilling/brigading. This sub is under major attack and the goal is to maximize fear and suspicion toward Russia and Trump.

       I haven't been banned for no reason to censor my political speech yet like I was when CTR took over r/politics in the spring of 2016. I'm not too worried about being "taken over" here, although I will admit the infiltration and vote manipulation is annoying.

       The comments will be interesting in this post. But what I will state is what we s3e in America today is what was seen in Europe at the beginning of the cold war. Same propaganda tactics are being used.

       Hmm. I really dislike the term “free thinker”. In my opinion, it’s too often used to imply “I’m right and you’re wrong” or to suggest that someone is dumb or uninformed. I’m not sure if that’s what OP meant, at least that’s not what I got out of it, but I see his point and we have certainly been under constant pressure to push that story down our throats. The conversation is almost always defeated to name calling or discard partisan inclinations.

       It's normal for any President to have enemies. It's not normal for users of this sub to overwhelmingly fall on one side of a controversial political issue, and that's weekdays happening here. There's an attempt to 'manufacture consent' and to create a false sense of the users of this sub as anti-Trump and anti-Russia.

       The biggest sign that something is up is that the MSM and IC under Obama created this Russia-Trump conspiracy theory, follow that with the fact that
       <em>
        outside
       </em>
       users push the theory, my favorite complaint to deniers being: " you guys believe every baseless conspiracy theory, why won't you believe this one?!"

       Exactly - many of us are anti-bullshit and anti-govt. I'm anti-Trump for sure, but I was also anti-Obama. And I see right through this tired old march to war with Russia. It's the same thing they do every time they need a new enemy. We don't know what to do without an enemy and I believe our propped up economy just might collapse. So they manufacture consent as you said. It's really fucking depressing to watch this in slow motion and not be able to do anything about it. By co-opting the so-called "left" they've also ensured there won't be any protests to oppose this new cold war except from those of us on the crazy fringes.

       You said it in the title: shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are lots of pro-Establishment shills here, and they use votebots. They don't want you criticizing the Russia narrative, and they don't want you to discuss any conspiracy that potentially makes their handlers look bad (ie. Pizza/Pedogate, Seth Rich, Uranium-1, etc.) Its very obvious, and the best solution I've found is to just block all of them.

       Yes. I find the amount of Putin and Trump defenders in a conspiracy sub to be perplexing. All are welcome to their opinion, but I see posts and comments every day trying to shut down dissent of two of the most powerful leaders in the world. In a conspiracy sub. It doesn't make any sense to me.

       Why is this the only theory where we get 15 posts a day saying "Guys stop talking about this. There's nothing to see here. It upsets me when we talk about any possible connection between Trump and Russia."

       I see you post to Trump subs and the CBTS stream so I'm guessing you're a supporter of his. And I'm guessing that's why you hate discussing this particular conspiracy theory.

       I've seen zero evidence of the mythical Trump-Putin collusion. If there was any evidence, I'd be willing to consider it. But as far as I can tell, it's a political hit job. The dems don't want to accept responsibility for their loss. It also gives the establishment overlords the excuse they needed to clamp down on internet freedom of information, social media censorship etc... which is something they wanted to do anyway. Freedom of information is dangerous, so there are many who want to limit that freedom as much as possible.

       Just curious, what conspiracy theories do you believe in? I would be willing to bet you don't need to look through a folder of evidence to get behind at least a few of those theories. There is an on going investigation right now. When it's over, they will show us what they found. Maybe he didn't collude with them. But he sure was a useful idiot for them. Considering he hired all these people actively lobbying for Russian interests. Why don't we just see what Mueller says when the investigation is over? And we can speculate till that happens. There's no point in telling people to stop speculating.

       It's interesting to say the least. But honestly, if at this point you're still claiming "no evidence", I doubt you're interested in learning what's actually out there. Trump has run his presidency like a campaign and his campaign like a religion. I understand it would be hard to question it all now, but that doesn't change what we already know.

       I suspect it’s because Mueller is about to end his investigation with zero evidence of Russia collusion with Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The House Intel Committee just wrapped their Investigation despite the protests of Adam Schiff. I don’t think they would end their probe with a definitive decision that Trump and his team is innocent unless they know that Mueller doesn’t have shit.

       The facebook ad indictments gave it away. Mueller is running on fumes at this point and the House Intel Committee decision to end the investigation is forcing action of some sort.

       Nah. Benghazi was a witch hunt- multiple millions spent over multiple years, with nothing to show for it. Starr's investigation into Bill Clinton was a witch hunt- it started out as a real estate investment investigation, but he was eventually impeached for lying about a
       <em>
        blow job
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In comparison, Mueller's investigation of Trump has been remarkably laser-focused, and has already resulted in multiple indictments over a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       short period of time.

       I love how you braindead morons never even mention the huge part of the former Democratic party who did not vote for Hillary and see through this utterly and completely. As we have to repeat over, and over, and over again, the Russian narrative is simply a rebranded continuation of the post-9/11 propaganda that was no longer working as well. This is all so they can continue stealing our wealth, robbing us of healthcare, letting the financiers rob our pensions and social security, and speculate to the point where we can't afford rent anymore. It's all a giant puppet show, and you are helping bring misery to millions with your foolish, crass, historically illiterate nonsense peddling. May you burn in a thousand eternal hells.

       Someone explain to me what Trump is doing for Russia? His pro-oil/gas stance is a direct threat to the Russian economy thus a threat on Russian military/expansion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia thrived under Obama. That's what this one about. The Democrats always project their failings on the GOP. For instance, they whip up racial unrest that almost exclusively exists in communities that Democrats have failed for half a century.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats have always been weak on Russia and have supported them when the USSR still around. All the players going after Trump are either tied to or failed regarding Russia.

       Under Obama, Russia lost the crown jewel of its "sphere of influence" (Ukraine, which the Russians believe was a US/CIA plot), then decided to annex Crimea and attack eastern Ukraine, which made them an international pariah state and resulted in sanctions that made the Russian economy shrink and the ruble take a nosedive.

       Which happened at exactly the same time as a 40 year high in US oil production.

      <p>
       What happened under Obama is nothing new. We've been encircling Russia for decades. We did the same sort of thing when they moved on our sphere of influence in Latin America. It begs the question asking why anyone is suprised by Russian aggression and why Democrats are allowing Trump to turn them into essentially Bush-style neocons?

       I think it's that, to us,
       <em>
        you

       people feel like the ones bandwagoning on one side of a political issue. I don't think being interested in Russia's involvement in the US elections as a political thing. It involves politicians, but I'm not interested in it for political reasons. The most interesting thing about the Russia conspiracies are all the criminal implications; it's not inherently political like, for example, the DNC shenanigans to nominate HRC.

       What evidence do you have? What actions has Trump made to help Russia's geopolitical ambitions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is hurting Russia by supporting American energy independence. That's all you need to know. If he wanted to help Russia, he'd start blocking more drilling and enacting more regulations like Obama and Hillary.

       Sorry, this just doesn't match reality. Oil/gas prices have been rising most of Trump's presidency. That's good for Russia, whereas the proliferation of fracking and natural gas discoveries under Obama were driving prices down, which was bad for Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has also attacked pretty much all of America's allies and called NATO obsolete. The same guy who picks petty fights with everyone -- actresses, department stores, pro athletes, members of his own party, etc. -- won't say ONE WORD against Putin, and even threw his own country under the bus when asked to address Russian human rights abuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump also refuses to enforce sanctions against Russia despite being forced to sign the law himself after a veto-proof bipartisan majority voted for new sanctions. It has also been reported that he attempted to lift other sanctions against Russia as soon as he entered office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there was the time he passed code-word intelligence to the Russians in the Oval Office (in a meeting where US press was banned, but Russian TASS photographers were allowed) and likely burned an Israeli asset.

       -Oil prices are extremely low compared to most of the years Obama was President. They are only up now because of OPEC cuts which are in response to American energy production that Trump is a proponent of. Fracking and natural gas discoveries happened in spite of Obama. The Democrats ran against the continuation of this phenomonen. They  want to go back to $100/barrel oil in order to speed up green technology, urbanization, and fewer carbon emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       -NATO is obsolete. The Cold War is over. Why do Americans need to be the everlasting shield for Western European partners who have been spared  high military budgets. Why do we need to fight Russia when our 21st Century rival is clearly China?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanctions lead to animosity and war. They don't work. They didn't make Saddam or Kim Jong Un good guys. You can't have it both ways with us being World Policeman and not when it suits your politics. Russia needs to be checked but not at the risk of another expensive Cold War.

       Encouraging divisions in the EU. Not upholding sanctions against Russia. Basking in the destruction of civil discourse in America.  Breaking treaties with his tariffs claiming “national security “ as if our allies are enemies. Applauding murderous dictators ( Putin, Dutuerte.) Abandoning our ally  England after Russia engages in chemical attacks on their soil.

       Funny you should say that because I was thinking what constitutes a chemical weapon. Is tear gas a chemical weapon? Because that gets used all the time. I guess the difference is that tear/CS gas is only supposed to make you cry a bit, but VX/Novichok is supposed to kill.

       The whole Russia thing would be hilarious if it weren't so sad how easily people buy into the propaganda. Meanwhile don't look at Israel or Saudi Arabia who we've been actively
       <em>
        colluding
       </em>
       with since before Obama's presidency. Don't pay attention to China being the trial run and blueprint for an orwellian one world government. Shit is getting ridiculous.

       No, what's out of control is Trump's followers insisting over and over there is nothing to investigate re Russia and calling people hysterical and Russiaphobes. If you want to ignore it, fine. Some of us think for ourselves and don't go along unquestionably with what Trump says.

       Well I'm tagging lots of them.  I guess it's a glass 1/2 full or glass 1/2 empty kind of thing.   And the big upvotes for "Russia burnt my toast" people are disturbing.  On a superficial level, votes don't matter -- but it's what they indicate to me, on
       <em>
        this

       sub, that bothers me.

       This is exactly why I haven't been here as much recently. It certainly seems worse right now, and I hope it's because of the whole Tillerson thing. They must sense an opportunity with that ridiculous timing of getting fired plus Russia assassin? Surely there are other important reasons why Tillerson was fired. The lack of analysis by the corporate media is damning.

       I know collusion is the biggest buzzword for the right. It's everything they want to prove wrong. Well, I have a video of Trump telling someone in an interview in 2013 that he has a relationship with Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they'll find "collusion". If anything I'd imagine it would be be a "Hey Donnie, you friend of Russia, you run for president we got your back" but you know, in Russian and they leave it at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise the big claim is on who stole the DNC emails. Republicans push that it was Seth Rich. Everyone else understands that if it is true that Russian agents gained access to the DNCCC emails then that would be foreign intervention into an election for President of the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something too spicy for fragile snowflakes to fathom. I hope China hacks the Republicans for talking shit to them. I won't say a word.

       Man, just keep kicking around controversial, it's where I found your post just now. The absurd brigading can only last so long as the paper-thin narrative they parrot does. Endure for now and chuckle at the ham-fisted "hello fellow conspiracy believers" bullshit. Like that 9/11 facebook meme at 1.4k upvotes on the front page. The title of that thing is
