        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all this hoopla about Gun rights vs School Safety, there is little fruitful discussion about the reason WHY we have a 2nd Amendment.</p>

<p>Quite simply, it is to ensure that citizens are &quot;one of the checks and balances&quot; in our Democratic system.</p>

<p>In the age of mass State Surveillance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk">Face Mapping</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfU_sWHT8mo">Voice-mapping</a> and photo-realistic CGI... Citizens need to be able to fight back against synthesized evidence and journalists need more tools to peer into the activities of our Government.</p>

<p>In an age when &quot;hacked emails&quot; is a scandalous connotation, the people need to wake up and realize that hacking is the last stand against full information control by the Government and it&#39;s aligned business\oligarchy partners.</p>

<p>I realize this post is pretty &quot;on the nose&quot; and maybe even &quot;Im14andthisisdeep&quot; but I find it strange that NOBODY is broaching this topic (and everyone is floating around old 2A arguments). </p>

<p>Especially in the conspiracy sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a gun owner and a supporter of 2A but I am totally in agreement with you on this one. The future battles will be fought in the cloud. We have systematically given away out rights to corporations though their T&amp;Cs. Everything we use requires signing away our rights to legal action allowing corporations to get a pass on criminal behavior. It started by attacking consumer rights groups that tried to protect people from bad products or services by limiting the power to sue, the torte reform effort, now it&#39;s all arbitration with a &quot;judge&quot; picked by your assailant. Then it went straight into the Patriot act removing more rights but most importantly your right to privacy and due process. This enabled the exponential growth of the surveillance state. Then they cemented the power of corporations over the government and the people with Citizens United guaranteeing that no one citizen could ever reverse the gains achieved by corporations since they are protected more so than actual people. </p>

<p>The need to bear arms is just as important as the need to be able to opt out or disconnect from any monitoring effort by corporations or governments. Even without giving up the ability to access free information or to pay for content you want without fear that your private information is taken and used without consent. This must be protected by the constitution in the future. That means in my mind that the ability to access technology and modify it for personal use is a must and should be protected as well. The ability to hack follows - if I want to use countermeasures to mask my private information I should have every right to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an awful argument. It&#39;s part of this 2a is outdated talking points. A citizen with a gun will always be a great threat. Look at Iraq, Afghan, or Vietnam. The largest military in earths history spending trillions of dollars cant defeat an enemy that is armed. </p>

<p>Say a large army has 100 000 troops. That&#39;s the size of a small city. Where in from has 180 000 citizens in a 40km squared area. If half those people are armed that means a small town has a standing army the size of an invasion force. </p>

<p>Drones and planes can bomb shit and create shock and awe. Destroy bridges and power infrastructure but no matter what you need troops on the ground to win the battle against the locals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree that armed citizens would be formidable but that assumes you want to hold the ground. I don&#39;t think that would be necessary in a future conflict. You cut off infrastructure and supplies to a large city and it would eat itself. </p>

<p>I am not really sure the goal in the ME is to win, it&#39;s just to outlast and assimilate so its not really comparable. I think that if we wanted to conquer we would bring to bear massive ordinance and the nomads running around would not survive.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>20 ISIS fighters held a 1x1 square mile plot of land in Benghazi for 1.5 years.</p>

<p>Surrounded by 10,000 NATO soldiers. Mortared, droned and cruise missiled. None of it mattered.</p>

<p>200 ISIS fighters held Fallujah for 6 months. Surrounded by 20,000 Iranian soldiers.</p>

<p>50 ISIS fighters held Kobane for 3 months. Surrounded by 20,000 soldiers from Turkey, Syria and Anerica.</p>

<p>500 ISIS fighters held Mosul for 6 months. Surrounded by 40,000 soldiers. The only reason ISIS lost Mosul was because The Crusaders flattened the whole city.</p>

<p>ISIS posted a pretty funny meme last year that depicts the essence of why 2FA matters VS a Regime armed with 7,000 nuclear ICBMs.</p>

<p>&quot;As Soon As We Picked Up The Gun, They Started To Listen&quot;</p>

<p>As an aside, it&#39;s a sure sign that we live in an Orwellian Dystopian Nightmare when ISIS memes are more true than what our Govt tells us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think it is unwise to underestimate those fighting for their homes but those crazy ass Boston Dynamic robots will be on the ground. Further, what about the sentiment that the US populace won&#39;t be devastated enough to even pick up arms unless the enemy shows themselves to unite against. Even then I would think at least some of the troops and police would flip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t fear Little Dog or any Terminators coming out of Boston Dynamics.</p>

<p>They make fucking toy robots and their demo videos are staged and the robot is operating under highly controlled circumstances.</p>

<p>If I was holed up in a building in some bombed out urban warzone and a Little Dog came trotting in, I have just the weapon to destroy it.</p>

<p>Such as a DIY EMP grenade built with Supercapacitors.</p>

<p>Buh-bye Little Dog. I&#39;ll then take the immobilized Little Dog and reprogram it and strap an IED to it and walk it back to your base.
Your Little Dog is now my Little Dog.
Thanks for the present.</p>

<p>How bad does a government need to get before it stops being all about talking? How would the government even get to the point? Do you even trust people who don&#39;t agree with you to become opening violent like mentally unstable people?</p>

<p>How would you even trust anyone? This sub and other groups can&#39;t even trust one shooter without turning it into politics like false flags, crisis actor. One side/group is going to call it a terrorist act. </p>

<p>The only thing is going to happen is the two sides fight each other instead of the government because you have all been brainwashed by both parties to keep them in power. </p>

<p>Unlike the last two times, the government has plans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A-fucking-men.</p>

<p>Our Founding Fathers never foresaw 3D printed ghost gun AR-15&#39;s and geo-fenced Quadcopter IED&#39;s, but they unambiguously emphasized that there shall be no restrictions on our Right to Bare Arns.</p>

<p>I think they would have no qualms about extending 2A to include a Well Regulated Militia arming themselves with Cyberrifles.</p>

<p>At least 90% of the reasons why NSA is kicking our asses in the most unfair fight and then getting away with it Scott Free is because we don&#39;t have our own Cyberrifles and because NSA and the 19 megabillionaire PRISM Partner Corpirations have monopolized and regulatory captured all of the ways to Hack Back to hoard it for themselves and to commit egregious injustices against us for which we have no defense.</p>

<p>Worse yet, as if these cyber assholes didn&#39;t fuck us over bad enough, now they&#39;re expanding Wassenaar Arms Control to include &quot;intrusion software&quot; under Export Control. Which includes all of the best techniques to defend your computers from treacherous cunts like NSA or shameless IP thieves like China.</p>

<p>A gun is just a tool. You can use a gun to defend your family from a home invasion or car jacking, or you can open fire on a crowd in public.
A gun can&#39;t be &quot;guilty&quot; of the actions of its owner.</p>

<p>So too for Cyberrifles. A piece of code that hooks into the deepest parts of your computer to monitor and intercept and override and neutralize a virus appears no different than the virus which is doing the same thing using the same techniques.</p>

<p>Cyberrifles are a special kind of gun, and should also be especially protected not just under 2A but also under 1A.</p>

<p>Code is Speech. The act of writing code is no different than Tom Paine writing an Anonymous political pamphlet.</p>

<p>So the Govt is skating on thin ice in trying to restrict both our 2A and 1A rights. I hope some edge-case fluke legal case about &quot;intrusion software&quot; would go all the way to SCOTUS to force them to rule that code is speech.</p>

<p>A similar thing happened back in the 90&#39;s when NSA demanded thatc code
implementing the RSA encryption algorithm be classified as a munition under ITAR and banned for export.
Some cypherpunks put that code on a t-shirt to prove the point that the Govt are idiots if they think they can censor free speech or ideas or math.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2y8c.jpg">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2y8c.jpg</a></p>

<p>I think the civillain cyberrifle industry has been unfairly squeezed to stunt its development. If cyberrifles were as common as AR-15&#39;s, then your grandma&#39;s nursing home WiFi network would run advanced intrusion detection that sensed viruses and automatically hacked back to break into the servers where the viruses phone home. And then it would dox the criminals who made the virus and also SWAT their homes.</p>

<p>NSA would be fucked, because the difficulty level of hacking you just went up 1,000%. NSA would have to tip toe on rice paper picking its targets, because if your Grandma&#39;s MONSTERMIND home defense hacked back and popped one of NSA&#39;s &quot;Listening Posts&quot;, there would be a new Shadowbroker every week.</p>

<p>I am absolutely convinced the biggest culprit causing our entire IT industry to get massively breached every month is because Silicon Valley has locked us into propietary closed source systems and made every computer down to your exersize monitor so needlessly complex, that we&#39;ve all been forces into a learned helplessness where we don&#39;t even try to build our own cyberrifles to hack back.</p>

<p>Which means only the Bad Guys will have cyberrifles, just like with gun, because criminals like NSA don&#39;t follow the rules.</p>
