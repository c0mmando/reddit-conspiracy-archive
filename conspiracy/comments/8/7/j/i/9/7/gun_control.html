        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of Wednesday, June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.0925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:</p>

<p>• 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws
• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified
• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – gun violence
• 3% are accidental discharge deaths</p>

<p>So technically, &quot;gun violence&quot; is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation?
• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago
• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore
• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit
• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)</p>

<p>So basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.</p>

<p>This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. </p>

<p>Now, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.</p>

<p>Are 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. That&#39;s why they are criminals.</p>

<p>But what about other deaths each year?
• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!
• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths
• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide) </p>

<p>Now it gets good:
• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!</p>

<p>• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If Obama and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides......Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!</p>

<p>So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It&#39;s pretty simple.:
Taking away guns gives control to governments.</p>

<p>The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.</p>

<p>Thus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs. </p>

<p>So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: &quot;Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force at the command of Congress can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.&quot;</p>

<p>Remember, when it comes to &quot;gun control,&quot; the important word is “control,&quot; not “gun.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing as some of them are flat out wrong, and most are just opinions, I actually kinda do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect Opinion (<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/guns-and-suicide/">https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/guns-and-suicide/</a>)</p>

<p>Then you talk about murders after having taken drug/gang violence out of the equation...just what?</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the false dichotomy comparing gun deaths to other deaths. Most of those other things i.e. food already have regulations etc. My eating myself to death also doesn&#39;t have nearly as big an impact on you or the community as my going to my high school and killing as many students as I could before myself.</p>

<p>Incorrect Opinion</p>

<p>Guilty of having an incorrect opinion? Since you dispute the 65% stat, what is the correct percentage? You site an article from 2008 which states &#39;where gun ownership was less common, suicide rates were also lower.&#39; But correlation does NOT equal causation. In states like Alaska suicide rates are high for many reasons including the extended winter. This is not hard science this is sociology.</p>

<p>A more recent report by ALL THINGS CONSIDERED goes into how gun suicides are more common than gun murders. Do you dispute that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, the biggest problem I have with all this and other nonsense is the idea a lot of people seem to have that just because we can&#39;t fully address a problem, or those like it, we shouldn&#39;t do anything about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What gun laws would you pass to stop an incident like the Florida shooting? The FBI was warned about his facebook and youtube posts. The county sheriffs office was warned that he was a school shooter in the making. Then sheriff Israel ordered the police to stand down while innocent children were murdered. Yet you want only the police to have guns? One teacher with a gun could have stopped the killing. </p>

<p>It is always someone with a gun who stops these shooters. There is a reason they always choose &#39;gun-free zones&#39; - they don&#39;t want to get shot. Furthermore, the supreme court has ruled that the police have no obligation to protect us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  </p>

<p>Now maybe if the Chicago PD and the Chicago prosecutors would nail the known straw-buyers who actually purchase the guns, and give them a felony record so they can&#39;t ever legally purchase another gun, it might slow the tide a bit.</p>

<p>Oh and make it public so the gangbanger&#39;s next girlfriend doesn&#39;t go buy him another 10 guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and it turns out people will still commit crimes if you make it feasible for them to do so.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like it&#39;d be a tough set of data to disentangle from so many confounding factors.  There <em>is</em> a correlation between per capita gun ownership by state and firearm homicides.</p>

<p>I think the biggest issue with trying to correlate laws and deaths is that there&#39;s <em>so many guns just around</em>, it&#39;s hard for policies concerning access to have a strong immediate effect.  Guns work for decades, and we&#39;ve had generations of super lax gun laws.  So even if you were to ban the sale of guns tomorrow, there&#39;s still like 350 million guns around that aren&#39;t gonna disappear.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we should craft firearm policy around the Florida shooting or instances like it, because they&#39;re so rare.   </p>

<p>Instead, I think our overall goal should be to reduce the number of firearms in private hands, and try to help ensure that these weapons are held by people who are generally more responsible.  I believe that the more weapons are just around, the more likely one will be nearby when someone is suicidal, or drunk and angry, or trying to commit a crime.</p>

<p>So I would support, for instance: (1) requiring everyone who uses a firearm or takes it off of their private property to obtain a license, which involves taking a firearms safety course and passing a written and live-fire test; (2) requiring firearm owners to carry liability insurance for their weapon, and have an affirmative duty to keep the weapon safely locked when not in use; (3) taxes or other regulations designed to prevent people from purchasing a large number of weapons in a short timeframe; (4) state-level registration of all firearms, like we do with cars, with an electronic database accessible to federal law enforcement to track straw purchase; (5) an annual registration or tax on every weapon (though I have some concerns how this would impact low-income people, who are the most likely to be living in neighborhoods where home defense is a real issue).</p>

<p>My goal is that, over time, the number of weapons in civilian hands is reduced, and those that have weapons are more responsible with them.</p>

Taxes are a contract that we all agree to to get things done.
Private corporations can&#39;t be trusted to do anything but steal as much from everyone as they can. Government representatives are voted in and out office and at least there&#39;s some control there.
We need governments to collect taxes and get things like roads and bridges built. Private companies doing these things would rob you blind everyday just to drive up to the corner store, and CANNOT be trusted to do anything in the public interest. Period</p>

<p>Yea ... soo why would we need government. You took a really dark turn their with the pedophilia and wife beating. Remember, I was responding to this comment:</p>

<p>Taxes are a contract that we all agree to to get things done.</p>

<p>That is simply not true, as I said above. There is no contract and the relationship between citizen and government is not consensual. All human interactions should be based on consent. That law is universal and prohibits acts of violent aggression and pedophilia. Like you said - it is INHERENTLY UNDERSTOOD! </p>

<p>Okay and who did you register the corporation with? The government? Why? In order to obtain limited liability in the eye of United States Law?</p>

If corporations built roads (or any of that), they would charge you hundreds of dollars to drive to work everyday. Think I&#39;m lying? look at the skyrocketing cost of pharmaceuticals. Corporations are inherently greedy and unethical. And they answer to no one. Like i said, at least you can vote morons out. That&#39;s why president snowflakes days are numbered. He&#39;s obviously incompetent and he will lose the coming election right after he loses the house and senate to the democrats in the mid-terms. People can control at least some of what is being done around them when it&#39;s run by governing laws and regulations. Corporations are psycopathic  by their very design. I don&#39;t trust them to not put poison dog-food on the shelves. Hell, they already have done that. And the list of their crimes is god-help-me ENDLESS!!</p>

<p>By that logic I could just build a road around your house and then say that by crossing them you agree to a contract where I take a portion of your income.</p>

<p>I get free internet provided by Google fiber. You lack fundamental understanding of the free market. Who do you think builds the roads? Politicians? LOL. We give them money; they skim some off the top for them and their homies; them they use the rest to pay contractors for the roads.

<p>Like I said, Fundamental misunderstanding of free market economics. Corporations could not charge so much without the absurd insurance policy that is forced upon us by the government - that is not Free Market. </p>

<p>Its exactly the same problem as student loans. If every 18 year old who can graduate high school is guaranteed a loan backed by the US government - college as charge whatever they like. If students paid out of pocket colleges would have to charge less or go out of business. Its a racket led by the government.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All of your criticisms of Capitalism are in fact criticisms of government. Companies must answer to the public that supports them unless they are too-big-too fail banks in which case obama will give them $700 Billion. People are greedy and that is why we must not have government centralized power.</p>

<p>Like I said CORPORATIONS REQUIRE GOVERNMENT. Governments create corporate persons in order to let executive escape liability to the public in the eyes of the government. Research it. </p>

<p>What was the alternative for those children? Who made them be there - where were the parents? What if the alternative was to starve to death on a failing farm?</p>

<p>There are many ways to provide oversight without government. Unions do not require a government so you already stated the solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give one example? I just gave you two. Women and children locked into warehouses forced to work for pennies with no alternative in unsafe environments in which many many died. That&#39;s big business for you right there no morality no interest or caring about anything but the dollar. Why do you think that&#39;s such a great idea? And again you can&#39;t vote a CEO out of office, but you can vote a politician or party out of office.</p>

<p>The only more government oversight we need is with gun control. And pharmaceutical pricing regulation. And probably lots of other things..</p>

<p>Yes you can stop paying the government. You can move out to the woods and not use the infrastructure at all and therefore not owe the government anything. Don&#39;t use the roads don&#39;t use the sewers don&#39;t use the electric power lines don&#39;t use anything and live like a Hermit in a cabin somewhere. But no one chooses to do that Everyone likes all of the infrastructure that the government has built and and for which we need to pay taxes.</p>

<p>If I am the victim of public school propaganda, then you are the victim of nonsensical theories of how big business is your friend. It&#39;s not. The rich f*** the poor. That&#39;s capitalism. That&#39;s What we have to fight against. Do you think big businesses would give Social Security to old people? Or do you think they would let them die in the street rather than spend a nickel?

<p>In what way were they forced? The alternative was to starve, be homeless or go back home to farm in IOWA. Nobody is forced to do anything in a Free Market. Otherwise, they are not in a Free Market. More like slavery.</p>

<p>You see Free Market corporations do indeed care about their bottom line. That is how they are able to employee people. But they also care about incentives like health care and other benefits that make them a more attractive employer than their competitors.</p>

<p>Do you really trust the government? Who should control the guns? The Trump administration? The police? Do you really trust the police so much that ONLY THEY should have access to firearms?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So I can just build infrastructure all around your house and tax you any time you want to cross the line? How did the government get the power to tax me for services I did not ask for? Where did their authority come from? A bunch of politicians singed a paper saying &#39;we&#39;re in charge&#39;?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rich f*** the poor. That&#39;s capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More propaganda from socialized education. You see Capitalism is simply private ownership of the means of production. Since you are against Capitalism, what should be the penalty for owning private property? </p>

<p>The author of the Harry Potter series is worth a billion dollars. Who did she fuck over to get that money? Nobody. Wealth is created out of her pure creativity and the brand has employed thousand of people across many industries. You seem to think that economics is a zero-sum game. You are wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think big businesses would give Social Security to old people? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>WE CANNOT EVEN AFFORD TO GIVE SOCIAL SECURITY TO PEOPLE. The money has run out but we keep borrowing against the wealth of unborn generations. Yet YOU are the virtuous one? No. That is totally immoral. Again, those unborn children signed nothing to allow that to happen. You and your fellow sociopaths just force it through as if it is a virtuous act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You sound so angry. So your argument for why it was okay to have women locked, yes locked check the history books, and children into warehouses is because they would starve if they didn&#39;t let this happen. Wow again what a fine history of humanitarianism that is. They should put that one on the cover!</p>

<p>And how do you suddenly jump to the argument that I said only the government should have guns? I do believe there is a rational line for civilians to have as do you, because surely you don&#39;t believe regular civilians should have access to tanks and ground-to-air missiles and flamethrowers do you? If you do you are way out on the radical right! Do you know this? Have you ever thought about how far out to the radical right you would need to be to believe these things? </p>

<p>Your next question simply seems to be addressing the history of capitalism and the federal government&#39;s place in maintaining an infrastructure. This history is long and storied. Is it my fault or your fault? no but it works pretty well. As I said before, if Private Industry could charge you whatever they wanted for the roads or the sewer system or the military, then they would charge you the absolute maximum just like pharmaceutical companies do. Would you like to spend $140 driving to work everyday? Because if that&#39;s what the market will bear that&#39;s what a Private Industry Road Builder would charge you!</p>

<p>And then you give me one example of 1 loan humanitarian self-made billionaire like the author of the Harry Potter books up against the entire history of shity, miserable, in human, and inhumane actions done and still being done by private corporations to justify all of Private Industry being really nice guys with little angel Halos balanced on their heads, trying to do the very best for all of us tiny little people with no power whatsoever?!! Are you f****** kidding me? Flatly, you simply must be. Haha on me for taking you seriously.</p>

<p>And then you say we can&#39;t afford Social Security but we can afford to spend so many mountains of f****** gold on Military we simply do not need.? If we just slow down the military spending a little bit we could probably double everyone Social Security and send them nice little boxes of cookies every month two! Short version? There are oceans of money out there, it&#39;s just the evil rich who don&#39;t want to part with a single dollar who f*** it all up.</p>

<p>Who am I you ask? I don&#39;t know who are you I asked Back? I am a hard-working human who&#39;s read a lot of books, and learned a lot of things, and knows evil when he sees it, just like you. You ain&#39;t nothing special mr. Neither am I. You&#39;re just a guy with an opinion who should probably read a little bit more and stop thinking he knows so much all the time. Which reminds me of a very Tweety President we have right now. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re a supporter, but you have a lot in common with those people from where I sit. Think about it.</p>

<p>Rich people are the main ones paying taxes. It makes sense that tax cuts would benefit them the most. You are actually arguing against people keeping their own money.

Seems to me you&#39;re saying these poor guys just can&#39;t make a living, and they are just taxed to death! How do I expect them to buy that third yacht they don&#39;t need and that 65000 square foot home that they&#39;re going to visit once without getting some kind of a major tax break from an uber wealthy fat guy who was elected using help from the Russians and still barely won? Really? Or are you trolling me in some ridiculous, ridiculous way, It must be the latter.</p>

<p>Do you know that if minimum wage had kept up with the cost of living since just the 1970s, it would now be somewhere around $25 an hour? And if minimum wage was $25 an hour? And a skilled worker earned three times that that means the average skilled worker should be earning $75 an hour in order to keep up with the cost of living alone. Much less be doing better than his parents or grandparents have done in the past. Who is it who keeps minimum wage it&#39;s such a paltry level for decade after decade after decade? Because somehow, they argue, they just wouldn&#39;t make enough billions every year if we raise the minimum wage even a quarter! Take a wild guess because somehow, they argue, they just wouldn&#39;t make enough billions every year if we raised the minimum wage even out quarter! when Big Business does this to us, they make generation after generation of us poorer and poorer and poorer simply by working just as hard or even harder. There&#39;s the history of big business for you. The nice guys, haha.</p>

<p>And you do know that President snowflake has a decades-long history of screwing over little guys by the thousands who he insisted do the very best work for him and then, when it was time to pay them, would make up some pathetic excuse of why it was terrible work and insisted he would not pay them at all. Then they would have to file cases against him to be able to get $0.15 on the dollar back from him. How horrible shity and miserable a human do you need to be to do something like this to hard-working families, literally taking food off the table and shoes off the feet of children of these hard-working Americans in order to scrape up a few extra million to buy a gold covered throne, true story! Or another giant portrait of yourself, also a true story.!?
Or maybe even yet another Golf Course where you could go to play golf three times more than Obama ever did! All after bitching about Obama golfing so much and how you would never ever even have time to play! What a hypocritical piece of s*** you would need to be to do something like this or to even back a man who is remotely like this! Surely you hate this conniving sniveling draft dodging piece of s*** as much as most of America does? Right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You had me, in relative agreement, except for your second and final paragraphs. The number of guns in civilian, or citizen’s, hands should not be an issue.  A citizen is a law abiding, tax paying, resident of a country. Felons can not legally own or possess firearms. Those with domestic abuse history cannot own or possess firearms. Those with diagnosed mental issues cannot own or possess firearms.  So why would limiting law abiding citizens ownership of firearms achieve anything?</p>

<p>Regarding your second paragraph, who decides who is responsible?  The government?  A politician? Your local police department?  I’m sorry but “responsible” is a very subjective term, much like “terrorist”. The opinion of the few dictate these definitions.  Your numbered solutions are reasonable, especially number one. A weapon is a tool...people need to know how to use them safely.  Number four already exists. Numbers 3 &amp; 5 quite frankly scare me. What would stop an executive order from upping this to a ridiculous, unaffordable level for all but the elite?  What is considered an excessive amount of weapons?  This is not only subjective, but also not relevant. Highly trained shooters will only ever use one or two weapons at most and number two is purely a back up.  There are some reasonable ideas there to be sure,  but anytime anything could be interpreted or subject to change by a few in power is precisely the reason the second amendment exists.  </p>

<p>The  media’s attention to gun violence in this country is a purposefully sensationalized spectacle to garner political support to disarm. </p>

<p>Right there you hit upon the weakness of your entire argument. Your attempts to control society from the top-down are only going to hurt those people who are most in need of self-protection.</p>

<p>Furthermore, taxation is enforced by violence. So in fact, you are advocating for violence in the name of big government (against law-abiding gun owners) in hopes it will mitigate gun violence.</p>

<p>Gun violence is on the decline. There is no reason to centralize power in the government but CNN will do what they can to convince you otherwise.</p>

<p>Shooters victimize those in &#39;gun-free zones&#39; because they know that nobody will fire back. The more you disarm us, the more victims there will be. NRA members don&#39;t shoot up schools - they end shootings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what you mean by contact hazard.  But you need to not look at it in terms of single guns and single individuals, but at the society-wide level.  It&#39;s not like guns cause violence or criminality in themselves, like a pollutant. But, the more weapons are around in private hands, the more likely a gun will be available when someone hits a low-point of depression, or becomes enraged at his wife or neighbor, or has a gang-affiliated nephew enter the home and swipe it, etc. etc. </p>

<p>Think of a giant chessboard, 350 million squares big.  On each square is a white chess piece -- well, mostly white, some are red.  And some of the white pieces flash red from time to time.  Think of every red piece as a potential for death; some of that red is a person reaching a suicidal state, some of that is someone becoming enraged and violent, some of the persistent red pieces are irredeemable criminals.  Now imagine that some of these squares hold firearms.  The more guns are on that board, the more likely one will be nearby to a red chess piece piece.  </p>

<p>You can try to move those weapons away from the persistent red pieces, and you can try to predict which white pieces might flash red and push the weapons away ahead of time.  Both of those things are very difficult to do, and they become harder the more guns are on that chessboard.  The fewer weapons are there, the less likely one will be near a red piece, and the easier it is to keep them away and only with the white pieces.</p>

<p>See, I just can&#39;t take anyone seriously who asserts that guns have nothing to do with gunshots.</p>

<p>There&#39;s debates to be had about the relevant impact of different factors, but insisting that the number of gun homicides isn&#39;t <em>at all</em> influenced by the presence of the only object in the world that can cause gun homicides -- that just smacks of willful blindness. </p>

Not only do we share a huge border with Canada and Mexico, but there’s already so many guns inside the US that these local laws will always be hamstrung. All you’ll do is drive up the cost of illegal guns creating more crime around the sale of them.

If you head west you are in KCKS.  Missouri has no restrictions on weapons and 50%+ people are armed.  Kansas has a bunch of hoops to jump through and it&#39;s really hard to get a conceal and carry permit.  Less than 25% of people are armed.  Do you head to Kansas or Missouri to mug someone?   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Guns took more than 36,000 U.S. lives in 2015, and this and other alarming statistics have led many to ask whether our nation would be better off with firearms in fewer hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny, they forgot to mention the suicides, which makes up 2/3. Widdle it down to 10,200.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Arming more people will make our country safer and more peaceful, they say, because criminals won&#39;t cause trouble if they know they are surrounded by gun-toting good guys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly true. You remember the shooting in Texas a few months ago that was <a href="https://keepandbear.com/2a/church-shooting-texas-stopped-good-guy-gun/">stopped by a man with a <strong>legal</strong> AR-15.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mike Watkins, a cop–turned–firearm instructor at the Kennesaw range, put it this way: “If I&#39;m a bad guy, and I know this place has guns, it&#39;s not a place I&#39;m obviously going to want to go and do something bad.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which side is this article on??? This here is simply common sense. It&#39;s called a deterrent. Remember the Cold War? To prevent a nuclear holocaust, we loaded the <sup><sup>fuck</sup></sup> up with nuclear weapons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s also the fact that where there are more guns, more opportunities exist for people to steal them and use them nefariously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, and it also proves that criminals will illegally obtain guns to use them in illegal activities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In one, they found that a gun in the home was tied to a nearly fivefold increase in the odds of suicide. (More Americans die from gun suicides every year than gun homicides.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If somebody wants to kill themselves, they&#39;re gonna kill themselves. It doesn&#39;t mean that having a gun means you&#39;ll probably kill yourself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of hard to &quot;prove&quot; that guns make people safer or don&#39;t. It&#39;s different people using different statistics that are based on different variables which creates a different outcome.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The thing about guns and suicide is this. Guns are <em>by far</em> the most effective way of being successful in a suicide attempt. They&#39;re also the most often chosen method.</p>

<p>And the presence of guns increases the chance of suicide greatly. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1656/2014/06/Access-to-guns-and-risk-of-suicide-chart.jpg">simple chart</a> from <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/magazine/magazine_article/guns-suicide/">this article</a> from Harvard University that backs that up.</p>

<p>Also, the vast majority of people who attempt suicide and fail never try it again. To this point, there&#39;s a great documentary called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnsj7mwXnLY">The Bridge</a> about the Golden Gate Bridge as a popular suicide spot. Every survivor in this doc said the instant they jumped they realized it was a mistake.</p>

<p>When a gun is your choice - and it is the choice of the majority of people who try to kill themselves - you almost never get to learn from that mistake.</p>

<p>Another significant fact that is always ignored in the gun debate is the fact that the data is wildly incomplete - <em>by design</em>. The NRA and the politicians they own have very successfully squashed efforts to collect data and study data on gun violence. To wit: Whereas the National Traffic Safety Administration collects detailed data of every fatal accident on US roads within 30 days by law, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (the govt source that studies gun violence) only collects data from 18 states; this is not due to laziness or poor structure. Gun control activists have been fighting for years to improve the purposefully lame data collection and study on gun violence, and the NRA has vehemently opposed such research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is mental health and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">regulatory capture</a> pharmaceutical manufacturers have gotten away with, due to corporate lobbying.</p>

<p>Instead of providing actual mental health counseling, pychiatrists push pills for kickbacks, and the fear of losing their license for some fabricated nonsense if they don&#39;t play ball with the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>Depression evolved as a defense against self destructive behavior in primates, whom have executive decision faculties. Depression signals other primates that something is bothering a member of the group, and that they should be consoled.</p>

<p>Antidepressant medications give someone who is depressed, due to a crisis in their life, enough willpower to end it, which isn&#39;t how depression is supposed to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that mental health care in this country is run by insidious greedy fucks. Like every other sector of human life. But...</p>

<p>You seem to be assuming that all or most suicide attempts are by people with mental health problems, and that isn&#39;t the case. Many suicide attempts are impulse based -- after an argument with a spouse, or getting fired from a job, etc. And the impulse suicides are the most effective because of the availability of a gun.</p>

<p>Studies from the CDC back this up. This quote is from an article in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> by Scott Anderson:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to statistics collected by the Injury Control Research Center [of the CDC] on nearly 4,000 suicides across the United States, those who had killed themselves with firearms — by far the most lethal common method of suicide — had a markedly lower history of depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, previous suicide attempts or drug or alcohol abuse than those who died by the least lethal methods.</p>

<p>On the flip side, those who ranked the highest for at-risk factors [like mental health problems] tended to choose those methods with low “success” rates.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the summary pulled straight from the report:</p>

<p>During 2000--2002, the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (the Task Force), an independent nonfederal task force, conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The following laws were evaluated: bans on specified firearms or ammunition, restrictions on firearm acquisition, waiting periods for firearm acquisition, firearm registration and licensing of firearm owners, &quot;shall issue&quot; concealed weapon carry laws, child access prevention laws, zero tolerance laws for firearms in schools, and combinations of firearms laws. The Task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes. (Note that insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness.) This report briefly describes how the reviews were conducted, summarizes the Task Force findings, and provides information regarding needs for future research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is anecdotal but I live in Ontario which has fairly strict gun laws. I have a unrestricted license which covers rifles and shotguns.  My friend just did his unrestricted which basically adds pistols.  </p>

<p>They didn’t check any of his references.  Granted he has no criminal behaviour and was a law abyding gun owner before.  </p>

<p>I don’t know what the problem is in the states with guns, and I think it’s definitely blown out of proportion.  BUT I do think that the people who are following their laws and going through the proper processes are not the problem.  </p>

<p>Also the 36.000 flue deaths a year is an incredibly misleading statistic for multiple reasons: first of all it is the consequences of the flue that kills people, and second of all it is mostly old people dying because of it, or in other words, people with a greater likelihood of dying in the first place, people with bad immune systems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your argument from a semantic position, but it is not completely correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does the flu kill? The short and morbid answer is that in most cases the body kills itself by trying to heal itself. “Dying from the flu is not like dying from a bullet or a black widow spider bite,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. “The presence of the virus itself isn&#39;t going to be what kills you. An infectious disease always has a complex interaction with its host.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could argue that the body reacting in an insufficient or even self-harming way to the flue is equal from the body not being able to deal with a fast amount of bloodloss, or the state of shock that results from it, but in my opinion that would not be the same. </p>

<p>Alabama has the second-highest rage of firearm deaths, but doesn&#39;t report firearm homicides to the FBI (which is probably why OP got confused).

<p>&quot;Firearm deaths&quot; is a misleading statistic, as it includes justified homicides (perfectly legal), suicides (makes friends and family &quot;sad&quot;, but otherwise doesn&#39;t injure or kill anyone else, and isn&#39;t even a crime in the US), and accidents (which are almost entirely due to negligence). In terms of firearm <em>murder</em> rate, Alabama is about in the middle of the pack with 2.8 per 100,000 inhabitants, ranking 21st among the states.

<p>Not true.  Per the CDC, in 2016, Alabama had 454 firearm homicides, or 9.3 per 100000 inhabitants, one of the highest rates in the country. (Alongside the 7th highest violent crime rate.)  California had 1467, or 3.7 per 100000 inhabitants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More similar to Japan. They have very little gun crime. Guns are dangerous. Like driving cars is dangerous. So I think in order to be allowed to have a gun, you should train with an instructor and be able to pass a test. I also think you should get in serious trouble if your kid steals your gun and shoots up his school. This shot keeps happening and I don&#39;t see the parents getting in a lot of trouble. I think those changes would help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Japan? Well, I&#39;ll agree to disagree on that one. 200 kids have been shot and killed in Schools since 1999. Take into account that around 50 million kids go to public school for 180 days a year...The probability of a kid getting shot and killed at school is 1 and 614 million.  My point- The only reason people (like yourself) believe we have gun problem is because the MSM propagates evil everyday.  </p>

<p>In 1911, the Ottoman Empire achieved gun control and from 1915 to 1917 1.5 million Armenians were rounded up and exterminated by the ruling class. </p>

<p>In 1929 Soviet Russia, full gun control was implemented by Joseph Stalin and tens of millions of Soviet dissidents or anyone the country&#39;s leadership believed were a threat, were rounded up and either murdered or placed in labor camp/prisons and forced to work, sometimes to their deaths.</p>

<p>In 1938 Nazi Germany, Hitler established gun control just prior to his enslavement and genocide of the Jewish population. This resulted in the death of nearly 13 million Jews. </p>

<p>In 1935, the Chinese government established gun control a couple years prior to the japan invasion. From 1935 to 1952, around 20 million citizens and political leaders were murdered. </p>

This is a piece of rather nihilist thought to be honest. The idea that because only 1/10000 of an entire populace dies because of a certain thing (by the way it would be more fair if you held it against the amount of deaths per year instead of against the entire living populace), you should not do anything to stop that is a bit dumb in my opinion. By that research we should also stop researching ALS, do you even know how few people actually have that disease? </p>

<p>Now you are doing what you accused me of doing earlier. It is possible to take two different stances on two completely different issues, you know? I do find it alarming that chemical substances kill more people, accidentally and intentionally, every single year that objects literally designed to kill (including suicide, accidental, and law enforcement fatalities by gun). Remove all of those and, as OP points out, homicide/mass killings by gun are a tiny, tiny fraction of all killings in this country. If &quot;it&#39;s the children&quot;, let&#39;s focus on something that is actually killing them in record numbers (there are a host of these &quot;somethings&quot;).  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Short explanation would be this: it boils down to your ethical and fundamental position on social contracts or more materialized, the form of your bill of rights and constitution. I believe that the right to bear arms as a form of protection causes more harm than it does good and therefore said right should not have a place in social contracts - this is not me arguing that it is not currently in your social contract -, but as I introduce a discussion on a social construct, I realise and accept that everyone is in their right to fundamentally and logically disagree with me, as we are not talking facts but ideology or believes. </p>

<p>tldr: I believe there should not be a material right for peoples to posess any arms, be it for offensive or defensive purposes. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No need to, not in any way offended. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t trying to put you in a corner or force a gotcha moment. We all have different prioritization of arguments in different debates. I was merely trying to deconstruct the logic of your argument to rebuild it afterwards. I believe applying the supply and demand model for guns is too artificial as the entire market is rooted in the form of ethics and rights. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Two points I would make: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>is it fair to exclude all of these categories? Suicide rates in countries with guns are higher than in those without guns. When there are less guns, less accidental shootings happen. When civilians have less guns, the police has less reason to use their own. So even though I understand why you would exclude these statistics, I don&#39;t believe it would paint a realistic picture of the death toll as a cause of gun posession.</p></li>
<li><p>OP actually didn&#39;t point that out, he divided the number of death by guns per year by the living population during that year. However I understood the point he was trying to make.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate butting into a very good debate between two respectful individuals, but I must.  In regards to everyone’s individual social contracts, I really like this point and it is the only valid point (IMO) I have personally ever seen for gun control. It is a matter of personal preference for you and what your ideal community would look like. This, while a valid point, is what I dislike about further gun control regulation. It is no different than an anti-abortion argument. You (those that share the same concepts) are trying to force your vision of what is idyllic on the rest of the populace. It is wrong. The only freedom anyone truly has is that of choice.  I am pro gun, I am pro choice, pro gay marriage, etc, etc..... allow law abiding citizens to make their own choices. </p>

<p>Long story short, for two reasons: 1. I think it is a very interesting debate, currently centered around alot of either false or misleading statistics while I believe the debate should be way more ideological. 2. Because I have, in my opinion, a rather unique perspective on the matter, rooted in my European framework of believes. </p>

<p>I find the more interesting question: why am I not allowed to give my opinion respectfully, simply because I&#39;m not american? Why would that disqualify me from taking part in the discussion on an international forum?</p>

<p>See this is probably the core of our disagreement. You believe no guns would lead to a false sense of security, I believe that the guns themselves are a false sense of security. Look at the doses of shit that your government poors over you on a daily base. You have no real democracy, with two shit parties. When I read that the government of Wisconsin is currently literally refusing to hold elections, all I can think to myself is: &quot;if the guns aren&#39;t blocking this crap, then what excactly are they good for?&quot; Your form of democracy with two parties that look excactly the same and vote for the same figurative raping of the middle-class and the poor, did the guns prevent that from happening? Hell no. So what did the guns prevent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with your dismissal of the 65% that die of suicide. </p>

<p>About half of suicides are committed using a firearm, and it&#39;s the most &quot;effective&quot; method.  You can read more about how successful methods of suicide are here: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/13/the-math-behind-our-suicide-and-guns-calculations/?utm_term=.e934b7761314">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/13/the-math-behind-our-suicide-and-guns-calculations/?utm_term=.e934b7761314</a></p>

<p>The second most popular form of suicide, self-poisoning (think attempted over-dosing), only has a 4% success rate.</p>

<p>Gun control would have a large effect on this population.  Waiting periods, for instance, have been linked to a 17% drop in suicide rates.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5699026/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5699026/</a></p>

<p>Israel instituted gun control on its soldiers, forbidding them from access to firearms when not necessary.  They found a 57% drop in the suicide rate among soldiers (84% of soldiers who had committed suicide prior to this change did so using a firearm).  <a href="https://www.sprc.org/news/suicide-prevention-israeli-military">https://www.sprc.org/news/suicide-prevention-israeli-military</a></p>

<p>&quot;never be prevented by gun laws&quot; is wrong.  Gun control targeting suicides would probably be the most obvious and easy changes we could make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a case study, let&#39;s look at one <strong>incredibly specific</strong> example of OP&#39;s post relating to suicide:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel instituted gun control on its soldiers, forbidding them from access to firearms when not necessary. They found a 57% drop in the suicide rate among soldiers (84% of soldiers who had committed suicide prior to this change did so using a firearm). <a href="https://www.sprc.org/news/suicide-prevention-israeli-military">https://www.sprc.org/news/suicide-prevention-israeli-military</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this means that making it so that only people who needed firearms had them cause a <strong>57% drop in suicide rates.</strong> <em>If they were just destined to commit suicide, why did tighter restrictions on access to these guns cause the suicide rate to drop?</em></p>

<p>I would appreciate if you would direction address the italicized question, rather than start talking about &quot;this would never work in america&quot; or &quot;this is about the army&quot; or something similar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to round out your thought process I’m going to paint a picture.  I have a really shitty day, wife leaves me, kids are attacked by some incurable disease, etc etc, and at this point I decide life is not worth living.  How do I do it?  I do some research and discover that most people commit suicide with a firearm. I want to end my life the right way, but I don’t own a firearm. So, I drive to the nearest gun shop/sporting good store.  I have no idea what type of firearm will do the job so I converse with the salesman. We get it figured out and have decided on a firearm that will do the trick.  After completing a form that takes 10-15 minutes to complete and after waiting for the salesman to call my information in for the back ground check (which can take anywhere from 10 minutes to a week).  I then drive home and shoot myself?!  Really?!?!   Currently only 32% of American homes own firearms.  I have done some research and it is true that most suicides are, for the most part, spontaneous. Your argument currently only applies to, at best, a third of American people.  Suicide is horrible, but to argue that it is worth sacrificing a liberty as important as free speech due to a few lost souls is unintelligent and quite frankly cowardly. </p>

<p>There are laws in some states (not mine, so I don&#39;t know a lot about them) that allow friends and family to report people they think might be a danger to themselves, and police can confiscate that person&#39;s weapon for a short period of time.

<p>Yeah, back then there wasn&#39;t much of a disparity between the equipment that civilians and the military had. They both had muskets with bayonets and cannons, it was simple stuff that both sides could get their hands on.</p>

<p>Today, the military has helicopters with night vision that can kill you in the dead of night before you even know they are there. Drones that can bomb you with precision. Tanks. Body armor. If Trump goes fascist and the military goes along with it, the average citizen is powerless against that kind of firepower. Your only hope is that the military, or at least a large portion of it, defects and brings some of that fancy hardware with them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about robberies. I&#39;m talking about the government sending a police force to bust down your door and drag you off to a secret prison in the middle of the night. Your gun is not going to save you if that happens.</p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of them would have been rounded up just the same, and their weapons would have been taken without a fight.</p>

<p>Thousands of people were marched right up to ditches full of corpses, and they did not resist at all. Most people just want to survive for as long as possible and pray for some kind of miracle to spare them, not die in a blaze of glory.</p>

Had they been armed, they could have resisted such a &quot;round up&quot; just like you and I would. 10% of those rounded up resisting would mean none were rounded up without a great many more losses to the Germans.

<p>If you really want to be able to fight the US military, you should be out there protesting for MORE gun rights.

<p>Its not about winning, its about resisting.  The US military needs all those things to invade and control its foreign adversaries.  I accept that.   The fear being perpetuated is that &#39;Oh no, one day the US military will turn on its civilians.&#39;   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that will ever happen.  Civilization actually has an intrinsic value.  Anyone trying to &#39;conquest&#39; the US would want to keep the working mechanism working with little interruption.  Attacking/oppressing the workers would actually work against that goal, so the motive for your premise doesn&#39;t really concern me as a legitimate threat.</p>

<p>The real premise is that the US has law enforement that civilians can only barely trust to straddle the line between protection and corruption and when you&#39;re being &#39;forced&#39; into doing something, a gun provides a last line of defense for yourself.  </p>

<p>If a tank wants to flatten my town, my town is flattened, but there goes all the value included.  Not a lot of resources to mine or extract.   </p>

<p>If a group wants to tell me I can no longer live on my land.  They&#39;ll be more likely to do it through the &#39;legal system&#39; than through force, especially if they are aware the homeowner is a gun owner.   </p>

<p>Its taking advantage of most peoples instinct toward self preservation.  It actually is similar to the though as to why many countries want to be nuclear powers.   </p>

<p>Its not so they can take over the world, its so that people are afraid to attack their corner of it. (most cases, obviously bad apples exist.)  A gun to a civilian serves the purpose of the nuke.  You can&#39;t just attack them out of fear of them attacking you back.  </p>

<p>Thats my take on it anyway.  </p>

Also, we should draw policy from a variety of sources and not look to any one thing. We should take account all viewpoints. But yes, the people who have first-hand experience should be heard. Policy many times is born from tragedy. The Triangle shirtwaist Fire was the stimulus to improve working conditions in factories, Are you saying Veterans should not be listened to when making policy regarding veterans’ affairs? Policy should be made with consideration to multiple factors, but those with first hand experience should definitely be listened to </p>

<p>Like when Hitler used the burning of the Reichstag as an excuse to start World War II? Yes tragedy is often born from tragedy but that is doesn&#39;t mean it is a good idea. </p>

<p>Gun violence has been on the decline for decades. Today you are more likely to be murdered by a knife. You don&#39;t ever hear about that because corporate media is paid to influence public opinion. </p>

<p>BTW: Why don&#39;t we just outlaw murder - then nobody would ever be killed!</p>

Finally the country listened to the recommendations of the  National Fire Protection Association and implemented fire safety and fire protection changes to over 16,000 schools in one year.  Since this fire we haven&#39;t had many kids die in school fires.</p>

<p>There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of Wednesday, June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.0925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant!</p>

<p>You need to look up what statistical significance means.  Just because the % small, does not make it insingicant.  Unless you have multiple regression analysis to go with it, dont make a claim that could invalidate your entire argument.</p>

Most of the people that even care about THAT don&#39;t care enough to leave FB. I mean, we&#39;re ones to talk since reddit does the same thing...

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;65% of those deaths are by suicide <strong>which would never be prevented by gun laws</strong>&quot; (Emphasis mine)<br/>
Is that true though?<br/>
As a mental health professional, I fully disagree with that statement.<br/>
Most suicides are not long-planned activities. The person hasn&#39;t sat there for weeks and prepared to kill themselves and set a date on their calendar. They may have engaged in some rehearsals (putting a loaded gun in their mouth) or had some previous attempts, but this isn&#39;t something that is planned in that way.<br/>
No, we know that isn&#39;t how it works. Often, suicide is done in the moment. When I talk with clients who are suicidal, I talk about waiting out their feelings for a couple hours or days to see how they&#39;ll feel. Invariably, they feel better. You can ask any mental health professional you want, and they&#39;ll tell you that this is real.<br/>
So what I&#39;d point out is that a waiting period on purchases will in fact save lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember a part of Infinite Jest when DFW talks about how suicide dropped in Britain when gas stoves were replaced by electric. It simply wasn’t as easy to kill yourself in Britain anymore. Guns are a very easy way to commit suicide and succeed. (Sorry for the harsh phrasing) One could also argue that mass killers are committing suicide as well, they simply want to transfer as much of their pain onto others before the ultimate act.</p>

<p>From an outside observer, suicides seem to act like memes- certain methods gone in and out of style, different cultures have different methods, and suicides go up after a celebrity suicide. </p>

<p>Anyway, to bring it back to gun control, just because guns are the method popular in America today doesn’t mean it will be tomorrow. There are far more lethal and less painful methods (Which I won’t speak about because I don’t want them in the collective unconscious) available to most people. It doesn’t make sense to take away citizens rights so that people will resort to another way of taking their own life, which may or may not be less lethal.</p>

Many of them completely lose the life they knew. Also, if we&#39;re being honest, and if we&#39;re talking about figuring out a number of Americans affected by gun violence, is it not fair to include all the family members of the people shot and killed by guns?

    <div class="md"><p>Wtf? Of course people close to people killed from guns will be affected.

<p>Why are you putting at me like that? I didn’t suggest a fucking thing but you imply that I do suggest something. What’s your angle bud? You seem to have an agenda or a chip on your shoulder. </p>

<p>I’m curious to see how many people are actually shot but not killed by guns each year in America. Are you going to source your “over 100k/year” number Or was that straight out your ass? Why do you capitalize random words throughout YOUR comment? It is a very unusual technique I have used it a couple times here in this comment but only to emphasize how weird it is. </p>

<p>Btw, I got the 100k number from Scientific American, and the actual number was 111k; I rounded it down to an even 100k. And I saw a bunch of other sites in the google results list that had the same number. And I&#39;m pretty sure none of them got it from my ass.</p>

<p>People use all CAPS for emphasis. Do you seriously not know that? If you notice from the context, the all CAPS words carry more meaning; it&#39;s a device used to alert the reader to pay attention. It&#39;s not done randomly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of your post. Yes guns are getting more press than they should. Yes they don’t do as bad (looking at the numbers) as other more preventable harms.</p>

<p>But do you really think US citizens could stop the government with its <em>guns</em>? If the government wanted to take action against its people it would use drones, tanks, air strikes, bombs, chemical warfare, and a host of other things. How would any kind of assault weapon save people from a truly aggressive state?</p>

<p>I don’t disagree with your general concept of the severity of the gun issue. But why make the argument at the end? Why not everyone just calm down about gun use. <strong>So</strong> many Americans have guns. Heavily regulating or even banning guns wouldn’t do much at this point. Let’s not fight for or against that. It won’t work. Let’s move toward saving lives elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I agree, disagree, but mostly agree</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My biggest issue is that if we get laws that will restrict LEGAL gun purchases, the only people left with guns are the people we don&#39;t want to have them.</p>

<p>It will be cops and criminals. It is not difficult to find a gun illegally. Now if everyone who lawfully purchased firearms theoretically didn&#39;t have them anymore, we are basically having to still worry about the people who acquired them illegally. </p>

<p>I would feel much safer with having people around that purchased their firearms legally, without worrying if the cops are going to show up in time to save somebody. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a crazy person trying to break down my front door in CA while screaming about wanting to kill me. They tore the knob right out of my front door. It took the cops over 30 minutes to show up and then do nothing. The guy lived next door to me, and I told them I wanted to press charges. They put him back in his apartment and told me I can&#39;t press charges against someone for banging on my door and &quot;jiggling my doorknob&quot;. Even though he had literally torn it out in a blind meth fueled rage. </p>

<p>While I was waiting for them to show up I didn&#39;t know if he was armed. All I had was a fucking knife to protect me and the hope that the cops would show up soon. It was the first time I ever felt I would want a gun for home defense.</p>

<p>In the end, the cops didn&#39;t do a damn thing. They expected me to just go to bed after they left the guy back in his place with no repercussions. I realized I have to look out for myself, and a knife isn&#39;t going to do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, she&#39;s still quite a bit nervous and reticent w/the shotgun, but I know she&#39;ll get more and more comfortable with it the more times we keep using it.  I honestly wish we could find some backwoodsy area where we can just go and blast away at a few homemade targets similar to some videos I&#39;ve seen online.  However, we&#39;re live in a pretty metropolitan city and big fields with acres of open country aren&#39;t really a thing around here - so we have to go to an actual gun range and pay.  :/ . It can add up quick.  We would go a lot more often otherwise.  Still though.  It&#39;s time for us to go again, so we&#39;ll be heading to the range soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need to spell it out for you because you seemingly can&#39;t grasp what I just wrote.</p>

<p>Most gun deaths are via suicide. Are those people addicted to guns? Are we to blame the guns for them choosing suicide?</p>

<p>Cigarettes kill more people each year than all deaths by guns—suicides included. Are people addicted to cigarettes?</p>

<p>Why would you march for gun control because of gun related homicides when it is statistically insignificant compared to suicides by guns and deaths by a legal product that an industry addicts people to?  Wouldn&#39;t one march against the statistically much larger problem that intentionally kills people vs the statistically insignificant product that people <em>choose</em> to use to kill people?

    <div class="md"><p>Gun violence is driven by crime, which is driven by poverty.  This is further exacerbated by the war on (the supply) of drugs that doesn&#39;t even begin to address the demand which drives profit.  That&#39;s an opportunity problem.  We also know a majority of those involve handguns and closing the gunshow loophole can reduce the volume of handguns on the street.</p>

<p>Mass shootings are supposedly the result of lone wolf madmen, they take place with legally acquired weapons and thats something a universal background check can stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are all factors that playing to violence in general, don&#39;t forget desperation, feelings of isolation, anger, frustration...people lash out. The war on/supply drugs aspect is a whole other argument, the government is flooding the black markets and &quot;underbelly&quot; of the country with weapons (let&#39;s not forget operation fast and furious). 
And universal background checks wouldn&#39;t have stopped Newton, pulse night club, Vegas (regardless on a persons conspiratorial standpoint on said event).
As told by MSM (if I&#39;m wrong please tell me, I&#39;m spitballing narratives as I can remember them)
New town. (Kid stole and murdered family and others, no mental health issues noted or officials alerted)
Pulse. (Ties to government persons, no mental health issues noted that I was aware of) 
Vegas. (Gun runner? {has this truly been clarified/ explained?})</p>

<p>And the last point is just false straight out, you have to provide proper legal identification to purchase a gun legally...you have to provide documents to get said identification. If you provide illegal/ false identification to purchase a firearm then you are a criminal and that is a whole other argument/ issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can buy a gun without ID or documentation at a gun show in a private sale.  Gun laws also differ from state to state.  In Louisiana they might as well be non-existent.</p>

<p>Newtown was an autistic kid that went psycho.</p>

<p>Pulse was a private security guard who went psycho because he was in the closet (despite originally portrayed as a terrorist)</p>

<p>Vegas is also a psycho.  Those details are murky but gun running might be part ofthe narrative.</p>

<p>The Batman shooter was a crazy psycho.</p>

<p>The Arizona/Giffords shooter was another crazy whackjob.</p>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald was a crazy whack job.</p>

<p>Dylan Roof:  another chip off the psycho racist block.</p>

<p>That&#39;s simply the narrative of mass shooters.</p>

<p>Fast and Furious was an operation run out of the Phoenix ATF.  It was taking place during the Bush era too.  It was some delusional Jack Bauer kind of shit.</p>

<p>The fact is they paint these mass shootings as the acts of lone gunmen who are psycho.</p>

side note used to push gun control agenda without addressing true underlining issues of causation</p>

<p>Pulse- had ties to multiple gov agencies, not flagged and used personal firearm upon &quot;snapping for being gay&quot; no flags in system because as you said he &quot;snapped&quot;? 
side note used to push gun control agenda without addressing true underlining issues of causation</p>

<p>Vegas- no he was a wealth individual who had no motive or agenda that legally? owned firearms despite close contacts claims...just because his &quot;actions&quot; a viewed as psychotic doesn&#39;t mean he was without proper clarification of events.
used to push gun control agenda without addressing true underlining issues of causation...without clear explanations of events</p>

<p>The Batman shooter- give you that one, but claims and evident indicate multiple shooters (mask, gear, and bloody footprint from vehicle where subject was apprehended), but still not flagged due to mental health if memory serves.
used to push gun control agenda without addressing true underlining issues of causation</p>

<p>The Arizona/Giffords-not a mass shooter- people will and can have psychotic breaks and not amount or regulation will control that</p>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald- NOPE! don&#39;t get this one....multiple ties to government agencies, foggy events that transpired, no true explanation and was killed by person with gov contacts as well during time that went against the staus quo of america...</p>

<p>Sirhan Sirhan- not a mass shooter- people will and can have psychotic breaks and not amount or regulation will control that</p>

<p>Hinckley- not a mass shooter- people will and can have psychotic breaks and not amount or regulation will control that</p>

<p>Santa Monica kid- never heard of this one</p>

<p>Miami shooter...(parkland) kept spare key to safe which was locked where firearms were stored, time frame is questionable imo...flagged MULTIPLE times and reported and investigated by authorities...reports of other shooter
used to push gun control agenda without addressing true underlining issues of causation</p>

<p>Dylan Roof:- i&#39;m trying to remember the ins and outs of this one but can&#39;t remember he killed a bunch of blacks if memory serves me right and had prior run ins.with LEO?</p>

<p>you forgot the dc sniper. used stolen rifle, brain washed a youth driver. government trained (if i remember correctly)</p>

<p>psychos will be psychos, mass shooters aren&#39;t crazy nut jobs that can be control through regulation or gun control...they have issues that gun control wont fix. either they are deemed sane and then snap, or already gone and steal. poor and frustrated, or voiceless. the media and gov (one in the same) will uses these events to push a narrative/agenda without addressing the underlining issues.</p>

<p>Fast and Furious- boil it down. the government was supplying firearms to criminals to track the flow into the US for &quot;drug&quot; operations without proper oversight...thus supply criminals with illegal firearms that were then found on US streets.-regulation, control and powers that be did that...no one else. the people paid the price</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is my understanding that the founding fathers put in place a Republic not a Democracy. They were not for the popular vote like you would have in a democracy. </p>

<p>They also said a well regulated malitia is needed, and that the people&#39;s right to bear arms should not be infringed. </p>

<p>Meaning they wanted malitia&#39;s regulated, but people to have access unimpeded. They knew a malitia could be compromised by a tyrannical govt (or in this case the deep state). But armed citizens would be harder to compromise, and thus their access should be not infringed upon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We’re not talking about the popular vote. We’re talking about the unimpeded right to vote encoded in 6 different amendments.  Republicans want to regulate voting more than guns.   </p>

<p>The right to bear arms is not an unlimited right. It says it is to be well regulated.  If the Supreme Court believed gun ownership shouldn’t be regulated they would strike down every state law that seeks to put regulations on guns.  They have allowed states to set their own gun laws because the Constitution implies regulation but doesn’t provide a specific legal framework for regulation leaving it to the states under the 10th amendment. </p>

<p>Again my point was conservatives feel regulating the right to vote is more important than guns.  The right to vote is to unimpeded. </p>

<p>Regulating guns does not infringe on your rights to gun ownership.  You can still own guns </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh ok I thought we were talking about the founding fathers and what they had written down for the constitution. Because the 15th amendment (the 1st about voting) was not ratified until WAAAAAY after the Constitution was written up, and the founding fathers were all underground. 
See I read the 2nd as &quot;A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.&quot; 3 thoughts and sentences. Hence the &quot;,&quot; 1st part talks about militia&#39;s. 2nd part talks about the people (us normal citizens) the 3rd says they shall not be infringed. </p>

<p>The SCOTUS has ruled on this, but I do not feel they had the founding fathers ideas in mind. Just like you and your ideas that the founding fathers wanted our (common citizens) voices heard in the voting booth. </p>

<p>Republicans want who is legally entitled to vote to vote as per the constitution. Those that wish to undermine our sovereignty wish to dilute the vote with mass immigration, undocumented, and some highly questionable dead people.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the right to vote more important than guns? Isn&#39;t voting &quot;your voice&quot; to policy makers? Would you not want your voice heard and not diluted with people that should not be voting? </p>

<p>Regulating guns is the very definition of infringement.<br/>
infringement: the action of limiting or undermining something.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I go out and buy any Gun I want today? No I can not it is regulated that way.&lt;&lt;&lt; 
So that means it is not infringed on? </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I can, however, walk into my polling place, tell them my name, have them look up my info on the sheet, show them my Drivers License (validating who I am), then walk right into the machine cast my vote and done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no language in the Constitution that says the right to vote is to be restricted.  Conservatives want to regulate voting more than gun ownership.  </p>

<p>The Founding Fathers never intended for all citizens to bear arms either.  Only members of the militia.  That’s why we had militia acts for 150 years defining who could bear arms. So the founding fathers argument is empty on both counts.  The right to bear arms was expanded to include all citizens waaaay later.  </p>

<p>There’s no evidence of massive voter fraud but there’s tons of evidence of violent gun crime and mass shootings that could be reduced with proper regulation of guns. </p>

<p>Again, Republicans want to make it harder to vote than to buy a gun despite regulation being written into the 2nd amendment and language that explicitly says voting shall not be impeded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. 
Regulation=infringement. Any time you make it harder for someone to do something is infringing on that.
For example. Fresh Air. You breath it right now. I am not infringing on that. If I close the window or door I am infringing on your ability to get fresh air. I am not denying you access to air. I am just infringing on your ability to get fresh air. </p>

<p>So if they regulate who can vote by asking to see a drivers license is that impeding your ability to vote? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Restricting the sale of guns and arms is not infringement.  You can’t buy stinger missiles at wal mart despite them being arms because of the threat to public safety.  You can’t buy nuclear arms either for the same reason. Clearly there is room for sensible regulations.  Nobody is saying ban all guns, just regulate them as written in the Constitution. </p>

<p>Nobody is required to have a drivers license or any official ID.  Some states with Voter ID require special state rendered ID.  These laws have consistently been ruled unconstitutional and labeled as poll taxes. </p>

<p>So if they regulate who can vote based on your legal citizenship status that is not infringing on your right to vote. They are not denying your right to vote (unless legally you can&#39;t). They are not saying you can&#39;t vote. They are just regulating it sensibly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no language saying the right to vote needs to be regulated.  It says specifically the right to vote shall not be impeded.  Putting barriers in place impedes your right to vote and violates the Constitutional right to vote.  The right to vote is written into 6 different amendments, not just 1 like the right to bear arms.</p>

<p>Regulation of guns, as is written in the 2nd amendment is not infringing on your right to bear arms.  You still have the right to bear arms, but the 2nd amendment states the right to bear arms needs to be well regulated for the security of a free state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regulation is written into the 2nd period.  The Supreme Court doesnt believe the 2nd amendment is an unlimited right to bear arms, otherwise theyd have struck down any states attempt to apply gun regulations.  The Supreme Court has had a conservative majority for the last 40 years.</p>

<p>The right to vote specifically states that there should be no impediments to a citizens right to vote.  Rendering special ID is a poll tax and thats why the Supreme Court have struck down those laws.  You are not required to have any ID as a citizen.  A drivers license is a privilege not a right.  There is no language saying the right to vote needs to be regulated.  None at all.  Conservatives are trying to make it harder to vote than to buy a gun.</p>

<p>Why should I as a liberal be screaming for regulation and voter protections?  There is no evidence of any voter fraud problem.  There are only empty allegations that nobody can prove.  In fact, the data says the majority of voter fraud takes place by poll workers, not voters.  Denying or disenfranchising citizens from their Constitutionally protected right to vote is the real issue that needs attention.</p>

<p>Prove that &quot;the democratic party themselves violated more than half of their voters this past electoral cycle.&quot;   If this is about the primary, the DNC selects the candidates for the general election and  yes I was pissed.  That&#39;s the drawback to a 2 party system and a voting system that has open and closed primaries that vary from state to state.</p>

<p>It was Republicans that made a mockery of voting rights by passing laws requiring voters to get specially created ID&#39;s from the state, that used taxpayer dollars and required voters to take time off work and get that special ID.  They also purged valid voters from the rolls and have been caught with gerrymandered maps that state Supreme Courts said were unconstitutional.  They are more interested in regulating voting than gun buying.</p>

<p>My point still holds:  Republicans are more interested in regulating voting than gun ownership.</p>

Requiring the use of an ID has been struck down as unconstitutional. Again there is no evidence of a massive voter fraud problem.

    <div class="md"><p>Your arguments are getting desperate now.  You have to register to vote and giving your name at the poll location simply verifies you are registered.</p>

<p>Even if Voter IDs are free there is still a cost to the taxpayer as their taxes are paying for those IDs.  They also have to take time off work to acquire that ID.  Those are impediments to voting and considered a poll tax.</p>

<p>No evidence exists showing a voter fraud problem.  There is no Constitutional requirement to regulate voting.  There is a Constitutional requirement to regulate arms for the security of a free state.  There&#39;s also massive amounts of evidence showing gun violence is a problem.</p>

<p>Im not for voter fraud.  There is no evidence theres even a voter fraud problem.  Tens of thousands of citizens are being denied their right to vote because guys like you insist there is a problem that you cant prove.  Theres no need for sensible voting regulations when there is a complete lack of evidence of voter fraud.  Its even worse because tens of thousands of citizens were denied their right to vote because of arbitrary regulations, later deemed unconstitutional, passed by Republicans to suppress the vote of minorities, students and the elderly.</p>

<p>Ironically of the 6 cases of voter fraud found in Kansas by Kris Kobach, 4 were Republicans voting in 2 states.</p>

<p>I disagree with this argument. <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/guns-and-suicide/">There&#39;s been a lot of research that shows a dramatic increase between successful suicides, and access to firearms</a></p>

<p>A close friend of mine killed himself with his parents shotgun years ago. I always wonder if he&#39;d be alive if his parents had it locked up. There&#39;s time to regret it if you take pills. My old roommate saw at least 1 person a week who tried to slit their own throats and, contrary to media depictions, almost all of them survive. With a shotgun, it&#39;s just a quick click and it&#39;s over. A permanent solution to a temporary problem.</p>

<p>The really fucked up part is there&#39;s nobody to clean up the mess. It was left to his parents to figure out how to deal with cleaning his brains out of the carpet and skull fragments from the ceiling. They&#39;ve really never been the same. </p>

<p>How did you get from 30,000 to 5,100? 65% (19,500) are suicides, those don&#39;t count, are you also disqualifying the police killings and the accidents? those shouldn&#39;t be disqualified in my opinion. it should be 10,500. </p>

<p>I disagree with this. If guns were harder to buy, less people would shoot themselves. If there were laws for storing guns in safes, less kids would use their parents guns to kill themselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame people in favor of some gun reform laws are so informed on the subject, they discredit their opinions with how unaware of statistics they are. most people in favor of gun control also know nothing about the different type of guns, and current guns laws already in place, they just yell &quot;gun control&quot; cuz they think it&#39;s an easy solution to school shootings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>honest Question from someone who has grown up in countries with strict Gun Control (Europe) and now living in a country where guns are extremely difficult to obtain (Japan). </p>

<p>I will not talk about how not having guns changes the landscape, reduces death (any avoidable death needs to be acted on), or how it changes the view we have on law enforcement (not scary, but rather very helpful). </p>

<p>I would rather ask a very basic question. The second amendment in the US, as I understand it, was established at a time where there were no alternative to deadly fire arms to self-defense. </p>

<p>Keeping the spirit of the second amendment, rather than following it to the letter, and adapting it to the 21st century: </p>

<p>Would people be receptive to self-defense solutions that are not deadly? (Think Taser on Steroids for instance.. many other options available I&#39;m sure)</p>

<p>Basically responding to the same need, without the avoidable death. </p>

<p>Would this be acceptable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the suicide point, which is so easily debunked its not worth the time, this is spot on in regard to my, and many american&#39;s interpretations of the constitution.  </p>

<p>The second amendments focus was not primarily self defense, it was societal defense against tyranny. As such it should, and to an extent, does scale with modern advances in weaponry.  There are already numerous restrictions to this in action, as well as several that have been tried and repealed historically, either as unlawful, or as ineffective in their intent.    </p>

<p>Much joking is done about Fedora Man defending his home against modern military weaponry, given that a tank can take an entire block of Fedora Man in about a minute.    </p>

<p>This fails to take into account that in a true war on the people scenario, the Gov&#39;t is severely limited in the military options they deploy. They are not going to bomb US cities. They are not going to roll tanks down the avenue, and they wont be launching missiles at civilian aircraft.    </p>

<p>This give an enormous edge to the armed citizenry, people who know their areas, and are willing to fight what would amount to an urban &#39;door to door&#39; war with highly armed infantry, Infantry that knows it&#39;s fighting and killing it&#39;s own people, in a form of warfare that is well known as some of the deadliest that can happen.  This is widely regarded as an unwinnable scenario. It becomes much more plausible if you disarm your population first.  </p>

<p>Our government ranks easily among those with the least overt control over its broad and very large, heavily armed population.</p>

<p>I tend to believe that in a given game, if an opponent manipulates the play-field in such a way as to make something that would gain them power easy to do, they fully intend to do that thing, and then assert that power.  </p>

<p>As such a move to disarm citizenry would be an opening move to making our population MUCH more prone to manipulation through force.  </p>

<p>Given that statistically not only are school shootings not on the rise, but neither is actual gun violence, who then benefits from the change in access to weaponry?   </p>

<p>I was, until just this morning, firmly on the side of,  &quot;look, no one is coming to take your guns.&quot; but we now have a retired Supreme Court Justice literally saying we should repeal the entire 2nd amendment. That would be the end of this country in my mind. </p>

<p>In short, sad as it actually is, Fedora Man is actually good for the status quo of this country, and that status quo right now actually includes a long term reduction in gun violence, with exception to our law enforcement officers, who are killing people at record pace in our country with virtual impunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very interesting view point (no sarcasm, I really think so). So for many people, the spirit of the second amendment is less about self-defense and more about having the collecting means to overthrow an abusive government. </p>

<p>I never thought people actually wanted this, but now that you mention it, I&#39;ll need to review my viewpoint indeed. </p>

<p>As for police violence, I would have the same comment: wouldn&#39;t it be justified to offer a non-lethal alternative (or less lethal alternative), a step-up from tasers, but (in most cases) non lethal. </p>

<p>I would leave it to hungry corporations to grab that market if official statements are released.  </p>

Maybe you should check it out and let me know what you think <a href="https://youtu.be/bX4qUsgHa4Y">https://youtu.be/bX4qUsgHa4Y</a> if you don&#39;t want to watch it what I remember is that: you saud that 65% of gun related deaths are suicide and say that gun control can&#39;t change that but what it can change is the chance of survival. There&#39;s a higher chance of survival from commiting suicide a different, usually more premeditated, way rather than just grabbing a gun and pulling the trigger. I&#39;m not saying what you wrote is wrong or that I support gun control or that I don&#39;t. I&#39;m impartial since I don&#39;t know much about it but maybe this video could help the discussion or something. </p>

How are they parroting the talking points of MSNBC and not the shooting victims here. Deep down they know that criminals can always get guns but they somehow want to keep them out of the hands of the &quot;disturbed&quot; who, in the grand scheme of things, is just a boogeyman, who may or may not be able to get a gun (if the nutso fucks with drugs he may be able to buy one on the street). They just want the news stories to stop, but the news folks aren&#39;t mere reporters. They&#39;re manipulators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You talked about how 65 percent of gun deaths were suicides and how  you thought it would never really stop it if guns had more strict laws. But in fact, it does, because, according to various studies with people that tried to commit suicide and survived, the decision is made usually very close to the attempt itself, and sometimes, even the smallest of things for example putting your gun and your bullets in two separate places can stop a suicide, so, yes, maybe making guns law more strict would stop some of these suicides, but unfortunately, not all of them. Adn I don&#39;t really think there is measuring deaths, a life is a life, and I think we should try to limitate the deaths by any meanings, no matter if it is related to gun violence or heart diseases.</p>

Taxes are a contract that we all agree to to get things done.
Private corporations can&#39;t be trusted to do anything but steal as much from everyone as they can. Government representatives are voted in and out office and at least there&#39;s some control there.
We need governments to collect taxes and get things like roads and bridges built. Private companies doing these things would rob you blind everyday just to drive up to the corner store, and CANNOT be trusted to do anything in the public interest. Period</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to round out your thought process I’m going to paint a picture.  I have a really shitty day, wife leaves me, kids are attacked by some incurable disease, etc etc, and at this point I decide life is not worth living.  How do I do it?  I do some research and discover that most people commit suicide with a firearm. I want to end my life the right way, but I don’t own a firearm. So, I drive to the nearest gun shop/sporting good store.  I have no idea what type of firearm will do the job so I converse with the salesman. We get it figured out and have decided on a firearm that will do the trick.  After completing a form that takes 10-15 minutes to complete and after waiting for the salesman to call my information in for the back ground check (which can take anywhere from 10 minutes to a week).  I then drive home and shoot myself?!  Really?!?!   Currently only 32% of American homes own firearms.  I have done some research and it is true that most suicides are, for the most part, spontaneous. Your argument currently only applies to, at best, a third of American people.  Suicide is horrible, but to argue that it is worth sacrificing a liberty as important as free speech due to a few lost souls is unintelligent and quite frankly cowardly. </p>

<p>If you really want to be able to fight the US military, you should be out there protesting for MORE gun rights. You guys need weaponized drones, tanks, machine guns, apache helicopters, etc. to all be legalized if your dream of fighting off the US military is ever going to be possible.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not about winning, its about resisting.  The US military needs all those things to invade and control its foreign adversaries.  I accept that.   The fear being perpetuated is that &#39;Oh no, one day the US military will turn on its civilians.&#39;   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that will ever happen.  Civilization actually has an intrinsic value.  Anyone trying to &#39;conquest&#39; the US would want to keep the working mechanism working with little interruption.  Attacking/oppressing the workers would actually work against that goal, so the motive for your premise doesn&#39;t really concern me as a legitimate threat.</p>

<p>The real premise is that the US has law enforement that civilians can only barely trust to straddle the line between protection and corruption and when you&#39;re being &#39;forced&#39; into doing something, a gun provides a last line of defense for yourself.  </p>

<p>If a tank wants to flatten my town, my town is flattened, but there goes all the value included.  Not a lot of resources to mine or extract.   </p>

<p>If a group wants to tell me I can no longer live on my land.  They&#39;ll be more likely to do it through the &#39;legal system&#39; than through force, especially if they are aware the homeowner is a gun owner.   </p>

<p>Its taking advantage of most peoples instinct toward self preservation.  It actually is similar to the though as to why many countries want to be nuclear powers.   </p>

<p>Its not so they can take over the world, its so that people are afraid to attack their corner of it. (most cases, obviously bad apples exist.)  A gun to a civilian serves the purpose of the nuke.  You can&#39;t just attack them out of fear of them attacking you back.  </p>

<p>Thats my take on it anyway.  </p>
