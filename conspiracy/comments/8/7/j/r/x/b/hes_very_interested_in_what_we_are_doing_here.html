<p>-Donald Trump on his relationship with Putin in 2013</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Dn1ZK2kcfQ8">https://youtu.be/Dn1ZK2kcfQ8</a></p>

<p>Why would the leader of Russia be &quot;very interested&quot; in what Donald Trump has to say back in 2013? Way before he declared his presidency.</p>

<p>Trump then goes on to praise Putin which should surprise no one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the CBTS Livestream explains what is going on very well.  It is best when Jerome Corsi is on, but you can look up Corsi&#39;s videos and just watch those.  </p>

<p>Trump was told years ago about what is going on with the U.S. government.  He was asked to run for President by certain groups, who guaranteed his protection.  </p>

<p>Trump was told about the Uranium One deal, and a bunch of other things.  This is why Putin would be interested in what Trump is doing.  </p>

<p>Trump was told that it was almost too late to save America, and this convinced him to run for President.  </p>

<p>&quot;In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,&quot; Donald Trump Jr. said at a New York real-estate conference that year. &quot;Say, in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo, and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you are saying.  However, the same group created both Communism and Fascism as opposing forces.  They create conflicts between Communism and Fascism to drive their agenda.  This is why Communism and Fascism are opposites.  </p>

<p>Hegelian Dialectics:   </p>

<p><a href="https://webporter.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/hegelian-dialectics-for-dummies/">https://webporter.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/hegelian-dialectics-for-dummies/</a></p>

<p>&quot;The Hegelian dialectic reduced to its simplest form could be summed up as problem, reaction, solution. The “agent of change” employing the strategy creates the problem or crisis, foments the reaction (tension), and then attempt to control the outcome by providing the solution (resolution).  </p>

<p>The Hegelian strategy requires an alchemic process of tension and resolution in order to reach a predetermined outcome. But how do we create tension in a group and control the outcome? One way to create tension is to introduce diversity. By introducing diversity into the group, tensions are raised, and the chances of conflict are increased. Diversity is needed for conflict, according to the Hegelian model.&quot;  </p>

<p>So, there is no reason to have Antifa unless you have an opposing force to conflict with them.  This is what happened in Charlottesville.  The conflict was facilitated because the police were ordered to stand down.  </p>

<p>Same with Parkland and same with the Las Vegas shooting.  The solution is more gun control because the American people cannot be dominated if they are armed.  </p>

<p>People focus on what Antifa is doing, but they do not focus on the hidden hand that is using Antifa as a tool to further their agenda.  Same with the group that opposes Antifa.  Do you see what I mean?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The international bankers want sanctions against Russia because Russia paid off all of their debt to them.  That is why Russia and Putin are &quot;evil&quot;.  The U.S. owes over $20 T in debt, so we make a huge interest payment to the international bankers.  See how it works?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is commenting on OUR as in Americas relation. The word WE as in a collective country.</p>

<p>It really is a non consequential statement. A leader of  a major country interested in what moves America is making. Whoopidoo </p>

<p>Trump made himself a regular in politics long ago. He had the Clintons over at his wedding. Trump is a billionaire who hung out with  and bribed politicians for years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the CBTS Livestream explains what is going on very well.  It is best when Jerome Corsi is on, but you can look up Corsi&#39;s videos and just watch those.  </p>

<p>Trump was told years ago about what is going on with the U.S. government.  He was asked to run for President by certain groups, who guaranteed his protection.  </p>

<p>Trump was told about the Uranium One deal, and a bunch of other things.  This is why Putin would be interested in what Trump is doing.  </p>

<p>Trump was told that it was almost too late to save America, and this convinced him to run for President.  </p>
