    <div class="md"><p>For a few higher value targets, yeah they could do that.  You do have to take into account that LEO presence in relations to civilians is anywhere from 100-500:1.  Their &quot;starve out&quot; tactics only work as long as none of the other gun owners in the area do anything about it, which in a civil war-type scenario, I think LEO would be forced to retreat pretty damn fast.  If they choose to perform door-to-door raids, people on both sides end up getting killed pretty much instantly and that would set off the powder keg.</p>

<p>Facebook elected Trump against TPTB will because they double dipped selling data to both sides. Now they’re being punished.</p>

<p>On one hand, I’m celebrating because the public finally knows the truth. On the other I am horrified, because if TPTB can wipe $100B in value off Facebook in a week and bring a billionaire as powerful as Zuckerberg to his knees then how the hell is an average normal citizen supposed to stand a chance against these people?</p>

<p>If Zuckerberg was a true leader, he would rebel and use Facebook to bring these people down. Instead he’s hiding little a frightened child.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so i was thinking.. right now the US in up in arms about facebook &amp; their selling of our information to third parties; mostly as targeted ads &amp; POVs. now this should&#39;ve been pretty obvious from the get go, but still, there&#39;s a massive assult on FB @ the moment. I don&#39;t see much happening from this, besides a loss in monetary value.</p>

<p>what&#39;s more interesting is that this could also play into a diversion towards the massive data gathering that&#39;s going on through all these home media devices, i.e. alexa, google, &amp; apple. the data being collected through these devices is OUTSTANDING. you can only get so much from text, now, it&#39;s an active listener in your personal life.. think about the profile being collected on the consumer. </p>

<p>when tensions start to boil, someone needs to get burnt, &amp; facebook is the martyr. nothing will change &amp; people will forget about it. no wonder change never comes about.</p>
