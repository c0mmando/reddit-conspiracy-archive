       Usually when TPTB end or attack some structure or system or make the information public, they are already way ahead of the game with the next generation of tech. We see this with military tech and computer tech. I postulate that with the recent Surveillance information that is in the public domain including the recent Facebook Revelation, the next generation of surveillance tech is already firmly in place.

       Palantir is a privately owned data mining company which doesn't sell shares publicly on the stock market. Facebook can't buy them out unless the agreement was mutual and Palantir wanted to sell enough shares to Facebook through a private trade.

       I wasn't specifically talking about that company, just the fact like media consolidation, these tech companies buy up any potential rivals to retain control.  FB even offered snapchat like $3B when it wasn't worth peanuts at the time.

       Right!? Some metaphorical philosopher's stone, straight out of Lord of the Rings.

       I discovered the story behind Lord of the Rings may have originated from the Seal of Solomon:

       struck me at the time as a personal fuck you message to Zuckerberg after he made a move to soften his personal public image at the cost of moneyed interests.  I imagine he forgot his place and is now paying for it in a big way.

       Overblown presumption. More likely the media circus is to quash any chance at similar efforts in the next election, which would have been presumably larger. Besides Facebook's data is a voluntary submission so unless your proposed system is strong arming personal data ("literally log your daily activity and info or else we're coming over with force") there's no analogous system for the millions more users now weary of data farming.

       Can't remember where I read it, but recently the idea that instead of us (for intents and purposes, first world) trying to bring the third world up in living standards, we are sinking to theirs. The whole social credit thing in China may have been some beta-test.

       For sure, the social score we see in China is what we should expect for the whole world. Thought crime, pre-crime, everyone will be monitored at all times to see if they are a threat to the"utopian" peace they have set up. It's basically forcing people to be good citizens facing a barrel of a gun.

       Yea that's true, it would be naive to think that "they" don't know about who has guns or who is stockpiling. They don't even have to invade these peoples house they can set up a perimeter around the targets and stop food supply and shut off electricity to force people to come out peacefully. But either way fighting or being waited out both suck.

       For a few higher value targets, yeah they could do that.  You do have to take into account that LEO presence in relations to civilians is anywhere from 100-500:1.  Their "starve out" tactics only work as long as none of the other gun owners in the area do anything about it, which in a civil war-type scenario, I think LEO would be forced to retreat pretty damn fast.  If they choose to perform door-to-door raids, people on both sides end up getting killed pretty much instantly and that would set off the powder keg.

       It's funny how anyone who perceives the world differently or has ideas that seem just too far out are written off as crazy or tin foil hat guys. Now most of the dystopian reality that is gradually coming online is not even hidden anymore, but people still are in denial. Some people are just ahead of their time and connect dots that seem like they would be completely unrelated.

       Let's be honest. With recent news in advancement in electrical generation, renewable energy and AutoNation PLUS ai and space mining, there won't be a need for uneducated humans and they'll have to choose education and contributing to the NWO society where you likely get a daily balance you can save or spend and get nearly anything cheap.

       Yes, this has been planned for a long time. They are definitely trying to execute a “managed decline” of the USA and Europe to try and bring us into line with the rest of their global system. The mass immigration is to break apart our identity and our connection to the past, and therefore our resistance to change. Not long now...

       it's called windows 10, an automatic update that you cannot stop? That will update over any work you are doing? You think the dev's wouldn't have had something like that in mind if it was just a regular update? This one was important, and it showed just how important by the forceful install.

       Yea I agree, windows 10 was forcefully installed and shoved down everyone's throats. Between windows 10, and smartphones combined with internet everywhere they have a real-time profile of everyone. They don't need people to input the data anymore since the data points are everywhere and automatically collected.

       This is true and false.

       Your statement indicates that every PC running Windows was forced to upgrade to Windows 10. That much is not factual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, a large portion of people came back from a PC break one day to realize Win10 had installed itself, but it
       <em>
        should have
       </em>
       given people the option to immediately revert back to whatever version of Windows you had previously.
      </p>
      <p>
       This happened to me. Was gone for about an hour, came back to Win10.  Immediately switched it back and then my "free upgrade" went away.

       It's also possible that the socially-positive aspects of Facebook (eg, the public flow of information NOT strictly controlled by TPTB) have been deemed unacceptable, and they now judge that it's worth the "cost" of losing that vector of control if (in sinking Facebook) they can seriously damage the public's direct information sharing ability.

       I tend to think this is the move. They figure they can damage control with "regulations" and at the same time and have the smoke screen of "The Government" to hide behind for legitimacy. Facebook should of burned for this but the public is just so conditioned still.

       This.

      <p>
       Facebook elected Trump against TPTB will because they double dipped selling data to both sides. Now they’re being punished.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand, I’m celebrating because the public finally knows the truth. On the other I am horrified, because if TPTB can wipe $100B in value off Facebook in a week and bring a billionaire as powerful as Zuckerberg to his knees then how the hell is an average normal citizen supposed to stand a chance against these people?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Zuckerberg was a true leader, he would rebel and use Facebook to bring these people down. Instead he’s hiding little a frightened child.

       You misunderstand my intention, this could be considered a victory if we all of sudden forgot that the NSA isn't watching us through TVs, phones, aircraft, wireless routers etc.. I think the days of willingly handing over data are over because it is not needed anymore. The data is being collected from multiple points and requires no more consent.

       IF it's won, as a media battle.

       If we just let Facebook off the hook, the best chance we had is gone. And if we convince ourselves that the only reason Facebook is on the hook in the first place is that the battle is already lost, that's just a demoralization campaign that is counterproductive.

       so i was thinking.. right now the US in up in arms about facebook &amp; their selling of our information to third parties; mostly as targeted ads &amp; POVs. now this should've been pretty obvious from the get go, but still, there's a massive assult on FB @ the moment. I don't see much happening from this, besides a loss in monetary value.

       what's more interesting is that this could also play into a diversion towards the massive data gathering that's going on through all these home media devices, i.e. alexa, google, &amp; apple. the data being collected through these devices is OUTSTANDING. you can only get so much from text, now, it's an active listener in your personal life.. think about the profile being collected on the consumer.

       when tensions start to boil, someone needs to get burnt, &amp; facebook is the martyr. nothing will change &amp; people will forget about it. no wonder change never comes about.

       I'm not sure what to think of OAUTH. It's the constant between all these systems and sites. There is a blog that goes more in detail, also how it sucks to implement:
       <a href="https://developer.telerik.com/featured/oauth-has-ruined-everything/">
        https://developer.telerik.com/featured/oauth-has-ruined-everything/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       With OAuth they got us by the balls because users are too lazy to register. Devs don't want to feed the kraken but users are demaning it. Weird world, ain't it?

       Palantir is a privately owned data mining company which doesn't sell shares publicly on the stock market. Facebook can't buy them out unless the agreement was mutual and Palantir wanted to sell enough shares to Facebook through a private trade.
