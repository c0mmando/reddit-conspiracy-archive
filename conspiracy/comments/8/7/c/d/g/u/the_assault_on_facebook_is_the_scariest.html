       For all of the fake news shared and data harvested, getting people to give up Facebook only serves the established institutions and their grip on power. There are so many examples, but here are a few:
      </p>
      <p>
       The West Virginia teacher's strike was accomplished without official union representation, but just coordinated through a Facebook group.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, Facebook means control of the political news we get. I was just listening to Bernie Sanders in an interview talking about how he got 20 seconds of coverage from TV news in the last election, but he's been throwing Facebook town halls with millions of viewers recently. There are a lot of organizations looking to upset the Democratic primaries, and vote in candidates who care about voters, not corporate campaign donations. They're also organizing and spreading information on Facebook and social media. Without Facebook you're back to either letting the media decide who they cover, and what they cover. It seems like no surprise that this is hitting a fever pitch as we're running into the primaries for 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social media has its problems and drawbacks, but it also allows people to share and amplify information without official editors deciding what can and can't be shared. This attack on Facebook is an attack on your right to receive and spread the information you choose. Reddit's nice, but your grandparents aren't on here, and they vote.

       Most people use it for all the useless crap that doesn’t influence anyone...
In the same way people have the right to use Facebook, people with any amount of intelligence have the right to use other platforms to inform themselves on topics anyway, without the need of social media

       The issue with SM isn't its ability for communication- that's the dream of the web itself. The issue with Socials is the voluntary mass data collection, and the utilization of that data. It's the creation of mental safe spaces where only ideas you like or agree with get through to you. And it's the destruction of old social bonds by a twisted sense of "friendship" and the dopamine release that comes with dozens, or hundreds, of thousands of people you don't know liking some staged snapshot of your life.

       Facebook has a massive reach that we, as ordinary people have access to for now. How do you get messages out to old people, who aren't on reddit, but do vote? Why give up a platform.

       Well first, I can't give up a platform I've never used. Secondly- as I said, it is about privacy and what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       give up for access to that platform. If you want to let FB, and whoever they sell your data to, to know everything about you, your friends and family, what you like, believe, and so much more, that is totally your prerogative.
      </p>
      <p>
       But massive social change happened before FB, just like it can happen without it. There was no internet when the Civil Rights movement started, nor during the 30's when the country collapsed economically, nor in the 60's with the political violence and assassinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are ways to work around it, but as I said, it's your prerogative if you want to work within that beast.

       So you're a "straight up" shill for facebook?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you're just defending a site and founder who uses and abuses you and your rights and those who seek to manipulate you for political and social experiments?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ok, people here know exactly what you're up to even if you are legitimately that ignorant of your actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a terrible, terrible attempt to be some kind of a real "user" of facebook coming to its defense.  This is only an example of what a shilling effort would attempt to do on this sub in order to combat the realizations that more and more people are coming to as time goes on.  One of the best examples here that r/conspiracy is touching on some spots that certain people with too much money would not like touched on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey, its just a shame that you're the one to be manipulated enough to have to do the job and this is your best effort.  A post.  You're just the tool, you're just the sucker they managed to convince to come here on their behalf.  It's quite the funny thing.  Or wait, I'll use one of the lines that always comes out that certain shills love to use.

       I just assumed that I was wasting my time arguing with a bunch of opinion influencing professionals who camp out on r/conspiracy, downvoting real issues, and upvoting flat earther content; and that you've got time since you're getting paid for this.
      </p>

       I'm bringing up something that goes against the MSM narrative, and you're fighting for the "social networks are scary" line that MSM 's been touting since the beginning of the internet.

       We've always been used and abused by the media. The selective promoting and suppression of stories has gotten us into wars, altered our diets, fueled our fears and paranoia. Facebook has problems, but I can post on it and reach people. I can't post to the front page of the NYT.

       Facebook is a part of the internet where people can amplify each others' voices. It has tremendous reach, and is easy to use. Of course everyone who wants to manipulate people is on there, but they're everywhere. At least it's a platform that we have the option to use.

       Lolol and you assume FB is non bias? FB IS just as bad if not worse than MSM when it comes to censorship and misinformation. FB is a tool of the elites, not the bastion of free speech you seem to believe it is.

       No, but if it doesn't like what you say they can shadow ban you where those 100 people never see what your crying about today. Facebook monitors everything you say and do. They know more about you than yourself.

       I think I get your idea that we can make changes with Facebook,  but if they control what we share then it's imposible to think that Facebook would be useful in case we want to make a big change (something like fire trump)

       They've largely been hands off until this whole fake news narrative has been putting pressure on them to regulate it more and more. "Fake news" was the start of the campaign to take the narrative back from the people on Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you've got the top comment on your elected representative's post, calling them on their bullshit, that's more interaction and impact that you get through other mediums. Powerful people don't like not controlling the narrative.

       I actually agree with what you're saying here and will receive the appropriate amount of downvotes, I'm sure. But Facebook is not only used for benign things but also for organizing rallies and other things. It's probably easier to spill the dirt on Facebook than to try and discredit all the rallies. Very strategic, probably by the very people this sub is in support of ousting. And this sub is defending the action, just as expected, because of their hate for Facebook.
