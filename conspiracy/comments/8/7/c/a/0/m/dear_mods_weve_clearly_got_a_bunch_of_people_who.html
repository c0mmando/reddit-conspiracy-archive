         What we do on this sub is share information related to conspiracies then analyze, question and discuss it.
         <br/>
         If it were just us agreeing with each other we'd get bored and leave. We don't need closed-minded people coming here to try to gaslight us, divert our attention and bury valuable comments. We need other open-minded people who already understand that conspiracies not only exist but the world literally operates on them. That is the value of this sub: being share and discuss information with other conspiracy researchers; not have to battle coordinated waves of shills &amp; closed-minded Michael Shermer worshipers.

       I get whay you are saying but there is no way to get legitimate contributors vs shills or bots without requiring everyone to submit to a personal back ground check and who do we trust with that info and power? We can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best way to handle it is the rules we have, fair mods to enforce them and us not feeding the trolls.  And we can also use these narrative parrots to help us counter the narrative by practicing our debating skills and exploring what does and does not work in breaking the hypnotism the audience is languishing in.

       There was a mod takeover that occurred in mid 2017 that ended up being the nail in the coffin.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the new mods were settled in they opened the flood gates to a bunch of users who are not concerned with truth-seeking and come here for no other reason than to disrupt, divide, and distract.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just saw a fucking Vanity Fair article posted with absolutely no commentary, just a title that is literally EXACTLY the same as the title of the article. Fucking VANITY FAIR!!!! What??!?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods, if you’re reading this, here are a few simple ways to improve this sub immensely:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Do not allow users to post links to MSM articles without adding commentary or the purpose for posting it to the sub. (And no, submission statements do not count. I shouldn’t have to scroll through the comment section to be able to read what the original poster was thinking when they posted their content. Half of the time the OP is parroting the viewpoint of the posted content)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Do not allow users to title their post using the same verbiage as the title of the content being posted. (As in, don’t use the same title as the shitty WashingtonPost article you’re being paid to post here).

       What rubric are you going to use for determining what is and isn't MSM? I'm not being snarky - I genuinely believe it isn't always an easy distinction to make. And then we have to ask why users shouldn't be required to add commentary for non-MSM articles.

       Basically, I consider something to be MSM if it gets the majority of it’s revenue from selling advertising. Selling advertising is the main source of revenue for almost all mainstream media outlets. This, by definition, means that truth and accuracy in reporting take second priority to profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it that hard to understand? I think it’s pretty simple. All of it works together, and the way we’re told it works is all just a cute little fairytale that has no grounds in reality. I truly believe that our Democracy is a farce and has been for more than a century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governments do not control the people of the world. Evil, money and greed control governments AND their people.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that posting an MSM article and not providing an opinion about it is lazy and unimaginative. It should be banned. There are too many posts that are nothing more than links to MSM articles with titles that parrot the article. It’s just incredibly,
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       obnoxious. If I wanted to read Vanity Fair I would go to their god damn website.

       Problem is some of these tactics happen organically when people want to "win" a debate. I'm more for a user profile oriented approach. Like the massive horde and users here that just poopoo everything? I would start there. If they don't have anything nice to say....ever...poof gone.

       Well, it's still bad when they do it. So you're not really hurting the discussion by telling people they can't use fallacious logic, right? But it would clean up 90% of our problems in the comments section, because we know almost all of the shills are incapable of actually proving their point, right?

       Not bad, but now you've got to spend a bunch of mod time digging through histories before you can get enough evidence to make a good judgment call, right? Ratio of shills to mods is too high, unless you're going to double the size of the mod team or something.

       I honestly wouldn't be too mad if the mods went around banning everyone who bends over backwards to defend plausible deniability. I don't like censorship, so I'd rather if they didn't, but I'd have a hard time complaining when the victims of censorship are the bad actors I'm blocking anyway.

       Not buying it. None of the front page posts push the MSM narrative. This sub has TEN TIMES as many readers and active users as TopMinds. Most users here, myself included, see right past the TopMinds Bogeyman.

       The real question is, what exactly are you trying to get the mods to do? Hm? They already have a secret Mccarthyism-wannabe sub. They already put posts in contest mode to hide votes. They already create a hundred topics a day lambasting the supposed brigading. Seems to me the only thing left is full-on Thought Policing.

       "normal voting patterns"
There is no such thing. Some articles suck, others are intriguing. Sometimes people get angry about something and vote on it more than usual. Subs gain and lose followers with differing values. Just because they people here are upvoting things you don't like doesn't mean it's a concerted effort to attack you. Plus, mods don't have access to the logs, so you would have no way of knowing if something was brigaded or not other than gut feeling. All this leads to is mods removing content they disagree with. If the community actually felt that something was being manipulated artificially, then either move to a platform where upvotes aren't anonymous, or figure a different way to prove it. All it sounds like at this point is whining that the sub doesn't agree with you.

       That surely can be a manipulation tactic, but you're forgetting about the other side of the equation. Everyone is free to spout nonsense, as well as truth. We can research and see propaganda for what it is if we want. Allowing one viewpoint a pass while condemning another because you disagree with it just opens the door for totalitarianism. Who gets to decide what the truth is? Ideally, no one entity. Consensus is much better, though not infallible to ignorance or bias.

        Using new information obtained from studies of old Soviet files in Moscow and now the famous Venona Intercepts — FBI recordings of Soviet embassy communications between 1944-48 — the record is showing that McCarthy was essentially right. He had many weaknesses, but almost every case he charged has now been proven correct. Whether it was stealing atomic secrets or influencing U.S. foreign policy, communist victories in the 1940s were fed by an incredibly vast spy and influence network.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yes, propaganda exists. But what is propaganda other than arguments and ideas? It isn’t witchcraft or wizardry. It isn’t going to melt your face like that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark; you can engage it rationally without plugging your fingers in your ears and screaming “propaganda!” In the event that the ideas you are debating against online are indeed the product of government deception, you should be able to debunk them using truth and rationality. If there are lies, point them out using truth and facts. If there are half-truths, bring in the other half of the equation. If there are bad arguments relying on bad thinking, refute them with good arguments and good thinking. The methods of refuting propaganda are the same as the methods of refuting anything else, so it’s stupid to act like plugging your fingers in your ears and screaming “propaganda” is a legitimate tactic.

       The problem here isn't the propaganda per se. It's the army of shills and bots who manipulate entire conversation threads and drown out the very arguments you and Caitlin suggest we make. Having a good counterargument doesn't help much when there's a coordinated system to make sure it's not heard.

       The "Deep State" narrative is an alt-right construct, and it, too, appears on the MSM with Fox News.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is there's a mountain of evidence supporting the Trump allegations and Deep State is simply being used to deflect from actual facts.  If someone disagrees with Trump, they are part of the Deep State.  No evidence required, just wild allegations.

       The deep state narrative is a new construct.  It references the theories of the illuminati and other secret cabals pulling the strings of society.  They arent the same thing.  The deep state narrative is being used to attack people who are critical of Trump or disagree with his policies.  They are typically empty allegations with no factual basis.  For instance, the wild and crazy claim that Obama and Hillary are somehow controlling this deep state with George Soros and his bottomless checkbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a form of neo-McCarthyism meant to marginalize those who oppose this administration.  It's also being used to distract, deflect and discredit any factual information that is critical or implicates Trump.

       "Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was meeting with Corey Lewandowski, soon to be Trump's campaign manager, in the spring of 2015, before Trump announced his candidacy and while Cambridge Analytica was still working for Ted Cruz's campaign, Wylie said. And in 2014, "we were testing all kinds of messages and all kinds of imagery — that included images of walls, people scaling walls, we tested 'drain the swamp,' testing ideas of the 'deep state,'" he added. "And a lot of these narratives, which at the time would have seemed crazy for a mainstream candidate to run on, those were the things that we were finding that there were pockets of Americans who this really appealed to. And Steve Bannon knew that, because we were doing the research on it. And I was surprised when I saw the Trump campaign and it started, you know, talking about building walls or draining the swamp.""

       Mike Lofgren of course is a former GOP congressional aide who calls this derivation Deep State 2.0, targeted mainly at liberals and liberal policymakers.  It's a re-framing of the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       So its certainly being popularized by the right wing.  We all know a Continuity of Government Plan exists, but there's absolutely no evidence Obama and Hillary are in cahoots with George Soros to foment some kind of deep state led coup against Trump.  It has been used to attack anyone that doesn't toe the Trump line.  It's become a vehicle to rehash Clinton conspiracies from the last 30 years that were also never proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a narrative being used to attack the opposition or to deflect and distract from actual facts implicating Trump.

       This place never used to be pro-Trump. It was actually quite liberal.

       I would not be surprised if it was used today, to discredit the place.

       Honestly? Not many people actually like Trump. Very, very few do. We all hate people like you, is all, so it looks like we like him, because we like anything that rustles your jimmies. I know that you will never, ever, ever, ever, ever in a million years believe me, but they exist because of a very particular brand of shit that you harbor in you.

       This subreddit demands more than a face value level analysis of ANY mainstream news to be relevant. There is an underlying conspiracy theory of mainstream media propaganda and manipulation. When people talk about mainstream narratives being pushed here, what they mean is that discussion of any alternative narratives or theories is drowned out and downvoted to oblivion.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The report was outlined last week by the panel's top Russia investigator, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said it would
        <strong>
         confirm the intelligence community's finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election
        </strong>
        but break from the agencies' conclusion that the Kremlin preferred a Trump victory.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So the HIC agrees that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, they do not agree with the intelligence agencies that Russia tried to help Trumps campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       So nothing in you said in your original comment is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't take much of what the Republicans are doing in the HIC as faithful.

       So you mean you don't already know the background of the removal of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page from the investigation? The release of their texts showing a strong Anti-trump bias? The editing of 302's covering the interrogation of Flynn and the subsequent suspension of his sentencing hearing? You have no idea why McCabe was fired?

       This is one of those ridiculous narratives that are far too heavily supported in a great sub like r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The usual conspiracy about investigators -- take the Warren Commission for example, or the 9-11 Commission -- is that they are too friendly to the objects of the investigation and the final report is a white wash.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that Robert Mueller is an "enemy" or a "criminal" perverts this whole idea. It doesn't matter who Robert Mueller is -- except that he is not a crony. That's how investigations work.

       No... it’s definitely a narrative being pushed. And yes, the president is under criminal investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you see, the truly perceptive and intelligent person sees that our media and politicians work together to create a charade (much like theatre) to distract us from what really matters, and from discovering real truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, if it’s being reported by the mainstream media, it’s not a conspiracy but rather a story that they want you to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM is the mouthpiece of the powers that be. The sooner you realize that and tune out, the better off our nation will be.

       I'm not sure, I haven't heard them say anything about Nixon, have you? I would expect some kind of eventual opinion shaping on the subject by them based on all the present-time parallels being drawn between Trump and Nixon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think that a comment like "Why did the deep state want to bring him down?" is rather leading as it assumes the "deep state" - which is now the whistle for faceless government boogeymen - did the bringing down and not his own actions. Do you have any evidence that Nixon was an innocent target?

       Some strong indicators that Nixon was set up by Bush and that Bob Woodward was (and still is) a CIA plant.  Lots of details in the movie and the book "All the Presidents' Men" that don't hang together at all, including the incredible bungling by the Watergate burglars, almost like they wanted to get caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also this is a conspiracy site, and we like conspiracies and thinking outside of the corporate box.

       Regardless of whether he was set up, it was only so far that information was leaked. There is no question of what he did and what he knew at this point. The burglars were only caught because of one particularly observant watchman.

       The "observant" watchman had to be led by the nose to the bungled burglary. That took two tries. And then witnesses were killed off including Howard Hunt's CIA "wife" Dorothy along with other key Watergate players and a lot of innocent bystanders when the airplane had a mysterious accident. The CIA loves plane "accidents".

       Because I enjoy the conversations and I find a lot of the thought here interesting. I enjoy participating in debates now and then. This is just one of many subs that I participate in and I appreciate the questions that make me look into things and question things that I wouldn't normally.

       Just pointing out the fallacy that something isn't a conspiracy if the mainstream media is covering it. I could just as easily point out that the Trump-Mueller investigation is a conspiracy either way it is viewed. Just one mainstream narrative is correct (Fox or everyone else).

       The point is not that the Mueller investigation isn't relevant here, but rather that this subreddit demands more than a face value level analysis of ANY mainstream news to be relevant. There is an underlying conspiracy theory of mainstream media propaganda and manipulation. When people talk about mainstream narratives being pushed here, what they mean is that discussion of any alternative narratives or theories are drowned out and downvoted to oblivion.

       In my experience the "mainstream narratives" is seen as anything that questions a conspiracy theory or agrees with the "mainstream media." It doesn't matter if it is the minority view in the thread or the majority view.

       Didny say anything like that. Pointing out that using that comparison is kinda dumb. Saying something happened 46 years ago as an example of how things are currently is stupid.Disagree all you want,just my opinion.

       I misunderstood. My bad. The media is a bad example anyway. They have been a front for higher ups since the get go. Things aren't all the same as they were. As we've progressed as a society, they be progressed in way to keep us indoctrinated.

       One of the most important leaked Hillary emails showed that the State department was well aware that Saudi Arabia was providing the funding for ISIS.  This is an unbelievably important revelation, it should have easily been the news story of the year.

        Not a single media outlet covered this.

       You have a very valid point on the first paragraph. And I understand your suspicion of the media. My only argument is that we should be allowed to discuss Russia here without being told we don’t belong. You may not believe it, cool. I don’t believe Benghazi was Hillary’s fault (or at least not 11 hearings worth of her fault), but I don’t think people that do don’t belong here.

       Way to dodge the point and find a way to be condescending at the same time. This is a place to discuss conspiracies, and neither you or I belong here any more or less based on which conspiracies interest us.

      <p>
       (If the argument about Hillary and Benghazi was merely about the foreign policy decisions that got us into Libya that would be one thing, it wasn’t. It was looking to blame her specifically for the attacks on the embassy in Benghazi and was a purely political witch hunt after the first 3-4 hearings)

       That’s pretty sweet. Are any of those people Trump himself? Can you even tell me why those people you listed above were indicted?

       If you think the reason Trump got elected was because of Russians, I’m sorry, but your perception of the world has no grounding in reality.

       See I didn’t say any of those things. I’m not saying Trump colluded, he’s too dumb and they were smart enough to keep a barrier between him and the Russian government. I still think Russia conspired to meddle in our election and succeeded. I don’t think they elected Trump, our own dumb populace did that. Not that you know how I feel do you have any other straw men you want to prop up for me?

       Then why did you bring up their names? Just for fun?

       I think Trump is smarter than you think. I mean, he is the president of the United States. You are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump won because people were tired of the same old establishment-career politicians pushing the same lies. It’s pretty easy for anyone who took the time to research Clinton’s political career to tell that she is basically a Republican pretending to be a Democrat. Pretty much everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie. She is not “progressive” even in the slightest degree. She also said “It’s my turn to be president”. I can’t respect anyone who would vote for a candidate that said that...

       I can’t find your actual quote anywhere from Hillary. I see a report of a Samuel Rosales-Avila supposedly having an interview with her, where she said this, but I can’t find any actual content from this reporter other than the quote. I’m not ready to call it fake news yet, but I would think I would be able to find an article or video that he published etc. Do you have a link that you trust with that info?

       Fair enough. I followed the campaign pretty closely and didn’t ever hear of that, other than the meme that was floating around. I’m surprised that didn’t get picked up by FOX or Breitbart as that would be a pretty easy attack for them to put together. If you can track it down I would love to hear it. I’ve been up and down the internet and can’t find it (I even searched T_D and HillaryForPrison to no avail).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Samuel Rosales-Avila story I’m pretty convinced that was fake news. Between looking for your video and trying all my Google fu to verify any reporter from La Habra with that name, I literally can find nothing on that persons existence. Every story that has a link for further info just has the same copy and pasted article after the link or a 404’d message. I do not bring this up to Cast doubt on your story or change your opinion in any way. I just thought it was an interesting rabbit hole.

       That's precisely what they did, by implying that everyone who talks about the

       is somehow just a whiny bitch that can't handle people disagreeing with them. It's not a straw man to refute the point someone is implying even if they didn't directly state it. The shills love to imply things.

       I disagree with your implication, and think you think you refuted his position while actually refuting a position he did not take. Yikes.

       I do love the ‘Who are you?’ though. Nice touch. I’d say you are implying I’m an alt account but I don’t want you to have me banned because I didn’t understand your point. I certainly hope you weren’t trying to bait me into a certain logical fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t mind me though. I believe in them pesky MSM narratives like Russia meddled in the US election so I have been told by specific people (no straw man for me thanks) I don’t belong here.

       Okay that is a definite baseless shill accusation. Yikes. You are really treading on thin ice here buddy. My buddy CIAsellsDrugs swings a mean ban hammer and I’m going to let him know all the mistakes you’ve made. He takes this stuff really seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok. Seriously. Sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll admit, I’m being pretty petty here, so I’ll stop. I know you won’t, but hopefully you can see how easily the same ‘rules’ you are spouting can be used against anyone. You are littering this thread with your high and mighty gatekeeping and trigger happy ban finger accusations. Nobody is saying shills don’t exist, despite your attempts to say so. They are saying when you include the phrase MSM narrative it seems like you are not worried about shills as much as opposing viewpoints (since nobody cared when it was Benghazi, Emails, or Fast and Furious). Shills are a genuine problem. So are people trying to silence discussion of popular conspiracies. To you that nuance isn’t important, to others it is very important. You both belong here.
      </p>
      <p>
       My apologies for using words against you, you seem stressed and at the least passionate about this issue, but your criteria seemed to be lacking so I had hoped a little ‘I’m rubber, you’re glue’ would help put things in perspective.

       Im sure I would be labeled as one of those because I dont jump on every bandwagon and often argue down right wing narrative shit.

      <p>
       But in conspiracies, like everything else, there are two sides.
Can a democrat actually hold democratic views without being a shill? 
Sounds like alot of people here want to be able to push whatever theory they want to, with no explanation or debate.

       So if you know you have bias, how do you really know for certain that the left wing conspiracies you dont believe in arent true and how do you know the right wing ones you do believe in are true?  How do you know if youre just not confirming your bias? And if you are just confirming your bias, how do you know your bias is even true?  You seem like a reasonable person and would probably admit there is no way you are correct about everything. If you know you are not correct about everything and that, logically, you must be wrong about something, how do you know what you are right about and what you are wrong about?  The short answer is, you dont.  So if you dont know what youre right about and what youre wrong about, how do you have any opinions or beliefs about anything?

       I mean this applies to anyone. By these guidelines no one should have an opinion about anything.

         Pizzagate has no evidence and is built upon an entirely backward hypothesis -- that HRC did it for political reasons. As we can see from places like this sub, the propagation of "Evil Hillary" killing Seth worked against HRC at the most convenient time right before the election. A valid hypothesis would be to say that Donald Trump or his supporters had Seth killed to both make HRC look "evil" and to provide a dead scapegoat for whoever really released the emails. This conspiracy makes sense.

         The "liberal" media has always been BS, but somehow the notion has staying power. It is corporate. It is not just corporate and not just consolidated into six conglomerates, it is much more. The big media companies are all controlled out of the center of financial power, London. We can tell just by looking at the institutional investors. Nearly every major corporation is controlled by about two dozen entities, media companies included. This is the big corporate conspiracy, and its out in the open. Just go look at who has controlling shares: holding companies like AXA, State Street, Bank of America, Barclay's, etc.

         What Podesta conspiracies work for you? Anything big? He's out of power by the way. In a place like here where we often here things like "both parties are the same" or "TPTB always get their way," we cannot also say that by some magical fluke of our false big picture notion that John Podesta's chosen candidate lost the election, and that somehow, he is pulling the strings from behind the curtain after such a colossal failure. It just doesn't work at all.

       With the exception of Massachusetts, those states with the bad exit polls in the primaries seem to all be Republican controlled states.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Republican controlled states, Republicans control the voting apparatus even for the primaries. This is important to know because if there are significant statistical anomalies, then they would have occurred under Republican control.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, if these primary elections were stolen, it could well be Republicans that stole them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for a little history. The Counterpunch article uses a source called Brennan Center. If you go to its site, you will find that Republicans have been cheating in elections routinely since 2002, after the Grand Theft of the 2000 election. So, Republicans have the will and the ability and the demonstrated track record of cheating on elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for a hypothesis as to why Republicans would cheat for Hillary: it's obvious. Bernie Sanders was well ahead of Hillary his match against Donald Trump. By cheating for Hillary in the primaries, Republicans would have a better chance of getting Donald Trump through the election.

       They didn't. He was considered tolerable at best, but then it got out of control. Now they've gone full retard and are trying to impeach a guy who was going to generally leave things alone, and now he's actively pursuing a swamp-draining program. Have you been paying attention to Q?

       There you go believing what "they" tell you without question. This is r/conspiracy dammit. Look at the facts!
      </p>
      <p>
       It was so obvious that Donald Trump was going to win the primaries right from the beginning that TPTB sold us an "emperor's new clothes" level lie ... that they didn't want Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they didn't want Donald Trump, the corporate media would not have given him billions in free coverage.
      </p>

       If they didn't want Donald Trump, the big donors like Koch and Mercer would have told a whole bunch of candidates to drop out so that Donald Trump has some real competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, they gave out all that free advertising and they were fine with running 18 candidates against Donald Trump. They assured his win in the primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, they took their most discredited neocon types, and had them endorse Hillary Clinton to make sure that she looked like the Establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB got to you big time. The result is deconstruction or society, cutting off healthcare, giant tax cuts mostly for the rich, more military buildup, etc. All the same things RONALD REAGAN and the BUSHES did. You were fooled.

       You are extremely committed to your position. That's not good, and there's no way I can talk you out of it. I didn't say they didn't want Trump at all, I said he was tolerable to them but they preferred others. That has clearly changed, with the CIA media giving him almost exclusively negative coverage.

       Even if you were completely right about Trump, you're taking a far too monolithic view of the oligarchy. They fight each other, to the point of assassinations at times.

       I tend to think the same as you. The think tanks etc would be well aware of how the public’s trust in politicians and mainstream media is at an all time low. What do you do? Frame Trump as being the antiestablishment outsider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at who Trump has taken regular meetings with since he took office- Henry Kissinger. Even Obama didn’t meet with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then look at his picks, Goldman Sachs, Exxon, other wealthy CEOs etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s some infighting at the top so he’s allowed a few wins. The only thing that does make me wonder is the fact that he bombed the opiom fields in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think western countries elections at the moment could be easily won by anybody framed as antiestablishment in terms of wanting to kick out the career politicians rather than someone wanting to bring down the system

       BCCI investigation as reported by the failing New York Times in 1991.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now the fight among investigators is coming out into the open. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who gave impetus to long-contained probes, told a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry that he is getting no cooperation from the Thornburgh Justice Department.
       </p>
       <p>
        Justice's Criminal Division chief, Robert Mueller, tells me he will have a hatchet-burying session with the independent-minded D.A. next week, and vehemently denies having told British intelligence to stop cooperating with the Manhattan grand jury.

        BCCI was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a dirty offshore bank that then-president Ronald Reagan's Central Intelligence Agency used to run guns to Hussein, finance Osama bin Laden, move money in the illegal Iran-Contra operation and carry out other "agency" black ops. The Bushes also benefited privately; one of the bank's largest Saudi investors helped bail out George W. Bush's troubled oil investments.

        Can a democrat actually hold democratic views without being a shill?

       I'd say that's a good representation of my journey. I've got significant gripes with Dem leadership. To my mind there is a jaw dropping integrity problem at play, and the daily outrage are distractions to ride it out without any accountability for clear ethics issues on display. Generally I'm yelled at, labeled, name called, shamed, blocked, and in general meet ad hominem and name calling attacks when arguing points on the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I find myself working with Trump supporters more often than not, and DJT grows on me as a result. There are good people out there. The mental barriers of treating politics as a 'team sport' are reduced by the strategies being deployed these days. At some point you become conditioned to simply ignore the outrage and speak your mind without caring what the response may be. Am I going to be called mean names again? Boo-hoo. I hear it every day.

       If you are literally describing your political views with adjectives derived from political party affiliation, yes, you are absolutely an outsider to this community. Yes, absolutely a shill, for either party. By definition.

       You're misunderstanding.
       <br/>
       I'm not saying we should exclude such people, I'm saying they shouldn't be here. In other words the process of investigating conspiracies would have quickly made it obvious that the two parties are both corrupt and serving the same masters.
       <br/>
       The evidence for this is everywhere.
       <br/>
       So, if we're seeing people here, who aren't new to conspiracy investigation, claiming to be a 'Democrat' or a 'Republican' something's very wrong.

       This is overly simplistic and your claim that they would not work together to monopolize power is incorrect, this is how coalitions work. It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       demonstratively true that Democrats and Republicans have a monopoly (or more accurately, a duopoly) on power. It does not
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to logically follow that they therefore must be the same. It is perfectly possible for two hypothetical parties to be highly opposite, and yet mutually recognize that they stand to benefit greatly from coordinated effort to exclude any other parties from power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just saying "both are the same" is too vague to be usefully correct, since there are many issues they differ on dramatically. What you actually mean, I am sure, is that they are both similar in respect to certain prevailing aspects - such as the desire to control public narratives, dominate control over political power, and level of self and elite interest over public benefits. You might think I'm being pedantic but it's very important to be specific, even though it's easier to just say some vague truism. It still shapes your thinking around issues in ways that may not be accurate.

       critical thought would say that they are on the same team. in order to run in politics you must be on team red or team blue. that's by design. how us citizens not know this shows a lot. people can just down vote though. much iq and critical thought!

       It is, though.  Politicians on both sides are, and always have been, subservient to certain powerful institutions.  The financial institution, the military industrial complex, the intelligence community and the unelected deep state, foreign power players like Saudi Royalty and AIPAC, and large corporations all effectively supercede the two party political system.  This is very apparent from campaign contributions: the banks, the pharmaceutical lobby, AIPAC, etc, all fund both sides of political campaigns so they get their way nomatter who is in power.  The Deep State and the military industrial complex continue operations and invade other nations despite who the puppet in the white house is.
      </p>
      <p>
       People act like the government has the power to crack down and regulate business, but the truth is the opposite.  They rely on corporate donations for their campaigns, they take corporate bribes to enact favourable policy.  All unelected areas of the government such as regulatory agencies have long since been infiltrated by the businesses they are supposed to regulate.
      </p>
      <p>
       They argue about unimportant wedge issues because it makes for good theatre and distracts people from real issues.  Sure, maybe the politicians themselves believe that they are fighting the other party for power, but the true rulers are unelected.  True power doesn't allow the option to be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a conspiracy "theory," it is a conspiracy, it is the reality of the world we live in.  Most of the real important conspiracies happen in these upper echelons of power behind the theatre that is politics.  If you don't "believe" that then come back once you've learned more about conspiracies, or go back to

       Sorry, that doesn't work with this particular conspiracy. There's too much evidence. If someone isn't new to investigating conspiracies and they're still claiming one of those titles, it means something's wrong. Either they're lying, or they're not doing the bare minimum when it comes to investigating, or they've got a serious mental block in place that's not allowing them to see even incredibly clear and prevalent evidence.

       Ya know, I that's a really broad brush you've decided to paint people with. I'm a registered Republican so I can vote in primaries but, I have more in common with moderate democrats, libertarians, and centrists than I do most Republicans. So, since I'm a registered republican and there's this mountain of evidence that they have done corrupt shit, I guess I shouldn't have an interest in conspiracy. Duly noted.

       Amen dude,  a persons political affiliation, belief system, or anything should not be a disqualifier for taking part in conspiracy conversations.
Thats the only way to really get to the root of conspiracies, if you have people from every angle taking part in the discussion.

       I've always wanted to make a post about this. The most obvious conspiracy against the general public is creating a population that can only think with a binary mindset. Right/left, pro-gun/anti-gun, pro-life/anti-life, pro-russia/anti-russia, US/rest of the world, UK/EU...
      </p>
      <p>
       There are NO issues in life that only has two sides to the discussion. There might be two obvious ones or more supported points of view, but there will always be nuances and other angles that should be considered. When you look at everything in a binary way, you've already fallen into their trap. Look at every major issue in mainstream news and you will see them establish the story as a binary equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to think that one thing that sets us apart from machines is that we can engage in a non-binary way. But looking at how most people interact nowadays it seems we really are just shittily programmed meat robots.

       Your post reminded me of a George Carlin bit, where he talks about how the more important the choice the fewer choices you're given.  Of course, I'm fairly sure he also said too many choices isn't healthy, either in the same bit or another one.

       However, searching for that led me to a transcript of his

       Of course not, but that has absolutely nothing to do with my point, which is simply this:
      </p>
      <p>
       We should not seek to banish those who disagree with our viewpoints about a particular conspiracy, nor those who happen to believe conspiracies that we do not.  Instead, we should welcome respectful debate, because this is r/conspiracy, not r/singleviewpointcirclejerk.

       No. But events about the Trump-Mueller-Russia investigation are, by definition part of a conspiracy. Either the Trump-Russia narrative is true and he conspired to win an election, or it is false and there is a conspiracy to take him down. Either way, there's a conspiracy.

       Maybe I'm misunderstanding OP's point...I read it as "We need to get rid of all these people downvoting me and disagreeing with me, as they are clearly shills and not
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       conspiracy researchers."  But correct me if I'm wrong (seriously).

       I think you're right. I think this thread could be another of those threads that have been surfacing lately stating things are there that aren't, or that this place is worse than it actually is. But instead of it being direct like the 'jump ship' threads, it's being more subtle.

       True, true...those are indeed the words OP used.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how is OP suggesting that we
       <em>
        identify
       </em>
       those people that something must be done about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah, it is those whose viewpoints "outnumber us in comment voting"--of course, the "us" here can only refer to OP and those who agree with him--and those who may, from time to time, share an opinion espoused in the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, by all means, ban accounts proven to be paid shills, or who have never believed in a conspiracy in their lives (although I don't know how you'd prove that second one).
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, repeat after me:  "Just because people disagree with me doesn't mean that they are shills."

       Basically, what you are saying is if someone's behavior disagrees with your assessment of "the truth" then they are wrong. Maybe you should read your own comments again, real slow, to glean why that view guarantees that you'll never be able to have a productive conversation with anyone ever again.

       , the shills come back and say "you just accuse everyone that disagrees with you of being a shill, REEEE!"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's categorically false. I haven't accused anyone of being a shill on here. I merely point out when people are using known disinformation tactics, because many of the trolls actually aren't paid (JIDF, topminds), but they are intentional disruptors.
      </p>
      <p>
       That has absolutely nothing to do with whether I agree with them or not, it has everything to do with how they are trying to communicate. Or really how they are trying to stifle communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shills do this because every once in awhile they manage to trick someone like you into thinking we are just butt hurt losers that can't handle someone disagreeing with them. It also side tracks the discussion so you can't get clear information about the well-known shilling tactics they use, because it would become readily apparent who is trying to mislead simply by the way they argue.

       The second is a PhD-level mathematical analysis of a theoretical model of social group dynamics, and how it can form consensus. That's not research on forum disruption methods. Tangentially related, I guess, but no more related than, say, research on how much good grammar and punctuation make it more likely for people to respect an argument, or how likely/unlikely people with deep-seated beliefs in demonstrable falsehoods are to change their beliefs when presented with contrary facts. Consensus of social groups is just way too wide of a topic.

       "Everyone who disagrees with you isn't a shill" is an intentional straw man. They are implying that we go around and accuse people of being shills
       <em>
        because they disagree with us
       </em>
       , not
       <em>
        because they act like shills

       . And they do it because they often manage to get people like you confused in the cross fire so that you start spreading their message for them.

       That's why it's so fucking important that we continually discuss the types of psychological warfare and forum disruption being waged here. This is how they have controlled people for thousands of years.

       So discuss it. I'm open to the idea that I've been manipulated by psyops, which is why I'm genuinely curious what your criterion for detecting shilling is.

       If you think I'm a shill, and it's not just because of my political views, then I'm honestly curious as to what it is about me that makes you think that.

       And you couldn't answer, assumed I'm a shill, and wouldn't explain why, leaving me to assume it's because I don't like Trump, which was my initial assertion as to what the general evidence for shill-dom is.
      </p>

       I genuinely don't want to misrepresent people. I hate it when others do that to me so I want to give you the same respect. I am totally open to, as you say, your basis for detecting shills being something other than my current impression. What exactly is it?

       Not only did I not assume that, I referred to shills in the 3rd person, which means I was explicitly

       calling you a shill. So, now you're using the known disinformation tactic of a straw man. Now, go ahead and make another straw man and accuse me of calling you a shill because you got busted using disinformation tactics.

       I legit do not want to project. Like I said, I don't like it when people do that to me, si I want too give others the same respect. I understand that you didn't call me a shill, but I didn't understand what else was implied by looking at my post history and deciding not to respond.

       I have explicitly acknowledged that I may have inaccurate perception of your perspective.

       Most of what I see is political arguments. This sub is not purely politics though I think that you may only be talking about political conspiracy posts. I do not see much of the “brigading” or pointless squabbling in ufo posts. In regards to political conspiracy posts I’m not that upset that “researchers” are derailed. If a couple of comments can derail these people then they aren’t very good researchers anyway and it is all a big partisan circle jerk to begin with. Pretty much everyone is being manipulated on some level and the irony of all these political shenanigans unfolding on r/conspiracy with everyone yelling “shill” at each other is equally pathetic and hilarious. And I’m guilty of bringing my politics here too so I’m not pointing the finger at anyone but I am curious if OP’s post is referring to political conspiracies in particular and which ones he is upset about. Examples would be nice, OP.

       I think he is referring to current events that are being pushed that are not conspiracies, but political discussion. So rather than having a sub filled with conspiracy theories, we are now essentially a sub filled with political discussion. And what comes with political discussion? Division. We aren't divided based on 9/11 truthers and believers, we're divided based on our political beliefs.

       If it were just a couple comments, that wouldn't be a big deal. It's a systematic forum manipulation process throughout the entire subreddit and relevant discussion threads. The voting bots on particular are noticable lately.  Anything against the latest deep state propaganda push  has been shilled very hard.

       Judging by the response you got, I'd say this might actually be a good idea. Looks like one or more of them may indeed be using a bot to handle their multi-account voting.

       Holy fucking shit, this is at +47 with only 59%. This means the shills have probably sent at least 100 vote bot accounts after it, and it's
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       hugely popular. Well, well, above the normal level of voting for the most popular of posts at this time of day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods, this is proof of supermajority support for aggressive action against the use of
       <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">
        shilling tactics
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills will now claim I am calling for censorship of viewpoints, not tactics. They will be downvoted and reported for trolling. Intentional straw man needs to result in a lot more bans.

      <p>
       It's not. It's the total magnitude of upvotes that proves both massive support and massive vote botting to suppress. You simply don't get 200 upvotes in an hour on posts in conspiracy unless they are incredibly popular. Not even the bots can do that.

       That seems a bit harsh, but judging by the lack of reply from "the one who constantly appears to cry shill" I'll guess that they don't like arguing points they can't prove wrong... so I certainly won't be sticking up for a coward, your point stands.

       nope, I just downvote dumb posts like this, and most of your comments whenever I see one, because for the most part you and many other commenters like you refuse to interact with other redditors, and instead just complain to mods about shills.

       Haven't been on reddit in 3 days, logged in to say this, and logged back out? Sure, I believe you. No way you are doing this for the purpose of creating hostility and suspicion in this community to disrupt the discussion and dissuade people from participating.

       I only recall calling someone a shill in r/conspiracy once, and that was when they said "I am a shill" and I merely said that I agreed. If you read carefully, every other time it's merely pointing to evidence of dishonest participating, never outright calling someone a shill.

       Sorry for going off too much I’m just someone who thinks that just be cause the media will attack him at every turn that doesn’t exclude collusion from being true. Of course democrat media pushes the narrative, they don’t like him. But the dude has been a sketchy liar for decades and his behavior has been divisive, compulsive, and made the country appear unstable. The questionable financing, the change in political party, shady real estate deals, statements from jr, etc all point to a potential if not probable connections between trump and Russian oligarchs.

       My issues with him aren’t about pussy grabbing, its about scam schools, potential money laundering, general untrustworthiness. Seychelles was Erik prince, not a letter agency. The Ukraine platform change didnt come from cia. My personal belief is that Russian interference helped trump, and he knew about it, but it wasn’t for benevolent purposes for trump. I think they knew it would piss off lots of people, they get to have an American president with very few ideas of his own mostly built on nationalism and isolationism, to weaken US influence on a global scale in preparation for the launch of the gold backed petro yuan.  It’s naive, in my opinion, to think the only bad players involved in this mud. There are just too many players with dirty connections that trump put there. When the Nunes memo gained a lot of hype, I thought it was going to be a real bombshell—not because of the hype, but because at that point I was convinced that the game was about the obama admin finding out trump did illegal shit via five eyes or some other illegal surveillance, and both sides were now racing to figure out how to prove one side committed crimes without revealing their own. I’m still not entirely convinced this isn’t what happened.

        One of the keys may be found by looking back at Zbigniew Brzezinski’s 1997 book, The Grand Chessboard in which he wrote, “Ukraine, a new and important space on the Eurasian chessboard, is a geopolitical pivot because its very existence as an independent country helps to transform Russia. Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire.”

        While many people came to the Maidan waving EU flags and were full of hope for a better life, the paramilitary groups, who repeatedly escalated the violence and sabotaged every interim agreement to resolve the standoff, marched under the red and black flag of the 
Organization  of  Ukrainian  Nationalists  (OUN),  the 
mid-20th-century fascist movement of Stepan Bandera. The OUN had collaborated with the Nazis during World War II and carried out the ethnic-cleansing mass murder of Poles and Jews on its own, as well. These neo-Nazi groups called themselves Right Sector; their formation and build-up during 1991-2013 stemmed directly out of

        White supremacist banners and Confederate flags were draped inside Kiev’s occupied City Hall, and demonstrators have hoisted Nazi SS and white power symbols over a toppled memorial to V.I. Lenin. After Yanukovich fled his palatial estate by helicopter, EuroMaidan protesters destroyed a memorial to Ukrainians who died battling German occupation during World War II. Sieg heil salutes and the Nazi Wolfsangel symbol have become an increasingly common site in Maidan Square, and neo-Nazi forces have established “autonomous zones” in and around Kiev.
       </p>
       <p>
        An Anarchist group called AntiFascist Union Ukraine attempted to join the Euromaidan demonstrations but found it difficult to avoid threats of violence and imprecations from the gangs of neo-Nazis roving the square. “They called the Anarchists things like Jews, blacks, Communists,” one of its members said. “There weren’t even any Communists, that was just an insult.”...
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the “Big Three” political parties behind the protests is the ultra-nationalist Svoboda, whose leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, has called for the liberation of his country from the “Muscovite-Jewish mafia.” After the 2010 conviction of the Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk for his supporting role in the death of nearly 30,000 people at the Sobibor camp, Tyahnybok rushed to Germany to declare him a hero who was “fighting for truth.” In the Ukrainian parliament, where Svoboda holds an unprecedented 37 seats, Tyahnybok’s deputy Yuriy Mykhalchyshyn is fond of quoting Joseph Goebbels – he has even founded a think tank originally called “the Joseph Goebbels Political Research Center.” According to Per Anders Rudling, a leading academic expert on European neo-fascism, the self-described “socialist nationalist” Mykhalchyshyn is the main link between Svoboda’s official wing and neo-Nazi militias like Right Sector.

        Can a democrat actually hold democratic views without being a shill?

      <p>
       Please god tell me what the fuck a "democratic view" is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are literally describing your political views with adjectives derived from political party affiliation, yes, you are absolutely an outsider to this community. Yes, absolutely a shill, for either party. By definition.

       Because people either find it amusing or interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you a personal anecdote: my dad has been neck deep in YouTube conspiracy videos for the past 3 years. It is hard to have a conversation with him anymore without him flying off the handle and accusing me of being brain washed or ignoring clear facts (like the devil creating Facebook or the moon being in the wrong spot in the sky).
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming here kind of helps me understand his viewpoint a little more (not much more), tempers me to what kind of arguments he might make, and in all honesty I find a lot of the overly dramatic theorising here amusing. It's cathartic in a way, because I get to laugh at dumb stuff here instead of in my dad's face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it's a free and open forum and we all have reddit accounts, not r/conspiracy accounts. People who don't believe in your stuff are going to get involved sometimes.

       And he's spent every day for the past 3 years researching this shit. He has an answer for literally everything or he walks away. I don't have 8 hours a day to catch up to all his bullshit and debunk it, I have bills to pay.

       Essentially youd need to make him realize it in such a way that it is

       Unfortunately, many people keep their ego and their ideas in the same spot, so it's hard (if not impossible) to target one without hitting the other. Many conspiracy theorists like to pretend cognitive dissonance only exists on the MSM-side of the spectrum, but we fall victim to it ourselves just as often.

       You can be interested in conspiracies without believing in them. Doesn't excuse shutting down discussion though. But I do think having skeptics is a good thing, rather than believing anything we're fed.

       i agree. logical discussion supporting/refuting either side of a theory is what keeps this sub from becoming an echo-chamber.

       i enjoy the debates. as long as they're rational and logical.

       Same here. I don't subscribe to most conspiracies on this subreddit, but I enjoy discussing them. Not sure why a sub
       <em>
        about
       </em>
       conspiracies necessarily has to be
       <em>

       conspiracies.

      <p>
       "Open discussion" includes dissenting views and debunking, and if the content is low-quality, partisan, and divorced from easily discernible facts, then you're going to get a lot of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want CLOSED discussion of all conspiracies, make the subreddit private, I guess. It wouldn't be surprising to me if the leadership here eventually decided that reasonable dissent is too much for them to handle.

       Conspiracy theories and wild conjecture are two different things.  I like conspiracies with at least a little bit of evidence, otherwise you might as well just be making things up.

       These users need to be banned. I think that shill list should be made public so we can add to it. I've never seen so many MSM theories being sold as truth here, it's disgusting, they have their own subs for that shit, r news, td and politics. If we go into their subs and contradict whatever they're selling, they'll ban you instantly. We should be doing the same thing here.

       Nope. As long as you don't break the rules, they'll just laugh at you and downvote. It's telling that you have to make up bad behavior by your enemies so that you can justify acting badly yourself.

       Honestly, if I were a shill or part of a shill organization, the first thing I would do is have a bunch of accounts constantly accuse everybody else of being a shill. That's the most suspicious trend of all in my opinion.

       Of course shills can accuse others of being shills, but isn't it more likely that they joke about it and deny their existence? Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are saying actually sounds like what the govt/establishment/deep state w/e would want us to think. So that we never take people seriously when they call out suspected shills.

       I don't think so. It's possible but If a shill is going to play the
       <em>
        You're a puppet
       </em>
       game, they'll likely do so when someone hits too close to home. That's a defensive technique. I don't think they would deflect by making up a story of different tactics to confuse you. That's such a complicated and unnecessary response.

       I don’t think people realize how low-effort and hands off it really is.  The type of sub is already full of different views and arguments and cynicism.  If someone wanted to actually drive that dissent (honestly I think the only shills are marketers for the Xfiles and other media crap) all they have to do is pop up for a day or two, post conflicting views with two accounts and call a bunch of people shills.  Maybe even post and delete a few posts.  From then on, what? Once a month come by and stir the pot a bit with a political post or a flat earth one?

       They do this. They also name themselves things like u/paidshill123 while spamming their bullshit in order to get other people to call them shill, achieving a similar goal. I think it's clear that they want us to know that they're fucking with us.

       I really wouldn't be suprised if there were shills with shill or ctr etc in their username. People then probably wouldn't think they're actually shills. Would you?

       There's new accounts and sock accounts and old bought accounts and shills with usernames where it's two words. Both first letter uppercase. As if the names were generated.

       What I mean to say is, shills come in all shapes and sizes. Some even get paid to troll.

       IMO, it actually makes discussion easier.  Instead of one side of the argument being presented via upvotes, all sides of the argument have an equal chance at getting a seat at "the discussion table".
      </p>
      <p>
       It does make it harder to circle-jerk.  It does make it harder to isolate dissenting opinions.  It does make it harder for "unscrupulous" bots/raiders to steer the conversation.

       How does it make it eaiser in a comment thred with say 500 comments? Is it really easier to scroll for 10 minutes hoping to find the comment chain you're looking for that's now somewhere entirely different?

       If you commented on it, yeah. But if you're just looking to read responses or follow other discussions you're not invovled in, it's impossible. It's impossible by design, that's the point of contest mode.

       It is easy to do both in contest mode.  You literally just read through a comment chain.  The comment chains themselves are randomized.  Which brings up my first point about every comment having its chance at the "discussion table".  The only thing that might be "impossible by design" is steering the conversation in an inorganic way.

       Just like how people from r/TopMindsOfReddit say they like to debate, but really they are just laughing at you, and (most likely) nothing you say will get them to admit they are wrong and you are right. Even if you make a good argument backed up by evidenced.

        /r/Wikileaks

       during the election and I was able the handle this very well. Sadly a corporate mod ran me out, but I kept up the discussion for quite a while. These were the steps I took.

       <strong>
        Internal Modding Politics

       <li>
        Refuse all private communication with other mods, beyond perfunctory admin
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Instead, FORCE any mod wanting to make a change, or proposition, to make it public, in a "Meta" discussion thread, same as a user. Same for inviting new mods, and similar type of discussion. - A corporate mod will encourage exclusive use of back alley channels, making their strange behavior less observable to the community at large. Without the community knowing each of their strange proposals, they are too easily able to sway the community on to their 'team' - whatever that means. Their modding needs to be public, and all ideas discussed publicly - No backroom channels.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Reduce the rules to simplistic concepts, focusing on civility and staying on topic
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ideally, the only two rules necessary are "Do not be mean to others" and "Don't 'spam' off-topic shit". You should ALLOW "Meta" threads and so forth, their hearts content. Is Conspiracy to "Trumpian"? Sure, make a thread for that discussion. However, asking that within a thread discussing those little green frogs Hillary coughed up would be unacceptable - Within a thread, all comments must be 'on topic', and Threads CAN be off topic, or meta topics.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Forcing everything to the public cleans up mod politic corruption. I would ban fairly quickly, and most often publicly. My rule was 2 day instant ban for any 'uncivil' behavior, or generalized spam. Automatically forgiven if they asked to be forgiven somewhat nicely. Obnoxious people stayed banned. Repeat offenders, or people without a history of any positive comments would get a 30 day ban instantly. If your only contribution is rudeness, you get long bans, instantly.

        For example, I might suggest

        </strong>
        the use of "bomb" to mean "big news" and "explosive" to mean "important event" within Conspiracy. Such words need to be only used when the topic is an actual bomb, explosive, or killing, or what have you, and not be allowed as thread titles, purely as superlatives. Most other issues you can simply deal with by flaring the thread appropriately vs removals.

       <p>
        I did a test linking to a Washington Post article a subreddit with no traffic. It got 10 upvotes in a day, with the next highest thing in 2 weeks getting 4 upvotes. They simply spam crawlers to upvote their shit about once per hour. Can't be stopped, should be permanently banned. Best to link to only sourced material, or individual journalist run organizations. The other issue with Mainstream Media is that the article title are often opposite of the content, or an article may get written with 20 popup ads for the 'opposite' side flooding your experience. Effectively baiting supporters of X candidate to click, while spamming them with ads for the opposition. With individual journalists run sites, this is hard to achieve as they must constantly switch side themselves, lessen credibility.

        Regarding Spam comment attacks, switch the sub to default sort by new

      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Default sorting by new usually does not bother users too badly, but completely destroys the power up 'up vote' bots, and brigading. It's much easier to upvote 10 or so comments to top positions within large threads, than it is to post 100 separate comments. Sorting by "New" effectively makes the majority of Users become what is seen, and upvote matter less - I would turn this feature on and off, as appropriate, but the threads were generally much better with it on. After 6 hours, or the top threads of the day, might get individually switched to "Best", if I felt the "best" represented the character of the Sub. If "best" was "Conspiracy sucks balls", I would leave it as new.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Stickied Topics almost always represented Important Threads, or Educational Threads
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I would OFTEN sticky thread teaching history. Especially from alternative points of view. For example, I had a lot of Malcolm X speeches (and other Civil Rights leader) as stickies on MLK Day. For JFK assassination, I featured famous speeches of him and his brother. At other times, I had "untold history by Stone" and "Citizen 4", and so on. I also had the Guerrilla Manifesto, and other type of educational material as the sticky. In addition, I wouldn't hesitate to promote a good contributing user, or sticky a thread which contained interesting content, even though it got few votes. Doing an approach like this lead to a higher educated user base, meaning that more educated topics were better received long-term.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       With policies like that, you can get a cleanly run, highly functional sub, with happy users. It's more difficult that 'do nothing at all', but it's absolutely not impossible, and far easier than that backroom dealing that most subs linger in.

       The thing is, we're in the midst of one of the biggest conspiracies since Watergate and it's being covered by the MSM. Does that automatically make it invalid? If this subreddit were around in the 1970s would we be sticking our fingers in our ears and shooting FAKE NEWS at the Washington Post and the New York Times for the Pentagon Papers? Watergate?

       The difference was that there was actual evidence in those cases (i.e. the Pentagon Papers themselves). There is no hard evidence tying the Trump campaign to Russia. If there were, Mueller would have indicted Trump by now.

       I’m a liberal hippy lurker and this has always been my issue of late. r/conspiracy has aways doubted the govt. from Roswell to 911 to Ok City bombing but now they believe the govt 100%. This is a tinfoil hat conspiracy that’s starting to come true. I always thought this would be a wet dream for r/conspiracy, like if there was proof and the msm starts reporting on Rowell having aliens but it’s the opposite. My favorite conspiracy bros are believing the govt. what the fuck happened?

If only we had a fella with a funny Greek name being approached from with emails from folks describing themselves as Russian agents. If only we had this Greek man being encouraged by campaign officials to persue this line. If only we had evidence at the same time as the above meeting of Trump publicly envouraging 'somebody' to release emails. If only his campaign manager had never managed a campaign before and was in debt to pro-Russian Ukrianian oligarch....

       The emails you are describing are not hard evidence. Hard evidence would be proof that the lawyer they were meeting with was actually a "Kremlin agent" and that the alleged "stolen information" actually changed hands. We have neither.

      <p>
       And the idea that Mueller would hold back an indictment for vague seasonal reasons is nonsensical.

       You still haven't cited any evidence. Neither have the other commenters on this thread, because there is no hard evidence proving collusion between Trump and the Russian government. A few vague emails do not a conspiracy make. If I'm wrong, show me the evidence instead of insulting me. You can't, because there isn't any.

       You're defending due process? No one is attacking his due process, dude. But I'm not a court of law and I'm allowed to make my own conclusions and when I see an email from a Kremlin agent asking Donald Trump Jr. if he wants to collude with them and he responds "Yeah, I'd love to collude!," I'm free to come to the conclusion that Trump colluded with Russia.

       You clearly attacked due process when you derided me for wanting "stronger evidence" before "jump[ing] to any conclusions".
      </p>
      <p>
       You clearly have very little knowledge of the law. A crime requires both a mental state (mens rea) and a criminal action. Someone writing an email is not a criminal action. Thus, no crime was committed by simply sending an email to set up a meeting. If Mueller could prove to a grand jury that a crime was committed, Trump would be indicted by now. You are simply grasping at straws here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process is the idea that the state must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person, including the right that they are innocent until proven guilty based on objective evidence. It is the foundation of our legal system. If you don't like it, maybe you should move to... Russia! : )

       Mueller hasn't indicted Trump because he cannot. Neither he nor the DoJ have the power to.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of his investigation, Mueller will present the evidence to congress, and they will use that evidence to decide whether or not to impeach Trump. Mueller needs to make the strongest case possible, so he's being patient and gathering as much evidence as he can. It would also benefit him to wait until after the 2018 elections, as many in congress are allergic to holding Trump accountable for anything.

       Right, he cannot indict because he doesn't have any evidence. You clearly have no idea how this process works. Mueller would take his evidence to a grand jury first, which would have the power to indict Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       A prominent New York judge once stated that a decent prosecutor could get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich. What does that say about Mueller's investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you seriously think that Mueller would hold back an indictment, thereby allowing a criminal who conspired with a foreign government to remain President if he had hard evidence to indict? You seriously seem delusional. I hope you find the help you so clearly need.

       If you don't believe me, perhaps you will believe the Washington Post: "For decades, scholars have debated the question of whether the Constitution allows a sitting president to be indicted and tried while in office — and whether it would be prudent to do so. Two decades ago, independent counsel Kenneth Starr confronted these questions while investigating President Bill Clinton and answered yes to the first, but no to the second."

       I suggest actually reading the article you posted instead of stopping at the first quote you agree with. It states that the current standing supreme court decision is that a sitting president is immune from indictment. Ken Starr is not a constitutional scholar nor a supreme court justice, so his opinion on the matter means precisely jack shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thank you for supporting my assertion that Mueller doesn't have the power to indict Trump. As I stated before, only congress has the power to hold him accountable for any wrongdoing.

       I did read the article. And it clearly states that there is a precedent for indictment, but indicting may not be politically expedient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, it seems like you are arguing that Mueller should wait for the political winds to change before indicting. This course of action would seem to be more politically motivated than motivated for a desire to uncover the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let your dislike of Trump circumvent your critical thinking skills. I don't like him either. But I'm not willing to compromise due process of law to put Mike Pence in the Oval Office. Seems like an even worse scenario to me.

       You didn't read it at all. You read what you wanted to see. Starr didn't indict Bill Clinton. Despite his legal counsel saying he could, he did not because he knew it would lead to a supreme court case that he would likely lose. There is no precedent. You have the answer in front of you so many times, yet you ignore all the bits that don't agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder you don't think there's evidence of collusion.

       Politics is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       by definition a 'conspiracy'... it's in the whole nature of politics. Politicians get together to agree on something and then push that agenda, that's how it works and how it is supposed to work.

       The word conspiracy means "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful". What part of that makes you think "aliens and such"?

       This sub isn't about aliens, it's about human beings who get together and do bad shit. Like how astroturf trolls brigade our community and troll us. They conspire to troll us, they are a conspiracy.

       Better is to focus on the manner in which people disagree with each other, as that can be enforced. A ‘downvote’ is fine. Saying ‘you’re another hillbot shill’ is not, and easy to enforce.

       i just had a flashback to 10-12 years ago when the entire site was like this. people would upvote content/comments they disagreed with
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       it contributed to the discussion. voting was used for more of a visibility method and not used because people got butthurt about something someone wrote, etc.

       all this can be circumvented except for one thing. A user before mentioned limiting self-posts to the weekend or something. I think this is a simple and easy solution that will rid the subreddit of a lot of 'noise' and perhaps banning certain websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since these self-posts started coming out by these last few weeks, people are accusing people of shilling, people are complaining about this subreddit. People are complaining about the mods. It's like, this subreddit isn't for that. And it's keeping users from enjoying the subreddit because they have to defend it against this fear mongering.

       Nothing wrong with self posts IF they are appropriately titled. Interpretive titles should get removed, or flaired appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Conspiracy needs to get back to its roots” followed by suggesting of ‘aliens only 24 / 7’ needs to be retitled “Conspiracy needs aliens only 24 / 7”
      </p>

       The original title is so abstract, it gets upvoted showing agreement but the topic is completely different.

       I think too many self-posts that have nothing to do with actual conspiracies and conspiracy theories have been posted. And there needs to be curtailing of that. These self-posts detract heavily from the idea of looking for things and instead breed paranoia and division within the community. Self-posts are important, but the constant inundation of posts like this one for example, is not good.

       All the mainstream news networks have such an obvious agenda and they are all equally horrible. I’m glad most people can agree on that! From Fox to CNN it’s obvious alternative media is needed now. But then the problem which you present is here, alternative media can be unreliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what’s the solution, besides attempting to hold our media accountable what can we do? Not sure myself honestly I try to be optimistic but the state of affairs is depressing in my opinion.

       I wonder why they still pretend like they don't exist. It's funny. Why don't they pretend on 4chan? Oh shills. lol they expect us to just forget that the word "shill" only entered into the lexicon in 2016.

       Politics conspiracies are great, of course. But what I'm talking about is this whole use of "MSM is fake news" for whatever people don't agree with politically. It's damaging to any objective discussion or debate.

       I'm not sure I understand your logic. We shouldn't discuss a conspiracy about being lied to in a grand scale because...it makes it harder to lie to us on a grand scale? Surely that can't be right.

       By all means, discuss! Usually I don't see any discussion though, only a blanket dismissal of all things "MSM" no matter how true the content may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical thinking is being tossed away, in it's place is a cult chanting "fake news" with zero independent thought.

       MSM, but they obviously get some things right. You've gotta be able to filter out the bias and find the real news. The real sheep are the ones not trusting

       MSM just because it's MSM.

       For example:  “Someone was shot in the mall today” Is the fact. Every news article, every news agency will report that fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox is going to tell you that that person was shot because she was a blonde white person and everybody who is blonde and white needs to be scared. Nancy Grace has more information at 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that’s not what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps CNN wants to paint it as a struggle between rich and poor. Or maybe it’s because she was a Russian exchange bride! But the issue is that all we know is that person was shot in the mall. We need to know which mall in front of what store, the persons name stuff like that.

       Emotion is what sells policy to the masses.  If the people have too much real information they don’t become emotional. If they aren’t emotional you can’t get them angry and send them to war as easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it’s obvious that when they focus on a ridiculous upsetting news story like transgender bathrooms it is because they need people in emotional state to validate whatever they’re going to bring out next.

       I just assumed if they were on Reddit (they likely are) that they'd mainly operate in political subs, but who knows. Maybe they're also in Top Minds, Subreddit Drama, Drama, and World News. Maybe what you're seeing is a mixture of Shareblue shills, trolls who get off to the drama, and people working for the govt trying to spread propaganda and disinformation.

Maybe what you're seeing is a mixture of Shareblue shills, trolls who get off to the drama, and people working for the govt trying to spread propaganda and disinformation.

       From what I can tell the mods are in on it and corrupted.  They don't respond to questions and they have every power to prevent the spammy t_d crap about why Russia isn't meddling or prevent the shareblue/israel brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is simply built into the platform.  Also the law enforcement ties, something is very fishy here in that I get almost 0 human responses to any post and then a handful that are either hasbara or police questioning me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at my history.  Also on my old account u/mindhawk
      </p>
      <p>
       I document some of it, and my similar experiences at steemit on my account there @mindhawk.  Further study will be rewarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use reddit(and twitar) with the knowledge it is a comprimised platform owned by hasbara and shareblue working together, with some ruskie infiltration that is tough for them to deal with because it is on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       So us humans are sort of bouncing around in between the robots.  It is only worth posting if your intent is to jam the entire operation and make their jobs of censorship and disinformation more difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is def odd don't you think there is no competitor even close to reddit?  And the form for reddit is basically good, only what goes on behind the scenes turns the whole of it into a propaganda farce.  Governments could be built around the concept of reddit if bots and shills could be prevented.
      </p>
      <p>
       With blockchain they can be prevented, but all the companies trying to do this like steemit and the israeli one are simply psy-op honeypot like facebork.

      <p>
       If you tried to do an independant one, your third employee would be cia or mossad so this is the type of world we live in now, which should frighten anyone once they see this.

       Who owns Reddit? We keep thinking that these are groups what if these were not groups. What if these coordinated tactics were simply Reddit’s platform and interest. I am starting to believe that Reddit is a platform used by the “elites” or “cabal” “council of 300” to influence and control. Imagine how much info the are gathering. Ideas they can simply use for their own personal gain. I used to think MSM were separate entities with the goal of making profits through ratings. Lol 😂 the idea that Reddit is owned by one individual is just a front man and their is a powerful entity who has a stake in controlling info. CIA? Fbi? Military? Deep state? Big pharma?politicians? All are front men.

       This is actually reasonable thinking. It was likely the shills that downvoted you. The degree of military worship on reddit and lack of criticism of the military budget and invasions isn't even possible for a progressive-leaning website. This, among other things, lends support to your thinking.

         What we do on this sub is share information related to conspiracies then analyze, question and discuss it.
         <br/>
         If it were just us agreeing with each other we'd get bored and leave. We don't need closed-minded people coming here to try to gaslight us, divert our attention and bury valuable comments. We need other open-minded people who already understand that conspiracies not only exist but the world literally operates on them. That is the value of this sub: being share and discuss information with other conspiracy researchers; not have to battle coordinated waves of shills &amp; closed-minded Michael Shermer worshipers.

       You have a very valid point on the first paragraph. And I understand your suspicion of the media. My only argument is that we should be allowed to discuss Russia here without being told we don’t belong. You may not believe it, cool. I don’t believe Benghazi was Hillary’s fault (or at least not 11 hearings worth of her fault), but I don’t think people that do don’t belong here.

       all this can be circumvented except for one thing. A user before mentioned limiting self-posts to the weekend or something. I think this is a simple and easy solution that will rid the subreddit of a lot of 'noise' and perhaps banning certain websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since these self-posts started coming out by these last few weeks, people are accusing people of shilling, people are complaining about this subreddit. People are complaining about the mods. It's like, this subreddit isn't for that. And it's keeping users from enjoying the subreddit because they have to defend it against this fear mongering.

       I think too many self-posts that have nothing to do with actual conspiracies and conspiracy theories have been posted. And there needs to be curtailing of that. These self-posts detract heavily from the idea of looking for things and instead breed paranoia and division within the community. Self-posts are important, but the constant inundation of posts like this one for example, is not good.

       Sorry for going off too much I’m just someone who thinks that just be cause the media will attack him at every turn that doesn’t exclude collusion from being true. Of course democrat media pushes the narrative, they don’t like him. But the dude has been a sketchy liar for decades and his behavior has been divisive, compulsive, and made the country appear unstable. The questionable financing, the change in political party, shady real estate deals, statements from jr, etc all point to a potential if not probable connections between trump and Russian oligarchs. Even without the potential coordinated email release, there is
       <em>
        plenty
       </em>
       of cause to dig into this guy. For that reason alone this sub
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be doubtful of him. Trust no one. Only the truth matters regardless of where it comes from. Be open minded.

       The word conspiracy means "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful". What part of that makes you think "aliens and such"?

       Unfortunately, many people keep their ego and their ideas in the same spot, so it's hard (if not impossible) to target one without hitting the other. Many conspiracy theorists like to pretend cognitive dissonance only exists on the MSM-side of the spectrum, but we fall victim to it ourselves just as often.

       ok. what would you do. there has been a war going on in this sub for years now. a war for your mind. control. this sub is a huge thorn in the side of MSM &amp; people in power. OP expects that to change? it won't until one side or the other concedes. or the internet is shut down.

       I think Trump is smarter than you think. I mean, he is the president of the United States. You are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump won because people were tired of the same old establishment-career politicians pushing the same lies. It’s pretty easy for anyone who took the time to research Clinton’s political career to tell that she is basically a Republican pretending to be a Democrat. Pretty much everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie. She is not “progressive” even in the slightest degree. She also said “It’s my turn to be president”. I can’t respect anyone who would vote for a candidate that said that...

       Refuse? When? For fuck's sake. Muh red herrings. I despise Rump and recognize that it's a polarizing phenomenon. Partisan politics is a surface story for the fascism we have always had.

       For example:  “Someone was shot in the mall today” Is the fact. Every news article, every news agency will report that fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox is going to tell you that that person was shot because she was a blonde white person and everybody who is blonde and white needs to be scared. Nancy Grace has more information at 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that’s not what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps CNN wants to paint it as a struggle between rich and poor. Or maybe it’s because she was a Russian exchange bride! But the issue is that all we know is that person was shot in the mall. We need to know which mall in front of what store, the persons name stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emotion is what sells policy to the masses.  If the people have too much real information they don’t become emotional. If they aren’t emotional you can’t get them angry and send them to war as easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it’s obvious that when they focus on a ridiculous upsetting news story like transgender bathrooms it is because they need people in emotional state to validate whatever they’re going to bring out next.

       wait what's an example of unriggable voting? you didn't fix it, you're playing along, the original democracy was random based, not vote based, wealthy landowners replaced it with voting, because they were smarter than you :)
