       "When a controversial cult leader builds a utopian city in the Oregon desert, conflict with the locals escalates into a national scandal, leading to the first bioterror attack in U.S. history and a massive case of illegal wiretapping."
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a fantastic series that I can't recommend highly enough. There are many aspects of the story that I think are relevant for discussion here, including (possible spoilers):
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The coordinated effort across multiple branches and levels of U.S. government to shut down this group
       </li>
       <li>
        The way in which power and money corrupted the leaders of the group itself, despite its utopian visions
       </li>
       <li>
        The response from the architects and adherents of establishment spiritual/cultural/economic narratives and norms being challenged by the group
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Finally, are we likely to see communitarian movements of this type again in the near future? Are efforts of this type meaningful experiments in alternative systems, or merely yuppie cults? What can we learn from this saga?

       I watched it. I was dating an Indian girl a few years back who showed me a video of this guy. She was making fun of his hypocrisy and catering to western desires to take advantage of the “aura” people usually have around these so-called “holy men”, for money. I honestly can’t understand how people fall for guys like these. Jim Jones, that gay porn Mexican actor guy that used to rape all his pretty boy followers, and such. Power corrupts, and some of these guys might actually start with honest intentions, but the more power and control the have over their followers, the worse it gets.

       Thanks for the feedback. However, I did search this sub for "Netflix" and this is the first series recommendation posted on here since the release of "Dirty Money" next month.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that "Wild Wild Country" and "Dirty Money" are both highly relevant to the types of discussions happening here. Further, reviewing content from mainstream sources like Netflix helps our work here remain in conversation with and responsive to mainstream cultural narratives.

       Ok I thought this was just another cult, but I have seen nothing so far that makes these people any different than a religion.  Sure they meditate, and seem different, but to me most religions are different when you break them down.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sheela was extradited to the US on charges of immigration fraud and
       <em>
        attempted murder.
       </em>
       She ultimately pleaded guilty to first-degree assault, second-degree assault, and conspiracy/assault. She also pleaded guilty to setting fire to a county office and wire-tapping at the commune.

       Certainly there are strong accusations of
       <em>
        attempted
       </em>
       murder, and apparently sufficient evidence to extradite on those grounds. But your statement, as phrased, remains untrue. Again not trying to be salty, just accurate and precise.

       I loved it - seeing the true believers talk was so bizarre. I wish it would have showed more of Bhagwan speaking, without hearing some of his persuasiveness its hard to understand why these people are so devoted to him. There's a lot of interesting topics within the documentary and it's interesting that a group that's lead by an effective dictator could move to a small town, take over, and pretty much become king - and i'm not sure if there's anything legally wrong with that. Like if Bhagwan would have just played it slower or differently, he'd probably still be in Oregon with his 50,000 person city.
      </p>
      <p>
       The quote that I keep coming back to from the series is near the end, from a true believer that eventually got away from it,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Bhagwan used to tell stories of the Zen master who, seeing that is disciple was ready for enlightenment, struck him with a stick and killed him. But in the moment before his death, he became enlightened. And I ask myself again and again, "Did I miss the blow from the master, did I run away, and not wait for that blow that would bring me enlightenment. It took me many, many years before I was free of this suspicion... I was freed of this suspicion, that I have somehow failed. As I'm saying this, I have the picture of a grub in a cocoon. If you've ever watched a butterfly come out of this cocoon, it's a long difficult process, squeezing and moving and the cocoon is clinging to the moth's body, until it manages that last wriggle, that push and it's out.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Yes, that was a key question I kept returning to – could this have played out any differently? Or was it inevitable that one way or another, for one reason or another, The Man would shut that show down?

       Haha yeah that's the question I guess - was there any nefarious government intervention in this. I haven't heard much about the immigration fraud case that they indicted him over, but it makes sense that they'd want to throw the book at him if he was using his followers to marry non-citizens to grow his city, which they knew was coming very close to overcoming the county. They supposedly feared they were going to lose the entire state to this cult because of how many followers he had.

       Right, but they only uncovered the immigration stuff when they started investigating on other grounds, arguably after they had already placed the group in the crosshairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And certainly the fear of "losing" the state is understandable, but isn't that the nature of democracy and demographics? I really like the point that one of the gentlemen made about Utah being almost entirely for the Mormons. Who's to say the Rajneeshee didn't have that same right?

       Yeah, that's a good question. I think a fundamental difference is that Rajneeshee's God was still alive. This fact put the whole separation of church and state at a very stark crossroads. It was clear from the documentary that Rajneeshee's didn't really participate in elections or democracy - it was always Bhagwhan at the top or his speaker acting as dictator. Sure, the Mormons may have been able to do this in Utah back in the 1800's, but that was at a time when the federal government had much less invested and power over those western territories (was Utah even a state before the Mormons were there?). We're not talking about a cult (and I think it's fair to say its a cult because their God is still alive) taking over an unincorporated territory out in the frontier - we're talking about a cult taking over a well-developed State that has been part of the Union for over 100 years.

       They got super unlucky that there land was next door to Bill Bowerman, He really is a folk hero in the state of Oregon..almost a God at the University of Oregon... Donald Sutherland Played Him IN a Movie!!(WithoutLimits). Take the time to do a map search of the ranch, Big Muddy Airport.. pretty amazing how they transformed the mountain desert ranch land  into lush farmland that is still the only thing green in that area today.

       I found it compelling if you can get through the first episode (a lot of background but enough hints of where it’s going to stick around).
      </p>
      <p>
       It raises a lot of constitutional questions about what’s right and wrong and how far a group can have individual will subverted for a ‘greater cause.’
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree they played the short game too strongly rather than going for the long game. The immigration stuff was basically the same as getting Al Capone for tax evasion ... it served an end purpose. But none of that happens if the cult hadn’t determined to take over all they could survey and to do so more quickly than was probably necessary ... which led to plots that resulted in assassination attempts and plots (including flying an airplane as a suicide bomb into a county courthouse) and even the largest bioterror attack in U.S. (maybe world?) history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheela was a piece of work and it goes to show that a lot of nefarious actions come back to basic human insecurity — she saw herself losing control and falling out of favor with the living god and lashed out to try to hold onto her power and position.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, I know it was a different time but I was amazed that they could just build an airport and begin operating without the federal government (using the FAA) stepping in ... seems like that was easy leverage if the feds had wanted to shut things down or give them trouble but no mention of it, and it remained operational to the end.

       Why do all the utopian communities have to turn out so weird? Their idea of the commune looked like something great and fun to be a part of but it’s always gets culty. I just want to live in the middle of nowhere with cool chill people and not have to wear 1 of 3 colors everyday. Pretty cool series though, my girlfriend grew up in Oregon and said her Dad would joke that he’s going to send them to live with the rahjneesh if they don’t behave.
