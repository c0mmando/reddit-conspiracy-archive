<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been ruined, its filled with garbage and political trash that filled <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and other subs.  You can&#39;t have a discussion here anymore, I shouldn&#39;t have to filter by new, I shouldn&#39;t have to ignore the trash comments and getting down voted because the other person disagrees.  This place is divided and it&#39;s obviously spewing into this sub.  This place will turn into Digg, it will be filled with political charge and it will eat itself alive till there is an echo-chamber at which point they will move on and repeat the process.  It&#39;s time to go.</p>

<p>After the privacy and security risks, the drama, the sub banning, youtube and soon likely twitter and others, I&#39;m done.  It&#39;s time to look after my privacy and security and support platforms that are built with privacy and security in mind, it&#39;s time to leave this crap behind.</p>

<p>I made this to give it visibility so others can see people are leaving and this is why I&#39;m leaving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So essentially what you&#39;re saying is that you&#39;re fine with political conspiracies here, as long as it&#39;s politics that you agree with.</p>

<p>When I got into conspiracies during the Bush admin, they were more of a leftist thing. That&#39;s the environment I came up in. The establishment was right wing, the shadow government (&quot;deep state&quot; now that Cambridge Analytica focus grouped that term for us to use) etc was right wing. </p>

<p>Now that the right wing are the ones more into conspiracies there&#39;s going to be clashes. Dismissing someone&#39;s conspiracies because of their politics is bad form for a conspiracist. I&#39;m a leftist who believes some conspiracies, and doesn&#39;t believe a lot of conspiracies. I don&#39;t see why I shouldn&#39;t be allowed to express my views in a conspiracy sub as much as anyone else is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you have been around a while?  Gen x?  Were you always way left?</p>

<p>Because if we are a similar age, and I think we are, then we have seen politics shift dramatically.  So much so that people either get pushed right, or they compromise their beliefs to be in line with the current party lines.  So if you were on the left back then and still are today, then I suspect that you started out pretty far left?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite Gen X, I&#39;m 35 so I think they technically call that Millennial, though there&#39;s that term &quot;Xillennial&quot; for the in-betweeners born between 77-82. </p>

<p>When I was younger I was just a mainstream Democrat. Moderate politically, though I was civil rights train well before the mainstream Democrat party.</p>

<p>As years have gone on, I&#39;ve completely abandoned the Democrats and have migrated much farther left than they are. So I&#39;m the opposite of the premise in your post. Honestly, so are most of the adults of my generation that I know. Will begrudgingly support the Democrats when absolutely necessary (like, say, in opposition of Roy Moore for example) but would prefer someone with true leftist policies, not corporate/establishment policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understood.  I started out distrustful of government and corporations and those in power.  That has not changed.  But I used to lean left but now some my beliefs are not really welcome there anymore.  These days, I would say that I have moved away from neoliberals and populists.  My line of thinking has left me in a tough spot.  I am 43 and it has been my experience that many people of generation have been, for lack of a better word, left behind.  Either way, I wish I knew where I fit in.  It bothers me.  Then on top of that, I am losing hope that anything will change in my life time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some views that aren&#39;t popular on the left, also, like being very pro-gun. But I&#39;ve always found them to be very accepted among my leftist peers. Now, they&#39;re not at all accepted with mainstream Democrats. Mainstream Democrats are vicious if you disagree.</p>

<p>My views essentially boil down to, if we&#39;re going to have a government, it needs to exist with the sole purpose of being a sort of joint agreement among the people in our country of mutual protection. Military protection (not intervention), but also civil rights protection, and protection from predators like unethical capitalists seeking to exploit people. I believe in complete and utter freedom of the individual, and I believe that is best achieved by abolishing the establishment and institutions designs to keep control away from the working people and with the rich and elites.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect these things to happen. When you have any political views outside of the mainstream, you&#39;re basically building a worldview on a pipe dream, and I&#39;m fine with that. So I do engage in the political process by engaging in the &#39;lesser of two evils&#39; in hopes of some sort of incremental change, because that&#39;s all I really have. It&#39;s that or don&#39;t participate. So I share your feeling about being left behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>C Wright Mills told us all over half a century ago: the power elite come from politics, the corporate sector, and military/intelligence community.  Over time they have increasingly merged together and individuals move fluidly between them.  Regulatory bodies become an extension of the industry they are designed to regulate.  There need not be an official conspiracy since powerful people&#39;s interests usually align.  It is the system itself that we should examine, individual personalities are simply the symptoms of a diseased political, economic, and military system. </p>

You had to fill out a simple forum, like a personality test, &quot;Explain what is wrong:  What are you requesting:&quot;  and a Doctor would sign off in Argentin; and I promise right hand to God my the doctors names who the RX bottles had a all white computer printed label slaped on, they all had German names... one name was Dr. Corleone and I wonder if anyone believes me.  I don&#39;t know much about Argentina politics, back channels, or drug laws... just, I found that &quot;email address&quot; and I&#39;d western union the money, and it&#39;d show up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Argentinian here - that sounds sketchy af lol, but sadly it&#39;s not at all impossible considering my country&#39;s.... Light disregard of laws, at times. After 2001 there was a BIG crisis here tho (unrelated to 9/11) so probably shipping or manufacturing just got too expensive/the factories closed/etc.     </p>

<p>Also, I wouldn&#39;t know about the German labels, and I know we&#39;re in a conspiracy sub, but the whole Hitler theory is just too beaten down and old here. It&#39;s true many Germans (many of them Nazis surely) came here but besides some old random general dying incognito in a farm somewhere, nothing really interesting has ever been discovered.</p>

I think it sends back a msg saying Mailbox full)  and the names were all German/Italian sounding - mostly German but I could order COD but it cost more or WU save money... and I wish I could explain it better.  Can you, in Argentina, walk into a Pharmacy and get Valium or Pain Pills?  Is it easy?  Because I laughed and then got scared at &quot;Dr. Corleone&quot;  and like I said it was English written on a sticky type paper that was obviously printed and it just a simple &quot;Take 2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain.&quot; and then hand signed... Have you ever seen something like that?  What do you RX bottles look like?</p>

<p>I sent the money to Palermo, mostly.  Sometimes buenos aires.  </p>

<p>What happened in your version of 2001?  Were things easier?</p>

<p>Just... I found it amazing.  Plus, they were &quot;American&quot;  pills.  You know?  If I order from India or Pakistan (or when I did) it would be &quot;their&quot; version of the pills...India makes all their pills white.  Pakistan is notorious for one pill being super strong and the next not so much...</p>

<p>Yet apparently I read an article that USA&#39;s health care is so bad, it&#39;s cheaper the consumer to purchase medication in a foreign country - even though the medicine is made in Ohio, (Israel is catching up on med market) - so from America, Ohio - to Miami, to Argentina - then back to Miami, and then shipped to your house in Michigan - it&#39;s cheaper.  </p>

<p>Makes no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Few things ever seem to make sense up there, don&#39;t you think? :P    </p>

<p>As for the rest of the comment, you&#39;ll be disappointed since you clearly know more about this topic than I do... I&#39;ve luckily never had to buy medications like that, so I can&#39;t really comment on the state of Argentina&#39;s black med market - though what you speak of is hardly rare or surprising.      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Per Google: The fifth category of German immigration to Argentina occurred between 1946 and 1950      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, we received some Germans (very few considering our country has 40Mill people), I was saying that most of those were mostly irrelevant citizens/low ranks of the army, nobody really interesting. Any German links were surely destroyed on immigration and the topic has never really received general attention since well, there&#39;s no Nazis around here, luckily. But the old &quot;Hitler escaped to Bariloche&quot; theory really does get old after a while, especially if you&#39;re coming from a country that seldom gets worldwide attention; you usually don&#39;t want to be known for stuff like this lol.      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet apparently I read an article that USA&#39;s health care is so bad     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is  100% believable. I&#39;ve heard dozens of &quot;horror tales&quot; on US healthcare. Here, most medical treatments are free and government-covered even if you don&#39;t have an insurance (even if you come from other countries...), so it&#39;s really wild to think there&#39;s people who have to save up for literal years to get that one surgery or treatment done to them, or people who even die before they can get treated.</p>

<p>I have a hard time subscribing to that though.  </p>

<p>One side wants to make affordable healthcare.  The other wants to take debt to give to billionaires around the globe.  One side wants to keep black sites open and not under US law, the other wants to close it down and give the people rights.  One side wants to stop global warming, the other thinks profit is more important.  One wants to protect the environment and grow national parks, the other wants to sell them to corporations.  </p>

<p>It seems much more plausible to me that there are people trying to push the narrative that &quot;both sides are the same&quot;, so that it&#39;s easier to not vote, or vote against your interests.  Democracy is a powerful tool, and that&#39;s how you lose your power and give it away.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been involved much in the conspiracy community for the last three or four years until a few months ago, so maybe things have changed, but the general impression I got was that the Democrats were used to push things like dependence on government, high taxation, gun control, etc. While the Republicans were used to push military spending, foreign aggression, general authoritarian dickishness, etc. And thus while voters would get emotionally riled up about right vs left, the elite would win no matter which party was in control.</p>

<ul>
<li>Gitmo was reduced in size during Obama&#39;s presidency.  That is action and accomplishment.  They tried to close it but republicans stonewalled.</li>
<li>The Trump tax cut passed giving trillions of the middle and lower classes dollars away to billionaires.  That is actual action and accomplishment.</li>
<li>Green energy targets have been passed by Democrats across the country.  Obama negotiated the Paris agreement.  That is actual action and accomplishment.  Republicans pulled out of paris and have been suing to stop the changes.<br/></li>
<li>Obama increased several national parks, monuments and wilderness areas.  That is actual action and accomplishment.  Republicans reduced bears ears, opened more land to fracking and are increasing the fees to access national parks.</li>

<p><strong>Please give actual evidence of lack of action</strong> as the points I raised have clear accomplishments.  This whole defeatist attitude of &quot;they are both evil and working together to ruin your life&quot; is exactly what they want.  You are helping average citizens lose power.</p>

<p>I think the problem is, it is tiresome.  Politics, politics, politics.  Probably on purpose also that it is always politics we hear about.  Comedy shows, media, reddit just simply ran it into the ground with the US election.  And still continue to do so.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fight constantly.  It&#39;s a new thing daily.  Just elect a cat to be a dictator so we can focus a bit more.</p>

<p>But you are correct politics is definitely where you can find a lot of conspiracies.  Just kind of hard to keep up constantly.  And also find the conspiracies.  And form a good argument with people.  You&#39;d have to be here constantly fighting and learning.  Like 50 hours a day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is tiresome, it’s supposed to be, it’s supposed to be driven down our throats until we want to be oblivious to all the wrong that goes on in politics. We’re the troops on the ground so to speak, spreading the truth (trying to anyway) and it’s always going to be hard but in the end, if we make enough of a difference in the world through being on here and discussing matters that wouldn’t be discussed otherwise on other platforms.... it’ll be worth every hour spent on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m left, don&#39;t really care if you believe me on that.  In case you were insinuating I&#39;m some troll or shill or whatever.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just been a long year of our President being himself (if you&#39;re US).  Of other countries doing their things too.</p>

<p>Guessing you&#39;re US, but shit has been stupid.  Like I said, next time just get us a cat.  This is fucking tiresome to constantly read politics.  And then try to keep up.</p>

<p>I want conspiracies but they over do everything so it&#39;s impossible to me honestly.  We have weird Trump shit at the same time as shooting marches and people waking up about Facebook and whatever the fuck else.</p>

<p>Only so many brain cells can operate over on this side.  Especially when drinking!  So no, I think the people just want the stupid shit to end.  This ain&#39;t a right or left thing.  Sorry.  No convenience.  </p>

<p>I enjoyed it when it started honestly.  Got all the SNL skits out of it.  Now it is just, jesus fucking christ how is this still a daily thing with our government?  Is it all on purpose to misdirect us?  Probably.  Where though?</p>

<p>See?  We need a why so much fucking bullshit tossed at us.  A girl Trump slept with, OK.  We knew he was a shitbag.  Yet daily updates to distract.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired and drunk, point is.  Both sides are getting worn out.  Someone go find the conspiracies that are in there.  Cause I&#39;m going to go play an idle game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See? <em>This</em> is a natural and effective observation to make. People come here to fuck with the discourse because the discourse in here breaks numerous different narratives all over every corner of the political coordinates.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with OP&#39;s decision. Or anything much right about it, either. It&#39;s a natural reaction to a natural reaction etc. etc. turtles all the way down.</p>

<p>But you can forego starving yourself if you know a little <em>more</em> about nature. And this comment shows that another natural thought to have is that perhaps all of these shills showing up here is not a problem; in fact, it&#39;s a sign that things are being done right.</p>

<p>However, nobody wants to watch their karma get slowly destroyed by an influx of brigaders, shills, sock puppets and downvote bots. The last part is especially upsetting. Lately almost every post or comment gets an automatic and almost instant downvote. That&#39;s upsetting.</p>

<p>It&#39;s enough to make a person want to leave. But why not just employ the same tactics? How many in here are doing their part to upvote comments that seem mysteriously downvoted? I think not many.</p>

<p>&quot;Russia spreading conspiracy - something you&#39;ll never read on r/conspiracy&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Russian trolls are very active on reddit especially on their nest r/conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, they should CC every email to r/conspiracy which is well-known for its transparency. Or maybe straight to Kreml just to skip man in the middle&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pizzagate is just russian research on how stupid and controllable western society can be. For the sake of USA power all pizza-gate believers should have their voting rights revoked.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why r/conspiracy never, ever mentions about russian trolls activity in USA? Biggest conspiracy in USA is covered by r/conspiracy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is - it is controlled by russian propaganda. USA never had president who divide the nation so much. This is just the beginning of the end of USA global leadership&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What dumbfuck believes in this Russian propaganda?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Russian trolls are having fun testing how much shit you can swallow :)&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Something you won&#39;t read about on r/conspiracy - is it controlled by russian trolls?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You won&#39;t find it on r/conspiracy&quot;</p>

<p>Gee... You don&#39;t have a fucking blatant agenda, do you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re-group?  The internet social hive mind needs a well defined leader and authority structure.  I mean, heck, I guess /I could/ be the temporary new moderator.  If anything have a little fun with it.  Nominate people.  Have an election.  Top 3 win so it feels equal; and a natural leader will emerge and the other two would feel out minority opinions.</p>

<p>So internet personality is required.  Or name recognition.  Sometimes being anonymous can help in situations - yet, anyhow, that should be fair.  This doesn&#39;t change the price of tea in China.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll all have our mentality when the next great gathering place surfaces. Maybe it&#39;s time to start a private subreddit with fairly strict rules?</p>

<p>Personally, although anonymity was key to these kinds of websites, I think our next best option is to start hosting local meetups. Bring your best material and just shoot the breeze with other like-minded individuals in a controlled environment; one that&#39;s free from the shills, bots, and knuckleheads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  This is where I&#39;m at.  No matter what platform you choose online, it&#39;s always going to be controlled by the Beast somewhere up the line.  Somewhere the money gets funny, like someone pointed out with Steemit.  Somehow, someone who would probably not want your message getting out is always controlling the platform you need to deliver it.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>So, yea.  We have to deliver sermons on mounts.  Right there in person in the real world.  You&#39;ll have to talk to your &quot;adult&quot; friends who&#39;s physical age is over 30 but they avoid politics and important issues that involve cooperating with strangers in favor of getting drunk like college kids.  Go risk their pretty much worthless friendship by talking their ears off about stuff that matters and affects all of us until you&#39;re that insufferable &quot;conspiracy nut&quot; friend they bitch about to their shallow peers. </p>

<p>Fraud and money laundering could certainly be an application for this. Once a &quot;transaction&quot; is recorded on the chain it can never be modified or erased. Voting is something I&#39;d really love to see blockchain applied to on a wide scale level.</p>

<p>An outlandish but conceptually correct way to look at it would be like this: let’s say the blockchain “list” is empty and there are no events. Let’s say we enter the first event “Apple”. So we do. Then we want to enter “Banana”. But this time when we enter the event, our goofy blockchain protocol will actually enter “Banana, and before me is Apple.”  Then when you enter “orange”, our protocol will actually enter “Orange, and before me is Banana, and before him is Apple”. Through a similar but more elaborate approach, blockchain makes information permanent. Blockchain combined with other clever techniques could yield ideas and products that we don’t have today. Like a censorship averse online media forum. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it is a last chance, but I do think that it offers a very easy learning curve if someone wanted to switch platforms because it works nearly identical to Reddit in terms of how it is structured.  A user familiar with where to click things in Reddit will have very few difficulties learning their way around Voat.  </p>

<p>That right there tells me that you have comments and insights that would be a good contribution because it shows that you hold investigating truth as a higher priority than being able to control the narrative with censorship - which allows the pushing of an agenda.  </p>

<p><strong>It is far better than Reddit</strong>...they actually mean what they say about supporting free speech.  The only question is whether you can handle free speech.  The upside is that you can say what the hell you wish with out some jackass mod &quot;banning&quot; you because you violated some &quot;rule&quot; they pulled out of their ass.  The downside is you have to accept that others get the same right so you might see words that will offend you.  </p>

<p>As long as you know how to ignore what you don&#39;t agree with and decide for yourself what you think, its not a problem...except for those who suffer from the delusion that they have a right to tell others how to talk.

<p>I just say whatever the hell I want to say and let the chips fall where they may.  Once I figured out that Reddit Admins couldn&#39;t give two ant shits if mods violate their own rules, I quit wasting my time reading sub rules.  If the rules correspond to what I want to say, fabulous.  If they don&#39;t, then I&#39;ll pretend to give a fuck...but it won&#39;t be very convincing because I don&#39;t really.</p>

<p>I know you probably haven&#39;t played out in your head where your quest for &quot;racism free&quot; leads, but once you think about it in detail you will discover all manner of other types of thinking and speech that you would prefer to filter out also. Racism isn&#39;t really some sort of evil speech that is unique...it is just  a popular target because it is in vogue to virtue signal by denouncing it. </p>

<p>Have you ever given any thought to what you might next eliminate?  Xenophobic speech?  How about pedophiles justifying their affection for children as &quot;normal&quot;?  How about the ravings of radical misogynists?  I think, by now, you see where I&#39;m going with this...once you start making exceptions about who can&#39;t express their views or what ideas are &quot;forbidden&quot; then speech is no longer free...and someday it might be one of your views that gets put on the &quot;naughty list&quot; of society.</p>

<p>Both Voat and Reddit belong to a site genre that becomes whatever you make of it, so IMO it&#39;s kinda unfair to mistake the &quot;site&quot;, for it&#39;s userbase. You can participate within of thousands of little enclaves, doing whatever it is you&#39;d like.</p>

You can all keep pretending like there&#39;s always a &quot;better place&quot; to be but the truth is there isn&#39;t. Mainstream &quot;conspiracies&quot; have overtaken the conspiracies that matter. The public consciousness has fallen fully for the divide and conquer. People aren&#39;t satisfied keeping their politics on Facebook, they feel the need to spread their hatred to every other corner of the internet. For me personally, I subscribe to a few channels on YouTube that give me the information I need to be aware of what&#39;s really going on and the comments sections of those vids are the best for discussion but that&#39;s about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The divide &amp; conquer was systematical and executed tactically. It&#39;s obvious when it happens too because the second you can&#39;t even talk about certain ideas is the moment you know something insidious is occurring. </p>

<p>The March on Wallstreet movement was at its height and Reddit and the Internet at large was a big part of that.  Then suddenly a few things occurred all at once, and a couple movements I remember that couldn&#39;t even be discussed without a flame war starting.  One was the Gamergate stuff, the other was the BlackLivesMatter stuff.  Even apple and Google fanboys had arguments, but on those two subjects it was simply &quot;if you aren&#39;t with us you are against us.&quot; And you weren&#39;t even allowed to argue without offending.  And that&#39;s when you realize both movements helped divide the population into conquerable, smaller populations.  It&#39;s the oldest trick in the book and it&#39;s so effective.  Men vs Women, Racial differences, these are the same tools that have been used to rule over populations over and over.  You don&#39;t have to spend resources to innoculate the population if you can get them to fight each other.  </p>

<p>So we need to look to the past at how people broke out of these same problems.  Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, JFK...they all were heroes because they united people together.  MLK didn&#39;t say &quot;I have an Oppressor.&quot; He said &quot;I have a dream&quot; and it included everyone. JFK literally said &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.&quot;  </p>

<p>Working together, that&#39;s the only issue they have. It&#39;s the reason politics is never about politics, it&#39;s about the issues that they can divide us on.  If you&#39;ve ever stopped and wondered &quot;why are presidential candidates talking about abortions?!&quot; Then you probably were close to figuring out that it&#39;s a farce, and that debating what we disagree on isn&#39;t the way forward. Building a future together with people is the way forward, and the value you have to focus on is The Truth above all.  That&#39;s why they won&#39;t let you talk about those issues without name calling and trying to vilify those who do, because they don&#39;t want to talk about the truth. </p>

<p>Tell the truth and try to work together with others towards higher goals.  Nothing else has worked better, and we have so many times in history that supports this.  There are no enemies, just focus on the truth and nothing else.  </p>

<p>This is what should never be forgotten. You cannot wait for a good guy to arrive on your team if he gets kicked out by your team because he is good for people. We can never forget that it is completely rigged like a banana Republic.</p>

<p>In fact, since there is no oversight in primaries, it is worse than banana Republic whom have UN oversight, usually at the request of the USA</p>

Waiting for some sort of neuron firing feel good thread or news story so you can whip something up on the keyboard listening to the wife talk yet just nodding your head.</p>

<p>So yeah, Reddit is/always has been a different... well, a sterile friendship/karma/rating system for a forum.. because, well, it just does.</p>

<p>But I wish you will.  I only stop by every so often.  Yet, what are you hoping will change?</p>

<p>That there will be a big shakeup tomorrow in news?  </p>

<p>IMO, the only thing changing is the comment section and emojis.  </p>

<p>What have you seen in terms of actual anti-white racism? There really isn&#39;t any anti-white racism on Reddit as virulent as the shit you&#39;ll see on otherwise unrelated /v/funny post over on Voat.</p>

I bet they wish they could go back in time. This isn&#39;t just one person. It&#39;s how everybody feels that knows the truth and knows there is a place called voat. I would think Reddit could put in place terms of service that made it against the rules for pr companies to attack their site with boys or shills or face a lawsuit, because let&#39;s face it. It certainly does hurt Reddit and it&#39;s bottom line. It&#39;s existence as well. I&#39;m four years it could be just like digg. An empty playground where nothing happens.myspace. for those that didn&#39;t know there is a place called voat. That was modeled after reddit. It needs more submissions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the problem is you cant even talk about real conspiracys on here, if you have ever been tolled to &quot;kill your self&quot; because you believe in a conspiracy you understand what im saying, people dont have conversations or debates people are not spreading the fundamentals of thinking for your self  and independent research. ive only encountered contrary ass holes who make a point to make any conspiracy look dumb. you got to keep moving ahead of the crowd to stay away from the agents in place and honey pots. </p>

<p>but i respect your attitude, thank you for being willing to fight the fight, it feels worthless from time to time and we need people like you to slap us in the face when we are ready to give up. but im talking about more than just the Sub. Keep thinking for your self, keep searching for the truth and keep an open mind. the Truth is stranger than fiction. #2realnews   </p>
