<p>Just wanted to let people know that the US Gov has the right to clone and search any of your Electronic devices when entering the country. Its no secret that Corruption is deeply rooted within the United States Government.  So dont carry Valuable Information with you when entering the United states.</p>

<p>If you want to be extra safe, wipe your laptop and other electronic devices prior to entering the United States. Once you are in, you can simply download the files (which should be encrypted) remotely.</p>

<p>The US government has to my best knowledge the right to ask you for passwords of your devices, if you refuse they can refuse entry.</p>

<p>Thats all.</p>

<p>Edit: Here is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/03/the-border-patrol-can-take-your-password-now-what/">article</a> that describes it in a bit more Detail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well usually if you do business, that information can be valuable. For example you are working on a deal with an american company then if somebody else knew about this, they could buy stocks (small scale) and profit. Or you are working for a biotech company and developing a new drug, you could sell that data to a rival company which would be a pretty devastating to your company.</p>

<p>For everyday extortion things, there is obviously something there too. Most of us have certain informations that we dont want certain other people to see. Maybe harmless and petty, maybe big (affair).</p>

<p>Valuable information can mean alot in this context and once somebody else has a snapshot of your life (your data) then its up to their Imagination what to do with it.</p>

<p>Sending your device with your data means, you are putting it in jeopardy. Its out of your hands until you get it back. Removing a battery is meaningless. Since they can always put in another battery. Or just remove the SD card or embedded flash memory (that is a bit difficult  though) make a copy, put it back and continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats the point, nobody would refuse it. If you are a American Citizen they cant refuse entry, but they can make your life hell. So nobody really can say no.
