    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that watching these kids gives me hope for the future of the country, and makes me think the historical role of Gen X/Millennials will be fending off the Baby Boomers who want to suck this country dry long enough for us to hand everything over to the current school-aged youth.</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s disgusting how many people here have viciously attacked these kids all for the horrific transgression of not being shot.  </p>

<p>As for your skepticism: </p>

<p>1) No, I don&#39;t know if these particular kids are the &quot;most upset,&quot; That&#39;s never been a qualification for being an activist.</p>

<p>2) No, of course the protests weren&#39;t just the kids.  They were the inspiration and initial spark, and then tens of thousands of motivated people who agree with their came to offer help organizing a national event.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pay attention to what is influencing these individuals, because your in essence calling for something as ludicrous as removing all the pine trees in North America because some get the needles in their eye.</p>

<p>What is activating these kids, what drives them to the act? Is it their school influence? Being in one of the hundreds of dying and inadequate schools across the country? Is it the massive amounts of Ritalin, cymbalta, and any other it the -ins, -ax, -pram, -ams, or -als.</p>

<p>Could social media have an effect? 
Could our current political climate influence it?
Could our &quot;shame centric&quot; culture shaped by social media have an effect?</p>

<p>Could it be that drastically shifting your body to meet some niche standard of beauty/acceptable in society has ripped away their identity and understanding of themselves?</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t scared of guns in highschool and a surprising majority of current students aren&#39;t either. It&#39;s only the areas with less than 5 minute police response times that want this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because guns have been inundated into our culture since the beginning, because shootings of these magnitude don&#39;t mean to punish the entire class. It&#39;s not the most obvious actor because this didn&#39;t happen with the same frequency until recently.</p>

<p>Guns didn&#39;t change, we did. Everyone is too scared to point fingers at the actual monied people in charge so they take it out on rural rednecks who cannot imagine a sustainable life in their area without game meat.</p>

<p>Here are some quick googlings, we have less guns in our society. Gun related deaths have been on a decrease, which is an unpopular fact to the &quot;2018 school shooting tally&quot; that people are using as justification for gun control.</p>

<p>Why are guns on a decrease, gun violence is on a decrease, but school shootings be on an increase? That&#39;s kinda the brain puzzler, which is where I believe the conspiracy fits in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great response with no substance but I am not surprised. Try to have a civilised chat with someone that has opposing political views. Most normal adults can do this. Most millinials cannot and that is because of the funded indoctrination of pc tripe, safe spaces etc. In this particular case have a look on youtube at videos of conservatives on opposite side of debate, peacefully and politely trying to engage with people on the march. I have seen so many already and it is always the same. The people protesting are very angry, aggressive and constantly triggered by ANY opposing view. They are rude, hostile and in alot of cases become physically intimidating. They just scream and chant empty rhetoric. </p>

<p>The same kind of people that &#39;march for theirs lives&#39; every other day about something they are outraged over.  </p>

<p>20 years ago people could sit down together and have intelligent debates.  Now its just a swarp of socialist puppets with blue hair, nose rings and 20 different identities, screaming and screeching over everything. Very aggressive and irrational and will not just have a normal conversation. If people did the latter more there would actually be alot more unity even if there fundamental political differing opinions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i hope they are setting an example for more people in my generation to actually fight against obvious corruption.
i think that your problem with them is shallow and unsubstantial, what should they look like? since they don’t look like you think they should, im interested to know what kind of person you think should be speaking for them?
i agree with you that the attack’s on here have been unnecessarily vicious, but most of them have been from idiots who still don’t understand what they are trying to do. all they think is “they wanna take my guns” and they see red, which is a bit ironic considering the reasons behind this call for gun regulation. but i’m happy to see people in my generation taking action, we are gonna be the ones to replace these old baby boomers when they eventually croak. maybe instead of fighting the future, people should start embracing the idea that the future generations want to end all this senseless violence and bullshit politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Puppets apparently are people who you disagree with.</p>

<p>It was not until 2008 that the Second Amendment came to the Supreme Court, and even then, the decision was 5-4.</p>

<p>Why did it take so long? Because it was well established for over 100 years that gun regulations were Constitutional. All of a sudden, the new Koch created &quot;libertarian&quot; movement advances an argument that is so ludicrous that it could not be taken seriously for well over 100 years. This is what changed.</p>

<p>In fact, in American history, it was the conservative pro-slavery anti-black crowd that restricted guns. They called them the &quot;black laws&quot; and they prevented freed slaves from having firearms. </p>

<p>It was not until 2010 that the gun rights created in 2008 were applied to the entire nation, in another 5-4 decision. This decision strangely enough went through a very long and quite good dissertation of the 14th Amendment to block states from gun regulations. How ironic is that? The same people who general ly want to repeal or deny the 14th Amendment as it applies to the freed slaves fully understand that it can be used to block states from taking action on the gun issue. To me, this is a smoking GUN of dishonesty.</p>

<p>As an example, mostly these same Justices used the 14th Amendment in 2000 to stop counting the legal cast votes of minority and black populations for the specific protection of whiter areas who had their votes cast and counted properly.</p>

<p>Oh i guess i just dont know how stupid i am, but youre too high and mighty to tell me?</p>

<p>No, thats not the problem. If these people were marching to end the corrupt system that breeds mass shooters id be marching with them.</p>

<p>Instead theyre spewing bullshit about how we need to curb gun ownership by law abiding citizens. That will make us all safer. Less guns will make us all safer. Which is a load of horsedick.</p>

<p>The laws were in place to stop this Nikolas Cruz kid who appears to be a patsy anyway. He was hearing voices and lived with a defense contractor who worked on electronic warfare. Not sus at all right?</p>

<p>40 police visits to his house but nothing done to take his guns? Seems legit.</p>

<p>Makes threats in his real name to shoot up a school, plus tips to the FBI that hes deranged, plus social media posts that hes got a bunch of guns and intends to kill?</p>

<p>And we need to stop normal people from getting AR15s to make us all perfectly safe. Im sure all the gangs and criminals who get guns illegally <em>no matter what laws you pass</em> will hand all their unregistered illegally obtained and impossible to track guns in...</p>

<p>Yeah its bullshit. Its a ploy to delete the second amendment like i said.</p>

<p>And i said that your generation is supposed to be more enlightened.

<p>I was the weird kid, i was <em>wrongly</em> drugged on ADD meds then SSRIs as a teen, and i know how horrible it is to go through that shit. It has nothing to do with guns and everything to do with a rigged system of perverse incentives through which people become enslaved by their own compassion.</p>

<p>If you cant see that this bullshit march is a feeble attempt to use compassion as a weapon to disarm the population and make them ripe for tyranny, then thats too bad.</p>

<p>Saying that you think this march <em>truly</em> comes from a good place means you dont see how either malicious or incompetent the people funding it are.</p>

<p>They will have you manufacture the weapons that they will destroy or enslave you with, and you will do it if you have compassion for the wrong people. It has been going on for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Right, the baby boomers are still in charge of America. Generation X never took power.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a school with thousands of people. Who should lead the protest -- ugly homely people who have lisps, stutter or have trouble putting together phrases? If only that kind of thing worked.</p>

<p>Why are THEY the faces that we&#39;re associating with this? Are they the most upset, are they truly the ones who put all this together? </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s because they are good at it and the idea is to make change, not put out some stereotype for those on the other side to tease and make fun of (not that this stops them).</p>

<p>Small potatoes. How come every time a group goes up against TPTB, they aren&#39;t allowed to spend any money? This is a double standard. Do you want that infamous &quot;purity&quot; from the people but not from the established experts and their teams of psychologists?</p>

<p>Money is arguably the greatest force to protect TPTB. That&#39;s why stock certificates are now considered people with Constitutional rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Young people have always been used as puppets. They are too naive and emotional to understand the long term ramifications of things. </p>

<p>Some gun regulations make sense. I actually, as a conservative, think semi-automatic weapons should be held by more mature members of society. I&#39;d ban  sales of these weapons until 30. That&#39;ll weed out almost all the mass shooters. Won&#39;t stop them all but it will stop the Lanzas or Cruzs, as well as the other high profile killers. </p>

<p>But as we all know, the Left doesn&#39;t want that. Their end goals are bans on ALL semi-automatic rifles, which are the only weapons that give the American people power. Once the semiautomatic rifle is banned, the American people are defenseless to ever carry out what the 2nd Amendment was intended for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both sides are wrong on this subject. There obviously should he some more regulations against young people. But at the same time you can&#39;t make laws and not uphold them. The people demanding gun control refuse to punish those who break the law. Felons are caught with illegal guns, often committing crimes in American cities every day. They don&#39;t want THOSE people punished. They won&#39;t ever march for the tens of thousands murdered or victims of other gun crimes. </p>

<p>My side has been banging the walls about the gun crime problem in this country for years and have been ignored by these same people. Their outrage therefore seems phony and contrived, particularly when they aim it at law abiding gun owners and not the criminal element and Law Enforcement/Courts who drop the ball, giving these animals a slap on the wrist until they finally end up killing somebody. .</p>

When I was younger, I acted this way too. I thought communism is what&#39;s best for people because hey, we&#39;re all equal! Guns=violence when in fact it is the total opposite...without guns, and the right to have them, we are able to have peace. They want to find out the hard way by ripping up the constitution, probably one of the best and strongest words written by anyone starting a country and just because we are having a gun debate, doesn&#39;t mean you have to tear the whole damn thing up. </p>
