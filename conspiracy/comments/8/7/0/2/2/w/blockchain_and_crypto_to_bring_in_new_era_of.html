       After beginning to file my crypto taxes I realized a couple things. Blockchain technology if it were not to remain anonymous will be the de facto tool to literally watch and record every step any person makes. Every transaction whether its money, text, video, you changing the color of your lightbulb (IOT chain) the RFID Chips in your coke bottle (VEN) will be watched and recorded. Literally everything around you will be on the ledger.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example in a near possible future where anonymity does not exist in a blockchain then people will not be able to get away with anything. And failing to comply with the authority will stop you from being able to access certain things
Because everything will be connected. You now see blockchains for almost every industry and or service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say Rick doesn’t pay his taxes or says something anti establishment on the internet. These actions will forever be on the blockchain. It will be undeniable that the person didn’t commit these actions because identities will be given via rfid chips like Walton or though companies like TKY. Then the consequences of these actions will lead into other aspects of life because everything will be interconnected On the blockchain.  Certain services will be prohibited to you because you don’t qualify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now China and other nations are developing a system that rates you based on your social actions. Straight black mirror.  You say something bad about the president or jay walk then you get docked points and forfeit certain privileges or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blockchain has the potential to bring a whole new system of control never before seen if crypto loses its core value.
      </p>
      <p>
       We as community in general  are blinded by profits and naive to the fact that the old guard will simply step aside. Instead they will do what they best. Control.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in a war for freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       This might sound tin foil but if you look at the big picture this is possible. We are at crossroads.

       "#DeleteFacebook", "Youtube "owing us" freespeech", "Blockchain is the future" - all these points that WOULD appear to be "ours" are gaining traction: why and how? Because it serves the agenda.

       Not really. It's just a brokerage like jd Ameritrade or Charles Schwab only with Robinhood it's absolutely free, you could apply for an account, get approved and add 20 bucks to your account and start buying stock. But there is a waiting list for Robinhood crypto. It hasn't officially rolled out yet. You can get NASDAQ stocks all u want and just not crypto at the moment. It's a legit platform even though it's only a couple years old. Check out the Robinhood sub

       Doubt it. Robinhood is a regulated broker/dealer in the US so they are required to collect tons of info about you - same (if not more) like a bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true way not to be tracked while using cryptos is the following:
1. You mine your crypto
2. You put the crypto in your software wallet (not Coinbase)
3. Buy online whatever you want
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything else can be tracked.

       Don't agree but I get your point.
The issue is that the moment you want to open a brokerage account, you need to provide real personal identifiable information (SSN, ID, address and bills that verify the address etc). And all your documents can be summoned by the IRS and SEC. Goodbye anonimity :)

       spot on. if it can be used for enslavement, then it will be, for sure.  i hope that the energy consumption to run it all will be prohibitive though. they might have to prioritize.  also some cryptos are secure, such as monero, but im not an expert.

       Just going to throw this out there. This is already true for credit cards and the people that use them. I agree with what OP is explaining, but it's important to realize we are already tracked on every single purchase using credit cards in the same way, maybe even
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       secure than an encrypted block chain. For example, retailers and service companies keep your damn credit card info in their computers.

       This. Not only that, but the other issues are things that can be solved through community collaboration and open source. The more audits the better. Monero has a descent track record and there are others. I personally think we should replace national ID with digital wallets and allow people to vote online and monitor their votes in real-time.

       Great point.  I remember refusing to give my phone number at radio shack and not giving my zip code at Best Buy thinking I am heroically preserving my freedom.  Meanwhile, everything I bought using a credit card, including the shit at Radio Shack and Best Buy, over the 30 years Ive had credit cards has left a profile that knows more about me than I do.

       There will be value in transparent money for the transparent economy and KYC.  Imagine knowing where every campaign dollar came from and where every tax dollar goes.  Just as useful for us to spy on them.  There will ALSO be a market for the anonymized currencies for actions like donating to wikileaks.

       I've been saying this for about a year, but people want to become a millionaire overnight so strongly that it falls on deaf ears.  They are blinded by greed and unknowingly ushering in an era of total and complete control.  Not to mention the environmental effects are absolutely horrid.

       You're right, I came to this conclusion a while ago too. Blockchain, as simple as it is, is potentially the most dangerous technology maybe ever created.

       I don’t know anything about the Robinhood app. But while we’re on topic, is there any way that this app could also be used against the people, like OP is talking about?

       Not really. It's just a brokerage like jd Ameritrade or Charles Schwab only with Robinhood it's absolutely free, you could apply for an account, get approved and add 20 bucks to your account and start buying stock. But there is a waiting list for Robinhood crypto. It hasn't officially rolled out yet. You can get NASDAQ stocks all u want and just not crypto at the moment. It's a legit platform even though it's only a couple years old. Check out the Robinhood sub
