<p>I feel like the absolute worship of a document written 230 years ago is no better than someone else&#39;s holy book.  It was written by men, just the same, and has flaws and was intended to be updated as generations come and go.  </p>

<p>No, and this type of question always leads to accusations of deeply ingrained racism being the only reason people still support the document.</p>

<p>That said, the idea that the constitution is perfect and should never change is a flawed idea, since it was purposely written in a way to be changed. </p>

<p>And it has many times over the last 200 years. </p>

<p>And lets not forget that with the original constitution, slavery was legal, only land owning white men could vote, and black people were considered 3/5 human. </p>

<p>The constitution was never a perfect document. </p>

<p>My point with that was more with you saying that the constituation was more important than anyone&#39;s desire to have it changed.  So you clearly agree that there are some things that should change.  Now it&#39;s more of a discussion of what is reasonable.</p>

<p>And when people take that to immediately mean that they&#39;re coming for all the guns, leads that to be the more likely result when refusing to come to the table for reasonable gun controlled.</p>

<p>The people of the US would be FAR more well armed than them.</p>

<p>it&#39;s been theorized 1/3 soldiers and their units would defect to a citizens revolution(I think it&#39;s much higher), then other nations looking to keep the US destabilized would, of course, aid the rebels.</p>

<p>Whole Units. Combat Ready.</p>

<p>When the USSR fell, the percentage of units unwilling to shoot their neighbours was far higher. (In the 90% area iirc, could be wrong)</p>

<p>50 men on a hill with automatic weapons can, have and will knock a fighter jet right out of the sky. Let alone whole anti-air units. Not to mention whole Air Wings.</p>

<p>Remember the old saying &quot;Hunting tanks is easy and fun&quot; It&#39;s even easier and more fun when you&#39;re crusing around in a Abrams, I&#39;ll wager.</p>

<p>WMDs? Now you&#39;ve got the whole UN on your case, and it goes from &quot;Dirty Rebels&quot; to &quot;Victims of the TYRANTS trying to extinguish the beacon of Freedom and democracy!&quot; &quot;Think of the children!&quot; &quot;BUY WARBONDS!&quot; Plus, who&#39;s going to actually turn the key on THAT operation?</p>

<p>Most countries, at this point in history, consider taking and holding the US virtually impossible, even with every other nation in the world combined. (Counting on the US military to largely go pro-we the people, which every indication shows)</p>

<p>So, No the US population isn&#39;t defenseless, &quot;We, the People&quot; ARE the Most powerful military force in the US.</p>

<p>Only time I see him called anything close to a tyrant is when he starts talking about punishing the press. Which is something a tyrant would do. </p>

<p>Transgender are losing rights under Trump. Both Ohio and Alabama have put forth radical abortion laws thst will challenge Roe v Wade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great point. Reasonable laws and regulations are in place. The problem is authorities seem to do nothing with this information. VA is one of the most open states when it comes to purchasing a firearm. You still have to submit to a $40, non-refundable, background check (talking about actual shops, not shows) and for almost all of the incidents of late, authorities had prior complaints that were not followed through. Most of these were on medication or had mental health issues, too. To me, it’s clear as day where the problem lies. </p>
