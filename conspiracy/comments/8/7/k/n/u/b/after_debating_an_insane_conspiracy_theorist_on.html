       This debate last night on the existence of media manipulation and agent provocateur tactics on reddit took place last night between a conspiracy theorist and the most active mod of tmor. They said that anyone who thinks shills exist is insane. Yet upon establishing first principles, xir acknowledged the existence of agent provocateurs, an inconsistency that conflicts with their former statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why am I insane or unhinged when I suggest that agent provocateur tactics are employed in reddit, but when you say it you're sane? Are you actually a conspiracy theorist _ph03nix?
      </p>
      <p>
       Very interesting seeing the result of what happens when someone actually tries to have an adult conversation in tmor. The most active mod of tmor
       <a href="/u/_ph03nix">
        /u/_ph03nix

       delete all of their comments before two days ago this morning. Is that really how thinned skinned these people are? They make fun of people, harass people, and target people simply for what they believe. But the second a joke is made on their behalf they [delete]. What does that show?
      </p>
      <p>
       If their sub was really about jokes why aren't the jokes actually funny?

       I tired to participate and make fun of insane conspiracy theorists but they removed my posts... Hmm. They don't like making fun of batshit insane conspiracies all of a sudden??

       You're incredibly naive by letting this goon fluff up his little show with fictions. Not to mention allowing your already-toxic sub be used for those purposes. Your inaction as a whole are why people like me exist. Remember that.

       Is that so, failed-mod-turned-groupie? We are expelled precisely because we will. The evidence for that is ginormous. We offered yesterday, no takers. What a surprise. Besides, what you people do isn't "debate". It's coddling each others fantasies, nothing more."

       Sure. Just a coincidence. Actually sounds pretty paranoid to me..

       It doesn't make sense. We all know TMOR is garbage, giving them attention just encourages them. Obsessing over them just makes them feel that they are correct in thinking everyone that posts here is off their rocker.

       There is a difference between ignoring them and letting their game go unchallenged.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can debate all you like on if this is the way to do it.  I think ignoring it does nothing at all and makes the problem worse for anyone here who wants to participate in the conversation or any conversation online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their entire goal is to disrupt, trying to have a conversation while they do their thing and simply pretending they're not there is not possible.

       Apparently, saying "thank you" is "controversial".  This was at zero up votes at the time I commented this.

       Thank you for coming to my defense kind sir. Kgb and CIA have always worked hand in hand. These nsa/fbi fucks don't know what their messing with! Our agencies are much more efficient. And much more decentralized.
