        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think for people to develop some healthy and strong personalities, they should reflect about life and about what really matters. Even before I became associated with the term conspiracy theorist, I didn&#39;t like the idea of being hyper connected to people through different media like facebook and such, so while I did use such methods of communication I always kept a healthy distance from them, always focusing on my own goals. Now, identity politics has invaded nearly every aspect of people&#39;s lives and even the internet. People work so much and are constantly under the threat of being judged by society that they don&#39;t have time to reflect about their own identity and have to follow the values of society just to survive.</p>

<p>Reflection is very important for becoming more whole. Take some time alone to think for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am somewhat cut off from communicating with folks from home for a long time now.I get a call every other week or so. Besides this i dont have access to facebook, youtube twitter and lots of other sites i took for granted. While i really miss watching dumb minecraft videos (wonder if the yogscast ever made a Moonquest 2...) i can honestly say it has been good for me.</p>

<p>I started learning more, have a closer sense of duty and responsibility and i have firm goals in life. Those things are hard to come by when you numb yourself with Innatenesses  24/7. So yes i recommend some &quot;time off&quot;. Take it as a vacation for your brain.</p>

<p>It was quite good for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said for years these things were watching and people laughed at me. Then the camera phones came and my friends laughed when I started talking about my camera always being hot like it&#39;s recording and it wasn&#39;t until after I installed Facebook. I told them it was logging texts and calls. I no longer use Facebook (14 months clean) and I&#39;m spending way too much time on reddit lately. It&#39;s becoming Facebook only more disconnected. I don&#39;t have any other social media. Redit is literally my news source. You&#39;re right OP.  It&#39;s important to unplug.  I have schizzoaffective disorder and at times the conspiracies run rampant in my head so I try to steer clear of most news but damn if these people aren&#39;t making it easy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we gotta follow whatever happens too. Yeah, I get your point. Those who follow me know I do my research according to certain things and I don&#39;t know, sometimes I&#39;m in bed and I start trying to solve the puzzle thinking what they could be planning next until a new theory comes to my head.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like being so passionate that you feel &quot;possessed&quot; by something, kind of like Socrates said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spent the last 10 years sustainable farming and hanging out with my dogs... fishing, hiking, being in nature. I don&#39;t buy anything new. I grow 90% of our own food. I don&#39;t have a social scene. Quit drinking. Single for the last 5 years. Never been fucking happier! Prior to this I worked in the shitty music industry with psychic vampires and played the social bar game... had a long time GF who had me borderline brainwashed haha. I now see my family members a few times a week and that is it. Spending all this time alone with my dogs and nature has allowed me to become my true self. I used to be full of anger/anxiety/wanting to die... now I just laugh and enjoy every day. Highly recommended!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: I 100% agree with you. </p>

<p>However, I have to look at social media like a source of income. In my eyes this “connection” we as users have to other have opened so many doors for job opportunities, and even making hobbies much easier turn into a semi stable ways of making your monthly revenue. </p>

<p>For example, Instagram advertising has become huge when it comes to the younger audience. Lots of companies reach out to these big names and pay them well to show some item to their demographic. I’m not writing this to argue, I’m just pointing out some things that people should know about this crazy phenomenon that is social media. Take it as you will. </p>
