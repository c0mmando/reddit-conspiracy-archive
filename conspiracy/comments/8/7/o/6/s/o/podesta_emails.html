       Because the Corporate Propaganda media colluded to ensure that instead of the real shit these emails contained- such as DNC collusion, corruption, and Pgate, was covered up with the "MUH RUSSIA" narrative.

       I know msm wise most people got distracted with that, but can't be everyone?  Like, are the Podestas, Alefantis, pimp granny even worried about anything?  People flying drones outside their shit?  Independently wire tapping them/general sleuthing/snooping around?

       You're looking at em. Right here in this sub, and other smaller communities here on Reddit. Sure, there are people out there who believe and see things as they are- but the vast majority of people could care less, and have bought the story hook, line, and sinker. Most have no idea about the true corruption of the DNC or Podesta, or the rigging of the Primaries. Most people don't pay attention...and when they do, its 5 minutes of CNN or Fox here or there...and they gobble the programming right up.

       Yeah it's weird.. also there was another article a posted a few days ago that claimed a child was abducted and not soon after the "emails" coincidently started up again at a faster pace after a lul in activity. I'd like to see these people investigate professionally and charged with their criminal activity!

       Madeleine McCann? The emails were deleted from the period she was abducted I believe, and there just happens to be a photo-fit that looks exactly like the Podesta brothers from the investigation into her abduction/whatever happened to her.

       Yeah that was very ironic..although if I remember correctly they were in the area at the time. You'd think they'd have people who do the kidnapping for them. I'm not very familiar with the case but I do know from videos I've seen that their home is decorated with child pornography and other weird explicit images of children sex slaves.

       Super creepy artwork you’re right there! The whole case doesn’t add up to me tbh, the photo-fits add to that. It seems pretty clear to me that the Podesta’s are deep into fucked up stuff. Crazy that nothing came of the email leak.

       There's no evidence of that. That was a claim made by

       about paedophilia in the EU and added some made-up bit about the Podestas being in Portugal. Note that VL quotes Madsen's line "Of greater interest is that fact that Freud owned a villa in Praia da Luz" but attributes it to an "FBI insider" to make it sound more credible. The claim was

       Where is the evidence the emails were "deleted from the period she was abducted"? As I recall, there's one email from within a day or two of Madeleine McCann's abduction and a couple of others from that year, but absence of any other emails does not equal evidence of deletion.

       Not to mention Podestas relationship with Clement Freud (known pederast) and Freud's relationship with the McCann family.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fact that its heavily implied the Podestas were staying at Freud's house, which was only 4 blocks away from the McCanns, during the time of the abduction.

       Just on the most basic false claim on this conspiracy meme, the "two suspects" that are shared as supposedly looking like the Podesta brothers are actually two efits of one person, who the police are looking for as a potential witness, rather than an identified suspect.

       Maybe... I just know I read the bulk of those emails with a Tabula Rasa and all that stood out aside from a few stingers was how concerned Podesta was with Frequent Flyer Miles. State Dept. FOIA was more interesting than what Podesta was up to.

       Eh... all the UFO and Zero Point Energy stuff I saw was somewhat ambiguous as to the authenticity of the claims...  Nothing blatantly shady that I saw... just cause something ends up on Wikileaks don't mean that the email was sent by a sane person.

       Anyone who wants to benefit from his position (as I've said it already). He worked will Bill, Obama and Hillary. He knows alot and has alot of influence, so if someone wants to reach (well not anymore because drumph won) Clinton's ears - or someone else he works for/with - they can do it through him.

        Hetty Green
       </a>
       ? She was worth $200 million when she died in 1951 but her "stinginess was legendary":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        She was said never to turn on the heat or use hot water. She wore one old black dress and undergarments that she changed only after they had been worn out, did not wash her hands and rode in an old carriage. She ate mostly pies that cost fifteen cents. One tale claims that Green spent half a night searching her carriage for a lost stamp worth two cents. Another asserts that she instructed her laundress to wash only the dirtiest parts of her dresses (the hems) to save money on soap.

       His first link isn’t correct but it’s relatively close.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The memo says: “We need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to Isis and other radical groups in the region.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So not explicitly weapons, but financial and logistical support (I’ve gotta assume financial support would lead to the purchase of weapons, among other things). Don’t really have a side in this argument, just pointing out that his claim isn’t too far off from what was apparently in one of the memos.

       The whole internet was set ablaze for a good couple of weeks when these emails dropped. Just look at the sheer amount of traffic reddit and the chans were getting. Look at the sudden shut downs of every thread/subreddit/board that was discussing them. Look at when they finally played the 'fake news' card that they'd been holding on to for years. Fake news had honestly been a widespread problem for years in places like Facebook, but they held onto the 'fake news' card until they had something to shut down. Just look at Google trends for Podesta/Fake News or Pizzagate/Fake News. 
Look at how quickly Twitter started hiding the trending hashtags on the matter, as well as admitting to hiding at least half or the posts. Look at how heavily communities were flooded with shills and spooks during this time, and how any mouthpiece was equally shut down. Assange disappeared from a room he's been shut in for years for releasing these emails. They even committed Kanye West because he was vocal about it.
      </p>

       These agencies do not react like this on just unfounded rumors. They only do this when there's someone/something to protect.

       One reason might be that there isn’t a person in the world who knows what they are talking about that will say DKIM is an acceptable verifier of an email senders identity and it would actually be very easy for an Intelligence agency or anyone with serious computing power to spoof a few fake ones to sprinkle in with the real ones. Why didn’t Podesta and company make an effort to point this out? They could have said they were fake and nobody could contradict them really, so why wouldn’t you if you were being accused of something so heinous? Then you look at the fantastically convenient circumstances surrounding the emails including the timing as a distraction from Hillary’s missing 33k emails, Podestas weak password, losing his phone in a cab, etc...combined with the very odd method of delivery by Wikileaks, breaking it all down into bite sized pieces and spoon-feeding them to us via the Stochastic Terminator algorithm, breaking a rock solid pattern of behavior up until that point by releasing everything via bulk dump, and alarm bells should be going off in your head.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that’s not enough we have ex-spymaster Michael Flynn, an expert in psychological warfare and subversion, leading the p-gate push alongside his son on Twitter. The same Michael Flynn photographed repeatedly with Admiral Rogers at Nowruz Commission galas, the same Rogers who heads the NSA which Fancy Bear tools can be traced back to. The NSA being a Pentagon controlled operation, who have obvious motive to want to humiliate Clinton due to Benghazi etc... I could go on and on, there are so many problems and red flags here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could Podesta be a pedo and the code words actually be referencing drugs, and the fake emails are just misdirection with the hopes that the media “fake news” onslaught will discredit and embarrass anyone trying to dig deeper? Of course that is a possibility, especially since it seems that pizza parlors being used as fronts for cocaine distribution have a long and storied history, just like the CIA and cocaine, as well as rumors about the Clintons and cocaine use/distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you stop and think about it, do your own research, and reconcile the contradictions together you can actually eliminate a lot of possibilities. Personally, I think the appearance of Frank Giustra of Uranium One fame alongside a FBI pedo doc logo for his charity is a giant red flag. That plus the infamous photo of Podesta with the fish and number 14 on his hands leading back to Russia is further indication that it was a “fake news” credibility trap.

       Researching Flynn leads me to the conclusion that his contentious relationship with the FBI is just as likely theatrics as anything else and could actually be working with the FBI to coordinate the Russia misdirection.  In fact, the Strzok/Page “insurance plan” could just as likely be the ‘holy shit, we convinced the country one half are Satanic cannibals and the other half are Kremlin operatives but we can’t deliver on either of those things so we need a back door to escape plan’ plan. Flynn contracted quite a few ex-FBI agents to do work for Flynn Intel Group and even had his good friend Brian McCauley get promoted to a high ranking position in the FBI by Mueller when both were there. It seems it is common for these govt. intel agents to leave for the higher paying private field and maintain good working relationships with each other, regardless of working for different agencies, for just that reason. Strange how easily Flynn was caught in the wiretap sting don’t you think? It’s like the spymaster totally forgot everything he knew about opsec, and then totally forgot he was a tough guy General and folded under the slightest media pressure. People like to say he was fired, but that isn’t how it went down. The initial news story broke, Trump issued that statement of support, Flynn held the news conference where he said he was stepping down, and THEN the Trump administration said that he was actually fired. Quite the discrepancy. That was the last thing Trump needed at the time too, you would think Flynn would be smart enough to know that and handle it differently.

       How so? None of it requires faith, suspension of disbelief, or to ignore any of the other available information. In fact it accounts for things no one else wants to talk about, like the strange circumstances surrounding Flynn’s removal. Put your own theory up and I will destroy it. Guaranteed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flynn likes money, and he doesn’t seem to be very particular where it comes from.

       Kneejerk downvotes, it seems I hit a nerve. I’m guessing it’s the 800lb gorilla in the p-gate room, Frank Giustra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example of anyone qualified to speak on the matter saying it can’t be done please. The limitation at the time of the initial Google server flaw discovery was processing power, that was years ago. Anyways, this guy has testified before Senate Committees etc. and was even called on by Google as an expert witness in their Oracle battle, he specializes in the mechanics of email  blah, blah, blah. He says it’s a myth that DKIM can be used to verify the senders identity. Browsing StackOverflow I found the same consensus. If you can point me at a qualified person saying it is a legit verifier like PGP, then by all means wow me with your mastery of search engines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing as how it took about two minutes to find this why didn’t anyone from the Podesta-Clinton camp do the same basic research? An expert on the matter debunking it seems like good ammo to me and you would think they would do anything they can to debunk it whether guilty or innocent.

       They weren't exactly crazy, it was mostly things we expected for years.  Now we have the direct words of people in the Clinton campaign, showing their true sentiments that were blatantly obvious all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically it comes down to the Clinton political dynasty's influence over the press, and many of the ruling class not wanting their own words leaked to the world.  That's why the vast majority of Republican politicians and power players are reticent as well, because they don't want the same thing to happen to them.  Therefore, since the press are straight up propaganda outlets, none of them want you to see or hear anything on the matter, and try to keep the conversation in a narrow spectrum of scientifically tested talking points.

       Also, your assesment that Podesta-Delonge connetion is a "nothingburger" is pretty much bs, since the mere fact of exposure of those emails caused Delonge, as admitted by himself, to make rounds doing interviews about his project. Notably, on the Joe Rogan, where he comes off as completely oblivious to how he is being manipulated, while listing all the possible intelligence manipulation strategies.

       The age of the account suggests throwaways, so its easy to make bs claims.

       I think it's information overload. There's been so much insanity in the past couple years that some things that would have, in another time, been the story of the year-- just get overlooked. There was so much so fast.

       Because obviously the Russians are hacking into our reality. Our political candidates are corrupt not because we've allowed corporations unlimited ability to fund our elections. Not because we've sold control of our government to the highest bidder. No, it's because Russians.

       We aren't hearing more about it because the globalists are sweeping it all under the rug.  The United States citizens want these globalist swine to rot in prison, but the media is trying to stifle the outrage.

       I was replying to a comment that didn't mention the pictures, just that their house was decorated with "explicit images of child sex slaves" (not true) and that they were in Portugal at the time (no evidence/made up claim).

       That's true, but it doesn't really refute anything significant, and still is suspicious as f#ck.

       Who do you suggest be the one to call out shilling behavior or should?
       <br/>
       You're on a conspiracy sub and this guy clearly mentioned something relevant to the thread.  How can you insist there is nothing there unless you know more about the situation than the rest of us?   Give us at least the reason you personally believe there is nothing further on this particular topic.  Then you wouldn't come off as a shill.
