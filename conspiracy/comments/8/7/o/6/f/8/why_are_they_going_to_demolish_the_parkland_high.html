        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>clearly one possible (likely) reason is they don&#39;t want to leave evidence of what didn&#39;t happen there.</p>

<p>But what are the official reasons? &#39;Cuz if it&#39;s just to erect a memorial, that&#39;s pretty lame.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to start a petition demanding to have the building independently investigated, because it&#39;s very suspicious in light of all the anomalies.</p>

<p>It looks like they&#39;re trying to destroy evidence under the specious pretext of preventing students from being traumatized by entering the building.</p>

<p>Fine. Let it be independently investigated first. And BTW -- you can be certain, before any petition is made toward this end, that it will never happen. They&#39;re going to destroy the evidence -- just like they did on 9-11 with the countless tons of steel from the world trade towers, sent to China before it was tested for radioactivity and other evidence of government complicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  People don’t seem to grasp the horror of these events or the effects on local communities.  The event is bad enough but then The national media literally descends upon the community.  Over and over again, people are asked to tell the story.  They get stopped in the school line every morning by some reporter weeks after it happened, etc.  People DO want to move on and they want to not be reminded of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. So why don&#39;t they allow an independent investigation. And a former FBI agent is not independent.</p>

<p>It has to be by someone who is skeptical that a shooting occurred.</p>

<p>By someone familiar with all the false flags and who won&#39;t believe any of this without solid forensic evidence</p>

<p>by they, you are talking about probably 5 families that live near a building. </p>

<p>amwericans are such fucking pussies -- &quot;oh, i can&#39;t live near a school that had a mass shooting... i am too sensitive and take things too personally.  please tear the school down just for me and the 5 families in my area that might otherwise have to be reminded of this terrible day for ever.&quot;</p>

<p>we don&#39;t go around demlishing intersections every time someone dies in a headon collision.</p>

<p>... but let&#39;s face it:  this bullshit that IllHornet raises is BULLSHIT.  the only reason they demolish these crime scenes is to burry the evidence of pure shenanigans.</p>

<p>yup.  </p>

<p>ask yourself, what makes more sense:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>demlish a school because americans are too pussy to move on w/o more destruction;</p></li>
<li><p>demolish a school to bury evidence of shenanigans;</p></li>

<p>i call bullshit.  the simple fact is:  you have no idea why it was rebuilt.</p>

<p>if it really is all about Americans being pussies (emotional distress), why did they wait so long?  you say you middle school had shootings all the time.  so why didn&#39;t they rebuilt every time there was a shooting?  because 1 or 2 deaths from gunshots on the playground is not emotionally disturbing for an 8th grader -- send her/him out to the same playground the next day... no problem. </p>
