       Ss: go ahead, take any dozen un-related or semi-related questions posted to
       <a href="/r/askreddit">
        /r/askreddit
       </a>
       and ask
       <em>
        yourself: "how comprehensive of a profile can you build on me using this data and how many companies would pay to see and to augment that profile?"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see the unions and intersections of the implications of each question and how quite a bit can be determined about a redditor and by extension that redditor's IRL identity based on how they (naively) answer even a seemingly insignificant number of questions on that sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also see some accounts that post there:

      <p>
       • more or less

        only

      <p>
       • have usernames that share specific letters in close proximity to each other, like a marker.

       Do you not believe they can do pretty well by just looking at post history? Why a specific subreddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Good on you for drawing attention to the possibility though. But I'd be just as worried about the entire platform as opposed to a single subreddit.

       The thing is, your post history may not
       <em>
        reveal
       </em>
       the very specific thing
       <em>
        "they" want
       </em>
       to know about you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if they employ ten bots to ask these twenty specific questions all in a cascade of posts, set up so that if you answer any
       <em>
        two or three
       </em>
       of them they can
       <em>
        accurately guess or know fully well
       </em>
       that thing they
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to know, then they may consider that a worthwhile investment!

       there is no magical question that will reveal you, they NEED raw data about you and tree questions will not reveal much.
       <br/>
       and the thing is never what you want, is how to make you want something or, at least, when did you want something.

       Its also a good way to identify people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you give the same answer to similar questions across several subs or even other websites their analytics gain more data points to use for tracking and id'ing people of interest.

       Yep, that is the easiest way to use this voluntarily provided data. (As I mentioned, it can be used to gain information about your IRL identity.)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other ways to use the data like personality profile. Or if your reddit "anonymity" is already blown, it can be used by your employer to find out whether you maybe should be let go, that kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are so many unique ways to respond to these questions (which aren't even asked for any provided human reason or even in a normal "tone", just blurted out there like bait,) that even with two pr three answers you can match the reddit account with a public facebook or twitter. Or a conversation you had.

       I remember going to 4chan once a few years ago and there was a thread where everyone was just using people's answers to get into their various accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the questions were just like "if your hometown was your first name, and your streetname was your last name, what would your name be?" (Not really quite this obvious, but close)
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously this was used to get through security questions and such.

       You may be thinking of the "what would your pornstar name be?" (your pet's name plus your street name in the version I've always heard); it's been a trope even before the Internet and now we're seeing how it plays out online.

       They would do it for market research and finding out public opinions on various topics. You can't manipulate the masses very well if you don't know what they're thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this raises another, more interesting question. Surely those dataminers and market reseatch firms would invest in separating the shills/bots from the real users. Since the quality of any analysis is always dependent on the quality of the data (replies), it's likely that if you're a prolific poster who they deem a "real user", your opinions will be overrepresented in a user-submitted (unscientific) context. Perception is reality.

       This is what I think. Glad there is another post about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it goes like this;
      </p>
      <p>
       One day they may ask "What is your fav food" You'll go in, answer and continue your way. Later on, through other threads, you answer your age, sex, location, etc. all that gets profiled and you are none the wiser. Months and years go by, you forgot you even posted those things, you may have moved and told the big o reddit about it, now that gets profiled and updated in the big server base someone, somewhere has.

I don't even pretend either ... except sometimes ... because sometimes I want to fuck with their algorithms ... but I never pretend if it's important, because I wouldn't stoop that low ... except sometimes if it's important I will fuck with them ... because sometimes if it's important I want to protect my privacy ... and fuck with their algorithms ... sometimes ...

       Considering reddit is the 5th largest site and even allows AI to be plugged in to learn, you can only imagine the other things they are doing... You want to see something really fucked up, check out r/neoliberal's stickied discussion.  Check how often the new comments are, then check the top scored comment, now check the # of comments, and look at the vote count on the thread.... After digesting all of that, now read the comments.  That thread restarts every 12 hours or so.

       SubredditSimulator is fascinating in re: AI. :) I enjoy a well-worded submission then checking out the bot comments.
       <br/>
       I was on 4chan when bots went wild. They were able to extrapolate text from image files and got caught up in feedback loops within themselves. I think I actually "learn" more from 4chan than here, which is saying something.

       I feel like this isn't a thing. A majority of the answers are usually jokes or lies. If the bots were accessing more than just your answers when you posted, maybe, but as it stands now it wouldn't be a realistic way to get any reliable information that would be worth buying. "Oh User SloppyBobby when asked "What would you like to do before bed, Watch TV or Read?" answered "Bang OP's Mom". We need to sell this IMMEDIATELY!"

       A sarcastic or joke answer can still give a bit of insight into a person's personality and what they may be interested in consuming...or how they might react to getting set-up as a patsy, ymmv.

       I'm not sure I follow. If a user posts a bunch of random dumb jokes, and some serious answers, you're now having to invest time to finding the line. Does SloppyBobby really just want to band an OP's mom? Is he actually a branch manager of a major Bank? Did he really Ask Sally out in 5th grade and puke right after?
      </p>
      <p>
       From a business stand point it's just not worth the effort, it's not reliable information. You can't just put it all in a file and say "This is Bobby, this is what he wants and doesn't want, this is the key to him"
      </p>
      <p>
       A data analyst would have to go through the information for it be something people would pay for. If I was buying it and had a ton of useless information and a fraction of true answers, I wouldn't buy again. There are much better source.

       From a marketing standpoint maybe not worth the time, but maybe Sloppy Bobby just gave you a bunch of clues that he likes National Lampoon's Vacation type movies and prefers slapstick Old Spice commercials to the over dramatic Drakkar Noir type bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise I'd think just about any kind of answer would be useful to intelligence agencies who want to draw up a profile on someone and I think that is the real issue. The marketing partners sharing info thingy is a fucking distraction from the real issue that some of those marketing sharing ad partner companies are actually government fronts using this whole thing as a ploy to trample the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

       I think this is just people trying to put a back story behind something that has no back story. If it was a question like "What's better, Coke? Or Pepsi?" I could see that being used as market research. But the random bullshit questions that flood that area, it would not be logical to use it as a valid source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say you were targeting someone named Amanda. You know Amanda uses Reddit, but can't confirm who she is. You then sift through thousands upon thousands of users, checking answers that match know data on Amanda, then after MAYBE confirming which one is Amanda, you then unlock some information you didn't know?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is why a lot of people don't take conspiracy theories serious. There are so many theories that are just explanations, doesn't matter if the explanation makes sense, but it's there, so it's true. Why use a source that generally doesn't get serious answers, or gets overly exaggerated answers, as oppose to literally anything else? Those Facebook 50 question posts would hold more valid information and is actually a profile of the person. People draw these connections to the Government doing this and that, or are behind this and that, but have no proof, they make it up and use vague facts as validation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they aren't behind some things. But most theories these days are more like jaded rants by assholes because there is no meat behind the content, there is no diving deeper because someone just decided that this idea is a thing and it is a thing because you can't prove it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at real theories, the ones someone doesn't just dream up, ones that someone looked into and were convinced was true. Those are the real ones, and those are the ones people should be concerned about.

Look at the user profile's of the lusers who post there, especially their submit history or use an outside Reddit comment search and after five minutes you will conclude they are lonely, nerdy, bs-ers looking for karma since they cannot get validation in real life.

       They would do it for market research and finding out public opinions on various topics. You can't manipulate the masses very well if you don't know what they're thinking.

       But this raises another, more interesting question. Surely those dataminers and market reseatch firms would invest in separating the shills/bots from the real users. Since the quality of any analysis is always dependent on the quality of the data (replies), it's likely that if you're a prolific poster who they deem a "real user", your opinions will be overrepresented in a user-submitted (unscientific) context. Perception is reality.

       And you don't and if you think anyone can data mine creative writing ex-defaults like
       <a href="/r/askreddit">
        /r/askreddit
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/tifu">
        /r/tifu
       </a>
       , etc. Only isolated, naive idiots can think those are truthful subs. People's lives just aren't that interesting as the lies on those subs make them to be, especially so when we are talking about the lives of Redditors.

       You may be thinking of the "what would your pornstar name be?" (your pet's name plus your street name in the version I've always heard); it's been a trope even before the Internet and now we're seeing how it plays out online.
