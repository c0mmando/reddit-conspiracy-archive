<p>You can see the unions and intersections of the implications of each question and how quite a bit can be determined about a redditor and by extension that redditor&#39;s IRL identity based on how they (naively) answer even a seemingly insignificant number of questions on that sub.</p>

<p>I also see some accounts that post there:</p>

<p>• more or less <em>only</em> post there;</p>

<p>• have usernames that share specific letters in close proximity to each other, like a marker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, that is the easiest way to use this voluntarily provided data. (As I mentioned, it can be used to gain information about your IRL identity.)</p>

<p>There are other ways to use the data like personality profile. Or if your reddit &quot;anonymity&quot; is already blown, it can be used by your employer to find out whether you maybe should be let go, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>But there are so many unique ways to respond to these questions (which aren&#39;t even asked for any provided human reason or even in a normal &quot;tone&quot;, just blurted out there like bait,) that even with two pr three answers you can match the reddit account with a public facebook or twitter. Or a conversation you had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would do it for market research and finding out public opinions on various topics. You can&#39;t manipulate the masses very well if you don&#39;t know what they&#39;re thinking.</p>

<p>But this raises another, more interesting question. Surely those dataminers and market reseatch firms would invest in separating the shills/bots from the real users. Since the quality of any analysis is always dependent on the quality of the data (replies), it&#39;s likely that if you&#39;re a prolific poster who they deem a &quot;real user&quot;, your opinions will be overrepresented in a user-submitted (unscientific) context. Perception is reality.</p>

<p>And it goes like this;</p>

<p>One day they may ask &quot;What is your fav food&quot; You&#39;ll go in, answer and continue your way. Later on, through other threads, you answer your age, sex, location, etc. all that gets profiled and you are none the wiser. Months and years go by, you forgot you even posted those things, you may have moved and told the big o reddit about it, now that gets profiled and updated in the big server base someone, somewhere has.</p>

<p>From a business stand point it&#39;s just not worth the effort, it&#39;s not reliable information. You can&#39;t just put it all in a file and say &quot;This is Bobby, this is what he wants and doesn&#39;t want, this is the key to him&quot;</p>

<p>A data analyst would have to go through the information for it be something people would pay for. If I was buying it and had a ton of useless information and a fraction of true answers, I wouldn&#39;t buy again. There are much better source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is just people trying to put a back story behind something that has no back story. If it was a question like &quot;What&#39;s better, Coke? Or Pepsi?&quot; I could see that being used as market research. But the random bullshit questions that flood that area, it would not be logical to use it as a valid source. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you were targeting someone named Amanda. You know Amanda uses Reddit, but can&#39;t confirm who she is. You then sift through thousands upon thousands of users, checking answers that match know data on Amanda, then after MAYBE confirming which one is Amanda, you then unlock some information you didn&#39;t know? </p>

<p>I think this is why a lot of people don&#39;t take conspiracy theories serious. There are so many theories that are just explanations, doesn&#39;t matter if the explanation makes sense, but it&#39;s there, so it&#39;s true. Why use a source that generally doesn&#39;t get serious answers, or gets overly exaggerated answers, as oppose to literally anything else? Those Facebook 50 question posts would hold more valid information and is actually a profile of the person. People draw these connections to the Government doing this and that, or are behind this and that, but have no proof, they make it up and use vague facts as validation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they aren&#39;t behind some things. But most theories these days are more like jaded rants by assholes because there is no meat behind the content, there is no diving deeper because someone just decided that this idea is a thing and it is a thing because you can&#39;t prove it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at real theories, the ones someone doesn&#39;t just dream up, ones that someone looked into and were convinced was true. Those are the real ones, and those are the ones people should be concerned about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would do it for market research and finding out public opinions on various topics. You can&#39;t manipulate the masses very well if you don&#39;t know what they&#39;re thinking.</p>

<p>But this raises another, more interesting question. Surely those dataminers and market reseatch firms would invest in separating the shills/bots from the real users. Since the quality of any analysis is always dependent on the quality of the data (replies), it&#39;s likely that if you&#39;re a prolific poster who they deem a &quot;real user&quot;, your opinions will be overrepresented in a user-submitted (unscientific) context. Perception is reality.</p>
