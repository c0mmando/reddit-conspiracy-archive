<p>Clearly this organization played the same role as CA but for the CTR/Shareblue side.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also Peter Thiel&#39;s Palantir. This heavyweight data mining org collaborated with Cambridge Analytica apparently:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/palantir-worked-with-cambridge-analytica-on-the-facebook-data-whistleblower.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/palantir-worked-with-cambridge-analytica-on-the-facebook-data-whistleblower.html</a></p>

<p>This is all good to know and track - let&#39;s be conversant in order to keep sight of what we are up against on this forum - from both sides.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of those high school robotics contests where each team spends all semester making a goofy gadget that rolls, spins, and hammers, and then for the finale it goes in a little arena to fight it out with an equally goofy-looking opponent ... winner take all.</p>

According to their lead researcher&#39;s testimony, these deadwood accounts make up about 4% of all registered voters, so we&#39;re talking about more than 5 million voters on-demand.

<p>We don&#39;t, and we don&#39;t know that the DNC followed through with it, but there is evidence in the Podesta leaks that they were planning to in 2020, if not this past election.

I am familiar with other data analytics products that use voter registration data, such as NGP VAN&#39;s Votebuilder which is used by the DNC. Registration data is imported annually and then usable by campaigns for whatever purpose they desire. It would only be a matter of time before more powerful analysis tools like Catalist made it onto the scene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I continue to be fascinated by this &amp; keep coming back to comments in this thread to dip a little further into Catalist.  Hard to get my brain around all of it.  </p>

<p>Why does osu.edu have these documents? Are there articles on this trial? who won?  </p>

<p>are there links that specifically talk about them targeting deadwood voters? or which of your links would I dive into try again to understand more deeply on that, specifically?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I remember correctly it&#39;s the sworn testimony of Yair Ghitza that describes their ability to identify deadwood voters. He created their algorithms. I read it all almost two years ago, so it&#39;s possible that the interview is somewhere else on the Moritz Law school page. There are other Catalist files there for sure. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t specifically say that they are focusing on targeting deadwood accounts, only that they can identify them and distinguish them from verified active voters. </p>

<p>So we know that they had the ability to do this, we know that they had the motive to do this, and we know that during the primaries numerous cities suffered from registry purges, a majority of which were Sanders supporters. We also know that Eric Schmidt of Google was working with the campaign on something related to artificial intelligence, but that it probably wouldn&#39;t be ready til 2020 based on one of the few emails between Hillary and Podesta. The smoking gun that definitely proves that they did it eludes us currently, but regardless people need to understand that Catalist collects and sells US citizen data to corporations just like CA. And they also buy information from firms like CA. They are solely controlled by the Democrats, and they sell out their own regularly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neutron interactive based out of SLC is pretty sophisticated. They don&#39;t work in politics but they have very good 1-1 correlative databases. For a while they were hired to increase enrollment figures  for &quot;for profit university&quot;. They&#39;d even go as far as posting fake jobs on monster just to get people&#39;s numbers. If someone  will apply for a shitty enough job then maybe they&#39;ll apply to a school that promises them better career option.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Both organizations should be investigated.</p>

<p>I think that there is much more focus on CA because they were caught on tape talking about it along with admitting they were entrapping politicians with bribes and prostitutes.</p>

<p>Plus, they were lauded previously before this came out, about how good they were at social media manipulation.</p>

<p>They spoke at conferences about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are people still talking about CA as if it isn&#39;t a shell company? </p>

<p>Everyone is all like &quot;fuck yeah look at FB getting all the flack! We are winning&quot; nobody here and I do mean nobody is talking about the companies and the people behind these operations. Alll anybody here seems to care about is which side of the left right <strong>bold</strong> Bullshit <strong>bold</strong> they can be tied too. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, these shady companies continue to manage the stories that everyone is talking about and no one seems to give to fucks about the mass manipulation of populations around the globe, fucking psyche profiles and the distortion of reality that is presented to targeted demographics and individuals. They nurtured and sparked off civil disturbance in Nigeria to further their agenda.</p>

<p>All we will see from this is CA taking a bath, which they don&#39;t give two shits about because it&#39;s a fucking shell company and FB gets a bloody nose, everyone thinks they have won some sort of victory when exactly the same thing is continuing across the globe unnoticed or cared about.</p>

<p>And I stand by the statement of, who in their right mind thought Facebook respected their privacy? If you respect your own privacy, then rule #1, don&#39;t use services like Facebook. How is that wrong to point out? Do I think it&#39;s right that they do it? No, of course not. But are they any different from literally every other company on the internet?
