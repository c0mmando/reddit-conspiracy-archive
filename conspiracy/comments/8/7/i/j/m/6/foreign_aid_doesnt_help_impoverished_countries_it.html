       <strong>
        The answer to poverty, Freedom
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2018 Index of Economic Freedom, an annual study that ranks 180 countries for their economic freedom using hard data, has now been published by The Heritage Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The results, when combined with poverty data from the World Bank, show that inhabitants of countries who enjoy high levels of economic freedom are far less likely to suffer from abject poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       In countries that rank in the top fifth, less than 1 percent of the population (on average) subsists on $1.90 per day or less. Meanwhile, in countries that rank in the bottom fifth, an average 27 percent of the population subsists on $1.90 per day.
      </p>
      <p>
       This bottom tier is represented by economic freedom-repressed countries like Togo, Chad, and Niger. In Togo, roughly 50 percent of the population lives on $1.90 a day or less. In Chad, according to the latest data, the portion of the population living on $1.90 a day is 38.4 percent. In Niger, it is 45.5 percent, as of 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Strongmen who disregard property rights or the rule of law to remain in power have been rewarded with billions of dollars in foreign aid from rich countries for decades. Despots and dictators have often used this aid to solidify their grips on power, such as by withholding food aid from groups that do not support them.
      </p>
      <p>
       These strongmen and dictators often take credit for bringing foreign aid to their countries while depriving their countryâ€™s people of the economic freedom they would need to end the dependence on foreign aid.

       The true answer to poverty in some cases would ultimately be eugenics.  We have tried teaching them, metaphorically, how to fish but they are incapable of learning.  Supporting them with handouts allows them to procreate without any regard for the ramifications which increases the future poverty logarithmically which will ultimately just require more and larger handouts.  It is nothing but a feel-good solution that does far more harm than good.

       Eugenics has been the doctrine of nazism since day 1. Your contention was no evidence was provided yet do you have any for that initial statement? I MEAN HOW CAN YOU ESPOUSE EUGENICS AND NO BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF ITS HISTORY.

       im not the same person - i saw your replies and felt the same frustration at your absurd reply but ok i'll bite:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nazi eugenics (German: Nationalsozialistische Rassenhygiene, "National Socialist racial hygiene") were Nazi Germany's racially based social policies that placed the biological improvement of the Aryan race or Germanic "Ãœbermenschen" master race through eugenics at the center of Nazi ideology.[1] In Germany, eugenics were mostly known under the synonymous term racial hygiene. Following the Second World War, both terms effectively vanished and were replaced by Humangenetik (human genetics).
       </p>
       <p>
        Eugenics research in Germany before and during the Nazi period was similar to that in the United States (particularly California), by which it had been partly inspired. However, its prominence rose sharply under Adolf Hitler's leadership when wealthy Nazi supporters started heavily investing in it. The programs were subsequently shaped to complement Nazi racial policies.[2]

        Those humans targeted for destruction under Nazi eugenics policies were largely living in private and state-operated institutions, identified as "life unworthy of life" (German: Lebensunwertes Leben), including prisoners, "degenerates", dissidents, people with congenital cognitive and physical disabilities (including people who were "feebleminded", epileptic, schizophrenic, manic-depressive, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, deaf, blind) (German: erbkranken), homosexual, idle, insane, and the weak, for elimination from the chain of heredity. More than 400,000 people were sterilized against their will, while more than 70,000 were killed under Action T4, a euthanasia program.[3][4][5][6] In June 1935, Hitler and his cabinet made a list of seven new decrees, number 5 was to speed up the investigations of sterilization.[7]

       Morally, I don't object the concept of eugenics, just a small tip to avoid looking like a total dumbass on the internet.

       I'm sorry for my aggressive reply (regardless if you were offended or not) There are some things that I would like to share:

       one reason for my aggressive reply was your response-
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of asking for evidence, why not ask why would it be bad even if it was espoused by hitler/nazis as well?

       additional talking points:

      <p>
       UN-Lucis Trust-Nazi connection:
      </p>
      <p>
       Removing the conspiracy element, its interesting that the United Nations adhere to similar ideas from hitler's mein kampf- which includes a one world government and a eugenically cleansed society.
You could say that its basically the guiding principle for their vision of a unified world. On that end, you can say that you arrived at the same conclusion as hitler and other students of the same esoteric school of thought(theosophy) which is ascribed to by the players in our world government.

       Some african tribes purposely ruin the projects and

       When I first learned about the 1950s mass sterilization program in Puerto Rico (a form of eugenics), I was horrified.  But as time passed, I began to see that it was a fairly moral way of solving the problem.  Itâ€™s not always about Nazis and big government.

       Ohhh, do you guys think that what the Nazis did was actual eugenics?
      </p>
      <p>
       First and foremost: true eugenics
       <strong>
        does not involve death or forced breeding
       </strong>
       . It is for the objective benefit of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       humans, and murder and forced reproduction are incompatible with this standard. What the Nazis did was an amoral perversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       A properly and
       <em>
        ethically
       </em>
       implemented eugenics program would involve voluntary, incentivized sterilization for people with issues like low IQ and heritable disease, coupled with voluntary, incentivized reproduction (or sperm/egg donation) from people with desirable traits like high IQ or other heritable advantages. The benefits would take many generations to see full fruition, but that's considered just fine, because it's for the benefit of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       mankind, not just the current generations.

       I understand the concept of eugenics. I thank you for explaining it to our wider audience with a calm, educative tone though. Good conversation is sometimes hard to come by on the internet because people get all mad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just bringing to light what I thought was going on with dude, you say EUGENICS, boom people think Nazi Death Camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazi work on Genetics was a double edge sword. It was groundbreaking, important, and beneficial on the whole. Conversely, people freak right the fuck out when you delve into certain areas, and it's got a very dark period.
      </p>

       It made eugenics a dirty word.

       Accountability, transparency, tax policy, trade based on mutual profit (not exploitation backed by military and economic pressure), laws that  are not enforced or have been written to legalize graft (give justice dept. lawyers a percentage of the settlements on the cases they win), holding corporate boards personally responsible for the actions of the companies, maybe killing the rich to serve as an example for those who don't know how to play fair in our society (just kidding on that one, but it's kind of there with eugenics).

       That's wonderful.  To which specific countries are you referring?  The ones to which I am consist of "people" whose average IQ is 60.  None of what you've stated will help them become self-sustaining, productive first world civilizations.  So, exactly which countries we're you referring to and then what would you do for the ones that I am?

       I'm not sure where you get your IQ statistics. I think what you might mean to say is that they are uneducated. That is an easy fix. Instead of massively expensive infrastructure projects that benefit business (and are built on debt, which can't be repaid except by selling off profitable resources at a fraction of there value). Countries build schools, and negotiate trade relationships for the real cost of their goods. Corruption in South and Central America are backed by military and economic power projected by the first world. There is no implicit reason for these countries to be impoverished other than exploitation by wealthy nations and international corporations (which have the backing of first world economic and military power). Well, I guess we can have a start at the America's before moving to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia/Pacific. The reasons for poverty in the third world are fairly elementary to understand. The solutions are equally simple; the reduction of interference by the US empire and it's European allies. Cuba is a fine example of a country that would do quiet well with out a boycott by the US and pressures to block trade/aid from other countries. Easily seen in the Monroe Doctrine (which I assume has been strengthened over the years).  As for some of your other points, basic medical care and family planning would go a long way before eugenics. We could certainly start with the undesirable populations in the US.

       No, it is literally 60 in sub-Saharan Africa and I can provide proof if you're genuinely interested.  Is it that outrageous of a fact as to make it that hard for you to accept?  If so, why?

       If you have a link to IQ and Sub-Saharan Africa I'd read it, but don't go to much trouble. I can google it. From what I have read, IQ is typically spread fairly evenly across race and culture. Certain factors do influence it such as malnutrition.

       I was just trying to answer your questions and assertions, but I agree we would make little progress. We often get our information from different sources, so there can be a wide gap in point of view. Thanks for being civil.

       No offense intended, but you could not be more incorrect on the subject.  Ashkenazi jews fall around 115ish on the bell curve.  Asians around 105-110 depending on the country.  Whites are slightly above 100.  Hispanic/Latins fall in around 90.  US blacks at 85.  Subsaharans literally around 60.  There is a wealth of research out there that confirms all of this and I have studied it myself relatively in-depth.

       Just suppose that I am correct and accurate.  Why do you suppose you have been lead to believe what is quite contrary?

       I have lead to believe the contrary by reading of scientific research filtered through popular science magazines (Science, Scientific American) and academic study of psychology and special education. I have read articles on IQ distribution across populations as well as the criticism of such studies. I don't find the area to be well studied and sample sizes tend to be small. As for Sub-Saharan Africa, my first two articles (from Google) placed the IQ at 80. One did offer reasons for bias and factors like malnutrition. I am familiar with studies that support your point of view. I have not come across a "wealth" of information supporting your convictions. I am not convinced of there accuracy when other factors are considered. As I said, sources of information tends to bias ones point of view. As much as wikipedia is disregarded as a source of information, a quick read of Race and IQ touches on several of the studies and factors.

      <p>
       Socialist ideals, taken to their logic conclusion, ultimately result in eugenics and gulags.

       I firmly believe that you are correct; in order for socialism to truly work a society would need to be strictly homogeneous in physical, mental, and spiritual arenas.  People always love to point at Scandinavian socialism as proof that it is the ideal governance for everywhere.   They are ignoring much about the characteristics and/or holding completely fabricated assumptions with no basis in reality.

       You just posted one of the biggest debates in political science in 2 alineas. It is indeed a very interesting question how to use money for developing the third world. The problem many identify is an inherant cost of liberalism. Governments invest in a country's economy, they invest in people with ideas. The irony of liberal politicians and institutions such as the UN that have many times attacked the principle of trickle-down economics, yet basically making trickle-down the core of their use of investments, is unfortunately lost on many.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the 90's onward, mostly post-kolonialist and post-marxist researchers started questioning this line of development, as they saw that too little is being done to stop actual and very real poverty. What good do macro-economic numbers mean to a country if the big majority of the people is living in hunger and dies from the most basic of diseases? Ofcourse there is also the problem of dictators raking in the money themselves, this problem has in my opinion slightly been overblown. But it is a real problem and should in no way be ignored. The problem with development is that it is and will mostly always be rooted in a liberal nation-state reality, so it is really hard to circumvent these dictators, this however does not mean that we should stop trying.

       I thought trickle-down economics is making investments into private corporations that will provide support to current and future employers/customers; not provide investments in the central government(s).

       This is a good question. I should specify more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that is often used in third-world countries (exceptions such as micro-credits do exist), is that by directly dealing with poverty, you don't help a country become self-dependant. So instead of investing in people, they invest in companies to help a countries' macro-economy. The idea is ofcourse that this will create more jobs, and once you get a job, you get a good life. Except that's not what happend in countries such as India or on the continent of Africa. What happend is that a few people got rich, and the rest is still piss-poor.

       You're a smart person with a good heart, this is obvious. Nature however doesn't care about our feelings. It only wants to thrive, Life wants to find a way, sometimes that way is ugly. Human societies are an extention of nature, to think otherwise is a mistake.

       That doesn't mean we can't be charitable, far from it. It just means if the roles were reversed,  (We sucked at war) we'd be the ones starving to death.

       It's a little more complicated than just saying they sucked at war, though. It all comes down to resources and (natural civil) development - most of the countries we give aid to, we've never been at war with. We've just pillaged them and colonized them and enslaved them and propped up dictators who kill them.

       This has been tried repeatedly, it's not been successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       One case had the UN sending U.S. farmers to educate sub-saharan african farmers about Modern Western Farming Techniques. They accused the US farmers of witchcraft and being wizards, and completely rejected the teachings.

       It......doesn't always work out like that, But it's not working very well.

       Canâ€™t hurt to try and canâ€™t cost more than the millions and millions in food aid everyone sends. If they can make 1 person provide for 5 and they can sustain that then progress can be made over time.

       Absolutely, education is never a bad choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it helps shift the culture slightly to accept new, more efficent ways of doing things, then I agree. Go nuts.

       Ten billion people kill the planet, popcontrol is in high gear and has been for the past few generations.  They're working to destroy the rural world while cramming more and more people into tight places with no rights.  All part of the plan :-)

       Foreign aid is mostly military aid. It takes the form of planes made by Boeing and missiles made by Ratheyon. The money is stolen from the taxpayers and is given to the stockholders of defense companies. If the receiver country has a war, they will buy replacement parts or planes because they are used to the US equipment. More money for the 1%. The strongmen overseas use the equipment to insure they can steal from their country. When they retire, they run to the US generally.

       Problem with this line of thought is, Today in the United States, The Richest Country in the World, Freedom out the ass......a Homeless child starved to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tomorrow another homeless child will starve to death. At LEAST 1. The day after, another.

       I've found that most of the obstacles in the way of achieving a socialist utopia are personality traits and components of human nature that would need to be eradicated or controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialist ideals, taken to their logic conclusion, ultimately result in eugenics and gulags.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it wouldmy surprise me that a proponent of eugenics would mean heavily socialist, politically.
