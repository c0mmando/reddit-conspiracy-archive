So what is exactly changing besides maybe the location? America has been at war, we are already &quot;geared up&quot; for it. It is literally the function of this nation to prepare and engage in war on the global stage. Why do you think 75% of our budget is dumped into military spending?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure he was referring to Presidents&#39; borrowing from Social Security and not paying it back making the system no longer self sustaining. </p>

<p>Basically what happened (for those that won&#39;t read the article I linked) was that Social Security ran at a surplus so the government took the excess funds and replaced it with bonds. These bonds state that the money will be repaid at a future date, with the earliest of these being due in 2020. This has been happening since 1935 and people only noticed when Bush 2 used it to help fund tax cuts and war. Social Security has not run at a surplus since 2010.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The borrowing did not make the program stop being self sufficient. 
And what are you basing the claim, &quot;not in surplus since 2010,&quot; and is that based on the debt and do you think it should just be stopped and the retirees left to starve? Because the MIC wants the money and are fine with the retirees to starve at home while they go kill people somewhere else on behalf of the tax dodging billionaires?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My post was apparently unclear. I was merely trying to point out what the previous poster was referring to in their comment and showing how this didn&#39;t make Social Security into anything that it wasn&#39;t already. </p>

<p>All information came from the 2 linked articles, one of which is the official statement of cash flows for the Social Security Trust Fund (where &quot;Social Security&quot; keeps their money; I used this one the most and would advise reading). The other was a politifact article that, when cross referenced on key points with the official filings, seemed to be an accurate and concise statement of the issue previously mentioned. </p>

<p>It is not running at a surplus, that is simply a fact that is stated in both articles (2 paragraphs above chart 2 in the Cash Flows sheet). It was clearly stated by the Social Security Cash Flows to have been scheduled to stop running at a surplus in 2016, but stopped early thanks to the recession. That also does not mean that it is not self sufficient, just that it isn&#39;t doing more than it needs to.</p>

<p>The Social Security Trust Fund was designed to allow surpluses to be used immediately by the government to allow them to repay the money into the trust fund when it is needed. This lets governments make the most of the tax money in a time value of money sense and make the money you spent on taxes potentially generate more revenue to put into programs instead of having a large static pool of money. The principle is sound, however the execution of this principle has been severely lacking (Bush&#39;s wars, for instance were a pretty terrible investment) as I think we can both agree. </p>

People think of it in terms of trillions of dollars, or 6k lives lost...no one even considers what the American people would do with another Korea...60k lives lost in 3 years...vs 6k in 14...or Vietnam, which lost similar numbers in about twice the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ the guy being interviewed in that clip is a fucking tool. The extra sketchy thing with places like Fallujah too is people wonder why are service members died there only to let it be taken over by Isis later on? Because that place is fucking polluted like Fukishima now due to all the depleted uranium munitions used. We didn&#39;t want to send our guys back in to retake it because we didn&#39;t want them getting contaminated, we figured we&#39;d let Isis absorb some of that garbage for awhile. Years later they have kids being born there with three heads and shit like you see in a Toxic Avenger movie.</p>

<p>Regarding the civilian casualties in Iraq and the big million number. Even if it was half that, even if it was a quarter, holy shit that&#39;s a lot of civilians for such a small country. I&#39;ve heard it said that a lot of that is due to sectarian violence. Probably, but as much of a monster as Saddam was, he had a comparitively tight lid on terrorism and groups like Al quaeda we&#39;re not his allies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;But we haven&#39;t seen total war since WW2.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to jump down your throat with arguments over semantics but I think you are wrong. Korea, Vietnam, Iraq part 1 &amp; 2 and Afghanistan can certainly be considered &quot;total war&quot;. Maybe you meant to say total world war? Even still, an argument could be made that Korea and Vietnam might be considered different fronts of the same Cold War against the spread of communism. Iraq and Afghanistan can certainly be considered different front of the War on Terror. This current war on terror could damn near be considered World War 3 depending on the facts about what is really going on in other places inAfrica and the middle East like Somalia and Yemen and what is really going on in Western Europe and their terrorist attacks/bombings (Which reminds me that the air war we fought over Eastern Europe in the 90&#39;s (?) is maybe the least talked about war front in recent memory.) Also need to take into account all the big brother shit that has gone down here in the U.S. and globally as far as a massive global surveillance apparatus being developed and put in place on both friendly citizens and enemies of the state.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think people really understand the cost of war nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe. Seems nice little vague and sterityoy to me. I think only most naive don&#39;t get it. Iraq and Afghanistan garnered the largest anti-war protests in history if I&#39;m not mistaken. Seems like a long time ago, but I don&#39;t think it really was. The Air Force drone program is losing pilots at a rapid pace. People are well aware of the high rate of veteran suicide as well as the option epidemic and it&#39;s ties to Afghanistan. Wiki leaks sure woke some people up. People understand, they&#39;re just to appathetic and busy with regular lives to really have any time to commit to doing anything about it. Not that I blame them. Much of that apathy and distraction is by design anyhow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a binary option. It&#39;s a spectrum that can be worse or better. That is just the truth. Starting conflict with Iran will increase the amount of war we wage and take it to a whole other level than we are at right now.  The only right thing to do is to lower the spectrum and decrease the amount of war we wage.  Adding to it by entering into a new conflict doesn&#39;t mean nothing changes because we were alreday at war. I think this is obvious but needs to be said  </p>
