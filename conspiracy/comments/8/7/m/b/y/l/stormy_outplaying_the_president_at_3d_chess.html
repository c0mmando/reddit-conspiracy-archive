        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems the 60 Minutes interview was full of traps and the president took the bait. First trap was her saying she was not attracted to the president. Today we&#39;re hearing rumors that the present said, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547739/Trump-told-close-Stormy-Daniels-not-type-woman-finds-attractive.html">&quot;She was not his type&quot;</a>, completely undercutting the official WH statements on the affair.</p>

<p>But it gets better. After the 60 Minutes interview, Cohen filed a defamation lawsuit against Stormy. Today, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-stormy-daniels-sue-porn-star-defamation-lawyer-affair-a8275131.html">She counter sued Cohen with defamation charges.</a> <strong>This new count of defamation falls outside of the original NDA.</strong> And the underlying facts in this case? ...wait for it... whether or not Stormy had an affair with Trump, all <strong>outside of any NDA</strong>. Clever move Stormy.</p>

<p><a href="https://thinkprogress.org/stormy-daniels-trump-threatened-to-kill-eaced2d7c79e/">Despite death threats</a> and NDAs, the public may yet learn the truth behind this conspiracy.</p>

<p>Ya know, I&#39;m not a Trump supporter. I want to focus criticism on his foreign and domestic policy, and his oligarchic cabinet picks, while maintaining my hardcore line against the Corporatists in the DNC. But this shit? This is pathetic, and not worth anyone&#39;s time. Don&#39;t feed the beast, just ignore this porn star and the MSM hype. Holy fuck people are so easily distracted...</p>

<p>Defending the little guy from TPTB is exactly what many of us come her for.</p>

<p>The other important issue is the NDA. Unlike appointed officials, elected officials don&#39;t have to pass security screening. <strong>That&#39;s our job</strong> as an informed electorate. These NDAs if legal, could prevent us from learning about Kompromat. </p>

<p>Think about this. You know that safe picture that was tweeted? If those are sex tapes, you want them using that to control our president? </p>

<p>This is very irrational, but I&#39;ll give you a pass since you seem like a cool person. I know what you mean, but there&#39;s no reason for that statement to be true other than you wish it was. Please tell me why I a wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because she doesn’t have any evidence. Because she’s already admitted to lying 3 times. Once when she signed the NDA and twice more when she signed those follow up statements denying the affair.</p>

<p>She also violated the NDA, a legally binding agreement, by talking to the press on numerous occasions and failing to turn over any and all text messages, videos, etc.</p>

<p>She is a liar and liars need to provide solid evidence or else I don’t believe them.</p>

<p>She was in a parking lot in Las Vegas outside of her fitness class so there should be some video. Where is it? Why did she just go to her fitness class instead of filing a police report?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know if you watched the Anderson Cooper interview but she said she was doing the interview because people are calling her a liar and Cooper said, “but you did lie. You signed two statements that said you did not have an affair with Trump. Did you have an affair with Donald Trump?” She said yes.</p>

<p>Either way, she lied.</p>

<p>I believe she did have an affair and that she signed the NDA and accepted the $130k to keep quiet about it.</p>

<p>I don’t believe her story about someone threatening her in the parking lot. There’s no proof that it happened except her lying words.</p>

<p>I don’t believe any of Trump’s attorneys physically threatened her to sign those two statements as she tried to allege. I think they threatened to sue her ass if she violates the NDA.</p>

<p>Everything else in her story including spanking Trump with the magazine has about as much proof as the alleged pee pee story.</p>

She didn&#39;t bother to report the death threat to her child to the police, so maybe child services should be called retroactively. Maybe she should have skipped her gym class and taken action to protect her child. Most parents would. But not this beacon of motherhood. So ya, she fucks for money (not judging her just stating facts) she doesn&#39;t bother reporting death threats to her child, in fact says it didn&#39;t even bother her a the time.

    <div class="md"><p>It’s more likely the disk has proof of the parking lot encounter, where threats were purportedly made to her, and that they know who it was. There is no other reason for her to bring up those details in that manner. “I could with out a doubt 100% identify this person if I saw them again.” And that’s the crime imo. She admits right off the bat she wasn’t a victim in the sex part. She didn’t go out if her way to drudge up salacious sex stuff. It’s a volley to the threats on behalf of Trump. In that since she is a victim, apparently? Which also explains why she wouldn’t talk about it. </p>

<p>From what I can tell no one is claiming the disk contains evidence of that encounter. It&#39;s said to contain proof of a sexual relationship. Where do you get the idea the disk has something to do with this man she claims threatened her. Where? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair things have changed drastically since the Lewinsky scandal. The Lewinsky scandal was so embarrassing that allegedly Bill Clinton bombed the middle east as a distraction. There was even a Hollywood movie loosely based on this theory. Where as many people in this sub believe that the scandal with Trump is a distraction from more important and/or relevant concerns to the average media consumer. Your comparison also doesn&#39;t take into account that Bill Clinton committed his transgressions in the oval office, not a decade prior. It also doesn&#39;t take into account that while people are making a big deal now about Trump&#39;s team trying to squash this, I don&#39;t remember much at all being made of Hillary&#39;s attempts to squash the fallout from Bill&#39;s ongoing affairs.</p>

<p>To be clear, this scandal is important and hopefully the truth will be transparent by the end of it so as to get her shed light on Trump and his teams true character or conversely the lengths to which some people will go to try and take him down. Either way a more knowledgeable public is a good thing. That said, I&#39;m not holding my breath for anything more than this turning out to be one big murky shit show of a distraction while a host of other problems that are much more important to the average citizen go essentially unnoticed behind our backs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also one more device to cause divisiness amongst our nation. Not that it&#39;s not a genuine concern for a lot of people, but it certainly isn&#39;t nearly as much of a concern to tptb that disingenuously act as outraged as some us while feeding us the info.</p>

<p>I guess you missed the part where one of his thugs made a death threat? And funny how your story ends before the illegal campaign contribution. There&#39;s a lot to see here if you are not blinded by tribalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big issue, that whoever is backing her is counting on making stick, is the supposed interpretation of the hush money being considered an illegal/unreported campaign contribution given the timeframe of the NDA.  No issues about morality, nor the threats, as this would be dismissed as hearsay, unless she happens to have a recording of that.</p>

<p>So if the contribution issue is founded, what would be the worst that can happen? His candidacy gets thrown out due that technicality and he&#39;s impeached? I doubt it. </p>

<p>I hope everyone rending their garments about <em>the poor woman getting threatened</em> remember her in a few months as elections pass and her and all the other <em>useful characters</em> that are 24/7 on the news right now are discarded by media. She, in particular, will be in deep waters if a judge considers her breaching of the NDA merits the penalties already mentioned... wonder if her current backers will help her then with the fines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s more likely the disk has proof of the parking lot encounter, where threats were purportedly made to her, and that they know who it was. There is no other reason for her to bring up those details in that manner. “I could with out a doubt 100% identify this person if I saw them again.” And that’s the crime imo. She admits right off the bat she wasn’t a victim in the sex part. She didn’t go out if her way to drudge up salacious sex stuff. It’s a volley to the threats on behalf of Trump. In that since she is a victim, apparently? Which also explains why she wouldn’t talk about it. </p>
