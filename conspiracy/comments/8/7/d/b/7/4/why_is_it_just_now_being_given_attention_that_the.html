    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s asking you why this wasn&#39;t a big deal then, but is now.<br/>
Why is this only now deemed valuable coverage?<br/>
Virtually every &quot;Cop guns down citizen&quot; story we&#39;ve seen in the past 2 years have all been covered ad nauseum before the trial.  Why is this only being barely covered 2 years after the fact?<br/>
And no, this wasn&#39;t reported on.  When you follow stories you can tell when another detail is shoehorned in.  Also where are your comments from back then announcing your outrage?<br/>
It seems so strange that you want this guy to feel &#39;stupid&#39; for not seeing the reporting that absolutely wasn&#39;t covered in the msm.<br/>
Why would you do that?</p>

It was widely reported that Mateen&#39;s father talked to the FBI about him. I don&#39;t think he was being called a CI then which also gives the story a new sexy spin.</p>
