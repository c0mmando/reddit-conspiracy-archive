       Yea, but if you look at the MSM news they report on many things that are not yet in trial.  They report on much more speculation, but for some reason this one wasn't worth it to them?

       It was reported on back then. That's how we know about it. It's being reported on again because the trial makes it relevant again.

       He's asking you why this wasn't a big deal then, but is now.
       <br/>
       Why is this only now deemed valuable coverage?
       <br/>
       Virtually every "Cop guns down citizen" story we've seen in the past 2 years have all been covered ad nauseum before the trial.  Why is this only being barely covered 2 years after the fact?
       <br/>
       And no, this wasn't reported on.  When you follow stories you can tell when another detail is shoehorned in.  Also where are your comments from back then announcing your outrage?
       <br/>
       It seems so strange that you want this guy to feel 'stupid' for not seeing the reporting that absolutely wasn't covered in the msm.
       <br/>
       Why would you do that?

       We are discussing a story. If being told different information makes you feel stupid that's your own issue. It was widely reported that Mateen's father talked to the FBI about him. I don't think he was being called a CI then which also gives the story a new sexy spin.

       Or some other alphabet agency wants it to look that way.  If there really are still patriotic "rank and file" FBI agents trying to do some semblance of the right thing, it wouldn't surprise me at all if that is causing internecine strife with another alphabet.
