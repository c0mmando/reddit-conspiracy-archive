        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s an underbuild theory thus far but; Diplomats are being kicked out of at least 21 countries, of which are 16 European Union states, the UK, which blames Russia for poisoning. This will probably heat up and Russia will respond in a strong manner, and if not an Allie of Russia might. </p>

<p>Just because it wasn&#39;t a successful murder, it was followed by a direct clams by the UK, that claims that the Russian state (the Kremlin), that ordered and provided the poison.</p>

<p>Theresa May has given The Kremlin and ultimatum; to explain how a former spy was poisoned in Salisbury, otherwise she will conclude it was an “unlawful use of force” by the Russian state against the UK.</p>

<p>This is similar to when  Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states. 
I want to hear your thoughts, and I hope to be wrong in my assumption, but I can&#39;t help to see similarities.
Edit: spacing and spelling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would Russia attempt assassination on a double agent who had been released in a prisoner swap 10 years earlier? He would be no use to anyone. He would have no capable info on either side because he can&#39;t be trusted by either side. UK have presented no evidence. Only hearsay and speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The kingdom of Serbia didn&#39;t have anything to gain from assignation of the Duke, and it wasn&#39;t ordered by Serbian leaders, but done by Serbian separatist. Similar I do not think Russia Statr ordered it, but it is the UK&#39;s claims that The Kremlin ordering it, that has me thinking that Russian separatist could likely be behind this poisoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great minds think alike &amp; so do ours apparently! Maybe I arrived at a similar thought though simply because I listened to Dan Carlin’s hardcore history, the episode on the start of WW1 and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand just last week.</p>

<p>However the withdrawal of all of these ambassadors is concerning me and yes I also thought the giving of an ‘ultimatum’ sounded eerily similar to the pre-WW1 situation.</p>

<p>However, killing an ex-spy shouldn’t equate to killing an heir to the throne, should it? Surely not! I hope not!</p>

<p>The Russian ambassadors being kicked out of so many countries now and I believe I even saw that Iceland was saying they were going to boycott the World Cup seems like a massive overreaction though. Just the UK doing so I would understand but what is pushing this so hard? Perhaps there is an attempt to block any power Russia has in the UN? Perhaps to push some action against Syria or Iran?</p>

<p>It’s a lose lose for Russia, if they did do it and admitted it they would be sanctioned or ambassadors would be sent home or their vote in UN matters stripped from them, if they didn’t do it, all the same things!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With this comment you filled the caps I didn&#39;t include, so yes, we do think alike. I will keep reading up on the pre-war situation, to see if I can&#39;t find any more red lines between these incidents.

    <div class="md"><p>With all this East vs West stuff going on (Putin, petroyuan, etc.), it is good to be reminded that Putin was put in power by Yeltsin, an avowed puppet. Also the Russian central bank is <a href="https://www.bis.org/country/ru.htm">part</a> of the BIS, Kissinger is Putin&#39;s <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/henry-kissinger-a-longtime-vladimir-putin-confidant-sidles-up-to-donald-trump/">confidant</a>, and Wall Street banks are <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8375128/Wall-Street-bankers-hired-by-Moscow-to-help-it-become-financial-centre.html">advising</a> the Kremlin. </p>

<p>Putin’s masters are the <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/putins-rabbi-says-challenging-governments-is-not-jewish/">same ones</a> as Trump’s.</p>

<p>About the Soviet Union specifically, see <a href="https://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Sutton_Wall_Street_and_the_bolshevik_revolution-5.pdf">this book</a> (full book PDF), <em>Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution</em>, by Anthony Sutton. </p>

<p>About China, Mao Zedong was put in power by American secret societies at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale-China_Association">Yale</a>. <a href="http://jewishjournal.com/news/world/179731/">See this</a>.</p>

<p>So in summary what we’re about to see is a “shift”, the USA is being sacrificed / flushed down the toilet - as it is an obstacle to the new order. The exoteric “base” is being moved to China, but the esoteric one stays the same; indeed power is not changing hands.</p>

<p>This ^ will be a <em>very</em> unpopular (criminal?) opinion during the war, if indeed a war is planned to “celebrate” (consecrate) the shift. </p>
