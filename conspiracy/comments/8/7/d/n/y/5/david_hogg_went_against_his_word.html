       What the hell is he referring to in this quote? He specifically says (from the article) that he heard about the shooting and went to the school to video because this “couldn’t be another school shooting”. Did he forget that he was supposed to be at the school during the shooting and trapped in a closet getting interviews from scared classmates? Also, why wasn’t he in school that day if this quote stands true? Can anyone dig up footage of him on tape actually saying this? Or at least another quote saying the same thing? This could get
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       interesting....

       Consider how long the surveillance vids from LV took. It seems there are foot dragging know-nothings remaining in critical bureaucratic offices; they are stymie ing proper broadcasting of the ridiculous plotholes in these intl updating stories. Did you see the supposed numbers in DC on Saturday? Supposedly 22 (master #) million pinheads watched skanky Daniels last night? They apparently don't care that they are among hordes of zombies following nonsense...non-news

       He's recounting the event of him riding his bike towards the school. He did it once in February, and again in this newest interview. Just because he doesn't say 6PM in the new interview doesn't mean he didn't ride his bike at 6PM.

       Seems it's implied through context on a different interview that he returns in the evening after the shooting, as opposed to breaking in while the shooting is occurring.

       E,cept in the interview which is linked in several comments on this thread he NEVER said at 6pm after the shooting. He said "on the day of the shooting."

       But are we not referring to the same action of him biking somewhere, that's the issue I have at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it would still be on the day of the shooting if he had taken his bike at 6pm to where the media were apparently posted.

       He never said 6pm, this is an example of revisionist journalism.

       The CBS interview has the quote everyone is pushing, but it lacks some sense of context in relation to time. Most other interviews relating to this add the context of time for the bike ride part that proves he wasn't there, that is what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second interview/article states it was evening too:
       <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/on-the-ground-with-parkland-teens-as-they-plot-a-revolution.html">
        http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/on-the-ground-with-parkland-teens-as-they-plot-a-revolution.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If he had said "I was at home the whole day and went to school in the evening", that would be a more plausible smoking gun. But without the time frame of when he left home on the original quote, wouldn't hold much water in regards to saying "he definitely wasn't at school".
