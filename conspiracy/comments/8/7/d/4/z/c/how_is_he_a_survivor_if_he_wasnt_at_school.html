        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>David Hogg, poster boy of the Parkland Shooting, claiming to be a survivor... but he wasn&#39;t at school the day of the shooting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-our-lives-39-days-how-parkland-students-turned-grief-into-action/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-our-lives-39-days-how-parkland-students-turned-grief-into-action/</a></p>

<p>Per his words - &quot;On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and road as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.&quot;</p>

<p>This, of course, contradicts his statements to Time Magazine of his being there during the shooting.</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/5161034/florida-school-shooting-survivor/">http://time.com/5161034/florida-school-shooting-survivor/</a> </p>

<p>Just kind of weird that someone working within the FBI who failed in stopping Nikolas Cruz, had a kid at the high school and was home the day of the shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah school shooting drills are a thing in Florida. I wouldn&#39;t call it a drill. It&#39;s more like each class is required to have a rundown and sort of practice of which corner to hide in in the case of a shooter being present. </p>

<p>But I believe he was talking about the fire drill. If I remember correctly, the shooter pulled the fire alarm to try and draw out the students. They had a fire drill earlier in the day as well I believe and that&#39;s why a lot of teachers were confused and had their students stay in class. </p>

<p>Video from inside the school. There&#39;s more links if you search around too. I think in the quote you are referencing he is saying that after the event he went to get his camera to document. His original videos are what helped to bring notoriety to Hogg in the first place. </p>

<p>No, the quotation, as well as the published videos of his which are purported to be taking place during the shooting, clearly indicates that is not the case. </p>

<p>Could mean that he went home to get his camera. </p>

<p>The video of him in the school is probably from his cell phone. Hogg probably has a camera and a cell phone used his phone in the school then went to get his camera to interview people afterwards. </p>

<p>Could it all still be a lie? Yes. </p>

<p>If he went home to get his camera he&#39;d say so. He&#39;d say &#39;I rushed home.&#39; or something. He doesn&#39;t. He clearly describes his actions as heading towards the school.</p>

<p>Because it kind of did just happen? It was a mere 4 hours between the shooting and the bike ride. </p>

<p>He wanted to be on the seen ASAP to give + conduct interviews. He wanted to make sure that his voice was heard. </p>

<p>&quot;this could not be another mass shooting&quot;</p>

<p>This just means that he&#39;s so dumbfounded that <em>another</em> mass shooting happened again</p>

<p>He wanted to make sure that the whole world hears about Parkland, as you can see him doing now.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>According to my theory he obviously would&#39;ve gotten the footage inside the school <em>because</em> he was at the school when it happened. Then he either takes an emergency bus home or has his parents pick him up. Maybe he bikes home 3 miles which really wouldn&#39;t take that long. Let&#39;s say the school gets an all clear at 6PM and Hogg bikes up there to conduct interviews outside of the school. It&#39;s really not that complicated. I would just like to know how students got home, and when the code red was lifted and students were allowed to leave. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? He could&#39;ve gotten out of the school at like 4PM. Then the police say the school is clear at 6PM and allows MSM to conduct interviews <em>across the street</em>, which I&#39;d imagine is fairly common. The MSM is always ready to jump on a story. I&#39;m not saying this wasn&#39;t a false flag so if that&#39;s what you&#39;te thinking you can get off my back. </p>

<p>&quot;DAVID HOGG: On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and road as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.&quot;﻿</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1Tg9DjDJdg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1Tg9DjDJdg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a> </p>

<p>In this one he says he was in his AP class. </p>

<p>He was taking video inside of the school with his camera during the shooting, the once he was released to a parent? Not released to a parent to ride home after an active shooter? Anyway, he rode home after to get another camera and came back to the scene to take interviews. Is this what you&#39;re saying?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he rode his bike as fast as he could, 3 miles, and made it inside a secure classroom, in 6 minutes? Without being out of breath and not a drop of sweat on his face? How was he alerted so quickly? even if it was a text from a classmate ,they would have to have hear the first shot, THEN text him, then he would have to get out of house and on bike and cover 3 miles to active shooter situation. Were cops already there when he got there? what did he sneak past them? I&#39;m not saying its impossible, but, I have some questions..</p>
