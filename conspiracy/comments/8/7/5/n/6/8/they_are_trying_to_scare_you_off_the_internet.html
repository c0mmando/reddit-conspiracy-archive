    <div class="md"><p>I think &quot;scare&quot; is the wrong application. Red pilling is bringing out the TRUTH on what happens to your data once you submit it. I have known about this for many years, it has never been &quot;secret&quot;. When you read any terms of agreement on public forums it pretty much says anything submitted is their property to do with as they please. And they do. They always have. All it shows me is how stupid people in general are when it comes to what data is and how its used by corporations. </p>

<p>So why are they pushing big scary headlines across all the major social media sites in a coordinated fashion within the span of a few days?</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s the way news cycles work. It doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t an agenda behind the news cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most interesting part to me is the Redditors &quot;jumping ship&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen threads asking about this already, but these posts are cropping up very suddenly.</p>

<p>These are posts that are only going to be seen by people who frequent this sub, but couple those posts with the &quot;delete facebook&quot; sentiment being pushed and you have what appears to be a <em>cross-platform</em> attack on individuals who may already be inclined toward a &quot;suspicious&quot; mindset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have tried to stay out of reddit &quot;politics&quot; since I hwve been here, but I do have an opinion on this. I think alot of those &quot;jumping ship&quot; were bots to begin with. I think their purpose is to convince real people to jump with them. Its as simple as the lemming migrations and mass suicides. Same with getting certain subs shut down. You infiltrate the sub with your bots. You have half of them say Muslims are worse than Jews, the other half posts the opposite. After countless complaints to the heirafchy of reddit, they just pull the sub entirely. Mission accomplished, war won without a bullet fired.  Now you take your bot army to the next sub and do the same. If the mods and ceos dont dont pull the plug on it and become complacent with the dialogue then the bots have won again and now have a solid platform to spread their propoganda. May be far fetched, but its the way I have seen reddit playing out for two years anyway... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook is not the internet. Maybe you mean social media.  Either way,  Facebook got caught doing a regular &#39;&#39;don&#39;t ask,  don&#39;t tell&#39;&#39; situation. Same thing every social media outlet does. It&#39;s common practice.  What Facebook did is no different than downloading torrents a few years back.  Everyone did it, but didn&#39;t talk about it.  Within a few months this will be forgotten and replaced with a new media induced outrage will replace it.  Just how it works nowadays. I rarely even go on Facebook, so really I don&#39;t have a dog in that fight. With Facebook owning Instagram I wonder if IG will be effected by all this hooplah. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the government is trying to scare you off the internet. How else are they going to keep tabs on you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>same! i actually had an online argument with one who was very sympathetic to their way.  I got a ban for hate speech.  I didn&#39;t use any profanities.<br/>
It&#39;s not just reddit thats going through this. I have conservative views and I don&#39;t agree with a lot of the nonsense like affirmative action.  But my &#39;hate&#39; is censored. A number of our facebook groups have been shut down.  It pretty much leaves 4chan as a free speech platform but even someone with my disposition can only last so long on that site.
I do think we are going through an online war of sorts. we may not be on a verge of something IRL but things are simming away online.  And all political factions are playing games. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this sentiment. I think there is a coordinated effort to push us off of social media altogether since they&#39;re finding that authoritarian censorship doesn&#39;t work. The corporate media can easily be controlled from the top-down nhrough corporate hegemony, but social media doesn&#39;t work the same way. </p>

<p>Seeing this manufactured movement is making me want to speak out even more. When they attempt to silence the truth through underhanded means, we should all be louder with the truth rather than more quiet. I might have to start up that YouTube channel I&#39;ve been thinking about. Maybe be more proactive about sharing links here and across other social media platforms too. </p>

<p>These are posts that are only going to be seen by people who frequent this sub, but couple those posts with the &quot;delete facebook&quot; sentiment being pushed and you have what appears to be a <em>cross-platform</em> attack on individuals who may already be inclined toward a &quot;suspicious&quot; mindset.</p>
