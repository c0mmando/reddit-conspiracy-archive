        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is disturbing, but I&#39;ve found a terrible conspiracy involving Obama and Planned Parenthood. <strong>For every dollar the NRA spends on political campaigns, Obama donates a dollar to Planned Parenthood.</strong> </p>

<p>Every other year, Obama makes big donations to Planned Parenthood and brags about it on his twitter account:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/wqlePLt.jpg">2013: $1,188,442</a></li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/jwmfjtu.png">2015: $981,152</a></li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3bSTX4D.jpg">2017: $1,085,100</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I always thought it was weird that he gave such specific amounts, but I never knew where the money came from. Until now. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how much the NRA donates to political campaigns each year, according to OpenSecrets:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/FM9sh6n.jpg">2012: $1,188,442</a></li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ICI8BOr.jpg">2014: $981,152</a></li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/n3rkquL.jpg">2016: $1,085,100</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So every year after the NRA&#39;s donation totals are announced, <strong>Obama donates the EXACT SAME amount to Planned Parenthood.</strong></p>

<p>Is he trolling us? Why is he doing this? Is PP funneling money to Every Town on his behalf? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have answers, but as an NRA member I feel very conflicted. I want to keep donating but I <strong>don&#39;t</strong> want any money to go to Planned Parenthood. I might stop giving, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m very spooked right now. Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>The NRA is not a driving force behind anything.  Maybe look into AIPAC and other super pacs.  See where their money and funding goes.  Then look at google and facebook and twitter and amazon and see how they spend their money.    Something like wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/  might give some insight into how these groups work outside the law and their corporations to bypass political safeguards and push agendas.  </p>

<p>NRA sells guns.  It&#39;s not a driving force in politics beyond protecting gun rights so they can sell more guns.  They don&#39;t wield crazy amounts of power nor are they able to sway entire bills in their favour like these other pacs.  Ask why it was almost illegal to boycott Israel made goods in America for any reason and that bill had 100% bipartisan support.   Ask who pushed that.  Ask why these lobbying groups can force something like that to be signed by every single member of congress.  Then youll start to understand who wields true power.</p>

And theoretically that highly-condensed singularity point contained all the matter in the universe.<br/>
Thus, prior to the Big Bang, the laws of physics would not apply.<br/>

It came from nothing?!? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? Why does there need to be a &quot;rule maker?&quot;</p>

<p>I’m saying that a “rule maker” seems more logical. </p>

<p>Would you agree that the universe started from an initial state of “chaos,” immediately following The Big Bang?</p>

<p>If so, the degree of order &amp; creation of “physical laws” within the universe would take eons to achieve.  Much, much, much longer than present estimates - around 13.7 billion years.  </p>

<p>I never claimed this.</p>

<p>I know you did not say it. 
I think that’s a common belief of “enlightened atheists.”<br/>
That believers only believe because they don’t fully understand science.  </p>

<p>IMHO that sucks. </p>

<p>Or is it incredible?!?
To imagine something bigger than yourself that loves you.  </p>

<p>I assume you believe in evolution, as well.<br/>
So, think about this. </p>

<p>The differentiation of species (evolution) occurred via genetic mutations, environmental factors, natural selection, etc. correct?!?</p>

<p>Ok.  That would mean that every single species of plant, animal, bacteria, etc. would have evolved from an initial common ancestor (most likely a single celled organism), correct?!?</p>

<p>Do you think the differentiation from a single celled organism to every living thing on this planet is possible in 13.7 billion years through chance?!?  What are the odds?!?
What about with a Divine Creator?!?</p>

<p>How about the differentiation &amp; progression of Homo sapiens within 200,000 years?!?</p>

<p>Sure, but there’s no evidence of one. None.</p>

<p>Sure, I guess. It was a lot of activity I’ll give you that, but it really wasn’t “random” as chaos is usually defined.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why? For what reason? How do you know this, or why do you think this? The evidence tells us that the laws of the universe were there at the “beginning.”</p>

<p>Eh, young ones sure, but not ones that have done their research. There are plenty of religious scientists. It’s just that, nowadays the majority of scientists are not religious. The religious numbers are declining in the US as well. </p>

<p>And hates you as well, if you don’t do EXACTLY what he/she/it says. Hates you so much that you will be sent to an eternal fire to burn and torture for all eternity.</p>

<p>Sure</p>

<blockquote>
<p>initial common ancestor... correct?</p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think the differentiation from a single celled organism to every living thing on this planet is possible in 13.7 billion years through chance?!?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, earth isn’t even that old. Earth is ~4.6 billion, life has been on here for ~ 3 billion.</p>

<p>Second, 3 billion years is a LOT of time, like a HUGE amount of time. It’s so large, you’d never be able to fully comprehend it.</p>

<p>Third, it wasn’t chance. Natural selection is a selection of the “best fit” species. The mutations may be “random,” but again, 3 billion years is a lot of time, and allows for a lot of different mutations to be tested. Even the smallest mutations may help, and they build up into a new species. </p>

<p>Who’s to say it isn’t possible? Why wouldn’t it be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are the odds?!?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who knows? There’s ~200 billion stars in our galaxy. There’s ~200 billion galaxies in the universe. Nearly all stars have planets, and about 1-in-5 sun-like stars have an earth-like planet in their habitable zone. That’s a LOT of possibility. Who knows what’s out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about with a Divine Creator?!?</p>

<p>A creator that has yet to stand up to tests in any way, shape, or form, and which has no evidence to support its existence.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of time. Are you saying it’s not possible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you don’t take this personally.<br/>
I’m not trying to argue with you, but I do hope to change your perspective. </p>

<p>I disagree that there is no evidence of a Divine Creator, but I digress</p>

<p>With that being said:</p>

<ol>
<li> There is no evidence to prove the existence of God.  There is no evidence to prove the non-existence of God.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, both views require a leap of “faith.” </p>

<ol>
<li> You agreed that it is more logical to assume  that the initial matter contained within the singularity would be created by a Higher Power, rather than “it is because it is.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, it would take a greater leap of faith to believe in the non-existence of a Creator than the existence of a Creator.  Does that make sense?!?</p>

<ol>
<li> You also stated that the rules of the universe (conservation of energy, thermodynamics, etc) were present at the the moment of The Big Bang. </li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, it would seem logical that the rules of the universe were established prior to The Big Bang.  This would support the notion of  “rule maker” rather than the universe creating its own rules to establish a status quo following the initial state of rapid expansion/chaos.  </p>

<p>The primary purpose of this was to point out that is takes more “faith” to accept atheism than it does to believe in a Higher Power, from a logistical standpoint. </p>

<p>That’s absolutely not true. My view has evidence. I can back up my claims with evidence. I can support my view with repeatable experiments and observations. Yours cannot.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again no I didn’t. I clarified this in my previous comment. I said it’d be simpler to assume this, but without evidence it’s simply a claim. I’m going with the view that has evidence, that has worked, that we have equations for, etc.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore it would seem logical that the rules of the universe were established prior to the Big Bang</p>

<p>This is iffy and really depends on how you want to look at it. The rules could have still been defined inside the singularity so sure, the rules could have been there before the Big Bang.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This would support the notion of a “rule maker”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you come to this conclusion how? Why do they need a maker. Could they not have always existed? Perhaps they just came into existence without the help of an outside “maker.” Your analogy can be applied to mine. In my view, it could easily support the notion that the rules just came to be.</p>

<p>It takes more “faith” to accept atheism.</p>

<p>What? Atheism doesn’t require faith. It takes literally no effort. You simply don’t believe. Unless you can back yourself up with evidence, you have no argument.</p>

<p>The conclusion that matter has just always been there does not answer how it came to be &amp; requires a “leap of faith” to accept as true.  </p>

<p>The conclusion that matter was created by a “rule maker” also requires a “leap of faith” but answers the question of how matter came to exist.  </p>

<p>Again, you’ve gone back on forth with this one. </p>

<p>If the rules governing the universe existed prior to The Big Bang, it would be more logical that the rules were created rather than “they just existed.”</p>

<p>If the rules just came to be, it would take FAR, FAR longer than the current estimates on the age of the universe to establish these rules &amp; generating the vast degree of speciation, planetary formation, etc. </p>

<p>What? Atheism doesn’t require faith. It takes literally no effort. You simply don’t believe. Unless you can back yourself up with evidence, you have no argument.</p>

<p>Yes, it does.
It requires a “leap of faith” to accept your conclusion that matter has always existed and/or was created from nothing (with no evidence).  Isn’t this the belief among atheists?!?</p>

<p>Sure, it answers the question, but so does mine. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the conservation of mass/energy?!? “matter is neither created nor destroyed.”</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t violate it, because the Big Bang theory doesn&#39;t postulate the creation of new mass. The theory is that at one point (little less than 14 billion years ago), all the mass and energy were condensed into a single, infinitesimally small, infinitesimally hot point.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be more logical, it&#39;d just be easier, but you need to prove this. </p>

<p>What if they weren&#39;t created, though, what if they just came to be, or always existed? It&#39;s a hypothetical. We can&#39;t prove it (with current mathematics), but it&#39;s a theory.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t. Never did I say matter came from nothing.

<p>I’m not arguing with you that the universe was created following The Big Bang.  I accept that evidence.  </p>

<p>Exactly!!!
We still don’t have a concrete theory regarding how matter/light/energy was created. 
Also, a theory is not a fact.<br/>
It always has the possibility of being disproven. 
This would require a degree of doubt requiring some “faith” to accept.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p>Yes, it does. </p>

<p>Also, linking two websites as “evidence” to support your conclusion is not a strong argument.,
I can provide a link to Scripture.

<p>No I did not. I told you, matter could have always existed, or matter could have just come into existence. We can’t know for certain, but you can’t not know. And you can’t assume it was made by someone, because then you have to wonder who made the maker.</p>

<p>Correct, so why assume there’s a creator? No other discoveries we’ve made have led us to assume there’s a creator. Just because it’s easier to imagine, doesn’t mean it’s right.

<p>Umm, in science it practically is. Of course, it’ll never be 100% fact, but a scientific theory is a well-supported explanation of natural phenomena.

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot prove or disprove the existence of a Higher Power.
You have not provided any evidence to support your claim that matter can be created without a Creator.  </p>

<p>No I did not. I told you, matter could have always existed, or matter could have just come into existence. We can’t know for certain, but you can’t not know. And you can’t assume it was made by someone, because then you have to wonder who made the maker.</p>

<p>Ok.  So, your two possible explanations concerning the creation of matter without a Creator are the following:</p>

<p>matter could have always existed</p>

<p>Ok.<br/>
Again, this does not provide a &quot;beginning&quot; for matter &amp; hypothesizes matter is infinite. 
This explanation does not disprove the existence of God.
The same logic can be applied to the atheists counter-argument of &quot;then who created God.&quot;<br/>
I.E.  God has always existed.</p>

<p>Correct, so why assume there’s a creator? No other discoveries we’ve made have led us to assume there’s a creator. Just because it’s easier to imagine, doesn’t mean it’s right. Look at evolution, weather, natural disasters, etc. One can assume it’s all due to a god, because it’s easier to imagine, but we know it’s not due to any god.</p>

<p>Again, you have not provided any evidence to support a claim that &quot;we know it&#39;s not due to any god.&quot;</p>

<p>I have tried to explain this earlier, regarding the amount of time required to create the physical laws of the universe, planetary formation, etc.  Again, I do not have proof of this but the time frame seems highly improbable.  </p>

<p>Let me try another route.  All living species originated from a common ancestor (most likely a prokaryote) around 3 billion years ago to create ALL living material on the earth past &amp; present (plants, animals, bacteria, etc.). This would also entail the &quot;99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.&quot;</p>

<p>In general, the mutation rate in unicellular eukaryotes and bacteria is roughly 0.003 mutations per genome per cell generation. 
DNA viruses have mutation rates between 10−6 to 10−8 mutations per base per generation, and RNA viruses have mutation rates between 10−3 to 10−5 per base per generation.</p>

<p>So, the amount of time it would for 1 single celled organism to produce a viable, genetic variant is astronomical.  </p>

<p>First, the mutation rates of prokaryotes/eukaryotes are extremely small. 
Secondly, the genetic mutation would have to occur in the coding region of the genome (not the non-coding DNA &quot;junk DNA&quot; which makes up the majority of a genome) to produce a differentiated phenotype. 
Third, the genetic mutation occurring in the coding region of the genome would have to produce a viable organism capable of sustaining itself within the same environment, conditions, etc.
Fourth, the &quot;mutant&quot; would then have to co-exist with it&#39;s &quot;parent&quot; in order to replicate.  They would both most likely have the same resource for energy/life.  So, the &quot;mutant&quot; could not commandeer the resources of it&#39;s parent.
Last of all, the mutation would have to create a benefit to the &quot;mutant&quot; allowing it to proliferate. </p>

<p>This is just going from 1 single celled organism to it&#39;s first viable derivative.  Can you imagine how long that would take?!?<br/>
You can repeat this experiment in a lab.
See how long it takes for a prokaryote to spontaneously mutate into a multi-celled organism. </p>

<p>Now imagine, that single celled organism &amp; it&#39;s successive derivatives undergoing the same extensive, astronomically low probability process to create ALL the living matter on earth past &amp; present.</p>

<p>Now add on top of that the potential change of environmental conditions (weather, natural conditions) which these young species must adapt.<br/>
Evolution is the differentiation of species through genetic variation, not inheritance of acquired characteristics.<br/>
I.E.  I have a slim frame.  If I work out everyday, I can build mass upon that frame but it will not change my DNA.  Thus, my children will most likely inherit a &quot;slim frame&quot; rather than my conditioned strong physique. </p>

<p>Do you think that is possible in 3 billion years?!?
I say, NO WAY!!!!</p>

<p>Again, it is much more logical to assume some &quot;intelligent design&quot; or &quot;helping hand&quot; behind the differentiation of species.</p>

<p>Umm, in science it practically is. Of course, it’ll never be 100% fact, but a scientific theory is a well-supported explanation of natural phenomena. A scientific theory is the highest ranking anything in science can get, behind law. Established theories withstand rigorous scrutiny and have a well-established base that was made off of repeatable experiments. A theory in science is not equal to a layman’s theory.</p>

<p>Ok.<br/>
How do you feel about Einstein&#39;s general THEORY of relativity?
Is that a proven theory with a well-supported explanation?</p>

<p>Ok.
How do you feel about the Quantum Field THEORY?
Is that a proven theory with a well-supported explanation?</p>

<p>General relativity and quantum field theory are incompatible.
So, that would indicate one of the THEORIES is incorrect. </p>

<p>Correct, but for established theories, like the Big Bang, that’s extremely improbable. There’s too much evidence pointing to the Big Bang.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not arguing the reality of The Big Bang creating the universe.  </p>

<p>I meant them as explanations not evidence.</p>

<p>Except they are still not providing an explanation for how the initial building material came to be.<br/>
They can continue to break it down into smaller scales (matter - energy - light - photons - particles/antiparticles - bosons, etc...) but they still cannot explain how the initial material (bosons) came to be. </p>

<p>Are there repeatable experiments that can be done to test the scripture? Is there any conflicting observations and evidence with the scripture found in science? Can you provide evidence that what your scripture says is true?</p>

<p>Are we sure CERN was able to create the exact same conditions at the beginning of the universe?  How can we be sure?  We you around to validate the conditions at The Big Bang?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying all Scripture is 100% accurate (as ultimately it was written by man).  There are plenty of contradictions.  I assume most were meant as parables.  I am trying to say that I believe in a Higher Power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1st article</p>

<p>“In the beginning, there was not yet any matter. However, there was a lot of energy in the form of light, which comes in discrete packets called photons.”</p>

<p>Translation:</p>

<p>So, we’re just going to change the name from matter to energy/light/photons.  Yeah, that’s how matter was created.  It was made from energy/light/photons.  That settles it.</p>

<p>Common sense:</p>

<p>Ok.<br/>
So, what created the energy/light/photons?!?</p>

<p>And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
Genesis 1:3</p>

<p>Answer:</p>

<p>When photons have enough energy, they can spontaneously decay into a particle and an antiparticle.</p>

<p>Translation:  </p>

<p>Ummm....well, matter... I mean energy... i mean light... I’m sorry, I mean photons are made of particles &amp; antiparticles.  And particles make matter.  </p>

<p>Common sense:</p>

<p>Seriously?!?  Ok...
How were particles/anti-particles made?!?</p>

<p>Answer:</p>

<p>At some point during this process, something else must have happened to cause the survival of more particles than antiparticles (we call this the particle-antiparticle asymmetry).</p>

<p>The current understanding of particle physics, called the standard model, dictates that nowadays the number of baryons is nearly constant, with only a small variation due to quantum mechanical tunneling.</p>

<p>In the early universe, however, the temperature was much higher, so that this tunneling was commonplace and a large number of baryons could have been created.</p>

<p>Translation:  </p>

<p>Ummm, well matter... I mean energy...   I mean light... I mean photons... I’m sorry, I mean the imbalance of particles/antiparticles were possibly caused by the quantum tunneling of baryons (protons/neutrons).  </p>

<p>Common sense: </p>

<p>Bruh, are you understanding me?!?
What created protons/neutrons?!?
I mean, hypothetically, we can recreate the initial conditions of the universe @ CERN, right?!?
Ok, so was the large hadron collider just always in existence?!? 
Or was it created by people via “intelligent design?”</p>

<p>Answer:</p>

<p>(Understanding it requires a lot more background information than I have space for.)</p>

<p>Translation:</p>

<p>We still don’t understand how matter within the singularity was created.<br/>
We have no f*cking clue. </p>

<p>Common sense:</p>

<p>What came first?!?
The chicken or the egg?!?</p>

<p>God said to Moses, “I am who I am.”
And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘I am has sent me to you.’”
Exodus 3: 14</p>

<p>Stop making stupid translations based on what you think they mean. You’re turning science into fiction by including your biased, ignorant viewpoint. The correct translation is already there in the explanation, no need to make your own based on what you do and don’t understand.</p>

<p>Including phrases and passages from the Bible isn’t proof of anything. Can you provide any evidence that those things happened, or are you just accepting it with faith?</p>

That&#39;s not a strong counter-argument.
I pointed out the inconsistencies in both articles.

    <div class="md"><p>2nd article</p>

<p>Interesting quotes.  </p>

<p>Do phrases like “could be” and “”could’ve” indicate certainty?!?
Or would you say they indicate skepticism, thus requiring a “leap of faith” to accept?!?</p>

<p>The &#39;divine spark&#39; was whatever produced the laws of physics,&quot; Filippenko said. &quot;And I don&#39;t know what produced that divine spark. So let&#39;s just leave it at the laws of physics.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So it could be that this universe is merely the science fair project of a kid in another universe,&quot; Shostak added. &quot;I don&#39;t know how that affects your theological leanings, but it is something to consider.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Big Bang could&#39;ve occurred as a result of just the laws of physics being there.”</p>

<p>I agree with his assertion that the theory of a divine creator continues to kick the can down the road, without answering the question. </p>

<p>However, that is the beauty &amp; magnificence of infinity.  The great I AM.
Maybe we will never find an answer because we cannot comprehend the concept of infinity.  </p>

<p>Also, couldn’t your logic that the singularity has always existed with no creation be applied to the existence of God.  Meaning God has always just always been present.  So, your conclusion also kicks the can down the road. </p>

<p>“The question, then, is, &#39;Why are there laws of physics?&#39;&quot; he said. &quot;And you could say, &#39;Well, that required a divine creator, who created these laws of physics and the spark that led from the laws of physics to these universes, maybe more than one.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>But that answer just continues to kick the can down the road, because you still need to explain where the divine creator came from. The process leads to a never-ending chain that always leaves you short of the ultimate answer, Filippenko said.</p>

<p>Perhaps. Perhaps not. We can’t know now. But why put faith into something for which there is no evidence? Why just blindly believe in a creator, rather than believe scientific evidence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>couldn’t your logic that the singularity has always existed with no creation be applied to the existence of God</p>

<p>Sure! The only thing is, we don’t know if the singularity is infinite, nor do you know if your god is. </p>

<p>Again, we disagree.<br/>
Why just blindly believe matter has always been or was capable of creating itself, when we have NO scientific evidence to support this?
I agree that we don&#39;t know now, but I don&#39;t believe we will ever know.  Subatomic particles will continue to get smaller and smaller (what are bosons made of?), with no explanation for initial origin. 
Your argument basically throws your hands in the air &amp; states, &quot;Sh!t, I don&#39;t know, it was just there.&quot;
My argument states matter was created by a higher intelligence. </p>

<p>So?  Is that supposed to justify abortion or something?</p>

<p>40,000.  No, but seriously I was going to, but all the ones I wanted to adopt were murdered by Planned Parenthood.  No, but for real this time, when exactly does it become my responsibility, rather than the mother of the child?  I assume that they know that having unprotected sex has a high likelihood of resulting in a pregnancy, but they do it anyway.  Why does it then become my responsibility because I would prefer that these people use protection rather than kill the baby?</p>

<p>But since you are calling it murder, can I ask you: How many unwanted children have YOU adopted?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when exactly does it become my responsibility, rather than the mother of the child?
When you take away a woman&#39;s options for medical care for her own body. When you tell someone who&#39;s been raped, that they must carry the products of that horrific crime, when you tell a mother who is carrying a child with a serious and permanent disability that will require years and thousands of dollars to care for, when you tell a young girl who has made a mistake that she must carry a child that she doesn&#39;t want and that child will probably be resented if not out right hated and more than likely abused. 
When someone like you thinks that know better than the the woman who is pregnant, that you know better than that do what to do with theor own bodies...then YOU and everyone like you should be made to assist in caring for that child.</p>

<p>If you assume That? Most people who get on their high horses about abortion, also follow it up with abstinence only sex ed instead of the smarter more healthy rounded sex education which also includes the education abput contraception.  Which BTW, is also a big part of what Planned Parenthood does..i. case you didn&#39;t know.</p>

<p>So it shouldn&#39;t be a big deal for them to stop providing abortions then, right?  Let some organization that is not funded with tax dollars do it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The fetus is not part of the woman&#39;s body.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not necessarily opposed to abortion in the case of rape, health of the mother, or severe disability of the child.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when you tell a young girl who has made a mistake that she must carry a child that she doesn&#39;t want and that child will probably be resented if not out right hated and more than likely abused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So just kill the child then?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When someone like you thinks that know better than the the woman who is pregnant, that you know better than that do what to do with theor own bodies...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the fetus is not part of the mother&#39;s body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then YOU and everyone like you should be made to assist in caring for that child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So because I say things you don&#39;t like, I should have to take responsibility for someone else&#39;s choices?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say anything about abstinence only, but seriously, how hard is it to understand that having sex causes pregnancy?  It&#39;s not difficult, right?  Which means that some people just don&#39;t care because they know they can get an abortion instead.</p>

<p>Anyway, I agree with Margaret Sanger, co-founder of Planned Parenthood, when she said, &quot;While there are cases where even the law recognizes an abortion as justifiable if recommended by a physician, I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NRA is a racist, fascist institution that plays with eugenics now and then.  Planned Parenthood is a racist, eugenicist institution that would totes go for fascism if it would kill off what they deem excess persons.  It&#39;s like two for one - the assholes are laughing all the way to the bank.</p>

<p>disclaimer: I have no problem with people bearing arms, or women terminating pregnancies.  NRA and PP are still avowed racists and shit institutions and ought to be shunned by any decent person, regardless of their opinions.</p>

<p>In the case of PP, it should be criminal that government money goes to pay the (really high) executive salaries of an organization which has never, to this day, renounced eugenics, who celebrates the vicious racist Margaret Sanger, and which still charges poor people for their services to twist the knife just that much more.</p>
