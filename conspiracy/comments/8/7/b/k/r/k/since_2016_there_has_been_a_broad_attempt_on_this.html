        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The narrative on this subreddit has become increasingly polarized towards pro conservativism and pro_trump. If you read comments, there is a constant attempt to gas light and act like they weren&#39;t the ones who invaded conspiracy, but that anyone dissenting against their views are the ones who invaded conspiracy. I&#39;ve seen so many upvoted comments and posts from these people that are actively Pro-police, anti-drug, pro-torture, pro-military, and pro-oligarchy. This has never been the case until the 2016 election. I&#39;ve taken the liberty of posting the front page of r/conspiracy around today&#39;s date (March 26th) for every year since 2009.

I remember hearing how people on this site talked about r/theredpill with absolute hatred and disgust. I remember checking it out a few times and mostly agreeing with them at the time. There were definitely some broken scornful people on there. The thing is though, they were making some pretty good points that were and are being totally ignored so it’s easy to see why a lot of them got to where they did. Most of this site refuses to exercise any self-reflection. If they can’t do that soon we’re headed down a dark path.</p>

<p>lol, that&#39;s what made me go there and study it, and boy am I glad I did. Even though there is A TON of egotism there, I really learned women&#39;s nature and archetypes that play out in both sexes. I used to always wonder why the pretty girls always went with douchebag knuckle dragging troglodytes who treat them like shit, but the good guys get passed up (until they reach their 30&#39;s and look for a beta provider to the provide for them)</p>

<p>Certainly in my early teens/20&#39;s I was also playing out some of these things, stopped doing them, and have been for the better ever since</p>

<p>What amazes me is how you can accurately state this, yet one of the top root comments in this thread literally states there are no threads currently on the front page representing the current MSM narrative. I don&#39;t care who it is that&#39;s blatantly lying to my face, they need to start being recognized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve also seen seen a concerted attempt to brand this sub T_D 2.0. The question is who&#39;s behind it?</p>

<p>Shareblue, CTR, and friends have a motive. They want to pin all the country&#39;s problems on Trump, Putin, etc. and not the corporate Democrats who keep offering voters shitty options and don&#39;t support meaningful reforms. Any news that is unflattering to them is painted as a conspiracy based on fake news only believed by right wingers. </p>

<p>The deep state has a motive as well. To keep power, they need to control what the people believe. Painting all conspiracy theorists as alt-right nutjobs keeps people on the left and center from believing it. Divide, control. We know that a lot of Reddit users are in Reston…</p>

<p>Who else? Doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s in the Republicans interest but I&#39;m willing to be persuaded. </p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely amazing, they&#39;ve stepped back on this one because they know that they are often accusing literal liberals of subscribing to well sourced conspiracies that are not implicitly right leaning. I could give a shit about Trump winning and I didn&#39;t vote for him but I&#39;ll go ahead and admit my bias - I may have been politically motivated in believing some of those conspiracies. The key detail is that it was anti-group-that-subverted-the-election-away-from-the-most-liked-political-figure in ages and not pro-right in any regard. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t going to go very well for you. I&#39;m going to tell you this right now.</p>

<p>The unspoken statement of mine that you&#39;re trying far too hard to put into words for me, is that people who identify with leftist Liberal ideologies tend to be hive-minded and Communist, with both reverence and trust for government, which is in stark contrast to what you&#39;ll find from an average conspiracy theorist who of course believes the government us behind many of our problems let alone should we ever ask for <strong>more</strong> government to regulate and control us: A popular sentiment and solution of leftists.</p>

<p>Nothing about that statement has anything to do with Republicans, Libertarians, Egyptians, or even cows. If you continue to have this much trouble staying on topic and avoiding your tendency to conflate what you want out of everything, I&#39;m going to disregard you altogether. </p>

<p>You think left leaning people are less smart than right leaning people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, it&#39;s either, &quot;left leaning people <em>aren&#39;t as</em> smart,&quot; or it would be, &quot;left leaning people are less <em>intelligent</em>,&quot; but oddly enough when referring to intelligence you can&#39;t even converse as though you yourself have been educated beyond K-12. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because you lean to the right. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose do lean &quot;right&quot; ideologically, although I do not support the Republican party (or any political party for that matter). My basis for what I&#39;ve determined to be true about the left has nothing to do with my leanings, though -- what I&#39;ve said about the left is entirely true. So true in fact is my point about the left that you couldn&#39;t even deny it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So it&#39;s fun to pretend that people who don&#39;t agree with you just aren&#39;t quite as smart as you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s borderline retarded to have even been said, but no... to agree or disagree would not reflect on ones intelligence, although it&#39;s entirely possible for someone to hold some opinions due to a lack of intellect and/or education.</p>

<p>Also, since you&#39;re obsessed with discussing &quot;intelligence&quot;, I&#39;ll repeat that as far as your average conspiracy theorist is concerned, they <strong>often</strong> have higher than average intelligence, which of course is evident simply in their ability to cast doubt and ask questions, rather than absorb everything they&#39;re told like sheep (Liberals).</p>

<p>&quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; I self conceptualized this now cornerstone philosophy when I was about 10 years old. It took another 10 to learn that Rene Descarte did it first, centuries ago. </p>

<p>Liberals lack the chief cornerstone of an independent mind, which is required to even <strong>be</strong> a conspiracy theorist most of the time. It is not unreasonable to say that <em>most</em> (meaning a majority but NOT all) Liberals on this sub are here simply to up/downvote threads and comments based on political opinions in an attempt to shape public perception rather than contribute to any actual conspiracies. </p>

<p>Hahaha.</p>

<p>Glad, that I&#39;m not the only person who suspects that foul play is afoot. </p>

<p>People might really be leaving en masse but the trained conspiracy theorist in me sees potential concern trolling and agent provocateurs, trying to stiffle discussion. </p>

<p>What I see is a ton of people claiming that our sub had been taken over by Trumpettes. But these announcements don&#39;t look organic at all. And those who are &quot;leaving&quot; don&#39;t often pass the smell test because only a few of them look like they are regulars anyway. </p>

<p>Besides, I see just as many people criticizing Trump as I see criticizing Clinton, Putin and any other controversial figure. No corrupt official is safe from discussion here. In this place we know better than most that the common man has very few allies in the upper echelon&#39;s of power. And we like to discuss that travesty in all of its forms.</p>

<p>Personally, it feels like someone is trying to make this a place that pushes the same narratives as <a href="/r/Politics">/r/Politics</a>. Just as some people once tried to push <a href="/r/T_D">/r/T_D</a> &#39;s narrative. As a community we just need to think critically, question everything and we should be fine. Regardless of who floods us with biased content it is up to us to sort it out and call out BS when we see it.</p>

<p>I am more moderate in my views, but I can see where many of these users are coming from. Their voices are often silenced before they even speak.</p>

<p>If you want this sub to be less polarized, be the change. This post itself is even more polarizing.</p>

<p>Prove your viewpoints. What do you disagree with about the conservative mindset? Write a good post and back up your claims.</p>

<p>Again, this is not the perfect answer, but I am just saying I can see why it has become polarized.</p>

<p>I mean hold the damn phone: a place where people come to talk about endemic corruption, technologies with potential and actual disturbing/harmful uses, and ancient civilizations which may have been highly advanced tend to be more skeptical towards those core tenets of Liberal philosophy!?</p>

<p>2013 had three anti-obama threads.
2014 mentions israel, plenty of political themed uproar, bankers, and snowden.</p>

<p>There was actually less political threads in 2015 than any other year.</p>

<p>2016 because it was an election year, had clinton, ted cruz, and trump threads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just looked through all of them, and I see a lot of criticism of Obama,  There&#39;s an article critical of Hillary, posted 3 months before Trump even announced he was running.  A post from 4 years ago telling people to be wary of the elite pushing for war with Russia.  A post from 8 years ago defending the Tea Party.</p>

<p>If you post any of that stuff now, it will be downvoted and brigaded.  I think you&#39;re the one that&#39;s gaslighting people, OP.</p>

<p>Also, look at this graph:  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VZcSpZY.png">https://i.imgur.com/VZcSpZY.png</a>  </p>

<p>It is a plot of T_D vs non-T_D vote scores.  Future T_D users were here, getting upvoted, 6 monts before Trump ever decided to run for President, and before T_D was even created. You will also see that T_D users were not in here downvoting everyone. There is no divergence. T_D users scores spike, and non-T_D user scores also spike. There&#39;s a big increase in activity prior to the election around when wikileaks was dropping emails and PG was hot, but the voting behavior stays the same. That changes after the election. T_D users scores drop significantly while non-T_D user scores rise. This is evidence of significant vote brigading. The index line makes it even more obvious.  It is blatantly obvious in any political thread. Anything not pushing the correct narrative is downvoted below the threshold, and it&#39;s only gotten worse since this graph was created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, just making sure, because when it comes to conspiracy and money laundering, it&#39;s hard not to immediately think of the current administration.</p>

<p>As for the little girls, Trump was hanging out with Epstein too and faces the same allegations, so that leaves you with Haiti. I don&#39;t know the story there, but maybe Trump can fix it.</p>

<p>He can fly down there, throw some paper towels and let Zinke hand a $300 million contract to some two person yokel firm from his home town. Problem solved. And a reminder, Puerto Rico is a US territory. Those are US citizens Trump has left hanging.</p>

<p>I guess my point is, the guy in the White House is guilty of anything you can try to hang on Clinton, so why does he get a pass in your mind? Why are the folks from t_d blind to Trump being a corrupt POS, or, at a minimum, that he&#39;s just not very good at his job, that his staff turnover is on him, that he&#39;s an embarrassment on the world stage, that he&#39;s not smarter than a fifth grader, anything...?</p>

<p>Your very next statement for starters.</p>

<p>If information came to light he was half as corrupt as HRC I&#39;d call him out, I&#39;ve yet to see any</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would have to be living in a Fox News bubble to avoid evidence of his corruption. How many off book condo sales to wealthy Russians, how many Chinese patents, how many investigations into unreported gambling activity at his casinos, how many Trump University settlements, how many lawsuits from contractors on his properties for unpaid bills, how many porn star payoffs, how many indictments, how much obstruction, how many emoluments, just what does it take for a t_d loyalist to see that this guy has always been a corrupt POS?</p>

<p>The evidence against Clinton is mostly random conspiracy BS like Uranium One, Pizzagate and the Clinton body count. Republicans dragged the Benghazi hearings on forever. Her emails were dragged on forever. Uranium One was such a joke of a scandal that Jeff Sessions refused to investigate and said as much before the House Intel Committee. Maybe the problem is that so much nonsense is thrown at Clinton that people have started to discount all of it.</p>

<p>As for paper towels, many in Puerto Rico are still without power. Anyone who throws paper towels in response to a natural disaster of that magnitude is completely out of touch, and a moron.</p>

<p>Globalism is a group of ideologies that advocate the concept of globalization. It tends to advocate for such policies as increases in immigration, interventionism, and global governance. Economically, globalism varies between free trade and lowering tariffs to Marxist proletarian internationalism. It is typically viewed as opposite of nationalism, and has become increasingly divisive in politics in many developed countries, such as the United States.

<p>This is the deep state and their agenda. Don&#39;t take my word for it. They admit to it themselves. </p>

<p>&quot;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent.&quot; <strong>—Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950</strong></p>

<p>&quot;We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.&quot; <strong>--David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission, in an address to a meeting of The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991</strong> </p>

<p>&quot;Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; invasion or Russians!!], whether real or promulgated [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.&quot; <strong>—Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991</strong></p>

<p>&quot;In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn&#39;t such a great idea after all.&quot; <strong>--Strobe Talbot, President Clinton&#39;s Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in Time, July 20th, l992</strong></p>

<p>&quot;For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot; <strong>—David Rockefeller&#39;s Memoirs (Random House, New York, 2002)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. <strong>—Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical. What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nationstates involved. As managers and creators of the system ,they will rule the future.&quot; <strong>—U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater in his l964 book: With No Apologies</strong></p>

<p>For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn&#39;t. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared &quot;ammunition&quot; in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... &quot;The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. &quot;The depression was the calculated &#39;shearing&#39; of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank. <strong>—Curtis Dall, FDR&#39;s son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law</strong></p>

<p>What the fucking fuck?!? I&#39;ve been here for nine years and you are full of shit. That&#39;s always been the central topic of discussion on this subreddit. Even the fringe topics eventually circled back to the Deep State or NWO in some form.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deep State is just the term the Hard Right gave the NWO.  It sounds more sinister because the Republicans in office couldn&#39;t get shit done, and blamed it on the Deep State as proof of it existing, but in reality they don&#39;t even agree on their own plans and can&#39;t pass shit.  The same shit happened when Dubya was in office.  </p>

<p>You can&#39;t blame their inactions on a &#39;deep state&#39;, in reality the deep state is the Republican Failure to do anything.  They got the numbers to pass whatever the fucking want, but that infighting can&#39;t seem to go away.</p>

<p>NWO posts were here, and don&#39;t act like I said it wasn&#39;t 1 in 10 posts or even that I didn&#39;t mention it at all.  They were on the front page at times but the politicization from 2016 really fucked this subreddit to make it more like it was controlled by Far Right nuts than it should be.  So.. get that shit out of here.</p>

<p>TLDR: Republicans are the deep state as they can&#39;t get shit done with infighting and blame it on some boogyman instead of actually using their numbers to get shit passed.</p>

<p>NWO =/= Deep State, The NWO of ole was the historical names such as Rothschild and Rockefeller controlling shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see conspiracy having a lot of pro-Trump posts as being unusual, or contrary to what this sub is about.</p>

<p>The reality is that even though Trump has the white house, he does not control the government. He certainly does not control the media. Most would agree that the only news outlet that is friendly to Trump is Infowars, and maybe some of the more left leaning people will think Fox News, too. He is not the &quot;mainstream&quot; of this country. In fact, most media organizations will print anything they can get their hands on which will paint him in a bad light. In this ecosystem, r/conspiracy is hardly needed for the politically minded, left-leaning conspiracy theorist. They can simple air their conspiracies to whoever will listen, and likely reach sympathetic ears. </p>

<p>On the other hand, Trump supporters are very limited both on reddit, and often also in their regular lives, in who they can talk to about their politics. Add to that the fact that Trump disagrees with the mainstream about what the facts are in a TON of circumstances, and you get what we have today. Lots of people with a limited choice of venue for where they can speak freely and ideas about what the powers that be might be lying about.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t handle other people&#39;s conspiracy theories because they conflict with your world view, then maybe you should examine how open minded you really are.</p>

<p>For the record, I leaned liberal before the elections and volunteered for Obama, then Bernie. Now I don&#39;t know what I am. A Russian bot, I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, you and many others are just confusing anti-establishment views and distrust of government as a pro-Trump stance.<br/>
We don&#39;t trust the DNC or the MSM mouthpieces &amp; intelligence agencies that empower them and you&#39;re confusing that as support for the RNC.<br/>
What you&#39;re not realizing is that we don&#39;t trust either party.<br/>
A lot of T_D people did indeed show up here but that was because they too were anti-establishment and had a strong distrust of government, and were opposed to both the DNC and RNC (the RNC was opposed to Trump). Almost all of those people either left or became even more awakened.<br/>
There is no strong support for Trump on this sub. You&#39;re just misinterpreting hate for SJW shills &amp; DNC supporters as Trump support, because you think everyone must be supporting one or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ahem... the links you share show:</p>

<p>Exposure of Obama (first link 2009), </p>

<p>Tea Party libertarianism (2010) which is where Breitbart came from and is arguably anti neo-leftwing once again,</p>

<p>Exposure of George Soros (2011)</p>

<p>Yikes, did you even click on your own links?</p>

<p>You literally are showing evidence to defeat your own claim... I&#39;m not even going to click any further than the first 3.</p>

<p>The truth is that, some conspiracies are considered anti DNC.</p>

<p>Also just in case you decide to edit your post, here are the original first 3 links:</p>

<p>I dislike Donald Trump by the way, but I dislike poor arguments even more, and I dislike this attempt to chase away genuine opinions held by those you disagree with using this subreddit.  I&#39;m sure the increase in right-wing perspective is because these guys are essentially subreddit refugees after being censored off of r/politics.</p>

Point out the shady stuff clintons have done or obama and it&#39;s like people stick their fingers in their ears.  If you are in a conspiracy sub... nothing should be off limits and you should be willing to look at every bit of info like the govt has lied to you wit no he official narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually want worldwide socialism, not Bernie&#39;s washed over pro-capitalist social democracy. I want full drug decriminalization across the board and legalization for marijuana, mushrooms and psychedelics. I want workers to actually own and run their workplaces democratically and to not be exploited by the capitalist system. I want to tear down the entire United States system that is bought and sold by the rich and elite.   No more wars and no more drone strikes ANYWHERE. No more innocent citizens in the Middle East being treated like their lives are disposable. No more selling ANY arms to those who then use it on innocents. Every single person has the right to own a gun and defend themselves and their families. </p>
