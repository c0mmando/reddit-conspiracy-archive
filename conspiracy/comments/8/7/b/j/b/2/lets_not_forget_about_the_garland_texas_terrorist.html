        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In light of the news about Omar Mateen today and other revelations trickling out about what the FBI knew before other mass shootings...remember the FACT that last year 60 Minutes did a story on the two Muslim men that attempted to massacre people at a anti-Muslim rally in Garland, Texas (they were shot dead by a Garland Police officer). WELL it turned out that those two men were being followed by an FBI agent aware of their plans...and guess what the FBI agent did?! Drove away... The agent was more than willing to let Americans be massacred. </p>

<p>So yes, the FBI is definitely allowing these events to occur....real question is WHY?</p>

<p>SIDE NOTE: Live in Texas. On the day of the shooting my sister texted me that morning saying &quot;heads up, something terrorist related might occur in North Texas today&quot;...she had received the heads up from her husband&#39;s friend who is in intelligence. &quot;They&quot; knew and did nothing to stop it. </p>

<p>Sorry I&#39;m just super bad at my job. So everything is ok.</p>

<p>Well if that were true then fire him. </p>

<p>We gave Bush and company that benefit of the doubt. &quot;No were just incompetent and really thought there were WMD&#39;s.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How could that be an option if the fbi agent who was on the scene doing nothing was also in communication with them and told one of the would be killers &quot;tear up texas&quot;.  </p>

<p>When you know the FBI&#39;s long history of terror plots, its not much different.  Except this wasn&#39;t a fake bomb.  This was real weapons and live ammunition.  </p>

But they pick and choose who the go after, or don&#39;t, depending on what agenda they want to push forward. Lots of friends thought I was nuts until all the stuff came out about Cruz and Parkland... now they are willing to listen.</p>
