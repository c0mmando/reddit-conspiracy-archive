<p>Media sure seems to have an agenda against whites and has for a while in commercials, news, entertainment, etc. The South Africa situation is an anomaly, but it&#39;s most definitely worth noting. The agenda has been subtle but there has been a reversal of racism against Caucasians in many areas of life such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKMkH4p_zXo">sports</a>, affirmative action, etc. It&#39;s a two-way street. Other races seem to think they&#39;re immune to being racist and it&#39;s not necessarily their fault, but through multiculturalism, indoctrination, etc. this is how things have become. Last, but certainly not least, there&#39;s the situation in Europe and especially Sweden with Islamization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all ties in. This place is falling apart and comments like this don&#39;t helping. Why would you call someone a &quot;fucking retard&quot; just because their post wasn&#39;t what you wanted to hear? If you don&#39;t like something, down-vote and move on.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a fucking retard because you&#39;re perpetuating fashy fee-fees and talking points, and it&#39;s blatantly obvious.  Not only that, but you present your argument with the most superficial horseshit that it&#39;s hard to take you seriously.</p>

<p>You are not my comrade, you are not my friend, and you are a poisonous leech selling some pure ideology.</p>

<p>No, I do not fucking downvote like a pussy, and I have no interest in protecting your precious feefees.  You do not deserve special protection from criticism like a goddamn snowflake.  If I downvote someone, it&#39;s because they&#39;re posting straight-up spam or nonsense posts to deliberately detract from a thread.  If I upvote someone, it&#39;s because they&#39;re putting forward actual content.  The upvote/downvote buttons are not supposed to be there to express your precious fucking feefees and vote down whatever you don&#39;t like, but sadly that is difficult to prevent and reddit is prone to astroturfing.  Regardless of that, fascist ideology needs to be challenged.  You&#39;re free to wake up whenever you like, but I&#39;ve never known fascist ideologues to come in good faith and I&#39;m not expecting that to change.</p>

Multiculturalism is a means of dividing a nation against itself. Liberals are only causing further destabilization and the &quot;useful idiots&quot; will be done away with if and once their goal is completed and/or the leftist wakes up to the truth.</p>

<p>Read that.  You claim white genocide and then just show a changing market place for athletes which is what?   .0001% of the population?  NOT GENOCIDE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t come up with the term, but I believe that it&#39;s obviously a more gradual process and could eventually lead to genocide chiefly through interracial breeding. Since our society places such an emphasis on professional athletics and hip-hop/R&amp;B have become the most popular form of music, eventually white women will seek someone other than the while male to start a family, or at least that&#39;s the idea behind the scheme. As they stated in the first video: Anti-white propaganda and weaponized words (Racist, etc.) + Phenomenon = Psychological warfare (Us vs. them). There is a more immediate threat of genocide in South Africa, though. Sure, you can say the white people shouldn&#39;t have been there in the first place, but you could also say that about a lot of other races and places in the world. People are born into this world without a choice in any of their circumstances and I&#39;m just trying to understand mine.</p>

<p>No, not really.  White Farmers in South Africa is not a white genocide.  </p>

<p>I would have never said that but I would still say that you have no proven even a remote idea of a possible future genocide,</p>

<hr/>

<p>A lot of white folks (my people) need something to mean something in their life.  They need their world war or their fight against fascism or their institutionalized racism but they have none of that.  So instead they, especially the younger folks, grasp for any things that even seems remotely like a cross for them to bear be it feminism or black empowerment or immigrants getting into the country- all of it becomes a fake &#39;us versus the world&#39; idea that they use to....<em>(drum roll)</em></p>

<p>Act like victims.  If you can be the victim then you have a cause!</p>

<p>I was there too.  I know what you are going through (I&#39;m 48).</p>

<p>But if your existential crisis blames anything outside yourself or looks at things going on outside yourself, then you are missing a huge opportunity.  The real answer to finding meaning is talking a deep and unflinchingly accurate view of yourself and then acting to change yourself, grow yourself and find ways to bring the joy out of yourself.</p>

<p>The outside world isn&#39;t to blame it&#39;s American culture the last 40 years that has hurt the growth of young adults when they most need support: latch key kids, both parents working, being alone, isolated, having no good close family type role model...all of it leading to a lost existence and to turning towards self loathing and then loathing the other.</p>

<p>Focus on the self.  Be honest with your flaws and try to make more of your life.  If i can do anyone can :)</p>
