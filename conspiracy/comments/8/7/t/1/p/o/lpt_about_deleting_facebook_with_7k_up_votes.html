<p>Here is the text he had written in the post.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>

<p>I thought this would be a good place to tell you about my experience in wiping my facebook account completely and also deleting the account entirely.</p>

<p>Now I am not here to tell you that you should or to argue with anyone about why. You will know if this choice is right for you, don&#39;t just do it because everyone else did because there is a lot of history there. I have actually been thinking about doing this for a long time and the reason I put it off for so long was that I still used Facebook to communicate with some of the lads who play in my band.</p>

<p>I thought a bit of a guide and walk through of what I did would be helpful because wiping the account is anything but easy. There are a lot of little things that you need to do. The good news is a lot of this can be automated so lets begin. I am sure I could have sped it up further if I wrote some scripts but in this case I did not do so.</p>

<p>I also know that you can just delete the account outright and Facebook says it will be gone forever after 14 days. But, to be fair I don&#39;t see any guarantee of that and I think a lot of other people like me might prefer to do it manually then close it. Again, up to you if you want to do this. Once you do this, this stuff is gone and it&#39;s gone forever!</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t sure then perhaps deactivate for a month and see if you can go without Facebook for a while.</p>

<p>When I was doing this I did feel a bit sad because its a long walk down memory lane and I did feel a bit of doubt but I pushed through anyway because I knew I had my data and photos backed up.</p>

<p>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</p>

<p>Step 1</p>

<p>Request an Archive and download all of your data. Once it&#39;s ready download it onto your computer or OneDrive, Google Drive and keep it safe. No point in losing all of your photos? Just remember this downloads &quot;YOUR&quot; data. It does not download all the photos that friends have taken and tagged you in. I&#39;ll get onto tagging later.</p>

<p>Step 2</p>

<p>First of all what I did was use a little program add on for Chrome called &quot;Social Book Post Manager&quot;</p>

<p>Once this is installed you just have to go to your activity log and tell it to delete all of your activity from top to bottom. This will take a while, especially if you post a lot of stuff (which I did for about 2 out of 10 years). Now because there is so much you will likely find that stuff gets missed. So it&#39;s a good idea to run this again. AND DON&#39;T FIDDLE with it while it&#39;s running. You basically want to clear the whole activity log down the left hand side. The Add-In will delete the basic data but it won&#39;t remove everything. Go into various sub categories. Use the utility as much as you can. It works on most of them. Also make sure you uncheck the &quot;Review&quot; box.</p>

<p>Step 3</p>

<p>Once you have used the utility you will have to get to the harder bit. This is basically going through the stuff people have tagged you in and removing the tag.</p>

<p>NOW REMEMBER YOUR DATA DOES NOT INCLUDE PHOTOS AND CONTENT THAT OTHERS HAVE POSTED AND TAGGED YOU IN. You can&#39;t delete that stuff but you can remove the tag. If you want to download this stuff you will have to save it manually from your friends facebook account. There were lots of photos of me on stage posted by my band mates and I was tagged in them. I saved some of these manually. Go through and remove all the tags.</p>

<p>Now I had some issues with some things being untagged so I sometimes had to click &quot;Remove Tag&quot; then select &quot;This is annoying or not interesting&quot; then click on remove the tag. Luckily there weren&#39;t many of these.</p>

<p>This took me about 2-3 hours total. Remember use all the Activity log categories down the site. Things like &quot;Posts your tagged in&quot; &quot;Other peoples posts to your timeline&quot; &quot;Photos your tagged in&quot; Clear it all!!! Notes, videos you&#39;ve watched, polls, search history. Wipe it CLEAAAAN!!</p>

<p>Step 4</p>

<p>Remove all app access to your facebook account. Any app like spotify or Nike+, basically anything you signed up using your facebook account with. You will need to strip this out of here. But before you do you might want to make sure you have a username and password to access it outside of facebook. You can achieve this by either signing up for a new account or doing password resets.</p>

<p>Step 5</p>

<p>Go into messenger and delete all your conversations, go into the Archive and delete all that from there. (There was a time when delete meant archive so they will probably be stuff in here too). I also went into Settings and &quot;Ads&quot; and deleted all the info they had collected on what I was into like video games, cats and music etc&quot;</p>

<p>Step 6</p>

<p>Unfriend everyone. I know you&#39;re a little heartbreaker. Break all those friendships and finally I also went through and deleted all my other info (there wasn&#39;t much to be honest). Stuff like where I live, phone numbers, place I work etc which Facebook had picked up over the years.</p>

<p>Step 7</p>

<p>Delete your account. Go into settings and delete it (This takes 14 days). Just be aware that once it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone (apparently). Once you delete and it logs you out, don&#39;t log back in because it will ask you reactivate. So make sure you are signed out of everything, on your devices, desktops and browsers. Sign out of everything, then DELETE.</p>

<p>Anyway I hope someone else finds this guide useful. If there is anything I may have missed out then let me know and I&#39;ll add it to the post.</p>

<p>EDIT: Step numbering.</p>

<p>Update: I know a lot of you are saying that it is probably never truly gone and there are no guarantees that Facebook deletes your data. This I acknowledge. But if anything this gave me a chance to reflect on a few things like:</p>

<p>What I have submitted over the years
What controls I have at my disposal to delete and control what is currently on facebook.
How it affects my life and my mood and how I interact with others.</p>

<p>One thing is for certain. Data is the lifeblood of facebook and they won&#39;t be getting any more of it from me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP here. Highjacking top comment. Sorry</p>

<p>I asked for reason and it was due to title and a rule about social media which wasn&#39;t listed in the sidebar at the time. This was automatic originally.</p>

<p>I asked the mods why because the rule about social media posts wasn&#39;t there and they agreed to allow it. Then it blew up like mad and after a few hours it was taken down.</p>

<p>I didnt get a reason originally. I had to ask and when I did i got the following explanation:</p>

<p>Issues with title
It was generating a lot of user reports
It was generating a lot of &quot;copycat&quot; and &quot;meta&quot; posts whatever that means</p>

<p>I personally replied to about 50 peope asking for the original text.</p>

<p>Also i realise that Onedrive and Google drive is not the best place to store your archive zip from facebook. But at least i could have encrypted it before uploading it there.</p>

I allowed it originally since it was so timely but our rules require that LPTs  be fully contained in the title of the post with exposition left to comments and that they be succinct.  with them copycat, joke and troll meta posts that followed, we diected op to repost in <a href="/r/you">/r/you</a> should know.

    <div class="md"><p>Why are there rules for listing &quot;Steps&quot; in a process? Seems a little much don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>My big problem with the removal was the fact you guys did it, and didn&#39;t list a reason why or anything. Looking at all other posts that you guys remove, you always have a comment explaining as such. Why did you choose not to do it here?</p>

<p>fully contained in the title. 
It was a post about deleting Facebook, in my opinion. It was succint. About as succint as it could be, given how convoluted deleting Facebook actually is. </p>

<p>numbered lists.</p>

<p>So purely because it&#39;s a difficult subject, it&#39;s not allowed? </p>

<p>How else are you supposed to document deleting Facebook without using a numbered list? </p>

<p>troll posts that followed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what reason is that for removing the thread? Troll posts aren&#39;t the fault of the OP.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, your explanation is simply not good enough. Re-open the thread.</p>

<p>because fuck facebook. that is why i allowed it in the first place. the problem with allowing rule breaking posts is be they propagate rule breaking posts.</p>

<p>Of the many things to choose, you went through their profile and know they are deleting comments.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what worries you?  Hah.</p>

<p>Ask them a better question.  Like why they built 800 subs.  Why they have been modding for 10 years.  Why they want the power and feel like it is some great thing to be an internet mod.</p>

<p>Deleting a comment though.  Bleh.  Also I know why they delete comments, because of people like you who go through comment history and try to lord it over others.</p>

<p>so true, most mods on reddit are abusing/cheating power, and act like a fucking nasty little bitch. This is why reddit are bad, little people can have a power.</p>

<p>They created many accounts, and pick one of the account become mods of their own subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeh as said above I can almost guarantee the second you make a post / like a photo / send a message, it is permanently logged on fbs end and deleting it on your end does nothing. As for going forward though I think its a great move.</p>

<p>When Facebook now comes out and says it’s giving you an option to permanently delete all your history it just seems so obviously fake just to calm down the masses. Nothing to see here folks, fb is on the job securing your private data, btw if your not doing anything wrong what do you got to worry about right? So many people seem to take this approach.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do people seem to not have foreseen this recent debacle? Why do people even use Fecebook, given the nature of that beast? Not to offend anyone, but by using Fecebook, folks just walk right into treachery. The only reason why I have (and log in to semi-annually, at most) a Fecebook account is because someone was pretending to be me on Fecebook. (And I don&#39;t even want to be me on Fecebook.) I have one post on it, have never permitted incoming followers nor messages, and have only logged-in via a location-cloaking VPN. That there had been ample documentation of Fecebook&#39;s having been created and funded by the CIA was a factor in my trepidation toward Fecebook, but I had learned enough negative lessons from MySpace (which was mild by comparison) before it to know that I wanted no part of Fecebook - and vice-versa. Unless FB has atoned and finally done something right and honest by changing its ways, no account is ever completely deleted - just &quot;deactivated.&quot; </p>
