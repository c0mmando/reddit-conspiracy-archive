       These "march for our lives" theatrics are hilariously ill-conceived.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Hogg is at the center, putting on his act, like a good crisis actor/"journalism" spook would.
Good little FBI boy. Keep practicing your lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind marching against drunk driving, suicide, gang banging, or opiod over-prescription..
Thats what I'd do if I was REALLY marching for life in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       These kids are not marching for their lives. They're just marching around to someone's
       <em>
        tune
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       With the "grass roots" impetus (planned propaganda campaign) mustered by FBI boy, these kids have been dragged into a political struggle by adults, used as an appeal to emotion, and got an "out of school" pass to go "protest" (which is a huge liability) even though they cant even vote. 
Or legally sign documents. 
Which is the case for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they're egged on by 24/7 coverage with sensational headlines
"March for
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       lives"
"Am
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       Next"
See the appeal to emotion?
      </p>
      <p>
       In maryland there was a shooting and the shooter was killed within seconds by a stationed officer..with a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess how much coverage that got.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a coordinated propaganda campaign in full force that ignores anything contra-narrative. 
Like those same kids complaining about mandatory clear backpacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love it, especially knowing how Amazon acquired the Washington Post
Or Anderson Cooper's "short time" with the CIA. The AP is an echo-chamber of propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concentrated, coordinated propaganda.
Repeal the Smith Mundt Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know about why the Parkland shooting happened, I'll give you some hints: Ukranian girls under 18, low-light cameras, compromised russian diplomats, Miami Mamas, 6166 NW 80th, Lynda Marie Kumbatovich Cruz, Irina Rostova, EB5 Visas, Bernie Whisenant, "Peter Wang."
      </p>
      <p>
       These kids, David Hogg included, are not normal kids. They're homegrown operatives and their school is a cover for their training.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats what the Miami Mama program was for. It was for raising kids as weapons. Ask Lynda Marie
       <em>
        Kumbatovich
       </em>
       Cruz if she was a Miami Mama. Oh wait, you can't, she's dead. Ask the son.. oh wait.. he was a "professional school shooter."
Ask David Hogg, or will he give you his "Journalism" spin? Ask "Peter Wang" if that's his real name.. oh wait. What about Meadow
       <em>
        Pollack
       </em>
       or Jamie
       <em>
        Guttenberg
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder about this school's "journalism" department or their "ROTC" program led by Peter Mahmood. Peter Wang and Nick Cruz got great rifle training with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Parkland superintendant's brother defrauded the fed of $6B in "student aid." The police look away and let their operatives commit felonies.
These people are crooks and their school is infiltrated by spooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, at least the police department got $500M. Maybe they'll try to intervene next time. Hush money is great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sloppy work.
Never letting a crisis go to waste will be their downfall.

       Edit: you guys are entirely missing the point. You're being lied to on a national scale by talking heads who have successfully shifted the conversation to safety&gt;freedom and will do whatever it takes to keep it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not about respecting the opinions of kids, they're not allowed to vote for a reason. Their opinion is premature in the eyes of democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're a conduit for equivocation and manipulation. Think for yourselves, but i'll advise you that letting emotion and kids lead a national discussion is unhealthy for maintaining a constitutional republic. It's all "based on a true story." Understand what "propaganda" is and how much time and money is spent on active measures as such.

       So it’s fake because you have different beliefs than them?

       Also not going to take the time to go through and point out everything incorrect you said, but the Maryland shooter killed himself, he was not stopped by an in school police officer.

       Good question. How do any of us know if we are wrong or right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying you are absolutely wrong, mind you. But you might be a little wrong or a lot wrong.  You also might be absolutely right. The question I cant answer, and maybe you can, is how do we know for certain if we are right or wrong about
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems we base our beliefs/opinions/ideologies/morals/values on what we have learned in our culture. We get our values/morals from our culture. We are taught what to think, what to value, what is moral or immoral.  We filter all of our thoughts/ideas/beliefs through this cultural filter.  We cannot help it, this is just how our brains work.  And our culture (not just ours, but all cultures) comes from events that have happened in the past and how our ancestors felt about those events, interpreted those events.  We know our ancestors were not always right about everything because we know that is just not possible. They were uneducated, superstitious. So certainly some of our current culture has been infected with their incorrect interpretations and reactions to past events.  We base our present on our past. Our past is our foundation.  What if our ancestors were wrong? What if our foundation is wrong? What if our morals/values/ideas/beliefs are wrong because they are based on bad ideas and information? How would we ever know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, maybe we, as a society, slowly resolve some of the errors over a long period of time, but we still do not know at any given time what ideas we hold true are actually wrong.  What do we believe today that will be known as false in 5 years, 100 years, 1000 years?  We dont know.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you and I are wrong because we have no way of knowing if we are right.

       And yet you go through the same process watching the media.
They're not "anecdotes," they're circumstantial pieces of evidence. The only "false" info is maryland, but in light of MOUNTAINS of false info on MSM, take it all with a grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       All information is propaganda. "Good" and "bad" information. It leads you in a direction.
      </p>

       So according to the article the officer did intervene with his gun and shot the suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the suspect shot themself at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they only did so after being confronted by the officer. They were wandering the halls freely before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the good person with the gun stopped it.

       2a is important. I'll be blunt. This conversation leads to me being accused of valuing 2a more than  I value the lives of students. I value my own life. If you want to say that means guns&gt;kids. Sure guns&gt;kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, say guns are banned. Do you really think people are going to turn in guns when a $1000 gun becomes a $10,000 gun overnight?  The anti-gun movement is a joke.

       said the Maryland shooter was stopped by a good guy with a gun. When people on the other side of the aisle as you point out how mentally unstable pro-gun advocates can be I'm not so sure but then I read something like what you have written and wonder if your side is too far gone to even have a meaningful conversation. This is a national discussion that should involve both pro and anti-gun control views but when you use rhetoric like already stated you are removing yourself from that discussion.

       This is a canned response. I don’t know if your just copying it from someone or if more then one of you have been told the same talking pints but this exact grouping of sentences keeps appearing all over the place. I’ve seen in mainly on here but even on other subs when the conversation comes up it’s the exact same canned response.

       In reference to the goals of the March for our lives campaign:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         -Fund research and Gun Violence Prevention/Intervention Programs.-   The President signed a new spending bill Friday March 23rd which allows the CDC to allow funding and research into the causes of gun violence in America. (many researchers are not hopeful research will reveal new information) The National Institute for Justice released the 2018 solicitation which includes Investigator Initiated Research and Evaluation on Firearms Violence, slated for May 2018.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -eliminate absurd restrictions on the ATF- this calls for a digitization of records by the ATF, which is already in place. Within the ATF they maintain several databases with information (NTC) some of that information includes sales reports, as of 2011 they had roughly 4.2 million of such records (even though the National Firearms Act forbids a keeping of a registry). This request also calls for annual inventory checks of gun dealers. As part of federal law the ATF may do compliance once per year, currently they are only conducting annual inspections on roughly 7% of the dealers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -universal background checks- 20 states currently require background checks on either handguns or long guns or both in private sales. US Federal Law currently requires all purchasers of gun sales from federally licensed dealers to undergo a background check.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       4.-High Capacity Magazine Ban- There are currently 7 states that ban high capacity magazines. The 1994 congressional ban on magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition expired in 2004 and was not renewed. Currently, high capacity ammunition magazines are legal unless banned by state or local governments, 7 such states do have bans in place for said magazines.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.-Limit firing power on the streets- The 1994 federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act did ban assault weapons, that law also had a sunset clause and was not renewed in 2004. It is now up to the states to ban such weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would appear that all of these goals have been addressed by individual states as well as the nation as a whole.

       Its not propaganda entirely, the media and our masters will allow certain protests to take center stage, guns, abortion. These issues don't effect pocket books and the war machine or their addiction to pedophilia. Once this movement adopts a more global anti-weapons anti-war message, it will be squashed. Just like the message of MLK Jr., Bradley Manning, Malala, the list goes on and on.

       Propoganda is not the word you mean. It does not mean lies although it could include lies. It doesn't mean anything other than promotion. Selective facts are propoganda. You can propogandize with the truth though.

       People use fake-news and propaganda as if they are synonyms nowaday. That's probably the thing I blame Trump for, most. We now live in a world where words no longer have a meaning.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Propaganda is information that is not objective and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.
       </p>

       If all info is propaganda, then this post is propaganda! You would be guilty of what you're accusing these protesters of.
