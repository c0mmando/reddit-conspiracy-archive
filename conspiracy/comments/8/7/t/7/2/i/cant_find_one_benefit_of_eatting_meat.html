The Inuit have little voice as gardens don&#39;t fair well in snow packs, but they need plenty of calories to survive in cold climates. Lacking some vitimins it makes eating the organs a necessity too. </p>

<p>Dr. Weston A Price traveled the world trying to understand why he was seeing so many tooth caries and malformed jaws and over crowded teeth in industrialized nations but in primitive ones with no modern dentistry (1930s any way) had healthy and strong teeth, wide and fill jaws that had plenty of room for them to grow straight and true. Including wisdom teeth which most of us must have pulled now.  I was lucky not to have any form at all.</p>

Blood is even worse than meat, I&#39;ve heard, and should be avoided.

<p>That said I do thinl that meat has benefits plants do not offer. I&#39;ve read it somewhere that when monkeys were fed an all vegetarian diet in captivity, they would not really reproduce, but would do so with the addition of a small amount of meat in their diet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I actually prefer sashimi. Raw fish ia delicious. Unseasoned meats are delicious too, especially red meats. Moreso if not factory farmed, as the meat takes on flavor from whatever the animal has been eating, namely not corn.</p>

<p>Your claim that our closest relatives are vegan is entirely untrue. Not sure how this discussion can progress any further until you accept this. I have looked into the diets of various primates. I even went in expecting to learn that they eat nothing but plant material, but it is simply not true. Chimps especially go on hunts specifically to eat meat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost any veggie isn&#39;t eaten raw, but prepared in some way and seasoned.</p>

<p>Also our bodies were made to eat meat. There is no way around that. Monkeys sleep outside shut and don&#39;t wash their hands afterwards. We&#39;re a completely different species. It&#39;s not out of line at all.</p>

<p>Heck if we were living like monkeys we&#39;d be dead. Humanity went through a plaque losing a third of its population because of unsanitary living conditions. I&#39;m sure meat eating isn&#39;t the issue.</p>

<p>Western diseases come from the hormones and preservatives in our foods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s actual legit ecological reasons for proper pastured meat of ruminants. Also, limited use of pigs and chickens if they can derive their food sustainably from the local environment and/or waste food products generated from humans.</p>

<p>Like, calculations of water &#39;wasted&#39; on beef often count rain water used to grow grass as water used for producing the beef despite the obvious issue in considering such consumption waste. Of course, the vast majority of beef sold isn&#39;t raised exclusively or even primarily on grass, but that&#39;s not an argument against beef in general, just specific forms of animal husbandry(which are monstrous and fucked up no argument here).</p>
