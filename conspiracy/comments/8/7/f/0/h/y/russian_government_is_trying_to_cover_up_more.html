        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Credit to <a href="/u/Max_Stern">/u/Max_Stern</a>, copied at timestamp of this comment. To add I did not come up with this theory <a href="/u/Max_Stern">/u/Max_Stern</a> did. I figured this would be a good place for it to be seen and I self posted so if the old comment was deleted it could still be found. </p>

<p>This shopping mall had cinema inside on the 4th floor with 3 halls. March 25 is the premiere day for some cartoons in Russia so some school (maybe schools, idk) organized a trip for their children, they took buses to drive them there. Children were accompanied by their teacher and one other man (maybe woman, no info) but they (teacher and other) didn&#39;t want to see these films so they told cinema stuff to block the doors of two halls so children can&#39;t run from halls to somewhere unattended. Then they went shopping while children were watching the films.</p>

<p>Ministry of Emergency Situations tells that fire probably occurred because of gas tank that was used to cook popcorn or something, that&#39;s what you see on the gif.</p>

<p>Fire spread rapidly and the most important part that fire alarm didn&#39;t work. Today government told like some stuff member disabled the signal when alarm activated or smth like that but other people say that there was no fire alarm signal at all. There is also an information that shopping mall owners paid to someone in city government to avoid installing the fire alarm, fire detectors were just fake piece of plastic.
Actually people tell that they didn&#39;t know about the fire until they heard that someone is shouting.</p>

<p>Remember these two blocked halls in the cinema? Nobody opened them, children and their parents (mostly women) were just blocked inside the cinema. They were burnt alive, that&#39;s not what you see in this post but that&#39;s how they met the death. Wives were calling their husbands and telling that they are blocked and that they will die because they can&#39;t escape, emergency exits were somehow blocked as well (idk about it).</p>

<p>When rescuers arrived they were acting slowly, telling to people outside that there are no people in the cinema (idk maybe they assumed that everybody left the shopping mall already because it&#39;s not like we don&#39;t have evacuation plans) but that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Example of cinema hall before and after: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KFt6SRb.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/KFt6SRb.jpg</a>
Amount of tickets when the fire occured: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WqZnJtc.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/WqZnJtc.jpg</a></p>

<p>People don&#39;t believe the government now, officials say that 64 died but actually there were way more people inside the cinema and parents sign an NDA when they go to identify the corpses so I assume that this is true. Some sources say that more than 350 people died, mostly children.
I just saw an interview with man who lost his wife, 3 children and his sister, he was saying the same, rescuers were acting fucking slowly at first, they ignored people who was saying about blocked children in the cinema; Later, when the fire was extinguished and they began a search operation, they were taking out bodies non-stop, police wasn&#39;t allowing people to see this, office workers in building on the opposite of the street were forbidden to take pictures or videos; it&#39;s 300-350 dead people, city morgues are full, parents sign NDAs, etc.</p>

<p>And yes, on the national television they don&#39;t even say that doors were blocked, they just omit this part, only one channel said that «the doors were tightly closed» (wtf??).</p>

<p>It&#39;s really, really bad, sadly I can&#39;t translate everything I read and see, amount of information is huge and all this information and videos are in Russian obviously but the situation is way worse.
There are screenshots of chat groups in VK social network where some young girl (like 14 yo) says «we are on fire ... probably goodbye».</p>

<p>I mean, I just wanted to share some info because even Russian citizens don&#39;t get the truth from official sources, I just visit all these Telegram channels, WhatsApp groups, etc, where people from Kemerovo tell about this situation.</p>

<p>I apologize for text mistakes, hard to quickly put all of this together -- english isn&#39;t my native obviously.</p>

<p>Edit 1: the teacher who accompanied the children probably evacuated, some people say that they saw her on the street, current location is unknown.
Edit 2: shopping mall from above <a href="https://russian.rt.com/russia/video/496344-53-pogibli-tc-kemerovo">https://russian.rt.com/russia/video/496344-53-pogibli-tc-kemerovo</a>
Edit 3: some more pics <a href="https://imgur.com/a/LJwNk">https://imgur.com/a/LJwNk</a> (the roof collapsed), the last pic is the one of cinema halls. You see, zero chances.
Edit 4: clarified edit #1, it&#39;s not official that she evacuated, sorry, my mistake.</p>

<p>Edit 5, about proofs + more videos: Reddit is banning all links to vk[dot]com so I can&#39;t put links there but I replied to some user with proofs almost immediately, my comment was just shadow-deleted

<p>Edit 6: Meanwhile, as RIA Novosti writes, the number of victims in Kemerovo has already been recognized as one of the largest in the last 100 years in Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not what I&#39;m hearing at all. Do you have links to the stories that say the fire started in the cinema?</p>

<p>From BBC article:</p>

<p>The fire broke out at about 17:00 (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. Some 660 emergency personnel were deployed in the rescue effort.</p>

<p>Deputy governor Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in the children&#39;s trampoline room.</p>

<p>&quot;The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia.</p>

<p>Russia&#39;s commissioner for children&#39;s rights, Anna Kuznetsova, has blamed negligence, and called for urgent safety checks at similar entertainment complexes.</p>

<p>Two witnesses told BBC Russian that they had seen the fire blazing in the trampoline room on the fourth floor but had not heard any fire alarm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, witness Anna Zarechneva told Russian RBC News that &quot;a woman burst into the cinema during the film and shouted &#39;Fire! Fire!&#39;, and we started running out&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The lights didn&#39;t come on in there to help us escape. We got out by following the floor lighting. But at that point no alarm bells were ringing. I only heard an alarm when I reached the first floor.&quot;</p>

<p>Just Google it? You have to translate Russian mass media if you want to get somewhat recent info but there is an BBC article that says that doors were blocked.&quot;</p>

<p>How can I be refuting his story if he&#39;s using the same article for some of his information.</p>

<p>I found the links to all the other information he provided...no thanks to you.</p>
