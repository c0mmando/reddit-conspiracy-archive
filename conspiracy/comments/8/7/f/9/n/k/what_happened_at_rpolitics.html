        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In light of the recent political landscape, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> users became so vehement in their political arguments, that they drove away users to argue with.  They created an echo chamber in their sub, this bored them, as these people come to reddit to argue with others.  </p>

<p>So they came here.  </p>

<p>What used to be a sub about discussing aliens, sasquatch, illuminati, and other cool stuff has devolved into perpetual political theatre.  Why? Because that&#39;s what <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> users want.  </p>

<p>People used to discuss personal theories and experiences, now people accuse eachother of being shills.  This place is constantly called T_D 2.0, despite the fact that any comment supporting Trump is downvoted into oblivion.  The T_Ders mostly left here when we discovered Trump was a warmonger and a Goldman puppet.  </p>

<p>What we have now is an army of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> users foaming at the mouth, desperate to attack and argue, so they&#39;ve turned to attacking the sub as a whole.  Everyday I see fellow <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users I used to have discussions with getting downvoted into silence, while hordes of douchebags with superiority complexes, calling out conspiracies and parroting mainstream narratives are inexplicably upvoted.  </p>

<p>Guys, I&#39;m afraid the diagnosis isn&#39;t good, we&#39;ve got cancer, and it&#39;s called <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, that&#39;s because the same thing happened here, or almost. Standard takeover - boot everyone, put your own people in at the top, then re-add previous mods further down, where they can always be countermanded if they try anything.</p>

<p>The difference between politics and here is the discrepancy at the top of the list, ie axo. That&#39;s why we&#39;re still dealing with the daily deluge of trolls, rather than being fully controlled like r/politics. Also why most all of axo&#39;s threads get cratered by the -30 brigade, and why the sad sub have made it their mission to wind him up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, hadn&#39;t heard that. Doesn&#39;t really answer the question of what he may or may not have stopped. Unless you mean you don&#39;t think he&#39;s stopped booting out everyone in this sub, which doesn&#39;t really follow since he&#39;s no longer a mod. I guess we&#39;ll breeze past that, hey.</p>

<p>And back to the original point, can you concede that modlists where everyone has near-identical appointment dates are evidence of takeovers, or at least takeover attempts, or at least some sort of power struggle fuckery? Unless I&#39;m misunderstanding, you were pointing to this sub&#39;s modlist as evidence that it could just be happenstance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree with you that it is. Flytape booted out everyone in this sub so he could take it over with dronepuppet and sarahconnor. Reddit added everyone back, and that&#39;s why every mod on this sub has the same add date. </p>

<p>And one of the mods from the poltics sub already came in here and said that someone from their mod team also tried doing something similar. </p>

<p>I believe there is still an effort to remove some of the mods of this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect he&#39;d see it differently ;) And certainly from the dramaposts I&#39;ve seen there was at least one other faction at work - GhostofDusty, SoverignMan, presumably others. They were the ones pushing for curation, whereas the only line I remember from flytape was along the lines of &#39;keep r/conspiracy scrappy&#39; - which it always was, and ought to be.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a bit tricky to take apart though, as wrapped up in ego and animosity as it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, seems I didn&#39;t have the full story. And still don&#39;t, tbh, it&#39;s all terrifically involved and there&#39;s only so much drama I can trawl through before I start getting queasy. </p>

<p>Safe to say I had the wrong end of the stick though, in the post you replied to. Now I&#39;m not sure what to think, other than I should really stop mucking about investigating the history of a conspiracy sub modlist and do some of that work I&#39;m employed to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics has always been heavily liberal/democrat users. Just saying. </p>

<p>But, when ever people complain about political posts here, it seems like they are always implying about political posts that make republicans or Trump look bad. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t complain about too many political posts about the DNC or Clinton or other liberals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were a lot of threads of pro-Trump stuff coming out after the election for a while, after his appointment of warhawk John Bolton, though, I highly doubt we will see much more.  </p>

<p>People are <strong>massively</strong> complaining about DNC stuff now, just try mentioning pizzagate.  The front page was just recently filled with posts debunking Seth Rich as the wikileaks whistleblower.  It&#39;s now apparently somebody called Guccifer, despite the fact that he never even gave anything to wikileaks..  Nobody complains about Hillary because she was a cunt and deserved everything she got.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Rich was the leaker, just that the popular opinion has massively changed, despite the fact that no evidence has definitively proven he <em>wasn&#39;t</em> the leaker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t just the users, I suspect the mods are involved too. My guess is we were getting close into something that was bothering TPTB and they torpedoed the sub with politics. I miss my aliens and Tesla stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true. I was banned at r/politics and I&#39;ll admit I look forward to shutting these mouth breathing morons down. Their sub does not prepare them for battle like T_D does. It&#39;s like shooting fish in a barrel when they are stupid enough to comment. Mostly they down vote and move on. Very sad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not helping that mods don&#39;t ban political BS posts. </p>

<p>Politics is by definition &#39;conspiracy&#39;, this is the point of real politics, politicians get together and push agendas. </p>

<p>IMO this sub should ban all political &#39;theories&#39;, or we need to create <a href="/r/nonpoliticalconspiracies">/r/nonpoliticalconspiracies</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>we all saw <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> being taken over and used as propaganda. (honestly it still seems that way)</p>

<p>there were multiple points during the election year that you could see the sub being controlled. most noticeably were the day hilary fainted while getting in a car. and election night.</p>

<p>I can go looking for the threads, but basically it seemed like the sub had no direction on what their narrative should be. no idea how to spin the story.(I believe it was a sunday) the entire thread ended up being 50% genuine conversations and the other 50% people amazed on how peaceful the sub was.</p>

<p>then literally the next day the sub went back to being propaganda. </p>

<p>same thing happened on election night when trump won. it was again mostly genuine conversations and people shocked at how civil the sub was.</p>

<hr/>

<p>what proof is there? none, just anecdotal proof. but it doesn&#39;t take much to realize that sub is just a mirror of t_d. another echo chamber for the opposite team. </p>
