    <div class="md"><p>At the very least, it&#39;s clear that Trump is no swamp drainer. As David Icke put it &#39;Swamps aren&#39;t drained by those who have spent their life swimming in it&#39;. Increasingly under Trump events are transpiring which reek of Cabal agenda. Only the dolts who have given their mind away to Q Anon and given up critical thinking believe him to be some kind of &#39;threat&#39; to the establishment. The media campaign against him, and the Q Anon psy-op, are simply to maintain the illusion the humanity is being saved by this &#39;outsider&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the life of me I have never been able to figure out how people in the conspiracy world latched onto Trump. These are people who are pretty critical thinkers for the most part. Did they just take him at his word that he would &quot;drain the swamp&quot;? There is and never was anything about this man that says anything other than &quot;more of the same old shit, if not worse&quot;. What did they see in this guy that gave them any hope?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human trafficking arrests are not skyrocketing. What we are seeing is actually a drop in the ocean, low level scum - nowhere near, not even close to - the full extent of it. What you are seeing is a carrot being dangled for you to gnaw on while WWIII and the final stages to implement the new world order are worked towards. </p>

<p>Also, legislation is being worked on which is going to completely explode the mass censorship of social media and the internet, as well as sweep potential evidence of child trafficking online under the rug, essentially putting kids more at risk -- look into the FOSTA-SESTA package - <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@thehoneybee/fosta-sesta-will-destroy-us-all">https://steemit.com/news/@thehoneybee/fosta-sesta-will-destroy-us-all</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you found the switch or the con I should say. This is how they tie people up and control them. I would have to say that from what I can see on the surface is that trump is in fact doing the opisit of what the swamp tends to do. If Q is a larp then guess what? It&#39;s an actual functioning larp that has put eyes on a host of nefarious people doing highly questionable things. From top to bottom, the information has been dug up and spread to the point it&#39;s touching main stream. The amount of shills and bots also attacking, further prove there is validation. </p>
