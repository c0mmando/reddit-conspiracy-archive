<p>WTF? apparently (Monsanto&#39;s?) glyphosate has been found in vaccines?</p>

<p>and glyphosate is frequently implicated as a cause of autism in the mainstream media </p>

<p>but vaccines are also frequently implicated as cause of autism by droves of parents during #HearThisWell vaccine injury awareness campaign</p>

<p>so what&#39;s going on? </p>

<hr/>

<p>i have been researching the causes of autism since August 28, 2014, the day the CDC whistleblower Dr William Thompson made his press release</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/tbsii10xufiz.png">https://i.redd.it/tbsii10xufiz.png</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>officially, there is no known cause of autism</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism</a></p>

<p>but the establishment is adamant that the one thing they know for sure is that vaccines DO NOT cause autism</p>

<p>and the official story is that autism is thought to be caused by some vague mixture of genetics and environment</p>

<hr/>

<p>there may be some truth to the genetic component, </p>

<p>as people with MTHFR gene do not detox well, making it hard for them to detox after vaccines </p>

<p>Genetic basis for adverse events after smallpox vaccination:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680</a></p>

<p>see also DME Drug Metabolizing Enzymes </p>

<p><a href="http://www.iversongenetics.com/dme-genotype.html">http://www.iversongenetics.com/dme-genotype.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of drugs are metabolized through the liver. The liver&#39;s primary mechanism for metabolizing drugs is the P450 cytochrome system of enzymes which include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. Over 50% of the most commonly prescribed medications today are metabolized through the P450 System. Not all patients respond appropriately to a standard, One Size Fits All dose. DNA testing provides a lifetime of protection against drug toxicity or lack of drug efficacy. This simple genetic test, which looks at liver enzymes, will determine your patient&#39;s drug sensitivity.</p>

<hr/>

<p>and there may be some truth to the environmental component, but in an unexpected way</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunologic_adjuvant">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunologic_adjuvant</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In immunology, an adjuvant is a component that potentiates the immune responses to an antigen and/or modulates it towards the desired immune responses. The word &quot;adjuvant&quot; comes from the Latin word adiuvare, meaning to help or aid.&quot;An immunologic adjuvant is defined as any substance that acts to accelerate, prolong, or enhance antigen-specific immune responses when used in combination with specific vaccine antigens.&quot;
A magazine article about vaccine adjuvants in 2007 was headlined &quot;Deciphering Immunology&#39;s Dirty Secret&quot; to refer to the early days of vaccine manufacture, when significant variations in the effectiveness of different batches of the same vaccine were observed, correctly assumed to be due to contamination of the reaction vessels. However, it was soon found that more scrupulous attention to cleanliness actually seemed to reduce the effectiveness of the vaccines, and that the contaminants – &quot;dirt&quot; – actually enhanced the immune response. There are many known adjuvants in widespread use, including oils, aluminium salts, and virosomes.</p>

<p>Adjuvants in immunology are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine by stimulating the immune system to respond to <strong>the vaccine</strong> more vigorously</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>however, <strong>the vaccine</strong> does not consist only of the antigen that we are vaccinating against,</p>

<p>but also of a long list of weird ingredients,</p>

<p>including peanut oil as a carrier</p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vaccines+peanut+allergy">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vaccines+peanut+allergy</a>  </p>

<p>TLDR: the adjuvant in vaccine sensitizes immune system to the supposedly inert peanut oil in vaccine, which is why there is a man-made peanut allergy epidemic</p>

<hr/>

<p>the adjuvant sensitizes the immune system to everything in the vaccine, including the adjuvant/ingredients in future vaccines, which is why we sometimes see a child react worse and worse with each subsequent vaccine </p>

<p>i had been aware of this phenomenon for many years and was happy to discover it has a technical name, &quot;anaphylaxis&quot;</p>

<p>but if you say &quot;vaccines cause anaphylaxis&quot; shills will show up to deny it   </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Causes:</p>

<p>Six vaccines (MMR, varicella, influenza, hepatitis B, tetanus, meningococcal) are recognized as a cause for anaphylaxis, and HPV may cause anaphylaxis as well</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>human DNA from aborted fetuses is also in vaccines</p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fetus+DNA+in+vaccine">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fetus+DNA+in+vaccine</a></p>

<p>so the adjuvant in vaccines sensitizes the immune system to human DNA, which may explain how vaccines caused the man-made epidemic of auto-immune disease</p>

<hr/>

<p>so Monsanto, Is there any medically, scientifically, or biologically plausible reason to put glyphosate in a vaccine?</p>

<p>i can&#39;t think of any legitimate reason, </p>

<p>however, knowing what you now know about how the adjuvant in vaccines sensitizes the immune system to all of the ingredients</p>

<p>and knowing that glyphosate is an ingredient in vaccines</p>

<p>we can reasonably suspect that the adjuvant in the vaccine also sensitizes the immune system to glyphosate </p>

<p>but the thing is, if i know this, and you know this, then certainly the vaccine makers know this...</p>

<p>why would the vaccine makers deliberately spike their vaccines with glyphosate, knowing the immune system will be sensitized to glyphosate?</p>

<p>is this a set-up to shift the blame for the cause of autism from vaccines to glyphosate? </p>

<p>From the caption below the image. Did you even read your own article.</p>

<p>I actually am familiar. That is why I asked for a scientific source from you that counters my knowledge on the subject. Please cite scientific evidence regarding the lasting residual effects of glyphosate on the environment. Once again, no blogs and no news articles. Actual scientific studies.</p>

<p>&quot;Glyphosate
  currently  has  the  highest  global  production  volume  of  all  herbicides.  The  largest  use<br/>
worldwide   is   in   agriculture.   The   agricultural   use   of   glyphosate   has   increased   sharpl
y   since   the<br/>
development  of  crops  that  have  been  genetically  modified  to  make  them  resistant  to  glyphosate.<br/>
Glyphosate is also used in forestry, urban, and home applications. Glyphosate has been detected in the 
air during spraying, in water, and in food. The general population is exposed primarily through residence 
near sprayed areas, home use, and diet&quot;</p>

<p>Incidentally these findings also indicate it is &quot;probably carcinogenic&quot; to humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Group 2A means that the agent is probably carcinogenic to humans. This category is used when there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Limited evidence means that a positive association has been observed between exposure to the agent and cancer but that other explanations for the observations (called chance, bias, or confounding) could not be ruled out. This category is also used when there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and strong data on how the agent causes cancer.</p>

<p>&quot;Glyphosate currently has the highest global production volume of all herbicides. The largest use
worldwide is in agriculture. The agricultural use of glyphosate has increased sharpl y since the
development of crops that have been genetically modified to make them resistant to glyphosate.
Glyphosate is also used in forestry, urban, and home applications. Glyphosate has been detected in the air during spraying, in water, and in food. The general population is exposed primarily through residence near sprayed areas, home use, and diet&quot;</p>

<p>Incidentally these findings also indicate it is &quot;probably carcinogenic&quot; to humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, it’s possible that regulators should take a fresh look at the toxicity of glyphosate with newer, better science, and with some newer findings (such as the higher persistence (than previously assumed) of the substance, and the fact that the substance may have other mechanisms that act via pathways found in vertebrates, and the fact that the chemical is being used in MUCH higher quantities and at higher frequencies than it was a decade ago). A healthy dose of skepticism is always healthy in the scientific community, and I’m sure you shouldn’t use glyphosate as the main ingredient in your potato salad.</p>

<p>But you’re ignoring the context of its reclassification, and blowing the consequences and implications of its usage way out of proportion.</p>

<p>Glyphosate was classified in group 2A based on substantial evidence in animals (rats, and to a lesser extent, pigs) , and limited evidence in humans. You know what else is classified as group 2A (probably carcinogenic) by IARC? </p>

<p>•Emissions from High-temperature frying</p>

<p>•emissions from household combustion of biomass fuel (primarily wood)</p>

<p>•occupational exposures in spraying and application of Non-arsenical insecticides</p>

<p>•Red meat</p>

<p>•Very hot beverages (more than 65• C) </p>

<p>•Being a barber/hairdresser</p>

<p>•Shift work that disrupts circadian rhythm.</p>

<p>•Glass manufacturing </p>

<p>You know what’s listed as group 1 (straight up carcinogenic)?</p>

<p>•Alcohol</p>

<p>•leather dust</p>

<p>•mineral oil</p>

<p>•salted fish </p>

<p>•processed meat</p>

<p>•soot</p>

<p>•shale oil</p>

<p>•sawdust</p>

<p>•silica dust</p>

<p>•many paints (containing benzene, which heavily used industrially)</p>

<p>Oh, and a host of viruses, radioactive materials, and random plants for both groups.</p>

<p>You’re (purposely) conflating “probably carcinogenic” (meaning, it may have certain properties, we don’t know, that if it is confirmed to have, would mean that it has the POTENTIAL to be at least a contributing factor of damage to certain aspects of a cell that would affect growth/regulation and lead to cancer) with “CAUSES CANCER” (in big flashing neon lights).</p>

<p>I didn’t mine a thread to say anything, I came across it while reading it- much in the same way you probably did when you left your first comment.  </p>

<p>Since you seem to be fond of checking users post histories, you’ll have probably seen for yourself  that I’ve been on this site for literal years, and I don’t look like a shill. </p>

<p>As for needlesintomatoes, think maybe the reason he’s always commenting about Monsanto is because he’s passionate about debunking the wide spread of uninformed conspiracy garbage? Or because he’s constantly under fire from an anti-GMO witch hunt? Maybe he doesn’t want to waste his time talking about GMO’s on the Internet, maybe he does, but I doubt he has much choice in the matter (outside of just abandoning his account).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.</p>

<p>The thread you came across is a month old, I posted my comments in the first 24-48 hours of its creation. You must have been intentionally looking for threads that contained Monsanto/Glyphosate, otherwise you purposely returned to this thread to post a rebuttal to my comment.</p>

<p>needlesintomatoes (who may or may not be your sock) clearly enjoys, or feels compelled to &quot;waste his time&quot; talking about GMO&#39;s, glyphosate, Monsanto et al based on the almost exclusive post history he has about these topics.</p>

<p>The age of my account is irrelevant, there is nothing to indicate shill or agenda based behavior in my post history (I didn&#39;t use Reddit for a long time and forgot my login when I came back to it so made a new account).</p>

<p>Now addressing what filled up the bulk of your post.</p>

<p>Even classifying glyphosate as &quot;probably carcinogenic&quot; has attracted somewhat fierce accusations by (totally not bought and paid for by Monsanto) U.S politicians that they excluded key information. However this &quot;key&quot; information was from unpublished studies, or studies not publicly available as opposed to publicly available published studies that it drew its data from (you know, data that the world can actually see and verify for themselves). As such WHO representatives firmly stood by their findings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/who-rebuts-house-committee-criticisms-about-glyphosate-cancer-warning">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/who-rebuts-house-committee-criticisms-about-glyphosate-cancer-warning</a></p>

<p>I suggest you familiarize yourself with the article, reading between the lines it quite blatant that Monsanto interests are the driving force behind the criticisms of WHO&#39;s findings (feel free to accuse me of being a conspiracy nut for saying that but take a look at the last paragraph of the article to understand there was enough suspicion of Monsantos malfeasance to warrant an investigation by the EPA&#39;s internal watchdog).</p>

<p>It is also indicated in the article that &quot;identifying carcinogenic hazards is a crucially important and necessary first step in risk assessment and management; it should be a &#39;red flag&#39; to those charged with protecting public health.&quot; Regulators can then take immediate action to ban or label carcinogenic substances, or use the observed data to determine how much risk the substances pose.&quot;</p>

<p>So its current classification being &quot;not that much of a big deal&quot; in your words is potentially the first step before changing its classification to group 1. Even so, group 2 is still made up of things that people should be informed about the risks of before being exposed to (did you include mention of being a hairdresser as something humorous or do you have sufficient insight to understand why that occupation is probably carcinogenic?).</p>

<p>I fully agree with your initial statement about reviewing glyphosate based on improved scientific processes and comprehension of its potential effects based on the data that has been accumulated over the years (by publicly available studies), </p>

<p>You accuse me of purposely conflating, not at all, I&#39;m pointing out that glyphosate has been recognized as being (as a required first step) <em>probably</em> carcinogenic by a world renowned scientific body that stands by their ruling. So, rather than ignoring the context of its classification, I&#39;ve just clarified it for you and I&#39;m not blowing anything out of proportion. Needles (you?) asked me for evidence for my statement glyposate has residual persistence (this was, after all, what I had stated, I hadn&#39;t made any claims as to what this meant- aside from citing IARC&#39;s classification) and I provided this. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t think there&#39;s much else to say on this bud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn’t make any sense for needles to be a Monsanto shill. How on Earth would such a massive corporation even benefit from dedicating resources to something so trivial? </p>

<p>Anyway, I read the article. Basically, both sides are pointing the finger at the other. </p>

<p>Except that there’s actual evidence that the IARC coincidentally received funding from environmentalist groups (around the same time their report just happened to swing in the negative, after they removed research and evidence suggesting that the substance was non-carcinogenic), whereas there’s speculation that Monsanto was colliding with other researchers with positive reports. I personally don’t doubt the validity of either of those statements.</p>

<p>I’ll level with you: I haven’t read the various drafts of the IARC report. I don’t know where to find them, and if you do, I’d love to read the last minute changes. However, this comes from several sources widely regarded to be trustworthy and unbiased (Reuters, AP, Snopes, etc.), and none of them have any clue why IARC would make these changes (outside of speculation) because they simply <em>haven’t provided any</em>.</p>

<p>But you keep equating IARC with the WHO- it’s not. It’s an semi-autonomous offshoot of the agency. </p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from <a href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf">an actual WHO meeting</a> , a full year after IARC changed the classification of glyphosate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.2 Glyphosate (158)
Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide. Several epidemiological studies on cancer outcomes following occupational exposure to glyphosate were available. The evaluation of these studies focused on the occurrence of NHL. Overall, there is some evidence of a positive association between glyphosate exposure and risk of NHL from the case–control studies and the overall meta- analysis. However, it is notable that the only large cohort study of high quality found no evidence of an association at any exposure level. Glyphosate has been extensively tested for genotoxic effects using a variety of tests in a wide range of organisms. The overall weight of evidence indicates that administration of glyphosate and its formulation products at doses as high as 2000 mg/kg body weight by the oral route, the route most relevant to human dietary exposure, was not associated with genotoxic effects in an overwhelming majority of studies conducted in mammals, a model considered to be appropriate for assessing genotoxic risks to humans. The Meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to be genotoxic at anticipated dietary exposures. Several carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats are available. The Meeting concluded that glyphosate is not carcinogenic in rats but could not exclude the possibility that it is carcinogenic in mice at very high doses. In view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the Meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet. The Meeting reaffirmed the group ADI for the sum of glyphosate and its metabolites of 0–1 mg/kg body weight on the basis of effects on the salivary gland. <em>The Meeting concluded that it was not necessary to establish an ARfD for glyphosate or its metabolites in view of its low acute toxicity.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis added.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to get across is that there isn’t all that much evidence to indicate that glyphosate is even all that harmful, much less in comparison to other herbicides: just to reiterate, you are blowing the implications of its reclassification WAY out of proportion. If anything, I’d venture to say that it’s a huge advancement in the field. </p>

<p>I’m not going to bother adding sources for that last sentence, as I doubt any of the MANY freely and easily available sources to back that up would convince you or anyone else here- like the credibility of the IARC report (as addressed above), that’s not even the argument. </p>

<p>And as for the hairdresser comment, yes, it was for humor, and yes, I fully understand why it’s considered a potential source of exposure at in Group 2A. I try to keep things light. But more importantly, I think it goes to show that the group sounds much scarier than it actually is. None of that stuff grows tumors, they exacerbate a process that occurs almost constantly already- of course, some things are much worse than others, both because of potency, exposure, and individual mechanisms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know why you keep attempting to defend/represent needlesintomatoes...</p>

<p>The IARC also receive (perhaps the majority) of its funding from the U.S federal government ($48 million since 1985). If their findings showed no carcinogens and I attempted to say their findings were influenced  by this funding I&#39;d be labelled a conspiracy nut, and yet somehow you can can claim funding from environmentalist groups could sway their findings as a sober, researched claim? 
I can&#39;t actually find any info regarding alleged donors (aside from the list of donors on the IARC&#39;s website- none of them seem to match your statement though), can you point this out to me please?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve cited Reuters as an unbiased source, yet according to the <a href="https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/02/07/document_gw_05.pdf">letter</a> written by the IARC director, the reuters journalist was drawing their allegations from material ghost written by a Monsanto scientist (separately Forbes retracted an article and ended their relationship with another journalist exposed to be doing the same).</p>

<p>There&#39;s also an article that does an expose on the &quot;hit piece&quot; from reuters <a href="https://theecologist.org/2016/apr/21/industry-fingerprints-all-over-reuters-attack-iarc-over-glyphosate-and-cancer">here</a>.</p>

<p>The WHO meeting you cite is from May 2016, the article I cited in the last post was from Feb 2018 (you&#39;re right though, IARC are an independent arm of WHO and not specifically the same entity).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not blowing anything out of proportion, I&#39;m simply citing the IARC rulings as a legitimate scientific body.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to rollback to the introductory paragraph from your last post saying that it it prudent to reevaluate glyphosate based on modern scientific methods and data.</p>

<p>I never said IARC wasn’t a legitimate scientific body, I just don’t agree that their rulings are as significant as you’re holding them up to be.</p>

<p>And strangely enough, I distinctly remember reading while researching a reply last night that IARC removed details and research from their report that didn’t support their conclusion due to pressure from anti-gmo lobbyists- however I can’t seem to find that source again. So I guess until I can, you can just disregard that particular contention (that they did it due to external pressure), but the fact remains that they intentionally insured research for unknown purposes. It’s possible that (given I was replying right around the time I fell asleep) I kind of just slurred some articles together. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>And as for rolling back, I’m fine with that- but only because what we know about potential mechanisms of the substance and it’s persistence has changed a bit. I still don’t think it’s that dangerous, and the vast majority of both the scientific community and world regulatory agencies seem to agree- it’s politicians and their constituents that don’t. </p>

<p>At any rate, the litigations, while cause for concern, prove nothing- Whether or not that supports either of our arguments is contingent on whether or not they are right to begin with. We can’t make that assumption. IMO, the litigation is due to a huge wave of woo and paranoia. This is why I brought up that list of mundane stuff classified by the IARC- there are any number of potential sources of carcinogens with which people all over the world come into contact every day, many of which they put into their bodies and in their homes of their own free will. Glyphosate isn’t the culprit, it’s the scapegoat for everything people are afraid of in regards to Monsanto, GMO’s, and science in general. I’m not saying everyone suspicious of glyphosate is anti-science- I’m saying that the level of fear surrounding it is the result of widespread chemophobia in an uninformed public, and so even typically pro science people afford it Indie skepticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from one of the worlds leading scientific bodies on cancer who have classed it as probably carcinogenic (as a place holder for potential graduation into being an outright carcinogen according to the statements of its director).</p>

<p>I agree there are waves of poorly informed people on witch hunts that flow back and forth across social media regarding any number of alleged imminent threats to our health. However, I also know that corporations like Monsanto will actively suppress and undermine any scientific data that threatens their cash cow. To believe the world of science is resolutely objective and unassailable from private interests and corruption is inherently naive. It remains to be seen to what extent glyphosate harms us (or our environment indirectly, those bees just keep dying).</p>

<p>And <em>free will</em> is the key statement there. If people want to drink alcohol every night, fully knowing the potential of harm, that is their right. Exposing people to toxins without their knowledge (or worse yet, with false claims of being benign) is an entirely different matter.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the worlds most widely used herbicide, I have no idea how much money it makes Monsanto but I&#39;m sure its enough to fudge a few studies and character assassinate a some people here and there.</p>

<p>And ok, I&#39;ll drop the sock insinuations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, and if there’s one thing here with with I agree, it’s the bit about the nature of the scientific community.</p>

<p>Well, two things- I’m super concerned about those bees, and other environmental factors. I’d honestly like to see it’s usage rolled back until they can do some more research on that stuff specifically.</p>

<p>However, I don’t believe it’s directly harmful to humans, at least not to a great extent, and it’s introduction to the industry has resulted in a widespread easily available herbicide that is objectively LOADS safer than most alternatives, including “organic” herbicides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it somewhat contradictory that on the one hand you agree about the nature of the scientific community and on the other wholly dismiss the sentiment that glyphosate may be a lot more harmful than we know (which would be on the basis that disagreeable scientific findings are withheld or otherwise obfuscated- a possibility you&#39;ve inadvertently acknowledged as valid).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not wholly dismissing that it may be more harmful- I’m dismissing the notion that it IS more harmful, because it hasn’t been shown to be more harmful. Should numerous good, peer-reviewed, publicly available studies show that it is more harmful than we know, than I’ll be all for it, but that’s not the case. I’m agreeing with you because obviously scientists make mistakes, research groups and think tanks feel pressure from political agendas, and have agendas of their own, etc., etc.: what’s important to note is that this is why we have a system to begin with. Scientists and researchers are fallible, so we have peer review to filter out the garbage, and to promote good science. Therefore, I stand by the scientific consensus, which is subject to change. </p>

<p>Also, I aim for civil discourse- I used to flame war, but That stopped having value for me long before it stopped being entertaining. This is more pleasant. I’ll admit though, I have to make a conscious effort to refrain from swearing left and right lol.</p>

Instead of replying in substantive terms people evidently rather mash the downvote button since it apparently doesn&#39;t conform to the standard &#39;anti-vax&#39; narrative in this sub.

<p>this glyphosate blaming reminds me of some other sketchy articles,</p>

<p>such as Sorcha Faal&#39;s bullshit about the FBI raiding the CDC, which was immediately seized upon by the pro-vaccine camp as evidence that the anti-vaccine camp believes Sorcha Faal&#39;s bullshit </p>

<p>and the aluminum study by Shaw, which was deliberately, obviously so flawed, that it &quot;debunked&quot; itself. Shaw said he would stop doing vaccine studies as soon as his sponsorship ended. the question is, who sponsored him, and why?</p>

<p>i suspect that the Shaw study was published just so it could be retracted, and pointed to as an example of how the scientific method works, how peer review works, how retraction works, and why aluminum is 100% safe to inject into babies </p>

<p>Monsanto themselves said regarding the Microbe Inotech lab testing that; &quot;The testing method used here for vaccines appears to be a method that was developed as a quick and inexpensive screening test for water samples to <em>decide whether additional testing with a more expensive and precise method is needed</em>&quot; (my italics)</p>

<p>MAAM paid for initial testing to assess whether additional (more expensive) testing was required and evidently did so. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how much NMR spectrometry testing would cost by an appropriately accredited lab, I guess that responsibility rests with a non profit, scientifically unaccredited organization to investigate and pay for themselves, rather than the government agencies with the appropriate hardware and resources already tasked with the specific purpose of ensuring what the general populace is exposed to is as safe as possible.</p>

<p>your second source made some vague claim about autism beginning in the womb, but this is bullshit. </p>

<p>they want us to believe its &quot;genetic&quot; in the sense that autism is inherited from a parent, but if autism is &quot;genetic&quot; its because of vaccine induced gene mutation </p>

<p>such as what happens in Dravet Syndrome  </p>

<p>Parent report the same story over and over and over and over:</p>

<p>Their kid was fine, developing normally, walking, talking, toilet control, eye contact </p>

<p>then the kid got a vaccine, and immediately regressed into the symptoms that would later be diagnosed as autism, and the parents were told it was not related to vaccines, no matter what the parents saw with their own two eyes </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even today, despite the obvious success of the vaccine, some people argue that smallpox was eradicated not by the vaccine but as a result of better hygiene or medical treatment. While improved hygiene and sanitation have improved public health in some aspects, cleanliness alone cannot prevent the spread of an infectious disease like smallpox. This disease spreads through droplets in the air and in saliva, not through dirt on the floor or because of unsanitary conditions. This is why even in industrialized, wealthy nations, smallpox continued to be a serious threat until the vaccine. And likewise, if cleanliness were the reason smallpox was conquered, then it would not have disappeared from the developing world, where poor hygiene and medical treatment remain realities.</p>

<p>But the best evidence that the vaccine for smallpox led to the eradication of the disease is found in the numbers. Between 1900 and 1949, prior to routine use of the smallpox vaccine in the U.S., there were approximately 29,000 cases of smallpox annually in the U.S. After the mass vaccination program, there were zero cases of wild smallpox in the United States (and the entire planet, too). Isn&#39;t that simply astonishing? Once nearly 30,000 Americans suffered from smallpox every year and now, not a single person anywhere in the world gets the disease. What a remarkable testament to the power of vaccination.  </p>

<p>Monsanto Responds to Flawed Study by Samsel Claiming Glyphosate in Vaccines</p>

<p>By: (((Dan Goldstein, MD, Pediatrician &amp; Toxicologist; &amp; Scientific Affairs Lead, Monsanto)))</p>

<p>Anthony Samsel and the activist group Moms Across America have suggested recently that glyphosate is found in vaccines. Nothing from Anthony Samsel’s results provides reliable evidence that glyphosate is present in vaccines. Everything that regulatory agencies and credible scientists know about glyphosate tells us this outcome is extremely unlikely. Unfortunately, such sensational allegations only serve to spark unwarranted fear and confusion and make finding reliable information much more difficult. In this post, I will discuss how this accusation is not credible by looking into the science behind the testing method.</p>

<p>Anthony Samsel has not published in a reputable, peer-reviewed journal any detail about what he or others did, so I can only comment based on incomplete and vague information.  Usually, I refrain from commenting on articles that haven’t been published in peer-reviewed journals, because that is the gold standard for the scientific community. If someone publishes science, reviewed by your peers, it carries weight; it deserves my attention to learn more about the science. However, Samsel’s study is not published in a peer-reviewed journal. I’m making an exception here, because it is irresponsible to scare parents about a matter as critical as children’s vaccinations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im curious why this author thinks that peer-reviewed journals are a credible source of information, considering the fact that Dr Wakefield&#39;s work was published in a scientific journal, where it remained un-retracted for 12 years. </p>

<p>furthermore, Dr William Thompson of the CDC also has his work published in a peer-reviewed journal, where it has remained un-retracted for 14 years, in spite of his press release admitting that his work was fraud  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to understand the background of the testing method used by Anthony Samsel, whose other claims have been rebutted elsewhere (“Medical Doctors weigh in on Glyphosate Claims” and “Condemning Monsanto With Bad Science Is Dumb”). The testing method used here for vaccines appears to be a method that was developed as a quick and inexpensive screening test for water samples to decide whether additional testing with a more expensive and precise method is needed. Simply put, because of this method’s potential for false positives at very low concentrations, a negative result of the test on water means no further testing is required; a positive result means one should conduct the more expensive test to confirm. This quick and inexpensive screening test has only been shown to work well in water – not vaccines, not wine, not beer, not milk, not eggs. Just water.</p>

<p>The activist group Moms Across America, the same group now helping promote Anthony Samsel’s vaccine allegations, previously used this quick and inexpensive testing method to incorrectly claim the detection of glyphosate residues in breast milk. After Moms Across America claimed to find glyphosate residues in breast milk using this method, a professor at Washington State University, Dr. Michelle McGuire, led a study to collect and analyze different samples using a more precise and validated method. Dr. McGuire found no glyphosate residues in breast milk. A previous study from New Zealand, a subsequent study in the United States and two subsequent studies from Germany also found no evidence of glyphosate residues in milk, and all of these studies reported an extensive validation of the assays.</p>

<p>Similarly, the method used by Anthony Samsel to generate data on vaccines was recently used to claim that glyphosate is present in eggs. Subsequent testing by the Food and Drug Administration, again using a valid method, did not detect glyphosate in eggs. Together, these results indicate that the quick and inexpensive test used to generate data on glyphosate in vaccines has been pushed beyond its reliable limits. One can only speculate that the motive here is to provoke fear and concern where none reasonably exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>failure to find glyphosate is hardly a compelling argument, since it would be exceedingly easy to NOT find what a person does NOT want to find </p>

<p>these are the same caliber of people who can&#39;t figure out what causes autism, in spite of thousands of parents telling them exactly what caused their child to regress into autism  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Glyphosate is a weed killer that inhibits a pathway found in plants, but not in humans or animals. Glyphosate is not a carcinogen, and it has a 40-year history of safe use. Like any weed killer, glyphosate has been extensively reviewed and approved for use by the U.S. EPA and other global regulatory authorities. For more information, please visit Monsanto.com/glyphosate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if glyphosate was so safe, why are authorities looking to ban it in multiple countries?</p>

<p>First off there is no peanut allergy epidemic.  In the states there were 6 deaths from nut allergies in 2015.  Pregnancy and child birth killed 1,140.  Four hundred million people.  6 deaths.</p>

<p>Second the peanut paranoia is what causes peanut allergies.  The simplest way to prevent peanut allergies is to feed infants peanuts.  Basic research will found extensive evidence.  This applies to many other allergies.  If you keep your kid in too sterile an environment their system starts to treat normal everyday materials as foreign and thus triggers an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>such as Sorcha Faal&#39;s bullshit about the FBI raiding the CDC, which was immediately seized upon by the pro-vaccine camp as evidence that the anti-vaccine camp believes Sorcha Faal&#39;s bullshit </p>

<p>and the aluminum study by Shaw, which was deliberately, obviously so flawed, that it &quot;debunked&quot; itself. Shaw said he would stop doing vaccine studies as soon as his sponsorship ended. the question is, who sponsored him, and why?</p>

<p>i suspect that the Shaw study was published just so it could be retracted, and pointed to as an example of how the scientific method works, how peer review works, how retraction works, and why aluminum is 100% safe to inject into babies </p>

<p>its unfortunate that you consider OP to be &quot;Gish Gallop&quot;. i suspect you have a short attention span, can&#39;t retain what you read, get frustrated trying to comprehend the significance of what you read, and have always considered every text book in school to be a form of Gish Gallop</p>

<p>the claim that vaccines eradicated small pox, when in fact there is no evidence to support that claim</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even today, despite the obvious success of the vaccine, some people argue that smallpox was eradicated not by the vaccine but as a result of better hygiene or medical treatment. While improved hygiene and sanitation have improved public health in some aspects, cleanliness alone cannot prevent the spread of an infectious disease like smallpox. This disease spreads through droplets in the air and in saliva, not through dirt on the floor or because of unsanitary conditions. This is why even in industrialized, wealthy nations, smallpox continued to be a serious threat until the vaccine. And likewise, if cleanliness were the reason smallpox was conquered, then it would not have disappeared from the developing world, where poor hygiene and medical treatment remain realities.</p>

<p>But the best evidence that the vaccine for smallpox led to the eradication of the disease is found in the numbers. Between 1900 and 1949, prior to routine use of the smallpox vaccine in the U.S., there were approximately 29,000 cases of smallpox annually in the U.S. After the mass vaccination program, there were zero cases of wild smallpox in the United States (and the entire planet, too). Isn&#39;t that simply astonishing? Once nearly 30,000 Americans suffered from smallpox every year and now, not a single person anywhere in the world gets the disease. What a remarkable testament to the power of vaccination.  </p>

<p>your second source merely says that some vaccines cause some side effects, but that the side effects are &quot;rare&quot;.  </p>

<p>Which they are - <em>serious</em> adverse effects anyway.<br/>

<p>you can tell that its a pseudoscientific paper, because they use &quot;ballpark measurements&quot; to describe the frequency of side effects, instead of precise, accurate measurements   </p>

<p>You&#39;re wrong; <a href="https://i.imgur.com/x7pNASY.png">Systematic reviews - like the research I linked to - are actually considered the pinnacle in the hierarchy when it comes to &#39;strength of evidence&#39; in biomedical research.</a></p>

<p>It is becoming patently obvious people are being over exposed to glyphosate despite Monsanto&#39;s best efforts to obfuscate this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also kinda weird you mined this deep into older threads just to say this and to somewhat defend needlesintomatoes who acted somewhat blatantly like a shill (to the extent what he&#39;d been accused of such here; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuspectedShills/comments/7hdld0/needlesintomatoes_a_new_account_thats_eager_to/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SuspectedShills/comments/7hdld0/needlesintomatoes_a_new_account_thats_eager_to/</a>), and who even 4 hours ago was still popping up in threads about GMO&#39;s and Monsanto...Are you the puppeteer of that sock? Haha.</p>
