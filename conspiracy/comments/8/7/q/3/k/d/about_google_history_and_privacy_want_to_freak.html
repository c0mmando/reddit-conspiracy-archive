<p>I&#39;d like to make it comprehensive and all in one place:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb">https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb</a> … Google stores your location (if you have it turned on) every time you turn on your phone, and you can see a timeline from the first day you started using Google on your phone.</p></li>
<li><p>This is every place I have been in the last twelve months in Ireland, going in so far as the time of day I was in the location and how long it took me to get to that location from my previous one <a href="https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT">https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity</a>  Google stores search history across all your devices on a separate database, so even if you delete your search history and phone history, Google STILL stores everything until you go in and delete everything, and you have to do this on all devices</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/">http://www.google.com/settings/ads/</a>  Google creates an advertisement profile based on your information, including your location, gender, age, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, possible weight (need to lose 10lbs in one day?) and income</p></li>
<li><p>Google stores information on every app and extension you use, how often you use them, where you use them, and who you use them to interact with (who do you talk to on facebook, what countries are you speaking with, what time you go to sleep at) <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/history/search_history">https://www.youtube.com/feed/history/search_history</a> … Google stores ALL of your YouTube history, so they know whether you&#39;re going to be a parent soon, if you&#39;re a conservative, if you&#39;re a progressive, if you&#39;re Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, if you&#39;re feeling depressed or suicidal, if you&#39;re anorexic...</p></li>
<li><p>Google offers an option to download all of the data it stores about you, I&#39;ve requested to download it and the file is 5.5GB BIG, which is roughly 3 MILLION Word documents <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout">https://www.google.com/takeout</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.google.com/takeout">https://www.google.com/takeout</a>  This link includes your bookmarks, emails, contacts, your Google Drive files, all of the above information, your YouTube videos, the photos you&#39;ve taken on your phone, the businesses you&#39;ve bought from, the products you&#39;ve bought through Google...</p></li>
<li><p>Your calendar, your Google hangout sessions, your location history, the music you listen to, the Google books you&#39;ve purchased, the Google groups you&#39;re in, the websites you&#39;ve created, the phones you&#39;ve owned, the pages you&#39;ve shared, how many steps you walk in a day...</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook offers a similar option to download all your information, mine was roughly 600mb, which is roughly 400,000 Word documents</p></li>
<li><p>This includes every message you&#39;ve ever sent or been sent, every file you&#39;ve ever sent or been sent, all the contacts in your phone, and all the audio messages you&#39;ve ever sent or been sent <a href="https://t.co/H8ng7bcyod">https://t.co/H8ng7bcyod</a></p></li>

<li><p>Somewhat pointlessly, they also store all the stickers you&#39;ve ever sent on Facebook (I have no idea why they do this, it&#39;s just a joke at this stage) <a href="https://t.co/4F5sExbynf">https://t.co/4F5sExbynf</a></p></li>

<li><p>And they store all the applications you&#39;ve ever had connected to your Facebook account, so they can guess I&#39;m interested in politics and web and graphic design, that I was single between X and Y period with the installation of Tinder, and I got a HTC phone in November... <a href="https://t.co/bkXruVZxLP">https://t.co/bkXruVZxLP</a></p></li>

<li><p>The files you download, the games you play, your photos and videos, your music, your search history, your browsing history, even what RADIO stations you listen to</p></li>
<li><p>This is one of the craziest things about the modern age, we would never let the government or a corporation put cameras/microphones in our homes or location trackers on us, but we just went ahead and did it ourselves because fuck it I want to watch cute dog videos</p></li>
<li><p>I got the Google Takeout document with all my information, and this is a breakdown of all the different ways they get your information <a href="https://t.co/mPAbyh1I9k">https://t.co/mPAbyh1I9k</a></p></li>
<li><p>Here&#39;s the search history document, which has 90,000 different entries, even showing the images I downloaded and the websites I accessed (I showed ThePirateBay section to show much damage this information can do) <a href="https://t.co/rZJhJjSe2t">https://t.co/rZJhJjSe2t</a></p></li>
<li><p>Here&#39;s my Google Calendar broken down, showing all the events I&#39;ve ever added, whether I actually attended them, and what time I attended them at (this part is what I went for an interview for a Marketing job, and what time I arrived at) <a href="https://t.co/mpB7NpLVzT">https://t.co/mpB7NpLVzT</a></p></li>
<li><p>This is my Google Drive, which includes files I EXPLICITLY deleted including my resume, my monthly budget, and all the code, files, and websites I&#39;ve ever made, and even my PGP private key, which I deleted, which I use to encrypt e-mails <a href="https://t.co/UpfUNTD6yR">https://t.co/UpfUNTD6yR</a></p></li>
<li><p>This is my Google Fit, which shows all of the steps I&#39;ve ever taken, any time I walked anywhere, and all the times I&#39;ve recorded any meditation/yoga/workouts I&#39;ve done (I deleted this information and revoked Google Fit&#39;s permissions) <a href="https://t.co/mAYmk8zxwR">https://t.co/mAYmk8zxwR</a></p></li>

<li><p>And now my Google Activity, this has thousands of files, so I&#39;ll just do a short summary of what they have  <a href="https://t.co/jucdjpQAVY">https://t.co/jucdjpQAVY</a></p></li>
<li><p>Firstly every Google Ad I&#39;ve ever viewed or clicked on, every app I&#39;ve ever launched or used and when I did it, every website I&#39;ve ever visited and what time I did it at, and every app I&#39;ve ever installed or searched for <a href="https://t.co/DcMdnbzuC66">https://t.co/DcMdnbzuC66</a></p></li>
<li><p>Every image I&#39;ve ever searched for and saved, every location I&#39;ve ever searched for or clicked on, every news article I&#39;ve ever searched for or read, and EVERY SINGLE google search I&#39;ve made since 2009 <a href="https://t.co/xPOK8h3qej">https://t.co/xPOK8h3qej</a></p></li>
<li><p>And then finally, every YouTube video I&#39;ve ever searched for or viewed, since 2008 <a href="https://t.co/0F1Lcwp2FS">https://t.co/0F1Lcwp2FS</a></p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m probably on an FBI watch-list now, so if I die in the next few months IT WASN&#39;T AN ACCIDENT, IT WAS A SET-UP</p></li>
<li><p>This information has millions of nefarious uses and violates multiple human rights, you&#39;re not a terrorist? Then how come you were googling ISIS? Work at Google and you&#39;re suspicious of your wife? Perfect, just look up her location and search history for the last ten years</p></li>
<li><p>Manage to gain access to someone&#39;s Google account? Perfect, you have a chronological diary of everything that person has done for the last ten years</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The question now is: Will this transparency actually change user&#39;s behavior? Or will Facebook&#39;s hollow promises to change be enough to lull its legions of users back into a passive ignorance. As Curran points out, people would be outraged if they discovered the government was monitoring them to this extent. But when Google does it? People hardly bat an eye.</strong></p>

Yes, we live together so we are all on the same ISP.  We are all on the same cellular service provider.  Neither my husband, myself or my other daughter got a notice.  I wish I would have snapped a picture.  We are going to see Avengers on 4/27.  We will be going to the same theater and I bought the tickets in the same way.  If she gets a notice again, I&#39;ll see if I can post a photo.</p>

<p>Hi - software engineer here. To give a simple explanation: they notice a familial-relationship and correlate that to location data (coarse/network or fine/gps location). </p>

<p>Basically, they know that your daughter and you have a familial relationship. </p>

<p>Their system then notes that you purchased tickets for X movie and Y theater.</p>

<p>Then, it notices that you both are at the same theater shortly before the movie time, thus making the correlation that you are there to see the same movie, and sends a contextual notification where it hopes your daughter would click through and possibly do an ad-view on a site with news about the movie, thus making money for Google/Alphabet. </p>

I can see no way they knew which movie we were seeing at a theater with 30 screens.  We pulled in at 10:55 for that 11:15 showing.
Pretty puzzling.</p>

She didn&#39;t have any connection to the tickets other than she pulled into the parking lot at the same time as I did.
This is a 30 screen theater.  Yet they knew what she was seeing and what showing.</p>

<p>I never used Google assistant or speech in general to do stuff on my phone like dictating etc. which is why I revoke all permissions they ask me about.</p>

<p>I was talking with my daughter about life in the ocean and for some reason she asked me whether mussels lay eggs and I didn&#39;t know so I told her we have to Google how they do it. I shit you not and I wouldn&#39;t believe it. It automatically completed my search &quot;how do&quot; with &quot;mussels procreate&quot;. I never looked up anything similar ever. </p>

Yes, we live together so we are all on the same ISP.  We are all on the same cellular service provider.  Neither my husband, myself or my other daughter got a notice.  I wish I would have snapped a picture.  We are going to see Avengers on 4/27.  We will be going to the same theater and I bought the tickets in the same way.  If she gets a notice again, I&#39;ll see if I can post a photo.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#39;t the location that freaked her out. It was the idea that they knew which movie and showing she was going to when she had nothing to do with buying the tickets. It must have been tracked by microphone.</p>

<p>Hi - software engineer here. To give a simple explanation: they notice a familial-relationship and correlate that to location data (coarse/network or fine/gps location). </p>

<p>Basically, they know that your daughter and you have a familial relationship. </p>

<p>Their system then notes that you purchased tickets for X movie and Y theater.</p>

<p>Then, it notices that you both are at the same theater shortly before the movie time, thus making the correlation that you are there to see the same movie, and sends a contextual notification where it hopes your daughter would click through and possibly do an ad-view on a site with news about the movie, thus making money for Google/Alphabet. </p>
