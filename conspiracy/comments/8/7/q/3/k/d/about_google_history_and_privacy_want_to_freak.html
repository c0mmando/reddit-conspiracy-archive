       As posted from Dylan Curran @iamdylancurran on Twitter, and mentioned here in
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/87ozob/think_facebook_is_bad_dylan_curran_blows_the_lid/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/87ozob/think_facebook_is_bad_dylan_curran_blows_the_lid/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to make it comprehensive and all in one place:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb">
          https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb
         </a>
         … Google stores your location (if you have it turned on) every time you turn on your phone, and you can see a timeline from the first day you started using Google on your phone.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is every place I have been in the last twelve months in Ireland, going in so far as the time of day I was in the location and how long it took me to get to that location from my previous one
         <a href="https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT">
          https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">
          https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity
         </a>
         Google stores search history across all your devices on a separate database, so even if you delete your search history and phone history, Google STILL stores everything until you go in and delete everything, and you have to do this on all devices
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/">
          http://www.google.com/settings/ads/
         </a>
         Google creates an advertisement profile based on your information, including your location, gender, age, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, possible weight (need to lose 10lbs in one day?) and income
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Google stores information on every app and extension you use, how often you use them, where you use them, and who you use them to interact with (who do you talk to on facebook, what countries are you speaking with, what time you go to sleep at)
         <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1">
          https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/history/search_history">
          https://www.youtube.com/feed/history/search_history
         </a>
         … Google stores ALL of your YouTube history, so they know whether you're going to be a parent soon, if you're a conservative, if you're a progressive, if you're Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, if you're feeling depressed or suicidal, if you're anorexic...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Google offers an option to download all of the data it stores about you, I've requested to download it and the file is 5.5GB BIG, which is roughly 3 MILLION Word documents
         <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout">
          https://www.google.com/takeout
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout">
          https://www.google.com/takeout
         </a>
         This link includes your bookmarks, emails, contacts, your Google Drive files, all of the above information, your YouTube videos, the photos you've taken on your phone, the businesses you've bought from, the products you've bought through Google...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your calendar, your Google hangout sessions, your location history, the music you listen to, the Google books you've purchased, the Google groups you're in, the websites you've created, the phones you've owned, the pages you've shared, how many steps you walk in a day...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Facebook offers a similar option to download all your information, mine was roughly 600mb, which is roughly 400,000 Word documents
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This includes every message you've ever sent or been sent, every file you've ever sent or been sent, all the contacts in your phone, and all the audio messages you've ever sent or been sent
         <a href="https://t.co/H8ng7bcyod">
          https://t.co/H8ng7bcyod
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Facebook also stores what it think you might be interested in based off the things you've liked and what you and your friends talk about (I apparently like the topic 'Girl')
         <a href="https://t.co/fqKiNlfATO">
          https://t.co/fqKiNlfATO
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Somewhat pointlessly, they also store all the stickers you've ever sent on Facebook (I have no idea why they do this, it's just a joke at this stage)
         <a href="https://t.co/4F5sExbynf">
          https://t.co/4F5sExbynf
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They also store every time you log into Facebook, where you logged in from, what time, and from what device
         <a href="https://t.co/iWXSPm5Peh">
          https://t.co/iWXSPm5Peh

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         And they store all the applications you've ever had connected to your Facebook account, so they can guess I'm interested in politics and web and graphic design, that I was single between X and Y period with the installation of Tinder, and I got a HTC phone in November...

         Side-note, if you have Windows 10 installed, this is a picture of JUST the privacy options with 16 different sub-menus, which have all of the options enabled by default when you install Windows 10

        <p>
         This includes tracking where you are, what applications you have installed, when you use them, what you use them for, access to your webcam and microphone at any time, your contacts, your e-mails, your calendar, your call history, the messages you send and receive...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The files you download, the games you play, your photos and videos, your music, your search history, your browsing history, even what RADIO stations you listen to
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is one of the craziest things about the modern age, we would never let the government or a corporation put cameras/microphones in our homes or location trackers on us, but we just went ahead and did it ourselves because fuck it I want to watch cute dog videos
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I got the Google Takeout document with all my information, and this is a breakdown of all the different ways they get your information

         Here's the search history document, which has 90,000 different entries, even showing the images I downloaded and the websites I accessed (I showed ThePirateBay section to show much damage this information can do)

         Here's my Google Calendar broken down, showing all the events I've ever added, whether I actually attended them, and what time I attended them at (this part is what I went for an interview for a Marketing job, and what time I arrived at)

         This is my Google Fit, which shows all of the steps I've ever taken, any time I walked anywhere, and all the times I've recorded any meditation/yoga/workouts I've done (I deleted this information and revoked Google Fit's permissions)

         This information has millions of nefarious uses and violates multiple human rights, you're not a terrorist? Then how come you were googling ISIS? Work at Google and you're suspicious of your wife? Perfect, just look up her location and search history for the last ten years

       </li>
       <li>

       <strong>
        The question now is: Will this transparency actually change user's behavior? Or will Facebook's hollow promises to change be enough to lull its legions of users back into a passive ignorance. As Curran points out, people would be outraged if they discovered the government was monitoring them to this extent. But when Google does it? People hardly bat an eye.

       Nah, I've searched horrible stuff before which in point makes me look like a "basket case", but by the point I realized that the government monitors that (say about at 14 and 15), I realized it was too late for me and just gave up.

       My daughter flipped out because she got an alert on her phone to enjoy "Pacific Rim at 11:15 at the AMC"
We were outside the theater.  We had pre-paid tickets that I bought on my home computer using Opera.

       Oh, YOU bought the tickets!  .... Could be microphone, could be connecting data from home wi-fi (if you live together) ... either way, freaky.  Which app gave her a notification? Was it Google Now or something ?

       I'll have to ask her which app.  It was freaky.
Yes, we live together so we are all on the same ISP.  We are all on the same cellular service provider.  Neither my husband, myself or my other daughter got a notice.  I wish I would have snapped a picture.  We are going to see Avengers on 4/27.  We will be going to the same theater and I bought the tickets in the same way.  If she gets a notice again, I'll see if I can post a photo.

       Hi - software engineer here. To give a simple explanation: they notice a familial-relationship and correlate that to location data (coarse/network or fine/gps location).
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, they know that your daughter and you have a familial relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their system then notes that you purchased tickets for X movie and Y theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, it notices that you both are at the same theater shortly before the movie time, thus making the correlation that you are there to see the same movie, and sends a contextual notification where it hopes your daughter would click through and possibly do an ad-view on a site with news about the movie, thus making money for Google/Alphabet.

       Hmmmm only thing I could think of is if you had a copy sent to her. Otherwise that's just creepy that they used her location along with yours(plus knowing you bought the tickets) and said her show starts soon.  Weird

       Didn't send a copy to her.  Didn't put it on the Yahoo calendar.  Bought the tickets, sent them from my Yahoomail to my Gmail (because that is easier to open on my phone).
       <br/>
       I can see no way they knew which movie we were seeing at a theater with 30 screens.  We pulled in at 10:55 for that 11:15 showing.
Pretty puzzling.

I shit you not and I wouldn't believe it. It automatically completed my search "how do" with "mussels procreate". I never looked up anything similar ever.

       I mean... I knew of the location tracker for years on my Google Maps.

       I thought it was fun! I can go back a year right now and see exactly what I did every day. It has helped my wife and I a few times when a mysterious charge shows up on a card and we see if we went somewhere odd that day.

       There's that thing they all do - "Do you want to secure your e-mail account with other e-mail account ?" "Do you want to secure your e-mail/FB account with your telephone number? "  ... connecting their dots and pieces ...that is nicely tying up their spiderweb around you.

       Last Friday I played Dungeons and Dragons for the first time with my friends. Spent saturday texting my wife and friend about it. That night I go to browse reddit on my phone and first thing I see is an ad about a company that draws DnD characters. Never browsed a single thing on reddit about DnD before, never mentioned it on reddit before, and never had I seen that ad before.

       Oh, YOU bought the tickets!  .... Could be microphone, could be connecting data from home wi-fi (if you live together) ... either way, freaky.  Which app gave her a notification? Was it Google Now or something ?

       I'll have to ask her which app.  It was freaky.
Yes, we live together so we are all on the same ISP.  We are all on the same cellular service provider.  Neither my husband, myself or my other daughter got a notice.  I wish I would have snapped a picture.  We are going to see Avengers on 4/27.  We will be going to the same theater and I bought the tickets in the same way.  If she gets a notice again, I'll see if I can post a photo.

        It wasn't the location that freaked her out. It was the idea that they knew which movie and showing she was going to when she had nothing to do with buying the tickets. It must have been tracked by microphone.

       Hi - software engineer here. To give a simple explanation: they notice a familial-relationship and correlate that to location data (coarse/network or fine/gps location).
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, they know that your daughter and you have a familial relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their system then notes that you purchased tickets for X movie and Y theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, it notices that you both are at the same theater shortly before the movie time, thus making the correlation that you are there to see the same movie, and sends a contextual notification where it hopes your daughter would click through and possibly do an ad-view on a site with news about the movie, thus making money for Google/Alphabet.
