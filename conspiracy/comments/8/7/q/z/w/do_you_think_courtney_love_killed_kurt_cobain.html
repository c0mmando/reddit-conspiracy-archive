       I seriously doubt it. Such songs as " I hate myself and want to die" lead me to believe he was suicidal as hell.  Its better to burn out than fade away he said, and he meant it. Him posing for pictures with guns in his mouth ect...  He was obssessed with suicide and he actually had the balls to take the plunge.  Give the man some credit. He blew his fucking head off as a final fuck you to the rest of us thereby insuring his everlasting musical legacy. 
  I think its very evil and callous to blame Courtney for it without any evidence. These accusations have surely had a tremendous toll on her. And their poor daughter "Hey mom, people on the internet say you paid to have dad killed".........

       He was actually a pretty smart guy and one hell of a human being.  His solidarity and empathy for causes is something I admired in him. My username comes from Nirvana's song lithium.

       Read his memoirs... the guy was miserable. He didn't want fame, he thought he sold out and felt guilty, he got addicted to heroin and described it as hell. You can still pull the trigger of a non sawed off shotgun with your toe.

       Pain and misery make for the best background to a song. Kurt's music had a very unique way of expressing the pain a lot of

       He had everything to lose.  I don't think Courtney killed him, but I don't think he killed himself.  Even Dave Grohl admitted some doubt to the whole story.

       I certainly agree that he had nothing left to lose, but from the words he spoke to the drugs he did, I'm sure in his head, there was nothing left to lose. To him, he had already sold out, he had become addicted to heroin, and was already in deeper depression than most will ever see. I have much respect for the man for having the bravery to fight his depression in such a public forum, and for truely believing what he spoke. But I do believe that he killed himself, and Courtney was just a victim to the whole thing, even as the enabler that she is/was. "I hate myself and want to die."

       She was an exaggerated drama queen. She was reading a song that other band members have said she
       <em>
        KNEW
       </em>
       was a song he was working on, but she was acting like she was reading a suicide note. She was all "Boo-hoo, fuck you Kurt, you bastard, how could you do this?!" over every line of this song, live on MTV news, as if she were reading a suicide note.
      </p>
      <p>
       And heroin makes you calm and distracted, not hysterical and over-dramatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       She got Kurt's share of everything, and used it to sue the shit out of the other members of Nirvana and some documentary producers who implied that she was behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: the only way I might believe she didn't do would be if it turned out he faked his own death and she was in on it, that could explain the bad over-acting in a way that didn't implicate her.

       I mean, its a possibility she paid someone to do it. There isn't enough evidence to prove one way or the other. There are some fishy things that happened, if true. But, I give her the benefit of the doubt. Especially for Francis's sake. 
  I think she was rightfully pissed at him afterwards. Boohoo, poor Kurt, only a musical living legend and a millionaire at fucking 27. How tragic. Poor you. Just drop everything and leave your daughter, wife and band. 
  He had deep mental issues that kept him depressed despite everything. Another indication for suicide. I kindda have the same thing, so I can believe it was suicide.
    I don't think the suicide notes were lyrics. For one thing they made sense and didn't rhyme. They were poetic but they weren't Nirvana lyrics. They were his last words and it would suck to deny him those.

       I am just curious how this, obviously talented, Junky has been elected to sainthood.  What evidence does anyone have that he is a nice, empathetic human being?
