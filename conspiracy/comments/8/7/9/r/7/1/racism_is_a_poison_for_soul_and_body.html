      <p>
       I am half french, half turkish. But 100% white. I am not a muslim nor a catholic, in fact i am involved in no religion of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have grown up in a strange situation because i knew only my french part (my parents were not living together).
But in my earlier years i was living with all kinds of people, our appartment was always full of friends from many different races. We lived quite happily.
      </p>
      <p>
       At school in Paris my best friends were Bulgarian, Hungarian, Yugoslavian... but i had friends of all races, black, chinese, Arabian etc.
I never knew what racism was, i could not understand the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after i quit Paris i have lived my teenage years in french small towns where racism and intolerance where quite "normal" for many people (absolutely not ALL people, of course, but a good part).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never been a victim of racist insults myself since nobody knew i was half turkish. It was even not clear for me. I really felt 100% french. I have a french name, i have the whiter skin one can have, never mentioned my family to people, i am not muslim, don't speak turkish, have no relations with my turkish family etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many people believed i was a normal french and constantly talk all kinds of racist jokes and thoughts in front of me as if i was in the obligation to agree and laugh at it with them.
It was an embarrassing situation because i really didn't knew who i was finally, i had no real identity. So i could not criticize these people and say to them i was myself a foreign boy, it seemed useless to me. 
I loved these people anyway, they were my friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       With time, i even began to accept some racist thoughts. I became inconsciously in a rebellion towards my father's family and the lack of love from them. I felt alone and devoid of identity so i chose to assume i was pure french. It gave me a reason to say i was somebody, with a past and an identity to be proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
       With some friends we began to play with all kinds of racist imagery (nazism, svastikas, FN (french national front) etc. ). We were not really involved in it, it was kind of child play for us, but we loved the rebel aura it could give and were fascinated. We were unconscious, we only wanted to seem rebel even if we were just ridiculous. 
It was a complete non-sense since in the same time we were huge fans of rap music and cinema and all our idols were black or jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to know though that these things could not exist today for french teenagers, it could be totally banned. Me and my friends were allowed to think what we wanted quite freely because it was another time and this time does not exist anymore in our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, what could describe correctly my behaviour is that i was very cynical, hater, violent and negative. I was a loser but wanted to be a king. The Alpha guys laughed at me and I was always in rage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was constantly insulting, hating, fighting, laughing at people etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never had a girlfriend because when sometimes a sweet girl came to me and wanted to be my friend i refused because i liked to have some sadistic power over her with my rejection. The only girls i liked were inaccessible for me and i was treated like a shit by her but i stayed in this pathetic situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I only knew more about Life and Love at this time i would have been happy with the lovely girls who really liked me, even if they were not necessary attractive to me, rather than dreaming about girls who never said "hello" to me...
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, a guy should always accept the love of any girl without discrimination. Rejecting girls because they are not what we expect physically or other reasons brings curses. If a girl loves you you have to accept this marvelous gift of Life and learn to love her as she is a Godess. At least accept just friendship with her but never reject her demand. 
Only the guys who do that will know what Love and joy really means in this life. 
But it is another story...
      </p>
      <p>
       So I was systematically against what the majority liked and did and always hating society.
      </p>
      <p>
       But weird things happened for me. The strangest thing i noticed (but without being able to find a link between that and my bad thoughts) is that i began progressively plagued by a skin disease called psoriasis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psoriasis is literally a condition where the skin is in a self-destructive process. Interestingly, it seems that my problems of identity and my constant hate towards almost evedybody surfaced with this disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had many other problems at this time who could have play a part in this disease (especially i always had bad crises of psoriasis anytime i could not express myself in society and felt rejected or unable to find my place).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that my involvement for a year at this time with the J. Witnesses was one of the causes too because it gave me many bad feelings and frustrations, a very bad and depressing experience. I became intolerant about almost anything and began more and more shy and sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also had many problems of hate with my neighbours at that time and it was horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       After my teenage years i stopped all involvement with extremist ideologies but i was still negative in many ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, I had the chance one day to find the books of an author called Joseph Murphy about the power or forgiveness and Love.
I was very reluctant in the beginning but it allowed me to understand how insanely I was a selfish egoistic hater who refused to love and forgive people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't caution all the things Murphy wrote (maybe too much religious stuff, I don't really think that the Bible talks with allegories about the subconscious mind, by example...), i think he made many mistakes, but about Love and Forgiveness he was absolutely right. It was the revelation I needed for changing my life. Before that i never have been able to understand what was so wrong with me. I thought i was normal and never admitted my own folly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I decided to change, to work on my hate and my relational problems and I have finally dedicated more than 10 years working spiritually, searching and studying all kinds of methods and traditions for cleaning my mind of all the negativity. Prayers seemed good but not enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only wish and obsession has been to discover how to really love and heal humanity like maybe a great master like Jesus did.And even if it seems crazy i will never be satisfied until i find this. I know that finding this secret is the reason why i am here on this planet and I will never give up my quest. Maybe i will never win but i am here to try and try without stopping. Even if it is useless, like chasing a rainbow, i will still believe. I will keep this dream alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it would be too long to write all the details about my life and i already wrote too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just know that the last ten years have been full of a strange fight between evolution and love feelings and bad relapses into my old thought patterns, hate etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that i have finally discovered physically and spiritualy that any kind of racism and hate towards human beings can ruin health. It is a poison. And the worst kind for the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understood that definitively some years ago because i became strangely more and more sensitive to the slightest bad thought about people.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a time, I was reading political things and had some interest for the NWO theories on the internet. You know in France we have some very negative guys like Soral and Dieudonné who are considered by their supporters as politically subversive, some kinds of "heros". Antisemitism is rampant in their speeches. They are not against the theory that the Shoa never existed and was an hoax made up by the Jews, by example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read many things about this kind of ideology but, believe it or not, anytime i began to accept these racist and negative thoughts i ended finally sick. I mean physically and awfully sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had headaches, nausea, sometimes to the point of vomiting, stomach pains, bad sleep, distress and anxiety. And basically many bad things happened in my life. All seemed to turn negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was especially true when i talked or thought bad things about the jewish community. Anytime i had an antisemitism feeling i was soon sick for days. It was like a punishment. Anytime i had again some sympathy for nazism, FN or other negative ideology and political views, i was sick too.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the beginning it was principally the bad thoughts about the jews who made me sick the most. In fact, i felt so horrible and had to regret so much that i had to ask Heaven for forgiveness or something. Only when i confessed my mistake and loved the jews again i could recover from my ilnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically i never had a decent reason to hate jews, because i just don't know them. I never knew personally any jew except maybe a doctor in Paris when I was a child. And he was a good doctor, by the way. My mum used to work with many jews in Paris because she was in the textile industry. She always said to me that the jews were very good and nice people so she never understood why i was sometimes very racist against them when we talked about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact all the bad feelings i sometimes had towards tem came only out of false informations and theories on the internet and antisemitic propaganda. It was not my own experience and my own thoughts. It was only based on fear and jealousy towards people i even don't know, just because some bad and sad persons talked and wrote about all the reasons they have to hate them and how everybody has to rebel against the jewish plan to rule the world etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel so bad now for all those men who live their life in the obsessive hate of the jews... It is pathetic. All those individuals are juste destroying their health for nothing and they have such negative influence on other people who believe them...
      </p>
      <p>
       All these theories and antisemitic propaganda are like a virus in the mind and it made me sick. I was not myself when i accepted such crappy things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "funny" thing though is that many people who hate the jews talk a lot about the so called "jewish nose"... They don't seem to understand that millions of non jews have this kind of nose, myself by example... So those fools blinded by their hate who believe that a jew can be recognisable by his nose would maybe throw me in concentration camp if they see me, believing i am a jew, and they would be completely wrong...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, my sickness phenomenon was not just working with antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I began soon to notice that even when i had racist thoughts about black people, the gypsies or any foreign people i ended sick too... No matter what race or community, it works anytime. Hating people made me sick, sad and lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sickness did not manifest just after some thoughts, of course, but if i spent maybe some hours, or a day or two in such a negative state it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I used to like black people but the only reason i sometimes had racist thoughts about them is by jealousy. Black guys tend to be seen by girls as good lovers, and especially many blonde white girls date black guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be sure that when white men are racist against black men the source of the hate is that they feel black men as competitors. They fear that the white women will prefer to be with black men.
It is a serious anxiety and sad feeling and i know so many men who feel like that...
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, i had a traumatizing experience as a teenager. I had a neighbour in the flat above mine, a celibate mother of two children, white blonde with glasses, bourgeoise... One night the children were out, don't know where, and she came back with a black guy she probably found in a nightclub, a party or something...
      </p>
      <p>
       So you know what i mean for the rest of the story... I heard them make their thing and i was in rage. I had so many bad thoughts, i hated all the world.I started to have this feeling about the fact that white women could prefer black men and i was sad.
Not that the sounds where spectacular, you know, she was not really screaming and the bed was not on the verge to crack, but i was upset and jealous anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the only reason for me and many white guys to be sometimes racist against black men or to fear them is jealousy and lack of self confidence with women and nothing more. I think you could hardly find a white guy who hate the black and who is not secretly afraid that white women go with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not really a dick size matter since so many white guys have big dicks (not me though but it's another story..) but rather an unconscious fear of being rejected by women if for a reason or another they will prefer a black man. This is really irrational and stupid  finally. But this feeling hurts a lot and is the cause of so much hate and conflicts...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, concerning the link between hate and sickness I had so many times the occasion to check this phenomenon again and again that there is no more the slightest doubt in my mind : hating people act as a poison in the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       It starts in the mind but soon the body is disturbed and sickness can manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why ? Because racism is pure hate and hate is the ultimate poison. It goes against all the laws of Life and nothing good can result of such a wrong use of the spirit and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I advise all people who are racists and haters to try to heal their soul and give up their bad feelings. Please stop poisoning yourself with hate. Free your mind and be happy. Rediscover your state of innocence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to understand that the other people are like yourself. As physical beings here we all came from semen and woman womb and pleasure, ecstasy and Love are the only source of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matter and spirit take many forms according to many circumstances but to feel a fundamental difference between us and others is an illusion because we are all like one soul in an infinite play of individualities. If it was not the case it would be impossible to experiment life as a relational and social thing. Nobody could understand each other but we all know that there is a universal language of the soul beyond races, cultures and words so all humans can recognise the same source in everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this fact racism is a non sense. It's taking appearances and circumstances as the soul and source. It's missing the point of who people really are. It's to have very limited feelings, intelligence and emotions. It's to live a very limited life. It's to potentially ruin our own health and hurting others for nothing worthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not necessarely in the obligation to love everybody if it seems too hard for us but at least we have the obligation to try to never hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know how hard it is. Hardest challenge in the world. No doubt. Maybe impossible sometimes. But we have to give it a try.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we don't do it for others we have to do it for ourselves because avoiding useless hate and racism will keep us in better health and mood. We will have benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, give it a try just for one day,or even just for an hour... Try to forgive everybody, try to forget your hate, imagine all people as your friends and feel what it is to live in a world without enemies to fight everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relaxing and sweet isn't ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to continue or not such a marvelous state of being is up to us. Everyday we have to chose between hate and love. We chose. it's up to us.
      </p>

       I am saving this story to read when I have more time. It deserves my full attention. Just curious, when you say you do not follow any religion of this world, do you follow one of another?
Look forward to reading your story tonight.

       Great post OP, thanks for sharing
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the things that pains me most about the whole "jew hating" is that people don't even know who the real enemy is. It's not your friendly neighborhood jew, it's the ashke
       <em>
        nazi
       </em>
       jews who have their roots in the talmud.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the people controlling the institutions, not the practicing jew from everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       They use them as shield.

       That's still racist.  You're still implying that Ashkenazi Jews are bad people because of their Judaism, and you're now calling them satan worshipers.
      </p>
      <p>
       You understand that Ashkenazi Jews aren't a singular sect of Judaism but a portion of the diasporic population of Jews from before the Middle Ages.  Their dispersion across Europe lead to
       <strong>
        a variety
       </strong>
       of sub-cultural, sub-religious, cross-ethnic groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never mind, clearly this is to complex of an issue for you to understand and you're much more comfortable calling them Satan Worshipping Evil Jews.  I mean FFS kid

       There is nondenominational worship for all sects of religion.  Historically, Jewish theosophy don't reference Satan (a
       <em>
        Christian
       </em>
       mythologue)
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there Satanist (religion) Ashkenazi Jews (ethnoculture)?  Sure, I bet there are, since there are Satanists in every form of monotheistic religious sect.

       You're making no sense, using buzzwords that sound scary, that you clearly don't understand, and hoping to take over a thread about not being racist to promote a racist ideology.

       Askhenazi are your friendly neighborhood Jews. A few occultist political Zionists run the show, it has nothing to do with all Jews or Ashkenazi. This is purely a political issue.

       Source? Last I checked ethnicity was your genetics. Not the color of your skin. A black African and a black American are not the same. A white African and a white American are not the same. The African's are, the American's are, but not because of their skin.

        If I only knew more about Life and Love at this time i would have been happy with the lovely girls who really liked me, even if they were not necessary attractive to me, rather than dreaming about girls who never said "hello" to me...
       </p>
       <p>
        By the way, a guy should always accept the love of any girl without discrimination. Rejecting girls because they are not what we expect physically or other reasons brings curses. If a girl loves you you have to accept this marvelous gift of Life and learn to love her as she is a Godess. At least accept just friendship with her but never reject her demand. Only the guys who do that will know what Love and joy really means in this life. But it is another story...

       You are unconsciously playing out the societal programming that make men put women on a some imaginary pedestal, that she is some imaginary goddess to be worshipped, that you have to settle for average and are not allowed to be with someone beautiful, and this is a horrible programming/brainwashing to live with.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to learn to walk with your spine straight, chest out, get some muscles, feel the strength in your body and the energetic quality of being masculinity, be 100% confident, and the biggest secret ever is to truly and deeply, do not give a single shit about any woman. When you are truly living the "I dont give a shit and it doesn't matter" philosophy when it comes to women, on a subconscious level, they feel that this is true and become attracted to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dont do these things, and continue with the false/fake goddess worship, you will get ruined by a woman, cheated on, they'll leave you for someone more masculine, divorce raped, and so on

       protecting yourself from societal/cultural illusions programmed into us by Entertainment/TV/Media, about having what many would consider mental issues, with the worship of women and putting them of pedestals, along with protecting yourself from Western Women's nature, is hardly bigotry. It is instead, intelligence and wisdom.

       Thanks for sharing mate. For anyone who is reading this post, I highly recommend that they check out The Myth of Race by Jefferson Fish. It's a concise book that explains how the perception of race came to be, its variance from place to place, and why its not as accurate assessment for grouping human beings.

       What you fail to realize is that it's the norm.  If you were brown and lived among brown people, you'd hear the same against non-brown people.  Asian, same thing.  In all cases the racism would increase as the people around you were older and had less interaction with / exposure to people who looked different.

       I mean racism is inherent with human beings. It's a scientific fact that Asians tend to have higher IQs than other races and that Africans tend to be physically stronger than other races. Racism is the acknowledgment that each race is different. How can anyone say that the difference between races and the genes associated with each race are only skin deep? You have to be willingly ignorant to science to believe that the difference between race is only skin deep. This isn't to say that one race has more value than another but all men were not created equal.

       I don't think OP's post deals directly with conspiracy's but there are some people who tie their racist ideas into their theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't think preferring any race if you are talking about physical attraction is a problem. The problems comes when certain people generalize and judge individuals for just having a different skin color than them or thinking they are superior solely because of their race.

       racism is a byproduct of ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/10 if some one is racist against group x, its because they have never been exposed to it, hatred is a fear of the unknown response.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only way to cure racism is for these people to be exposed to those they are scared of and get to know them.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the same way you cure a phobia of dogs/spiders/whatever the only way past it is through exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is why race baiting and division are such a major focus of the media, with out that fear racism dies and can no longer be exploited as fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       unlike most people i wont label a racist stupid, they just don't know if the other is "safe" and therefor fear it. 
this is why racism is prevelant in rural areas and not in cities, exposure.
