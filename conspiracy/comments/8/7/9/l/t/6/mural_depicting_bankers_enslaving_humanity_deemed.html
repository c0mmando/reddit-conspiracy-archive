    <div class="md"><p>Artist&#39;s statement on Facebook:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a lot of questions after 9/11 that I used my art to address. My views weren&#39;t necessarily shared by many of my peers; more than being underground, they were considered disinformation and somewhat cast me as a pariah in a culture I helped build. Then the economy crashed in 2008. All my growing fears and frustrations with the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, the ever-expanding coffers of the 1% bankster elite profiting from the military industrial complex at the expense and enslavement of the working class were confirmed. So I took to the streets, first at Occupy LA 2011 then a year later I painted my &quot;Freedom for Humanity&quot; mural in East London, which received both praise and condemnation, and was eventually buffed by the local council on the grounds that it was ‚Äúanti-Semitic&quot;. Now, over 5 years later, a new breed of self-interested UK politicians and their mainstream media puppets continue to try to fit me into their tidy little box of limited perspectives using my art as a divisive tool to cut each other down and associate opposition with hate and bigotry. Yet all one has to do is simply watch the video to see my real life experiences and thoughts documented. As an artist I am always moved by the necessity to make my work important. Art must speak about the real issues of our time. Everywhere I look I see the world becoming the science fiction reality I grew up reading about in books and watching on the screen. Greed runs rampant and now more than ever the capitalist elites who have caused suffering on mass scales throughout history for their own trillions in profit have an even stronger hand in orchestrating most all of the problems we face, namely war &amp; poverty, and the destruction of humanity. ‚ÄúFreedom for Humanity‚Äù was my response to this human condition. The irony is that it‚Äôs become a mirror for the very politicians who are perhaps too afraid to look themselves in the face, all the while sitting pretty (or pretty desperate) in the coat-pockets of their financiers, the greedy elite, playing a game of monopoly on the backs of the working class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How the hell did they manage to make this even remotely about antisemitism? I can&#39;t stand this shit dude. &quot;Anti-Semitic&quot; is their impenetrable force shield that they get to hide behind forever because everyone is so fucking afraid to say anything about Jews, or Zionists, because of the alleged holocaust. Not saying i believe it was fake, but there are some questions about it, so there is that possibility. It&#39;s the same reason 9/11 will never be solved, because you are &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;,  if you even question that the jews are not perfect people. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Literally the mural in question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but it is the systemic corruption that presents the most fruitful target for change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The systemic corruption is a direct result of the legal restructuring of the state as the most prolific piece of &quot;machinery of repression&quot; as you put it, and it has been and continues to be carried out by people just like the ones featured in these murals. Is it not important to identify those primarily responsible for creating an oligarchical system? That in no way prevents people from banding together and demanding a more just economy with appropriate compensation for their work instead of the value of their labor being siphoned to an ownership class. Identifying the enemy does not prevent people from acting-quite the opposite. If you want people to take responsibility for their own quality of life in this fucked up master-slave paradigm, the worst thing you could do is call for an end to those very actions which most effectively focus and concentrate the efforts of the people.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, the tiny fragment of the population that associates with the intellectual garbage that is white supremacy and antisemitism will never bring about anything institutionally threatening to the Jewish community. That&#39;s just a fantasy spouted by the left to get you to vote for another neoliberal puppet, just like how the republicans want you to be afraid that not voting for their respective mouthpiece will result in Christians becoming second class citizens.</p>

Nothing wrong with Jews who actually follow their religion. Problem is the zionists who hijack Judaism and hide behind it while carrying out their political plans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in that case I agree with you. But only when you make the distinction that their working together is &quot;to the detriment of society.&quot; I&#39;m against any group who works together for their own benefit but at the expense of other people. If we&#39;re just talking about Jews who work in a group for their own benefit, well that&#39;s absolutely fine. As long as it doesn&#39;t hurt anyone else then I support it - everyone deserved the best for themselves. But yeah, it&#39;s important to make that distinction between whether or not their working together is to the benefit or detriment of society. And I&#39;m the case of zionists, they&#39;re certainly not benefiting greater society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you. I just wanted to make sure you understood the distinction between disliking a group because they are hurting society - which is reasonable - and disliking a group because of a shared religion they follow - which is bigoted.<br/>
That said, zionists aren&#39;t Jews. They hide behind Judaism, but they do not follow the religion. And zionists have contributed very much to the detriment of modern society, so in my opinion disliking zionists is completely reasonable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my mind, the Zionists are the Jews and the Jews are the Zionists, because the Zionists can always count on the real Jews to support them. Give a little bit of money at the Temple, sign a complaint sheet, call their representative, travel to Israel etc. In the last resort, the Zionists can always move to a new country and find a ready-made hideout amongst the Jews there. Since the Jews support the Zionists, they are basically the same thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is another layer to the meme; abstraction Of course, any criticism of Jews is met with harsh censorship, so, as happens within any dystopian society wherein a people are gagged, they find ways to (((say without saying))). With the merchant meme, there are endless variations of the picture, from pointalism to cubism to what you saw here, all to illustrate the same concept of suppression and censorship. </p>

<p>There are many examples of such symbols and innuendos being used throughout history, though not always about Jews. It&#39;s usually a portent of an awakening society, and as was the case with Germany, and Russia in the last 100 years, we can expect either governmental collapse, revolution, or an increase in draconian prison sentences for youtubers who teach their dog to sieg heil. In any case, we&#39;re in for some truly great art, so it&#39;s not going to be all bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we know that they are the Jews who say they are Jews but are not. Jesus said the same thing like 2000 years ago. What strikes me as incredibly odd, though, is how the Jewish religion abides them, defends them, and seems to exist entirely to serve them. I&#39;m not saying that there are no good Jews, but until the good in a group stand against the bad in a group, it&#39;s hard to tell them apart, and more so when they all defend each other in weird ways. If I were a Jew, I&#39;d be spending a lot of time trying to separate the bad from the good, because if they don&#39;t do it now, then once critical mass in societal awareness of their schemes is reached, they won&#39;t have another chance. With the extent and magnitude of their crimes, the world wouldn&#39;t want to let it happen again. Perilous times in the world of Semitism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Jeremy Corbyn&#39;s implacable opponent, Owen Smith (Labour MP), made a naked leadership challenge on March 23. This particular load of &quot;anti-semitism&quot; baloney was cued up to hit the media the next day.</p>

<p>Except Corbyn nixed it by firing Smith immediately, so he cut the head off the serpent as it was rearing up to strike him. All that&#39;s left, therefore, is (what was meant to be) the sting in the tail, and on its own it&#39;s pretty pathetic. A six-year-old story about an ill-advised Facebook Post and a bunch of paranoid Jews waving banners in central London for a few hours. Yawn yawn, yawn.</p>

<p>One of my favourite Twitter accounts has also pointed out that although Corbyn&#39;s supportive comment on the mural dates from 2012, the artist&#39;s confession (that&#39;s being touted as the cast-iron proof of anti-semitism) <strong>wasn&#39;t published on Facebook till 2015.</strong></p>

<p>IOW, Corbyn&#39;s actions in 2012 were not carried out in the certain knowledge of the artist&#39;s apparent anti-Jewish stance.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a circumstantial case made out of cobwebs and sealing-wax, and it fell apart almost at once. </p>

<p>It did succeed, however, in getting the &quot;Labour is anti-semitic&quot; smear back in the media, just as we enter the UK local election campaign period.</p>

<p>I recently made this comment on r/BasicIncome</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. WE need to realize that multinationals control the world, and if we want a better world, we have to attack the multinationals, replace them, destroy them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a mod replied, saying ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interesting that someone reported this saying that the term &#39;multinationals&#39; was a dog whistle phrase for Jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow. Someone reported my comment? For that? Do you think they are just confused, or trying to be deceitful?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the mod replied,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure. But I do find it frustrating that often when you want to talk about international institutions and the process of globalisation and the people that support it, you are labelled an anti-semite. It&#39;s pretty ludicrous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s almost like they are projecting.... </p>

<p>It reminds me of a scene in Al Jazeera&#39;s recent undercover investigative report on the Israel lobby in the UK: <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/investigations/thelobby/">https://www.aljazeera.com/investigations/thelobby/</a></p>

<p>There is one scene where a pro-Israel lady accuses an older lady (who was questioning her stance on the 2-state solution) of being anti-semetic for saying that she&#39;s heard that working for the  &quot;Friends of Israel&quot; organization can help you get a job. Meanwhile the pro-Israel lady inserts &quot;bank jobs&quot; in her retelling of the conversation when the older lady never mentioned banks. Sounds like someone is projecting their own stereotypes or really just assuming anyone who disagrees with them is racist. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/lobby-episode-3-anti-semitic-trope-170112090717792.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/lobby-episode-3-anti-semitic-trope-170112090717792.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truly there is a neoliberal trope that uses fear of the white supremacist movement to rationalize unquestioned support for elites, for Israeli colonialism, for financial chicanery. However, the schism of the left over identity politics does frustrate the kind of unity needed for truly responsible and ethical government. It seems worthwhile to repudiate memes which accelerate this schismatic pathology.</p>
