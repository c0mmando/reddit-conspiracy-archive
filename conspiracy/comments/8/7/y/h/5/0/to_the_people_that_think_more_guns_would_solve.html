    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about &quot;more guns&quot;, it&#39;s about where the theoretical power base for the State lies. Does it lie in the State alone? Or does the State draw its legitimacy from the consent of its <em>armed</em> citizenry, who elect Congressman to <em>represent</em> their interests? The citizens <em>must</em> be armed, or else there is a power differential that ends on the side of the State and the State alone.</p>

<p>Nuclear proliferation fucking sucks- but it has absolutely nothing to do with citizens have the <em>Right</em> to bear small arms as the final, theoretical check to their governments legitimacy and power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and i do not doubt that their intentions are true. i am wondering, if push literally came to shove, who they would stand behind, their superiors who have been corrupted, or their families and friends. people in the military seemingly idolize their career choice, maintain its philosophies, and stand by their decisions. it is glaringly clear that our govt and its military branches do not always act in the interests of the civilian population. who do they truly protect? whose agenda do they sometimes unwittingly support? you can hardly blame people for being nervous, it&#39;s been evident for a while that the agendas of the military are for profiteering and colonization. </p>

<p>also, the shots for &quot;shit whole countries,&quot; could contain chemicals other than  what they say. it&#39;s not a secret that they have tested on their soldiers, if they TEST on them, does it not stand to reason that there may be a REGIMEN they use? again, either wittingly or not?</p>

<p>We wouldn&#39;t have to. Majority of military is pro gun and on the side of the people. The only scenario could be another civil war, but the left would lose, or those wanting to fight against the people, would have to import mercenaries, which would face off against the people and majority military and vets.</p>

<p>Also, U.S. wouldn&#39;t nuke itself in a revolution scenario, it would be like Commiting suicide</p>

Or would you prefer to like up against a wall in front of a huge ditch and get mowed down?

Nuclear proliferation has been almost stunningly <em>not</em> catastrophic so far because the ruthless self-interested people who climb to power aren&#39;t suicidal.

    <div class="md"><p>I trust my common sense, something you don&#39;t seem to by applying in this case. </p>

<p>Explosions are based on the amount of energy released. We have nuclear energy because nuclear material has a fuckton of energy. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t fit as much nuclear material into a WWII era plane as you can fit in a huge ass nuclear reactor.</p>

<p>The explosion at hiroshima was 15 kilotons. That means they would have needed 15,000 tons of dynamite packed into a tiny little bomb to produce that blast. Thinking that&#39;s possible defies all imagination.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t get why you can&#39;t apply just a little bit of common sense to this, unless you&#39;re intentionally trying to spread misinformation.</p>

<p>In short, to give up nukes is foolish, it&#39;s your last bargaining chip (see Libya?).  I wish my government wasn&#39;t filled with psychopaths but it is.  These are the rules they play by.

    <div class="md"><p>Well in the sense of having a gun. To protect yourself and places without are easier to hone invade and steal their stuff. </p>

<p>So ask Iraq if they would have liked a nuke to scare away invasions. The Ukraine gave theirs back. Perhaps they would still have Crimea if they didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Russia didn&#39;t have nukes until the 1950&#39;s and the USA considered invading or nuking first until the got their own. Then not again. </p>

<p>So in a world where there are people/countries with gun/nukes and people/countries who will use them against you it&#39;s better to have one then not. </p>
