    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I feel like what happened with the Tsarnev case is that they thought they were part of a bigger plot to bomb the marathon. </p>

<p>I think they were setup by FBI agents posing as other radicalized Islams and they thought they were part of a larger plot. </p>

<p>They went out that day thinking multiple bombs would go off, but only there&#39;s did because the other FBI agents simply didn&#39;t go.</p>

<p>Then they tried to run and got taken out.</p>

<p>Their friend down in Florida was murdered by the FBI as well because he knew some parts of the plot and was probably piecing it together.</p>

<p>Another case were they probably wouldn&#39;t have gone through with it without the FBI nudging them in the direction and setting it all up.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but that&#39;s my gut feeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t restrict your question to just the ones that managed to commit a massacre. Ask how many have also been arrested for intent to commit terrorism and paraded as victories for our intelligence agencies. Then extrapolate and try to figure out how often these people have been goaded, coerced or entrapped into commiting their crimes and how many of them simply slipped through the fingers of the intelligence apparatus tasked with keeping an eye on them. Off the top of my head, the case of the Newburg 4 is a good place to start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>jim morrison grew up on military bases and his dad was the navy admiral responsible for the gulf of tonkin. he was on his dad&#39;s ship just a few months before showing up in laurel canyon. in a photo from the trip he looked like leave it to beaver.</p>

<p>frank zappa grew up on military bases and his dad was part of the top secret ICBM team.</p>

<p>pappa john (momma&#39;s and pappas) grew up on military bases, was appointed to the naval academy, and had a bizarre habit of being in every latin american country before a coup, including cuba and the bay of pigs. </p>

<p>his wife grew up on army bases with jim morrison. morrison threw a rock at her or something in kindergarten and injured her. </p>

<p>pretty much every &quot;musician&quot; in laurel canyon was linked by first degree family to high ups in the military and intelligence agencies, including the two main monkeys. i put muscian in quotes because with the exception of stills of the byrds (and crosby, stills, nash, and young), and brian wilson of the beach boys, none of them could sing, write music, or play instruments. the music was all done by the wrecking crew--kris kristopherson and glen campbell etc. the voices were overdubbed to a ridiculous level. i feel wilson wrote all of the songs, but that&#39;s just my theory.</p>

<p>laurel canyon sits under a top secret govt film studio on lookout mountain.</p>

<p>as an aside, the momma&#39;s and the pappa&#39;s were living, and had been living, for sometime in st. thomas usvi when they &quot;wrote&quot; california dreaming. none had ever been to california, and they were in a much more dreamy place regardless...the leaves certainly weren&#39;t brown and the skies most definitely were not grey.</p>
