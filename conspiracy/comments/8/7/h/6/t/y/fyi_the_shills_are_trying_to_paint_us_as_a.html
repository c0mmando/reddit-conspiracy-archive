<p>They&#39;re also trying to get us to stick to fringe paranormal conspiracies because they believe those theories make it easy to discredit us. Over and over, I see known shills post <em><strong>&quot;now this is what I come here for&quot;</strong></em> when a fringe paranormal thread is posted.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re interfering in current CIA agendas critical to police state expansion and discussing truths that the PTB have deemed off-limits for us, that&#39;s why we&#39;re ending up with so many shills, and why the shills are getting increasing dirty in their tactics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has always had posts negative of Trump, negative of the intelligence agencies, and negative of the media. There are a lot of people on this sub who want you to think that it&#39;s completely one-sided, and that&#39;s absolute horseshit. </p>

<p>In most threads, the people getting upvoted in the comments are the ones speaking out against trump. They usually respond by claiming it&#39;s because the thread made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but we see anti Trump comments at the top of threads that aren&#39;t even the top post in this sub. Notice you never see anyone claim &quot;this sub is a T_D circlejerk&quot; in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don&#39;t exist and continue with the anti-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub.  </p>

<p>Here are a few examples of anti-Trump submissions, of which there are many more if anyone decides to take a look: </p>

<p>Pay close attention to the upvote percentages. </p>

<p>&quot;Donald Trump supposedly told House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) he supports cutting Social Security but will not admit it publicly because it would hurt his election chances.

<p>&quot;Dear T_D readers, Please read this post. <strong>I am ready for your downvotes.</strong> If you are a trump supporter who also visits this sub, here is a message for you.

<p>There are also a lot of posts that say &quot;Fuck both sides.&quot; Examples:</p>

<p><strong>Response to &quot;But this is just <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> doing it, not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Many of them didn&#39;t get to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. I checked a while back using an archive. How did the ones that got to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> get there in the first place? This sub&#39;s core userbase upvoted them. Like I already mentioned, anti-Trump comments do really well in here, and you would know this if you spent any decent amount of time in this sub. Even just looking at this thread would show you that. There are many more posts just like the ones I cited above. If you search, some that you will find are at 5 upvotes, 25, 100, etc. Those are just a few of the biggest examples spanning over a year that i decided to use for my comment. </p>

<p>Plain and simple, you were fooled by others who claimed this sub is &quot;The_Donald 2.0&quot; or whatever. </p>

<p>Here are a few smaller threads that obviously didn&#39;t get to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Just a friendly reminder that Trump&#39;s labor secretary helped billionaire pedophile, and &#39;close friend&#39; of Donald Trump, Jeffrey Epstein avoid a potential life sentence in prison for trafficking underage girls for sex.&quot; 770 points, 78 percent upvoted: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76qr7j/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_trumps_labor/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76qr7j/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_trumps_labor/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of my original comment was that you don&#39;t have to choose a side. Aligning with political &#39;sides&#39; is really not helpful for critical thought, but each to their own. You&#39;ve made your choice, and you&#39;re free to do that. I&#39;ve made my choice, and I&#39;m free to do that too. My opinions may not match yours, but that&#39;s a good thing. That&#39;s helpful to discussion. No one learns anything when everyone agrees, but I&#39;m getting off point. I&#39;m motivated by truth, mostly to further spread that truth. I&#39;m not motivated towards any particular political side by said truths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not partisanship - that&#39;s called having enough brains cells to see that Trump is constantly being attacked by the deep state, which means (see if you can follow me here) <em>he isn&#39;t on the side of the deep state</em>, which means he isn&#39;t your typical president.<br/>
He may be a turd and TPTB may now be successfully getting him to do their will, but he&#39;s not on their side, and their Trump-Russia evidence wreaks of deep state concocted B.S.<br/>

<p>2 big points that are probably most pertinent for the_donald&#39;s refugees</p>

<p>Firstly we do not allow memes or shitposts. Rule 8</p>

<p>Secondly we do not call people cucks or any other pejoratives. Rule 10</p>

<p>All the other rules are equally important (like rule 6 about excessive capslock) but those two are the most likely to snag you here.</p>

<p>Surprise, a sub got massively censored by Reddit admins and r/conspiracy mods said &quot;people who come here and break the rules will be banned.&quot; Kind of like any open and decently moderated subreddit would do rather than ban people simply because they come from a sub with a particular opinion (which is different than coming from a sub that actively works to subvert opinions - ie.

<p>i had hopes he might be enough of a wildcard to slow this march toward wwIII, but recent events have put that to bed.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t see any paths around it now, the public has been whipped in to a frenzy of russophobia that makes the macarthy era pale in comparison. the only reason we havent already gone to war have been Putins ability to bob and weave.</p>

<p>the push for war has been crazy, and the only reason it hasnt happened already is Putins ability to not react.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, had Hillary made it into the White House, we&#39;d already be at war with Russia. Having to deal with unexpected Trump put a dent in TPTB&#39;s plans. Probably only slowed them down a bit though. It appears they may have obtained pretty solid control of Trump now. I didn&#39;t vote for Trump. I voted third-party, but if I had been forced to choose between him and Hillary WIII Clinton, I would obviously have chosen him, because there was at least some chance he wasn&#39;t a puppet whereas Hillary absolutely positively was their next chosen puppet (Bush Part III). If it&#39;s of any comfort, I don;t there there are nearly as many real people getting duped into the anti-Russia frenzy as it appears. It&#39;s mostly bots &amp; shills with a chunk of clueless pack followers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears Hillary was the planned puppet for a long time and, as early as 2014, they started pouring money and resources into creating an environment in which she would either be highly popular or the illusion of high popularity would be believable by MSM watchers (they ended up spending at least a couple billion, imo). I still believe Hillary actually did win via voting machine fraud but the voting machines weren&#39;t correctly programmed to deal with the electoral college element, so it ended up going to Trump. That&#39;s why there was such an insane sloppy panic, and impeachment push, from TPTB right after the election. They didn&#39;t really have a fallback plan. They thought the machines would guarantee a win for Hillary.<br/>
Thanks for reminding me about Jeb. I need to go back and look at what was taking place around the time that he threw his hat in, to determine what they likely had in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an outdated definition. It&#39;s now used as an analog to neocon. Neoliberal = new liberal. They&#39;re not liberals. The same way neocons aren&#39;t conservatives.

They literally just push whatever agenda the CIA currently wants pushed and always support, or remain silent about, the military invasions. Might as well call them CIAliberals instead. They didn&#39;t come into existence organically (they&#39;re a CIA creation) and their numbers aren&#39;t as great as they appear - they&#39;re inflated by fake MSM reports and bot &amp; shill activity.</p>

<p>2 big points that are probably most pertinent for the_donald&#39;s refugees</p>

<p>Firstly we do not allow memes or shitposts. Rule 8</p>

<p>Secondly we do not call people cucks or any other pejoratives. Rule 10</p>

<p>All the other rules are equally important (like rule 6 about excessive capslock) but those two are the most likely to snag you here.</p>

<p>Surprise, a sub got massively censored by Reddit admins and r/conspiracy mods said &quot;people who come here and break the rules will be banned.&quot; Kind of like any open and decently moderated subreddit would do rather than ban people simply because they come from a sub with a particular opinion (which is different than coming from a sub that actively works to subvert opinions - ie.
