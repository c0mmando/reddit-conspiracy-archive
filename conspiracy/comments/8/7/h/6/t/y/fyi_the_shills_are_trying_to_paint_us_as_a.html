       Painting us as a pro-Trump sub helps them get unpaid SJW/NEOliberal reinforcements and sympathy from admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're also trying to get us to stick to fringe paranormal conspiracies because they believe those theories make it easy to discredit us. Over and over, I see known shills post
       <em>
        <strong>
         "now this is what I come here for"
        </strong>
       </em>
       when a fringe paranormal thread is posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're interfering in current CIA agendas critical to police state expansion and discussing truths that the PTB have deemed off-limits for us, that's why we're ending up with so many shills, and why the shills are getting increasing dirty in their tactics.

       This sub has always had posts negative of Trump, negative of the intelligence agencies, and negative of the media. There are a lot of people on this sub who want you to think that it's completely one-sided, and that's absolute horseshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most threads, the people getting upvoted in the comments are the ones speaking out against trump. They usually respond by claiming it's because the thread made it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but we see anti Trump comments at the top of threads that aren't even the top post in this sub. Notice you never see anyone claim "this sub is a T_D circlejerk" in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don't exist and continue with the anti-
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few examples of anti-Trump submissions, of which there are many more if anyone decides to take a look:

        /r/all
       </a>
       get there in the first place? This sub's core userbase upvoted them. Like I already mentioned, anti-Trump comments do really well in here, and you would know this if you spent any decent amount of time in this sub. Even just looking at this thread would show you that. There are many more posts just like the ones I cited above. If you search, some that you will find are at 5 upvotes, 25, 100, etc. Those are just a few of the biggest examples spanning over a year that i decided to use for my comment.

       Huge numbers of people keep spreading the false claim that "this sub is T_D 2.0" and "anything anti-Trump gets buried," yet I'm the bad guy for reposting a comment of mine a couple times. You're just pissed that you're finding out about a fake narrative.

       You are lumping genuine concerns in with admittedly brigaded anit-Trump posts. The end result is trying to make it seem like it is all brigaded when half of those things DESERVE to be talked about. If you believe they deserve to be talked about then why did you include them in your copypasta?

       I think you have such an incredible hatred and bias within you that you cannot imagine that others do not abide it as well, so anyone who disagrees with you on any little things is "partisan".

       The fuck are you even talking about? Do you think I'm left wing or something? And you blindly deduce that and then accuse me of having a bias? I think both tribes are fucking retarded. I form my own conclusions. I even said "my profile is right there". But no. Keep your head in the sand and keep up the snap judgements.

       The whole point of this thread is that we are neither left nor right wing, as a whole. Acting offended that someone may even suggest that you may be left wing (which they didn't even do) massively shows your bias. We welcome opposing political opinions, but only if you welcome them too.

       I'm answering your question to the best of my ability. You're asking what do i do, and I'm telling you what i do. I had to reword what I'd previously stated into the form of an answer to your question, because you asked me to and that is quite simply my answer. At this point it seems your issue is that I'm not giving the answer you're looking for.

       The whole point of my original comment was that you don't have to choose a side. Aligning with political 'sides' is really not helpful for critical thought, but each to their own. You've made your choice, and you're free to do that. I've made my choice, and I'm free to do that too. My opinions may not match yours, but that's a good thing. That's helpful to discussion. No one learns anything when everyone agrees, but I'm getting off point. I'm motivated by truth, mostly to further spread that truth. I'm not motivated towards any particular political side by said truths.

       You cannot just make stuff up to support your narrative.  That is not how any of this is supposed to work.  You can at least use Occam's razor.  The simplest and more likely explanation is the suit was brought in an attempt to sway the election towards Hillary and once she lost there was no reason to continue.  If she had continued she would have been counter sued and publicly deposed and she was not willing to face that kind of scrutiny.

       That would be very convenient for them.
       <br/>
       It would also mean we're morons considering that Trump has thoroughly proven himself to be another tool of the military-industrial complex (whether willingly or via pressure &amp; false intelligence reports).
       <br/>
       Hillary was supposed to be their next puppet but they're managing to get Trump to do most of what they want anyway.

       There are virtually no politicians that this sub (a sub with so many awakened people) should be supporting.

       Ron Paul,

       Yeah this is such a dumb post. “We aren’t pro Trump!” Ok then start a post that goes into the multiple conspiracies going on around him. I enjoy the fringe conspiracies and I don’t think they are a distraction from the political conspiracies, a few years ago this sub had a ton of fringe conspiracies and everyone was super critical of Obama’s. Jade helm, secret Walmart tunnels, fema camps, etc. now days you come on here and you see maybe 1 non political theory, a bunch of t_d reposts, and maybe a few locked threads that are critical of trump because “brigadier”.

       This is my problem. Is this Russia thing not potentially the biggest scandal in us political history? And there's plenty of tidbits of evidence this sub would normally eat up. And the way this administration is operating (like putting Pruit as head of the epa) or the ceo of ExxonMobil as the former secretary of state. Or John Bolton as the National Security Advisor? This is shit this sub would be salivating over.

       We don't idolize the president, this is a situation you fellas tend to get wrong. When someone disagrees with your favorite conspiracy, it does not mean that they are whatever hyperbolic image that you paint them as, no matter how much you want to believe it, you will not convince people with belittling and concern trolling.

       You said conspiracy posters, which I'm assuming anything slightly leaning right fits the bill of an invasion from The_Donald to some users (don't want to say you, but your pointed comment  and downvotes lead me to believe it) who fail to realize/acknowledge the amount of brigading from multiple sources that happen to the sub on a daily basis.

       Nope. The Trump 'conspiracies' have CIA stink all over them. That's what you're failing to remember about this sub - we know conspiracies - that's out thing. We may not be able to identify all conspiracies that are fake but we can identify the ones that are
       <em>
        blatantly
       </em>
       fake - the ones that were clearly concocted by the warmongering psychopaths in power.

       A lot of people here claim to not be partisan, but as soon as we get a Republican president they all of a sudden love the president. If you bring up facts about the investigation they’ll hit you with the “oh you believe the FBI?? You aren’t a real conspiracy theorist.”

       That's not partisanship - that's called having enough brains cells to see that Trump is constantly being attacked by the deep state, which means (see if you can follow me here)
       <em>
        he isn't on the side of the deep state
       </em>
       , which means he isn't your typical president.
       <br/>
       He may be a turd and TPTB may now be successfully getting him to do their will, but he's not on their side, and their Trump-Russia evidence wreaks of deep state concocted B.S.
       <br/>
       So.. we absolutely are watching all of it and we're giving all of it consideration, but conspiracies that are
       <em>
        blatantly
       </em>
       concocted by the deep state to aid their agendas are going to get exactly the type of attention they deserve.

       This is the "circlejerk" tactic. Attempting to make it appear that there is some kind of consensus that team Republican is really delusional and needs to be more apologetic and timid. Of course, r/conspiracy knows both parties are fake and owned by Wall Street.

       What's the scandal again? That Putin hacked John Podestas email and voters  learned the truth about corruotion at the dnc and hrc campaign? Or is it that Putin hired trolls to make memes about Jesus wrestling the devil or that Bernie is a progressive hero? Sorry but that doesn't seem like a huge scandal.

       Surprise, a sub got massively censored by Reddit admins and r/conspiracy mods said "people who come here and break the rules will be banned." Kind of like any open and decently moderated subreddit would do rather than ban people simply because they come from a sub with a particular opinion (which is different than coming from a sub that actively works to subvert opinions - ie. TMoR)

       More signs that the CIA is behind the bulk of the attacks against Trump. Saying he's a horrible person while simultaneously saying nothing about the military invasions, and even giving him a momentary pass when he agreed to shell Syria? This isn't the behavior of the

       exactly. Trump was the lesser of two evils during the last election but its become clear that was either a ploy (and he was just as bad as shitlery) or that they got to him and are now steering him either directly or by simply manipulating him.

       i don't see any paths around it now, the public has been whipped in to a frenzy of russophobia that makes the macarthy era pale in comparison. the only reason we havent already gone to war have been Putins ability to bob and weave.
      </p>
      <p>
       the chemical attacks, the turkey-russian shoot downs, mh-17 false flags, the UK poisoning, the attacks on venezulea, all the turmoil that just happend to appear in nearly every BRICS nation almost simultaneously etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       the push for war has been crazy, and the only reason it hasnt happened already is Putins ability to not react.

       Yep, had Hillary made it into the White House, we'd already be at war with Russia. Having to deal with unexpected Trump put a dent in TPTB's plans. Probably only slowed them down a bit though. It appears they may have obtained pretty solid control of Trump now. I didn't vote for Trump. I voted third-party, but if I had been forced to choose between him and Hillary WIII Clinton, I would obviously have chosen him, because there was at least some chance he wasn't a puppet whereas Hillary absolutely positively was their next chosen puppet (Bush Part III). If it's of any comfort, I don;t there there are nearly as many real people getting duped into the anti-Russia frenzy as it appears. It's mostly bots &amp; shills with a chunk of clueless pack followers.

       It appears Hillary was the planned puppet for a long time and, as early as 2014, they started pouring money and resources into creating an environment in which she would either be highly popular or the illusion of high popularity would be believable by MSM watchers (they ended up spending at least a couple billion, imo). I still believe Hillary actually did win via voting machine fraud but the voting machines weren't correctly programmed to deal with the electoral college element, so it ended up going to Trump. That's why there was such an insane sloppy panic, and impeachment push, from TPTB right after the election. They didn't really have a fallback plan. They thought the machines would guarantee a win for Hillary.
       <br/>
       Thanks for reminding me about Jeb. I need to go back and look at what was taking place around the time that he threw his hat in, to determine what they likely had in mind.

       trump just savaged him in the debates, not with anything but insults but it destroyed his ratings. at that stage im pretty sure he had the most "donations" of either parties candidates.

       That's an outdated definition. It's now used as an analog to neocon. Neoliberal = new liberal. They're not liberals. The same way neocons aren't conservatives.  They're a new breed psychos that lie somewhere between moderate and fascist and dare to call themselves left/liberal. They literally just push whatever agenda the CIA currently wants pushed and always support, or remain silent about, the military invasions. Might as well call them CIAliberals instead. They didn't come into existence organically (they're a CIA creation) and their numbers aren't as great as they appear - they're inflated by fake MSM reports and bot &amp; shill activity.

       Oh my god. Is the problem The Shills or the fact that like 30 percent of current posts are these whiny meta-deals with no substance or evidence? "The sub" writ large isn't pro Trump, just happens that he directly appealed to the conspiracy community as part of his campaign, and this campaign has continued with stuff like Q and his "trust Jeff Sessions, bring down the liberal cabal" false-hope fever dreams. Trump being a man who got internationally rich and powerful via globalist business practices, the very system he allegedly wishes to take down now.

       Nope. The problem is the shills, their vote manipulation, their gaslighting and their portraying themselves as fellow conspiracy watchers. That's why there are so many posts about the shills (not even remotely close to 30% though) are appearing - because the shills have become a major fucking problem.

       The problem is shills. You can pretend they don't exist all you'd like, parroting "proof, proof?!?!?!", demanding pictures of Israeli college students replying to one of your posts specifically or you won't believe they do it to anyone else, but everyone with the ability to recognize a pattern are going to keep living in reality. I'm sorry that that's getting to you. Maybe get some fresh air

       I'm sure they do exist and operate here all the time, along with the rest of Reddit and the internet. But every "solution" proposed ends up being censorship of some kind, and all the posts like this in the world isn't gonna change much. The key is provide good info, engage in real conversations, and note when somebody's Team Sport M.O. has blinded them from the other half of reality.

       There are a still some people who haven't heard of shills, and some who are just now coming to the realization and so will post what it most prescient to them given that. It's tempting to demand that the whole world "get on your level", but it's counter-productive.

      <p>
       This does not mean that real users cannot identify shills. Shills started reverse-accusing people only after their tricks were growing thin. I trust in the intelligence of my common man.

       More importantly, a lot of new people don't understand how infested this place is, and they inadvertantly just accept what some shill says without thinking about it. Most common example is the "not everyone who disagrees is a shill" line.

        doesn't ban content because it is pro Trump, but we will ban based on behavior.
       </p>
       <p>
        Read our rules before posting please.
       </p>
       <p>
        2 big points that are probably most pertinent for the_donald's refugees
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly we do not allow memes or shitposts. Rule 8
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly we do not call people cucks or any other pejoratives. Rule 10
       </p>
       <p>
        All the other rules are equally important (like rule 6 about excessive capslock) but those two are the most likely to snag you here.
       </p>
       <p>
        And please do not link to other subreddits here, you guys have a voat community if you need to do that shit.

       Surprise, a sub got massively censored by Reddit admins and r/conspiracy mods said "people who come here and break the rules will be banned." Kind of like any open and decently moderated subreddit would do rather than ban people simply because they come from a sub with a particular opinion (which is different than coming from a sub that actively works to subvert opinions - ie. TMoR)

       He raped a 13 year old who he said looked like Ivanka. Ivanka was 13 at the time too.

       I'm sure they do exist and operate here all the time, along with the rest of Reddit and the internet. But every "solution" proposed ends up being censorship of some kind, and all the posts like this in the world isn't gonna change much. The key is provide good info, engage in real conversations, and note when somebody's Team Sport M.O. has blinded them from the other half of reality.

       Alleged. I am a woman and I don't support the witch hunt, where a guy who once slapped an ass is likely too lose his career. The appropriate response to that is, you say something, they say "Sorry" and so long as they didn't do it again, that's it over.
