       <strong>
        When your sheep are getting killed by wolves, you get a guard dog. Simple as that, maybe a better fence too. You don't have the sheperds stand in the field with guns. They are sheperds. That would be disruptive and counterproductive.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Students are our future. They are America's greatest natural resource. They deserve to be in an environment where they feel safe, not an environment where they are forced to wear prison backpacks and are subjected to prison-style policies.
       <strong>
        That is the best way to ensure future shootings occur
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, you can't just have any old rent-a-cop with a gun or local PD do it. That will not be effective and that will not give students the sense of security they need.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be an honor to protect HS students. So what if they are ungrateful and disrespectful. There is also immense hope, creative energy, and visions of unlimited potential there. There's also a lot of fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Solution:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Create a program in which the best and the brightest from military academies and ROTC volunteer to do 1-2 years as armed security in high risk schools. I'm talking West Point, Coast Guard Academy, Air Force Academy, Naval Academy. The cream of the crop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Teach for America and Peace Corps consistently attract some of the top talent from the best universities in the US. Why can't this be the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       To make it effective, participants would undergo incredibly intense psychological and tactical training on par with the seals and other elite groups. In addition they would also do meditation. If they pass, they are accepted into the program and are placed into a school with the best tech in communications, surveillance, and threat deterrence, as well as a whole range of non-lethal equipment. They would not answer to the PD, teachers, or administrators, but they would only be allowed in the school if the community passes a vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace Corps can only go to countries where they have been invited by the governments there. School funding is decided by local elections via school levies. This should be the same. It's not mandatory, but it would be funded by the national government, maybe local governments pay a % of the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       As volunteers would be smart and extremely well-trained, people would look at them and rest easy, not worry.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make these positions attractive, in addition to the training, participation in this program would fast-track their career advancement and get immediate pay benefits relative to their peers who did not participate. This seems fair and equitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our children need to have a sense of security in order to learn. This would provide that, and so many other benefits to volunteers and the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does everyone think?
      </p>
      <p>
       There will always be wolves. Declawing them and making them wear clear backpacks is not going to stop them from killing again. I believe this to be a workable solution.

       The data on video games shows that there is no positive correlation beyween violent video games and school shootings. In fact, 80% of shooters did not play video games.

       Ok, now take that data and remove it from your mind for a second. Do you honestly think that an impressionable child in his formative years is not going to be affected, at all, by spending countless hours each day watching people die in bloody horrific fashion on television AND THEN simulating the very same act over and over for days on end in the form a ultra-realistic video game, where they are in-fact REWARDED in-game for this behavior? No impact?

       Pitbulls are illegal because people are idiots. Gullible sheep wanting the state to protect them. There are no bad dogs just bad dog owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are dozens of breeds that could eat pitbulls for lunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every BSL legislation includes many breeds that are not pitbulls.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we don't encourage the state into every aspect of our lives.

       Pitbulls are bred to latch onto a cows hindquarters and not let go until it falls over and/or dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a breed they are incredibly loyal to their owners, but have been statistically proven to show violence towards everyone else. They are great and intelligent dogs when trained properly and in the right environment. They have no place in schools.

       communities would decide for themselves whether they or high risk or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other factors like:
      </p>
      <p>
       crime rates

       wkuld certaintly be factored in. In the beginning, it would make the most sense to start with schools where shootings have already occurred. Remember, its as much about giving the community a sense of security as it is about stopping or preventing shootings.

       remember, it would only be 1-2 years and by invitation only. It could scale as it grows in popularity, other channels of volunteers could work once the legitimacy of the training is established.

       Most schools and districts would vote to not have the service, but for those who do want it, it is a high quality service.

There is no way in hell I was going to find myself  standing there unable to protect them, while some over medicated, fatherless jerk comes in and starts killing the kids I love.Hell i used to eat my lunch in the yard to make sure my kids were not terrorized by the school bullies.

       People are far more likely to be shot or oppressed by cops than they are the occasional school shooter.  Putting the cops (or military, somehow worse) in the schools just brings up the likelihood of being murdered by cops by several points.

       You could also "domesticate the wolves". If there are no (or at least far less) wolves to attack then it helps solve the issue. If a kid goes into a school and starts shooting and this volunteer shoots him before the kids can kill anyone, the kid is still dead, we still have a dead body. 0 dead bodies are better than 1 dead bodies, we need to change society to PREVENT someone from ever wanting to run into a school with a gun. There is also no guarantee that the volunteer will not snap in the future.

       You know what the end of this is going to be?  They're going to purge students who are considered problematic, and there will be a campaign for students to rat out and isolate the ones that are considered problematic.  Then combine that with an education system which necessarily isolates kids and you'll get a solid 20-25% of the kids being weeded out and basically denied a future - if the kids aren't problematic, they're make sure they are.

       I already saw enough of that when I was in the system, counselors bragging about their sadism towards kids they didn't like.  Just imagine how it's going to be when they're really let off the leash.

       By the way, it's not just going to be the targeted kids, it's going to be their parents and siblings who are shamed and ridiculed.  My mother suffered greatly merely because she chose not to throw me into an institution, and I believe it was started because I was a third child.  Gotta have that two child policy in place!

       Your plan will do jack shit.  If a kid decides to suicide attack, they're not going to be intimidated by some armed thug.  The armed thug might kill the shooter, but the shooters are going to obviously go for the element of surprise and try to take out as many people as they can before they go down.  That's what the Virginia Tech shooter did.

       There really isn't a solution to this.  Full confiscation would curb the kills as guns are replaced by melee weapons or, if the killer is creative, homemade explosives.  The environment which triggers the attacks in the first place will still be intact, and everyone with the power to do something about it willfully persists in recreating that environment.  The question I have is why it doesn't happen more often - and it probably does, but there isn't always a narrative or a bunch of photogenic, privileged students to put on the TV.

       My dad was an AFA grad and F16 pilot for 20 yrs.. I Highly doubt he would have voluntarily postponed a career he worked 6 years to accomplish to be a school guard when he could be flying the most advanced fighter at the time.

       definitely not for everyone, but there are some who would see the need and heed the call.

       Definitely think there could be a solution similar to what you proposed.. Maybe make 18yo’s who are seeking to enlist straight out of HS, be assigned to school protection a requirement before they go abroad to die in a foreign land in a meaningless and endless war.. would be great training on peacefully policing

       yeah. it would take a specific type of person. Most would go their whole 'tour'without seeing any action. It would be pretty boring, but worth every taxpayer penny if they stop stuff from happening. They would have to enjoy observing a lot.

       I dont think these guys should have any place breaking up normal fights, just the ones where there are weapons.

       Pitbulls are bred to latch onto a cows hindquarters and not let go until it falls over and/or dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a breed they are incredibly loyal to their owners, but have been statistically proven to show violence towards everyone else. They are great and intelligent dogs when trained properly and in the right environment. They have no place in schools.
