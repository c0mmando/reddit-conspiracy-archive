        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So is there? Like not just the Holocaust one, but other things also, like did he really plan to exterminate all of the &quot;non Aryan/Germans&quot; after the war, or was he just more &quot;pro white Europe&quot; and not &quot;GAS EVERYTHING&quot;, you get the point. Also, other dictators/authoritarians at the time (and later) had some redeeming qualities, like Tito for example, so was he that bad, is what i&#39;m trying to say.  All in all, not trying to say he didn&#39;t do anything wrong, just is everybody &quot;demonizing&quot; him for a good reason, or is it a little bit fabrication? </p>

<p>PS; don&#39;t take this too seriously or get offended, please. This is just a thought i had these days, after watching some documentaries.</p>

<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark is kinda true.  It&#39;s partially why Italy invaded Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Nazis traveled to Tibet to learn how the Green Dragon Society operated, and to gain access to the underground tunnels/bases/races said to be under Tibet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The book is The Spear of Destiny by Trevor Ravenscroft.</p>

<p>It mostly focuses of Hitler&#39;s and his backers attempts to first acquire, then use, the power contained within the spear to win the war (super condensed recap).</p>

<p>The Spear of Destiny is the one that pierced the side of Jesus, by the hands of Longinus, as Jesus was being crucified by Pilate.</p>

<p>As the tale unfolds, the Vril, Thule, and Tibet connections are discussed, but not the focus.</p>

<p>Lots of other occult and r/conspiracy concepts are discussed as well, root races, remote viewing (one Nazi general claimed he could remote view, and knew of troop movements, etc before the Allied did them), consciousness, all sorts of good stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah, i mean he probably was. But isn&#39;t it kinda strange (at least to me) that so many people followed him? Like i know about the state of Germany and it&#39;s people at the time and all (that&#39;s kinda normal, considering how they had nothing to do with the army, so they weren&#39;t &quot;burdened&quot; by their actions), but how come there wasn&#39;t any resistance or segregation within the army, like lets say a regiment or something decides they wont burn//rape/kill anymore (in Russia. for example) and &quot;protests&quot; or something? How come they went to such lengths to secure so much land, kill so many, and do those things just because a crazy guy told them too? I mean, there was like 7+ million people in their army at the time, how come non rebelled? But is there such a theory, as i said above?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It kinda takes a darker turn when you consider the army, in my opinion. Because of the things i said before, the size, no rebellion and all. Maybe extreme German nationalism? But Nazism was kinda borderline occultic, so again weird.</p>

<p>Bush&#39;s administration had the 9/11 card to get that frenzy going, the good guys versus &#39;the terrorists&#39;. I guess Hitler had Germany&#39;s astronomical economic recovery versus the perceived wrong doings of the Jews?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mike King makes a persuasive case in his book <em>The Bad War</em> that all of Hitler&#39;s military maneuvers were pre-emptive in nature, or a reaction to a provocation.  When you&#39;re the bully, you try to bait the smaller country into moving first, so you can gain the propoganda advantage. When your existence is on the line, you take the bait because winning the public relations battle is secondary to survival.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler and the other Nazis were quite explicit about their vision of Nazi Europe and a Nazi world when writing to other Nazis and their target audience.  If you take the Nazis at their word there is no way they wouldn&#39;t, say, exterminate the Jews when they repeatedly call for the extermination of the Jews (something which is not totally unprecedented in European history, as the Nazis were just repeating a sentiment that goes back to the middle ages).  The attempts to sanitize latter-day race-science and eugenics are the same as attempts to sanitize Nazism, and both produce the same outcomes.</p>
