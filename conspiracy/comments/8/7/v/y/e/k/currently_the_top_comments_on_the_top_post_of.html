<p>Yes, only the right wing spearheaded by the alt-right are demonizing Hogg this way.</p>

<p>Maybe but that isn&#39;t the issue I commented on.</p>

<p>How convenient for you to be able to reject actual facts and data so you can make up all kinds of stuff unimpeded.</p>

<p>Aw, maybe if you thought for yourself instead of the conclave, you&#39;d realize the error in your logic.</p>

<p>In this lovely video you’ll see that Hogg personally admits he wasn’t even at the school at the time of the shooting.  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=4m26s&amp;amp;v=IUOkBv6wMhc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=4m26s&amp;amp;v=IUOkBv6wMhc</a></p>

<p>Late in the 2nd minute. It’s more than acknowledged here on this that David Hogg was a plant of some kind. He’s like 25 irl, has now been a “victim” at 2 different school shootings, and is just about the worst attempt at a media pawn ever.</p>

<p>David Hogg is acting as a spokesperson for a movement,  if you don&#39;t want to be personally dragged through the mud,  then don&#39;t do that.  See:  Julian Assange.</p>

<p>It&#39;s goalpost moving like this on this issue that&#39;s getting seriously out of hand,  and it&#39;s why this story continually has traction on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  You&#39;re free to start any movement you like in this country,  and we&#39;re free to question you and your motives to the fullest extent of our capabilities;  if you think we&#39;re wrong then coming in here to attack our very structure of consideration and conversation will only create the opposite of what you seem to desire.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re seriously conspiratorially minded,  you&#39;ll see this entire situation as the <em>true</em> conspiracy;  with the end goal of destabilizing peoples very perception of reality.</p>

<p>Aside from that,  if you or any other media organization wants to address the issue of the conspiracies surrounding David Hogg and refuting them with facts and material evidence -- why not do that?  Instead you <em>and</em> these professional organizations would rather poke fun at people who make a habit of questioning the narrative.</p>

<p>So true. And it&#39;s also been really bad on many other topics in this sub. Yesterday, the top post was about 6 articles using the word gamble. It was a weak conspiracy.... <strong>BUT</strong>.... The top comments kept parroting the exact same FALSE rebuttal that all of the articles were quoting a specific person using the word. A quick look at each article EASILY proved their claim as false nonsense.</p>

<p>I refuted so many of these comments and encouraged them to actually read the articles. Every single reply I got just refused to admit they were wrong and just moved the goal post of their argument to something else.</p>

The anonymity of the internet, and the ability to have two conflicting stories right next to each other make it impossible to fully control, so there needs to be some form of debunking in order to control the actual story. So the only way to control what’s being said is to astroturf the comments you don’t like, and promote the ones you do. This is the new norm I’m afraid. </p>

<p>It looks like the old guard is winning, they persuaded google to change the open platform on youtube by submitting pedo content. They put their foot down on Netflix and Amazon by taking their movie rights to their own platforms. They attempted to kill facebook   by attaching it to the whole Russia thing.

<blockquote>
<p>Impact of mobilizations . Negative mobilizations have a long- term adverse impact on the involved users and communities. We find that negative mobilizations lead to a “colonization” effect, where defenders reduce their participation in the target commu- nity while attackers become more active. However, building off our analysis of user-level interactions, our results suggests a possible route for mitigating this adverse outcome: we show that a reduction in the echo-chamber effect—marked by an increased interaction between attackers and defenders—and an increase in defenders’ use of anger words towards attackers, are associated with decreased rates of colonization and increased future participation rates for the defenders. Thus, it appears that <strong>increased engagement and a more fierce defense may be a more effective mitigation strategy, compared to ignoring or isolating the attacking users.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of threads that hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> seem to have this trend where a comment that belittles the sub and mocks the conspiracy will suddenly hijack top spot from supportive comments from the real <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> userbase.  Then the <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> users begin flooding in and further reinforcing the dismissive top comment.  The fact that top comments always spawn large comment chains also acts to effectively bury the supportive comments underneath.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been a fierce defender of the sub, so apparently I must be doing something right.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is absolutely fucked at this point.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go quite that far, but it does resemble <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> in a very bad way for about the last year. in fact, I think the time I noticed a sudden change in the community was around the time Brocke announced Shariablue, and his contrinbutions to keep it running. </p>

<p>I consider <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> &quot;absolutely fucked at this point.&quot; You have the mods over there fighting to keep anything against the left/Clinton narrative buried. Submitting a single post of facts that shed Hillary in a negative light was immediadetly removed and so arduous I gave up. Post rejected as duplicate, not politics related, etc.  </p>

<p>At least the mods are still on the side of the conspiracy community basics. </p>

<p>I agree both sides are the same.But I had hope for Barry in 2008. He was an inside, made, crooked ass politician spewing his master&#39;s orders eloquently.</p>

<p>Trump is not a politician. He does not rely on payoffs and kickbacks to fatten his pockets against the interest of the citizens. That&#39;s what all the other fuckers do. </p>

<p>I have hope for Trump. He might be hard to defend because he does/says some crazy shit, but he is doing a pretty good job so far. </p>

<p>I will hold onto my hope.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. An article was posted about a survey claiming 78% of people who say they are Democrats favor banning semi-automatic weapons. The post is showing “0” with over 40 comments, the top few are calling OP a liar and saying he’s pushing propaganda.

    <div class="md"><p>Because they send their guys to set threads and just bombard it with upvote. they changed tactics from upvoting their posts to the top of front page and instead just go for the comments instead. when I take a step back and really think about what you&#39;re doing it&#39;s insanely good and well done. </p>

<p>the main thing they try to do, similar to how the media does it really, is to try make you feel as if you are alone in your thoughts, you&#39;re stupid for having your thoughts and their thought is the &#39;just&#39; thought </p>

<p>you can spot it a mile away though as they usually will try and make the comments have a touch of condescending attitude or just downright antagonizing </p>

<p>for those though who feel as though they are getting to you, just remember ~ the fact they do this means they are panicking and on their back legs </p>
