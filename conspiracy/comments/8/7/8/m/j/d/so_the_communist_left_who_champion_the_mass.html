    <div class="md"><p>you don&#39;t really have many accidents with a gun (compared to purposeful incidents), usually more targetted planned actions... of course there ARE accidents, like a child shooting his younger sister because the IRRESPONSIBLE PARENTS can&#39;t safely raise children around WEAPONS. You don&#39;t put your kitchen knife drawer next to the cot, do you?</p>

<p>A gun&#39;s SOUL purpose is to kill someone.</p>

<p>A car&#39;s purpose is to HELP you get to A to B.</p>

<p>Now, you will argue that a gun can be used for whatever, but the point of it is to kill/wound/inflict damage, regardless if it &quot;helps&quot; you, ie shooting someone&#39;s kneecap instead of killing them. </p>

<p>The main point of a car is to help. Not so you can go buy a car, then drive it straight INTO a petrol station, causing an explosion and killing people.</p>

<p>See how both ASSIST YOU? but one is predominantly a weapon, the other an aid.</p>

<p>Of course, this can be twisted, let&#39;s try and be clever. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh you can have a water gun, that&#39;s just pure fun!&quot;</p>

<p>Or </p>

<p>&quot;Oh but you can have a tank!&quot;</p>

<p>but think about it, the tank has a gun on it.</p>

<p>quote:</p>

<p>Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million per year, in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008.&quot;</p>

<p>CARTOONS | JERRY HOLBERT
VIEW CARTOON
Criminologist and researcher Gary Kleck, using his own commissioned phone surveys and number extrapolation, estimates that Americans use guns for defensive purposes 1.2 million times each year -- and that 1 in 6 Americans who have used guns defensively believe someone would have died but for their ability to resort to their defensive use of firearms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are completely wrong in your analogy. There are tons of regulations for cars to prevent deaths:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>seat belts</p></li>
<li><p>child seats/children have to be in the back seat</p></li>
<li><p>insurance</p></li>
<li><p>safety requirements in the manufacture of the car</p></li>

<p>Car accidents kill far more children than guns.  Why isn&#39;t the Left concerned about that?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that the Left does not give a rat&#39;s ass about children.  Look at abortion.  </p>

<p>They want to ban guns because it fits their communist agenda.</p>

<p>About <a href="http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml">300 people</a> get struck by lightning in a given year. </p>

<p>About <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States">100.000 people</a> get shot in a given year.</p>

<p>So there is a 333 times greater chance of getting shot. </p>

<p>If you only count deaths then the numbers are about 10.000 and 30, so actually the same ratio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are making generalizations about the &quot;communist left&quot;.  You are putting words in the mouth of about half the US.  </p>

<p>Most people are asking for reasonable regulations on gun ownership, not total bans.  I have no doubt that I would qualify as the &quot;communist left&quot; in your book, but I am a gun owner who has had a conceal-carry permit for 12 years.  How does that work?</p>

<p>Also, your analogy is wrong as pointed out below.  To own a car in the US, you have to do the following:
* Take a driving class
* Pass a driving test
* Obtain a license to drive a car.
* Register your car with the state every year.
* Prove that you are insured.
* Misusing your car can result in loss of license to drive one.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s contrast that with current gun law.  In order to buy my first gun, I had to do the following:
* Go buy a gun.</p>

<p>Steve can be registered to vote in California.  But Steve doesnt vote because Steve is dead, but he <em>is</em> registered to vote.

<p>Only a small percentage of people are imprisoned for crimes involving guns, and even then the guns are usually peripheral to the actual crime and were never used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fuo.pdf">Almost one-fifth</a> of inmates carried a gun when arrested. 1-in-10 state inmates actually shot the gun, and 1-in-50 federal inmates. For state numbers, this is not a &quot;small percentage.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, &quot;The U.S. is ranked 4th out of 34 developed nations for the highest incidence rate of homicides committed with a firearm, according to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data.&quot;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#Homicides">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#Homicides</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost 50% of arrests in America are for drugs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure where you got this statistic. &quot;In 2016, about 200,000, under 16%, of the 1.3 million people in state jails, were serving time for drug offenses.&quot;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States#Violent_and_nonviolent_crime">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States#Violent_and_nonviolent_crime</a></p>

<p>I found your statistic though, and that&#39;s only for federal prisons. For state, it&#39;s the number I gave above. Though, the amount of people in federal prisons is much less than that in state. According to [<a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2018.html%5D(this">https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2018.html](this</a> statistic), 225,000 are in federal prisons, while 1.316 million are in state, and 615,000 are in local jails (138,300 others). Of those 2.3 million, 455,600 are in for drugs, or 20%. This is not 50%, so no, the imprisonment rates are not like other countries if you take drugs out of the factor.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about America being a prison state, hence federal prisons.</p>

<p>What are you comparing it to? Per 100,000 people the US is actually behind Seychelles: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate#Incarceration_rates</p>

<p>The US has 666/100K. Th next is a few islands, turkmenistan, Russia, Rwanda, Panama, etc etc. in fact 25 countries have higher rates than ½ of the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, read the article.  You claimed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But Table 3 doesn&#39;t bear that out.  That stat you&#39;re referencing is for &#39;use of a firearm in commission of an offense&#39;.  That&#39;s simply a charge that gets applied whenever a person is found in possession of a firearm when they are arrested for a crime.  It does not mean they actually fired the weapon.</p>

<p>So the next best place to live if I want to live a free life are, and I quote &quot;a few islands, turkmenistan, Russia, Rwanda, Panama&quot;.  That about sums America up for me, all right.</p>
