<p>Look at his top 2 categories for donations.</p>

<p>Does George pay Mike Tartar cash in his pocket to protest? I wouldn&#39;t say so. But even on Snoopes there&#39;s picture of people offering others 50$ for travel expenses and food to protest. </p>

<p>How gets paid to protest?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your reply. The Open Society Foundation seems like a open, transparent organizations that supports important issues like democracy and the rule of law.

    <div class="md"><p>Wasn&#39;t saying he was! I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a possibility that a &quot;Jewish Mafia&quot; funds certain things that would push there Agenda, as does Soros.</p>

<p>Soros made money of the failing pound in the 90&#39;s... I wonder why.</p>

<p>Did you see the Top 2 categories I linked? It shows he clearly pushes an agenda.</p>

<p>My connection? If Soros funds and pushes an Agenda, why wouldn&#39;t a Jewish Mafia? It that proof? No, but keep your eyes open for what comes next and formulate your own opinion. That&#39;s all. Like anything else, only time will tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did check out the link, and the top 2 categories seem to be &quot;Economic Governance &amp; Advancement&quot; and &quot;Democratic Practice&quot;... I mean, those are pretty universally accepted as good causes to support, how is this proof of any nefarious intent? </p>

<p>To your last point, you are right that this is not proof supporting any theory that a &quot;Jewish mafia&quot; is pushing an agenda to replace Trump with Clinton. Therefore I can not fathom why he was brought up in the first place... The only connection seems to be that he and this &quot;Jewish mafia&quot; share a religious/ethnic affiliation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That not my point. Ok, FB got caught stealing and selling data right? I say, well Snapchat, twitter and Instagram probly do the same! Then you&#39;d say &quot;no, I don&#39;t see the connection other then them both being social media platforms&quot;. You&#39;d be right, but there all free, where does the money come from? So I&#39;d say, since FB does it, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if the others do it.</p>

<p>If American Spies, other countries probly spies. If a company stores money off shores, other similar companies probly d the same. Do you see the pattern?</p>

<p>I mean you don&#39;t have to agree with me, this is a conspiracy sub meant to discuss, we all have our opinions until the future changes it. Only time till tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook and Instagram/Snapchat/twitter etc are all social media platforms, so comparing them like you did in your example would be fair. George Soros is a business man of Jewish decent, while this &quot;Jewish mafia&quot; is, as far as I can tell, a supposed nefarious group(s) that is plotting to overthrow Trump and replace him with Hillary. The FB example you use is in no way applicable to the Soros/Jewish Mafia &quot;link&quot;. The two are such different entities that I see no way in which the actions of Soros would in any way give us clues/insight into the actions of the &quot;Jewish mafia&quot;. </p>

<p>To you last point, what does my post history have to do with this? Are my arguments somehow stronger or weaker based on who I am? Regardless, I&#39;ll mention a few conspiracies that I am interested in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who sunk the USS Maine</li>
<li>Who shot Kennedy</li>
<li>What is the connection between the Kremlin and the current US administration</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Well no, the theory among people who follow these &quot;conspiracies&quot; isn&#39;t that Trump is working with the Kremlin, it&#39;s that he&#39;s being Israels puppet. Have you looked into the USS Liberty? That&#39;s a good one that will somewhat tie back to today. If he was Putins bitch he wouldn&#39;t be adding Warhawks into his cabinet, he&#39;d adding SJW liberal type leaders to make the nation weaker.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m a fan of what Putin did to interfere with America/Isreals plan for Syria. Without Russia near the pipeline the world would be complete different. He stuck a wedge in their plan .</p>

<p>We toppled to many countries and installed our own puppets, I don&#39;t undserstand who Russian cyber attacks are such a threat when we murder world leaders, after taking their bribes! (Gaddafi). Then we take their GOLD!!!!!</p>

<p>What has Russia done to us? Yes protect ourselves from cyber attacks, but fucking fix ourselves as well. Can you not hear the pre-war tone the media is trying to push on us?</p>

<p>Are you serious?! You are a &quot;fan&quot; of the autocrat that propped up a murderous dictator in Syria when Syrians rose up to fight for freedom and democracy? Assad uses chemical weapons against his own civilian population, he is a genocidal murderer that needs to be removed from power. You ask &quot;What has Russia done to us?&quot; - well, let&#39;s see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attacked the democratic process in the 2016 US election</li>
<li>Invaded a sovreign nation and annexed its territory (Ukraine)</li>
<li>Assassinated people on UK soil with chemical weapons</li>

<p>still no proof, and have you ever heard of the White Helmets? Bad news when there around, and they were there right after.</p>

<p>Do you want America/Israel to be the forefront for the NWO? It looks like WW3 is being pushed pretty hard right now, maybe this will be the finally for a one world gov. What is that too far fetched as well? Have you not heard Bush Senior say the word New World Order before?</p>

<p>You listed 3 things about Russia that are no where near being the worst things Russia has done. List me out what you think America is doing buddy, your list is gonna be pretty fucking long. Let me ask you, are you a fan on banks being installed in every country? How many countries remaining without?</p>

<p>Three... Why the fuck is one entity running the world? But it seems like you just browse the msm headlines and then formulate an opinion, without trying to see the big picture. I don&#39;t think I know everything, I know enough to know I don&#39;t know shit when it comes to things behind the scenes, but I&#39;m not gonna swallow every piece of information they through at me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not your buddy, pal</p>

<p>Did you read the article you linked? Mattis is talking about the latest reports, not about the use of chemical weapons in Syria in general:</p>

<p>&quot;In his remarks Friday, Mattis alluded to the April attack, saying, “So they’d be ill-advised to go back to violating” the international prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.&quot;</p>

<p>That Assad has used and continues to use chemical weapons against his enemies and the civilian population is well documented and widely acknowledged. </p>

<p>The US is of course involved in some shady business, but I would pick a world lead and &quot;ruled&quot; by the US over one run by Russia any day of the week.</p>

<p>The US and its allies must take a firm stance against the barbaric actions of Russia, that doesn&#39;t mean this is &quot;ramping up to WW3&quot;. If you think this will lead to a world war I&#39;ve got a bridge to sell you...</p>

<p>Finally, to your question about banks: I am indeed a fan of banks being &quot;installed&quot;in every country. A well regulated banking system is a vital part of any modern economy.</p>

<p>&quot;Mattis says it is clear that Assad’s government has weaponized and used chlorine gas in the Syrian civil war.&quot;</p>

<p>You are cherry picking lines from an article where Mattis is doubting the latest use of such weapons, and using it as proof that Assad has never used WMDs against his own people. Mattis clearly states that Assad has used those kinds of weapons in the war. </p>

<p>And a president accepted millions in bribes from another country, would that mean there friends? No, see France and Libya. They had him killed after taking 50m.</p>

<p>We back rebels in the M.E as well as long as they help push our agenda. </p>

<p>Anyways was nice talking to ya, still can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t mind every country being slaves to central banks.</p>

The weird appointments like Bolton would make more sense if it was the other half of a secret plea deal.
