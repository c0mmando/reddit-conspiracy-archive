From my understanding Jeremy Corbyn defended the artist who painted <a href="http://www.israellycool.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/antisemitic-art.jpg">this mural</a>, which depicts a group of Jewish/Zionist bankers playing monopoly on the backs of slaves. And also there have been <a href="http://news.images.itv.com/image/file/1497226/img.jpg">protests</a> over antisemitism within the Labour party yesterday.<br/>
I don&#39;t know much more, but what do you guys think? Is it antisemitic to point out that the wealthiest bankers in the world happen to be Jewish? Are the protests legitimate? Or are they organised by some entity who has a vested interest to discredit or remove Jeremy Corbyn, in a Soros-esque organised protest?<br/>
I dunno! I&#39;d like to see this discussed a bit. It just seems a bit inorganic to me.<br/>
Edit: grammar </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to convey the scope of the media manipulation against Corbyn here in the UK. The papers that are backed by the Murdoch empire have almost exclusively had anti Corbyn headlines for the past 2 years. I am not exaggerating.</p>

<p>Just take today for example (27/03/18). Most small newspaper have the 100 russian diplomats being expelled on the front page but the biggest selling papers owned by Murdoch have this bullshit story about mural that is barely even a story. Things have really ramped up since they lost their parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>If you look at some of the things the Tories get away with its shocking compared to these small little digs at Labour. Here is a small list of things that would bury Labour if the tables were turned.</p>

<p>Boris referred to black people as having &#39;watermelon smiles&#39; and called then &#39;Picanninies. Imagine if Labour had done this. . .</p>

<p>Michael Gove has twice asked the inquiry into child abuse (iicsa) about the details of a priest he is friends with fishing for information they have on him. Both times the inquiry have ordered him to back off and they reported him both times for intefereing with the investigation. Imagine if Labour had done this. . .</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even know where to start with Jacob-Rees Mogg. Anti abortion even in cases of rape (even children) and incest but bizzarely wants to bring back hanging. If you are opposed to abortion because you think it&#39;s a sin and only God can give and take life, how can you then want to sentence people to hang? It said it was to spare prison over-population. . . Imagine if this was a labour policy.</p>

<p>I could carry on but fear it would fall on deaf ears. If anyone is willing to discuss the current UK political landscape I could go on all day. But it&#39;s like pissing into the wind because people just see the relentless headlines and assume it&#39;s all true. </p>

<p>I will be astounded if your post gets above 10 or so upvotes. Will probs stay at zero which it is at now. Remember the Tories have the drop when it comes to online spin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate our current Tory front bench. Never before have we had such a rich and blatantly criminal cabinet. </p>

<p>The husband of one of our &quot;drug czars&quot; that pushes anti-legalisation owns the largest weed farm in the UK and as such the Uk is one of the worlds largest exporters of legal marijuana.</p>

<p>If there is anyone else that doesn&#39;t see the BLATANT push to privatise our NHS they are either blind or don&#39;t care. Selling off NHS land to private firms, renting all medical equipment and increasing private contracts all while watching the NHS become not fit for purpose and so farming yet more contracts out to private firms. The NHS has been getting worse and worse and the man that has headed it for years and years instead of being pulled up for his failure he gets more responsibility. The only conclusion I can make from that is he is doing exactly what he is supposed to do. </p>

<p>Even our PM&#39;s hubby&#39; firm is a financial giant that specialises in hiding money for rich corporations. </p>

<p>And as for the press... Calling Corbyn a terrorist while giving a billion pounds to a corrupt party that still has ties to paramilitary groups ( I do understand that this stands for DUP and Shinn Fein)</p>

<p>This is just the tip of the whole disgusting iceberg.</p>

<p>EDIT: I understand Rhys Mogg is a total corrupt fuckwit but just because his personal views include a really strong anti-abortion slant it&#39;s not like suddenly we are gonna start debating changing the law. Abortion really isn&#39;t a political football here in England and there will be no serious movement to make it illegal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the article i read yesterday in The Sun (Murdoch tabloid rag known for bare faced lies) this started when an Israeli pressure group had a press release where they stated that the whole of the labour party in the UK are antisemitic. </p>

<p>On the subject, can we stop using that word? Antisemitism. It&#39;s not racism, because however much some might want it, the Jewish religion is not a race. It is a dogma, a religious belief system, and it should be subject to open debate as any belief structure would, without the knee jerk reaction of &#39;anti-semite!&#39;. However, we know why it&#39;s done. People back down when called anti-semites, especially politicians. The word has too much power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-semitism is used as a catch-all by extreme Zionists in order to pull not only the Jewish people but all semite people into their fight. This is nothing to do with normal jewish people. Rather, it has EVERYTHING to do with certain people who disregard the talmud, use scripture for their own gain, in order to initiate the second coming of Christ and egotistically hold power over all other people.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/87bd9v/british_jews_protest_against_labours_corbyn_over/">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/87bd9v/british_jews_protest_against_labours_corbyn_over/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been asking basic questions over in worldnews,</p>

<p>&quot;
Got any source from their scripture that states they are allowed to go to war if someone harasses them?</p>

<p>Seems a bit extreme.</p>

<p>This is what I am finding:</p>

<p>Rabbi Jesse the Galilean states: &quot;How meritorious is peace? Even in time of war Jewish law requires that one initiate discussions of peace.&quot; - Leviticus Rabba, Tzav 9</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/war1.html">http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/war1.html</a></p>

<p>and from: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_warfare#cite_note-Broyde-5">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_warfare#cite_note-Broyde-5</a>
Normative Judaism is not pacifist, though violence is only permissible in the service of self-defense. While the biblical narrative about the conquest of Canaan and the commands related to it have had a deep influence on Western culture,[1] mainstream Jewish traditions throughout history have treated these texts as purely historical or highly conditioned, and in either case not relevant to contemporary life.[2] However, some minor strains of radical Zionism promote aggressive war and justify them with biblical texts.[3][4]</p>

<p>It becoming more apparent that these &quot;minor zionist movements&quot; are not that minor, and these people with false egotistical and greedy ideals are pushing their views into mainstream Judaism, calling &quot;harassment&quot;, however minor, anti-semitic and a right to war, twisting biblical scripture to fit their motives.</p>

<p>It feels like the Jewish community needs to step up and call out these people who are not promoting true Judaism. Those who do not respect the Talmud, those who have read scriptures about the &quot;second coming&quot; and are trying to forcefully push the motive of control and power.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure most of the non-religious population would back their cause if they understood this divide, Jewish people seem like a very reserved and peaceful group, more akin to a lifestyle rather than a pure religion, much like Buddhism.</p>

<p>Also, a bit of Etymology here, but Semitism means: &quot;Jewish influence in a society.&quot;,</p>

<p>which stems from: Semite (n.) 1847, &quot;a Jew, Arab, Assyrian, or Aramaean&quot; (an apparently isolated use from 1797 refers to the Semitic language group), back-formation from Semitic or else from French Sémite (1845), from Modern Latin Semita, from Late Latin Sem &quot;Shem,&quot; one of the three sons of Noah (Genesis x.21-30), regarded as the ancestor of the Semites (in old Bible-based anthropology), from Hebrew Shem. In modern sense said to have been first used by German historian August Schlözer in 1781.</p>

<p>So, if we say &quot;anti-semitic&quot;, we really need to define who or what the subject is being &quot;anti&quot; against. As we should not use it as a catch-all.</p>

<p>Especially when there are 12 tribes of Judah, and multiple spin-off movements such as extreme Zionism.</p>

<p>Wikipedia confirms this:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism</a> The root word Semite gives the false impression that antisemitism is directed against all Semitic people, e.g., including Arabs and Assyrians. The compound word antisemite was popularized in Germany in 1879[6] as a scientific-sounding term for Judenhass (&quot;Jew-hatred&quot;),[7][8][9][10][11] and that has been its common use since then.[12][13]</p>

<p>So, it looks like this is not &quot;anti-semitic&quot;, used as a catch-all by the people who these actions are offending, but rather &quot;anti-extreme zionist&quot;, those who are pushing skewed Jewish scripture to define their motives of creating &quot;the greater state of Israel&quot; and war. Which in turn, by calling it anti-semitic, drags ALL Semite people into the issue.</p>

<p>?
&quot;</p>

<p>Jerey Corbyn is just the latest face to be attacked. Can&#39;t have anyone stand up and realise that these zionists are not jewish, and hold no religious background. It&#39;s just power, greed and desire.</p>

<p>Plus the fact, that an Israeli senior politcal officer got caught plotting to &quot;take down&quot; corbyn also makes a good case for it:

    <div class="md"><p>The latest episode in the Labour antisemitism saga has really wound me up. For context, I am the son of a Hungarian Jew born in 1944. My grandfather was sent to Mauthausen shortly after his birth.</p>

<p>Firstly, the mural. The artist himself admits that two of the bankers are Jewish. They are Rothschild and Warburg. The other four are other famous bankers, including JP Morgan (depicted with a big nose) and Rockefeller. So it&#39;s a group of white men who are united by wealth and power, not religion.</p>

<p>The symbolism in the mural is that of the illuminati and Freemasons. It isn&#39;t overtly Jewish, although some wacky people have linked Freemasons to a Jewish conspiracy called the Elders of Zion in the past. This is very much a minority view in the minority that believe in a global conspiracy of this kind.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, we have a mural linking famous wealthy people - Jews and non-Jews - to a global conspiracy. Somehow this has been construed as &quot;clearly antisemitic&quot; with people identifying most or all of the people at the table as Jews. I think this says more about the cognitive bias of the people viewing the mural. I didn&#39;t see what the fuss was all about until I read some comments about it.</p>

<p>Now, we are supposed to believe that a message of support from Corbyn&#39;s facebook account to the artist 6 years ago somehow endorses blatant antisemitism, and that this is of great importance right now. It&#39;s conceivable that Corbyn didn&#39;t even see the picture, as most MPs&#39; social media is run by advisers. As for the picture being blatantly antisemitic, I&#39;d disagree. The mean banker goblin things in Harry Potter look far more stereotypical of antisemitic propaganda.</p>

<p>The story first surfaced 3 years ago, around the time Corbyn was getting elected leader for the first time. It then resurfaces when one of his own MPs - Luciana Berger - apparently sees it on Twitter and sends him a message. She then goes public with the story at 3pm having waited since &quot;this morning&quot;. Why the urgency for a response about a six year old comment? Could it be timed to coincide with Owen Smith&#39;s sacking?</p>

<p>Luciana Berger is a former director and current member of Labour Friends of Israel. LFI is an organisation whose purpose was to &quot; promote the interests of Israel&quot; until it was rebranded (but not fundamentally changed in 2003). It has close ties with the Israeli government. The majority of Labour MPs at the protest and in the media speaking about antisemitism are LFI members (Berger, Streeting, Umunna etc.). They are also opposed to the direction in which Corbyn is taking the party.</p>

<p>The two organisations (BoD and JLC) that sent the letter to Corbyn and called the protest also have close ties with Israel. JLC is a charity and as such does not have to reveal its donors. The leadership of both organisations are very sympathetic to the Israeli regime.</p>

<p>I could go on about media coverage for hours, but I won&#39;t. Needless to say, all the main media outlets have run with the narrative as framed by LFI, BoD and JLC. This is just a continuation of the reporting of antisemitism in Labour that mysteriously started the moment Corbyn became leader (despite many of the incidents, including this one, happening while Miliband was leader).</p>

<p>The most disturbing thing about this story is the repurposing of language and the chilling effect of antisemitism on debate. Any shorthand, such as saying &quot;Israel&quot; instead of &quot;the government of Israel&quot; when critical is now antisemitic. To question whether something is actually antisemitic is antisemitic, if someone else has deemed the thing antisemitic. It&#39;s bananas, and obviously plays to the interests of &quot;the government of Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>Now BoD and JLC are making demands about expulsions from the Labour party. Both organisations are part of the Israel lobby. Let that sink in. The government of another state indirectly demanding changes to the democratically elected opposition in this country.</p>

<p>Would we stand for a Labour Friends of Russia? A Conservative Friends of Iran? A Lib Dem Friends of North Korea? OK, that last one&#39;s a bit extreme, but you get the idea. We are dealing with an apartheid state that is guilty of multiple human rights abuses, after all. Why the hell should any other state be allowed to lobby parliament? It&#39;s an affront to democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate our current Tory front bench. Never before have we had such a rich and blatantly criminal cabinet. </p>

<p>The husband of one of our &quot;drug czars&quot; that pushes anti-legalisation owns the largest weed farm in the UK and as such the Uk is one of the worlds largest exporters of legal marijuana.</p>

<p>If there is anyone else that doesn&#39;t see the BLATANT push to privatise our NHS they are either blind or don&#39;t care. Selling off NHS land to private firms, renting all medical equipment and increasing private contracts all while watching the NHS become not fit for purpose and so farming yet more contracts out to private firms. The NHS has been getting worse and worse and the man that has headed it for years and years instead of being pulled up for his failure he gets more responsibility. The only conclusion I can make from that is he is doing exactly what he is supposed to do. </p>

<p>Even our PM&#39;s hubby&#39; firm is a financial giant that specialises in hiding money for rich corporations. </p>

<p>And as for the press... Calling Corbyn a terrorist while giving a billion pounds to a corrupt party that still has ties to paramilitary groups ( I do understand that this stands for DUP and Shinn Fein)</p>

<p>This is just the tip of the whole disgusting iceberg.</p>

<p>EDIT: I understand Rhys Mogg is a total corrupt fuckwit but just because his personal views include a really strong anti-abortion slant it&#39;s not like suddenly we are gonna start debating changing the law. Abortion really isn&#39;t a political football here in England and there will be no serious movement to make it illegal. </p>
