    <div class="md"><p>I think most Americans are still &quot;asleep&quot; when it comes to 9/11, but that&#39;s also one of the necessary starting points to waking up to Reality. And the Building 7 video should at least shake them monetarily...some people immediately shut it down memetically, but it&#39;s a fantastic place to start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use to post articles on my FB all the time regarding 911 and building 7. One of the best responsives I got from a friend was &quot;popular science did a article on 911 debunking the ridiculous claims and how it was obvious it was that the elevated shafts obviously caught on fire and burned down the buildings and how the public from the naked eye couldn&#39;t see how bad the heat from the twin wtc were on wtc 7. That is why wtc 7 collapsed.&quot; I was speechless. I actually didnt respond. At that point...I knew it would. be pointless</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes- some people will never see. They&#39;ll always buy the lie, no matter how fragile, because it allows them to keep their own worldview intact. But other people will be woken up. Even my dad had to stop and think really long and hard when I showed him Building 7...and he was a 2x Bush voter. Fast forward 18 months and now he&#39;s talking about Sandy Hook and I&#39;m absolutely stunned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is hard for people to see. I have a friend who is the first generation of his family to never have fought in a war. His whole family tree even goes back as far as fighting in the revolutionary war and every major war after that. He will NEVER address 911. He doesn&#39;t want to think his country did what they did. I never was even in the military and I still have a hard time accepting who is pulling the strings and why did they do what they did? I imagine for military people it is even harder.</p>

<p>One wants Iran war, the other doesn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They both want global domination.</p>

<p>One wants unipolarism, the other wants to work together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>both like to spend the fuck out of money</p>

<p>One has a <em>policy</em> of creating deficits, the other has reduced them.</p>

<p>Actual human people care and it makes a difference to them.</p>

<p>So, now we can see even more differences.</p>

<p>The big picture is that these differences matter to millions of people whose lives matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong question. Differences matter to those affected by differences, not by those who you believe are not affected. For example:</p>

<p>If Donald Trump finishes breaking the Iran peace deal and it there is a war, then the thousands of Americans and who knows how many Iranians and their families whose homes and lives are destroyed which otherwise would not be would see differences.</p>

<p>Your moralizing ideology is so lacking in humanity that you would have no concern whatsoever for all those people who suffer on some false principle that you would probably clutch onto if your own life is threatened.</p>

<p>And while you continue to rubber stamp the greater evil as the same, real people suffer and things get worse and worse. This is how it has been since Ronald Reagan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems fun. Let me try it.</p>

<p>On one side, you have the people who are claiming for their constitutional rights to be taken like freedom of speech, expression, association, though, creative freedom, innocent until proven guilty, etc. People who are taken your money to give it to people that hate you, promoting cultures that hate you, burning your flag, disrespecting the anthem, police and military. Also people calling you Nazi, fascist, white supremacist, rapist, abuser, white nationalist, kkk, anti semite, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, sexist, misogynist, ableist, etc. People beaten you up on the street with masks just for disagreeing, blacklisting you, calling for your firing, silencing your opinion, shutting your platforms. People harassing your wife, kids and family because you have different views. People infiltrating academia, media, Hollywood, video games, comics, books, Silicon valley, etc. Just to push an agenda, create a narrative and hide the truth. People who are collecting your data to use it against you. People pushing for wars just because they like their president and Secretary of State. People protecting corporations over their own citizens because your constitutional rights dont apply to them. People willing to sacrifice friends and family for political views. People who prefer to help foreigners who hate you with passion rather than their own brothers and sisters. People who prefer to respect other religions rather than respect yours. People who think you are a red neck because you live in a rural area. People who thinks you are trash because you were born with certain characteristics that makes you a privileged person. People who think your culture is garbage but must protect every other culture around the world. People that hates you for owning a gun or being a Christian. People who won&#39;t even want to protect democracy with voter ID laws like every other country in the world and hates you for that too. People who have no problem in saying you should be dead. People who are protecting pedophiles and rapist over their own children. People who are putting you in jail because of a comment on Twitter or a Video on YouTube. </p>

<p>On the other side. People who are claiming for their constitutional rights. People protecting their own citizens. People proud of their culture, anthem, flag and country. People who don&#39;t see colors or sex, just who is the best. People who don&#39;t see politics in order to keep friends and family. People claiming for open debates, the market of ideas and platforms for discussion of every topic to every speaker. People defending their children against abusers. People asking for evidence before accusing someone of a crime. People who won&#39;t go against your job just for opposing views. People who wants to be safe again in their own communities and country. People who wants to spend their own money whatever the hell they want. People who wants to be free again to say whatever the hell they want without fear to be committing a crime for offending someone. People who wants to make the internet great again.</p>

<p>But they are both exactly and totally the same :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our government was stolen via a stolen election.  The most important tool was the voter suppression.  The same tiny group was controlling both parties leading up to and conducting the election drama, needed for the cover story.  Hillary just wasn&#39;t that popular, the Democratic just didn&#39;t get out the vote.  </p>

<p>It is impossible to vote when your name has been removed from the registration lists. </p>

<p>And the other tool, is ballot disqualification, in those states that had a narrow margin.</p>

<p>The Olympic had sustained damage from a few accidents, but the insurance policies would not cover damages - only in the event of a complete sinking would they cover losses.</p>

<p>So they had both ships next to each other, and overnight they swapped names on the two ships. So, now the gimp Olympic had the letters &quot;Titanic&quot; painted on it.</p>

<p>Then, they went full speed into fog, icebergs and shit and sank the bitch for cash and prizes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aliens</p>

<p>I have seen a low flying black cube UFO.</p>

<p>This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/</a> I think they are the Archons... P.S. The &quot;Texas Black Cube&quot; pics you see all over the internet are a proven hoax. It always bugs me that it gained so much traction.  I am keeping an online log of research on r/BLACKCUBEUFO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s just a collection of supporting material, not in any particular order. The stickied video at the top, the interview with Dmitri Khalazov, is your best bet.</p>

<p>Regarding radiation, that&#39;s what&#39;s giving all the 9/11 first responders cancer. But it was confined to a small area because it was a subterranean detonation -- not atmospheric, the big mushroom clouds you&#39;re used to seeing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facts are not partisan. After Democrats exposed the corruption of the media, Republicans reinstated that corruption and expanded it by handing the media off to giant conglomerates who also own banks, oil companies, and other industries.</p>

<p>It is also not partisan to say that media regulations were created entirely by Democrats, and existed untouched until Republican Ronald Reagan introduced his &quot;get government out of the way&quot; deregulation.</p>

<p>Since everyone knows about the 1996 Telecommunications Act and that Bill Clinton signed it, and since most people around here blame Bill Clinton for media deregulation as a result, what I am actually doing is DEPARTISANIZING the popular partisan view. Republicans played the biggest role in consolidating the media.</p>

<p>I thought about the &quot;Deep fakes&quot; and the tech they have to fake &quot;live&quot; video. The fact that &quot;he&quot; stood there for a minute, holding a gun, and she didn&#39;t react is the red flag. Can you imagine a man with a gun, standing at your 3 o&#39;clock, and you not noticing? You would have to forcefully deny the desire to look at the person holding a black object in their hand next to you. It&#39;s evolution to be aware of our periphery, especially when someone is actually there and that someone is holding a gun. It&#39;s just not right. </p>

<p>One of my new favorite author that I have discovered is Linda Goodman. Her books are amazing.
You should start with &quot;Star signs&quot;. :)</p>

<p>she talks about immortality, astrology, numerology, FBI / Cia and how her daughter was kidnapped.</p>

<p>She is an astrologer with the first best selling astrology book in the new York best seller.
She also talks about conspiracies, immortality, time travelling and LOTS of other very interesting and life changing things.</p>

<p>Her books have opened my eyes on so many level..</p>

<p>She spent all her millions in the 90s trying to find her daughter and fighting against the government.</p>

<p>Then she suddenly disappeared. ....&quot;died&quot;.
maybe she is alive, who knows what really happened. I don&#39;t want to say everything, you really have to read her books! Especially Star sign... :)</p>

<p>Sorry for my poor English lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something is fucky with the moon.</p>

<p>You&#39;re telling me it rotates with the EXACT same period as one revolution around the Earth? Why do no other celestial bodies exhibit the same behavior?</p>

<p>We went there 50 years ago with a computer less powerful than a cell phone, but we &quot;lost&quot; the technology we&#39;d need to go back? Pretty sure I can run a fairly close sim on Kerbal Space Program in 5 mins. SpaceX can land rockets remotely on Earth in a higher gravity environment. Exactly what technology are we missing?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the story is, but something just isn&#39;t quite right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey JamMaster,</p>

<p>I’m a lurker on this sub, have been for some time, but i just wanted to give you some info on the first part of your response: the moon and earth are what is known as tidally locked. This occurs as a natural result of energy and momentum conservation, where after some time the exchange of angular momentum of two orbiting bodies goes to 0, causing the smaller mass bodies rotation to go into resonance with its revolution. </p>

<p>This is actually a rather common thing to happen among celestial bodies; Mercury is tidally locked to the sun. Both of mars moons are tidally locked to mars. Pluton and Charon are tidally locked. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all have more then two tidally locked moons. Here’s a link if you are interested to read more <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidal lock wiki</a></p>

<p>in regards to “losing” the technology, we used the saturn five rocket to get to the moon in the 60s and 70s and then the space shuttle program took off. (keep in mind the space shuttle is not equiped for a lunar journey) after the space shuttle program, the infastructure put in place to build the highly specialized parts of the saturn 5 rockets slowly went away. Businesses that built part A and B went out of work, and those who built part C moved intondiffernt types of manufacturing. when people say we “forgot” how to get to the moon, its not that we dont know how, but rather we dont have the infastructure in place to do it at this time. hopefully as space becomes more privatised we can see this trend reverse.</p>

<p>if you have any questions id love to answer them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Informative response. I can see how we &quot;lost&quot; that tech to go back to the moon. I imagine a lot of that equipment was so old and a lot of the people who worked on that tech have passed away. </p>

<p>Probably a combination of that, lack of public interest in the space program and wasted money and huge risks to send ppl there just to jump around and do stuff robots could just do for cheaper with no risk is the reason we haven&#39;t gone back in decades. I&#39;m sure when technology gets better though and escape velocity from earth becomes way more cheaper and practical, will send colonies up there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That argument simply does not make sense.</p>

<p>While it might be true that the equipment used back then has become obsolete and out of service, it is also true that the equipment has been replaced by more advanced technology. Nobody uses floppy disks anymore because the new technology does it better.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need the exact same old technology to go back to the moon. We have better technology now.</p>

<p>And what makes you believe there is no public interest? Look at how the general public is captivated by all things SpaceX.</p>

<p>And money, well... They give money to whatever they want to call a priority. So the question is why do they not see space exploration as a priority?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure the general public would be pissed as hell if the government decided to spend a butt load of money to send people to the moon to jump around again. What purpose does it serve sending ppl on the at this moment? The public would much rather see that money spend somewhere else. (Not saying the government doesn&#39;t waste money left and right on all sorts of things.) Also, you heard about the tech used for the nuclear program? It&#39;s so obsolete I heard they dont know how to properly disarm some of them which are old and a risk, they just deposit them somewhere deep in case they go off. The argument here is that the old tech for these systems are more immune to hacking or sabotage since the tech is so old.</p>

<p>I bet you we can disarm new nukes no problem. I bet you our new nukes are better than our old nukes. Tech has gotten better, so we just use the new tech. The fact that old tech becomes obsolete is not relevant whatsoever.</p>

<p>I made the comparison that the nukes use old tech just like the old tech used for the moon landing missions and since we haven&#39;t been back to the moon since the 70s, a lot of that tech has been forgotten. And with nukes, a lot of the old tech with older nukes are becoming forgotten as well. It&#39;s no conspiracy, it&#39;s boring facts.</p>

There is no new tech for the nuclear systems yet and my argument was that the tech for landing on the moon is old and dated and most likely forgotten too. Of course we have far superior tech now and can build all this better stuff but the stuff we have for these two specific programs is dated and younger generations dont know what dafuq a floppy disk is or computers built in the 70&#39;s.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I guess I see what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be pretty skeptical of the idea that they haven&#39;t developed any new technology around nuclear warheads since they were invented. </p>

<p>And sure, we&#39;d have to start from &#39;scratch&#39;, I guess. But as I already pointed out we have computer systems that easily make the correct needed calculations and the programs are already written to handle that kind of projection, and we have technology that already comes really, really, really, really close to what we would need to land on the moon.</p>

<p>So are we really starting &#39;from scratch&#39;? No. No we aren&#39;t. It would likely be much easier than it was the first time around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being tidally locked is just what we call this phenomenon when the rotation and revolution match. Without turning this into a 20 minute discussion in the mechanics of tidal locking, what actually happens is the earth and moon are close enough that the gravitational pull on the near side of the moon from the earth is greater than the pull on the far side of the moon from earth. This causes the earth to try to slow down the moons rotation (removing angular momentum) until it reaches an equilibrium state, where the rotation and revolution periods equal</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to have to respectfully object to that explanation. From the wiki that you linked:</p>

<p>&quot;In the special case where the orbital eccentricity is nearly zero, tidal locking results in one hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner, an effect known as synchronous rotation.&quot;</p>

<p>This would mean that they are two different, albeit somewhat related, phenomena. Though they don&#39;t seem to always occur together. For example, from the same wiki under the &#39;planets&#39; section:</p>

<p>&quot;It was thought for some time that Mercury was in synchronous rotation with the Sun. This was because whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, the same side faced inward. Radar observations in 1965 demonstrated instead that Mercury has a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun, which results in the same positioning at those observation points. Modeling has demonstrated that Mercury was captured into the 3:2 spin–orbit state very early in its history, within 20 (and more likely even 10) million years after its formation.&quot;</p>

<p>So is this saying that Mercury is tidally locked but not in a synchronous orbit? It sounds that way to me since it is featured in the &#39;tidal lock&#39; wiki. Also, having that orbit established very early in its history would give it plenty of time to stabilize into a synchronous rotation if it were the case that tidal locking causes such an event.</p>

<p>Also from the wiki: </p>

<p>&quot;Proxima Centauri b, the &quot;Earth-like planet&quot; discovered in 2016 that orbits around the star Proxima Centauri is tidally locked, either in synchronized rotation,[17] or otherwise expresses a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance like that of Mercury.&quot;</p>

<p>This quote alone shows that tidal locking does not imply synchronous rotation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that &quot;something is fucky with the moon&quot;, but I can&#39;t explain it at all. No conspiracy theory I&#39;ve heard on the subject ever explains things satisfactorily either. How come we only ever see one side of the moon? How come the moon appears the same size as the sun in the sky, allowing for total solar eclipses? These things are so astronomically unlikely that it would be absurd to suggest that these things are happening if we didn&#39;t see the evidence of it right in front of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flat earth model explains it perfectly. This &quot;universe&quot; was constructed with intent and direction. It&#39;s not the result of accidental mutations over billions of years. In the heliocentric model, we can ask what are the chances that our moon broke off from the earth and ended up in a place where it is both tidally locked as well as the same apparent size as the sun? Then we taken the flat earth explanation and ask a similar question. What are the chances that someone creating this system would place two similarly sized bodies in the sky to be used for timekeeping purposes? The first one is almost 0. The second explanation has a much higher probability of being correct.</p>

<p>People are blind to it because they think it will hurt Trump. Yet their hatred for Trump (much of it justifiable) is being channeled into supporting a far greater evil, one that has the possibility of dragging us to war and limiting our rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck are you on about. Russiagate has more evidence than any conspiracy since MKULTRA. There&#39;s a lot of hard evidence, and a gargantuan amount of circumstantial evidence which last I checked is what most conspiracies are built on. Russia is malicious. You see what the fuck Putin is doing to his country, you saw what happened in Ukraine. Russia misses the USSR, and they recognize that the US is what&#39;s standing in their way of being an empire again. Thats why they made Trump run for president. They didn&#39;t push for him once they saw a divisive candidate - they gave him two options - to die, because he owed so much to Russia oligarchs - or run for president. And then they made sure he won. Russia has been behind Trump since the very beginning. This has been a plan for a very long time. I fully believe Russia has intended to install a president who will allow them to become an empire again for a long, long time. It didn&#39;t have to be Trump, but he ended up being their best option. He owed Russian oligarchs, and he ran for president because if he didn&#39;t they&#39;d fuck up. I think they brainwashed him. It would make sense - if he was always as stupid as he now seems he wouldn&#39;t have been able to maintain his wealth, even at the completely incompetent level he did. Russia&#39;s motivation is very, very clear - they want to take over eastern Europe again. It didn&#39;t have to be Trump. It could have been anyone that they could make their puppet. So that they can return to being the superpower they once were.</p>

They are presenting facts. The &quot;forced to run&quot; part is a logical conclusion. We know that Russia wants to expand and that Trump has been indebted to Russia for a very long time, so it makes sense that they would make him run. Especially considering how much a surprise his candidacy was at the time, it seems more likely than not - not enough for the courts, but definitely enough for a conspiracy theory. </p>

Every other article on yahoo and msnbc news is about how bad Russia is and what a threat they are to us. Idk the agenda of the people behind it but its infuriating. Am I a Trump fan? No...but at the same time I can tell they are using people who don&#39;t like trump and feeding this narrative to them to fuel this bullshit. I dont know who is behind this but it is fcking scary. They can build up enough hate, anger and enough steam in the public to really start some major shit. This should put fear in all of us. Its propaganda at its best and now with youtube and Google coming out and admitting they will now censor articles and delete the ones that don&#39;t fit the mainstream media is terrifying. They are deleting conspiracy videos left and right. Anything that doesn&#39;t fit the governments narrative. Scary shit.  At this rate...3rd party news agencies may be banned in the next couple of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freemasons as an organization are very powerful, and them and their partners have been planning WW3 for a long time, as part of their manufactured Biblical end times that they have planned for us.  Its complicated and I learn more each day, but yeah....Tubal-Cain is the password of the Master Mason and there is important symbolism in that....in fact symbolism is extremely important which is something that the average person needs to wake up to.  These secret societies use symbols in plain sight as an effective means of communicating with each other while us &quot;profane&quot; miss the meaning or significance....for example with PizzaGate a lot of people found out that pedos use spirals/spiral triangles and spiral hearts as one form of signalling to other pedos etc....this happens all the time for different reasons....logos of companies etc show those initiated that they are part of the club, and they all try to do business with each other....stuff like that.  Secret hand grips, and other signs signal their allegiance...and they are this secretive for good reason....if people woke up to what they were truly about there would be massive revolts.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally have 0 doubt that NASA and other government / private space-related organizations are conspiring in order to hide the true nature of the earth / universe. Obviously it&#39;s hard to agree on the details of how our flat plane exists, but there is 0 doubt in my mind that the conventional explanation is false. </p>

<p>1) Jesuits are secret religious people behind much of the modern scientific ideas such as heliocentrism and the big bang theory and are motivated to lie by political power. Also most if not all astronauts are Freemasons.</p>

<p>2) NASA faked the moon landing and continues to upload manipulated footage to their social media accounts. </p>

<p>3) Laws of perspective from a flat plane are consistent with direct observation of the world around us; the sun appears to move downward when it is actually moving away, ships sailing past the vanishing point of vision, etc. </p>

<p>4) No regular person is allowed to travel in Antarctica without pre-approval. </p>

<p>5) Pilots, engineers, land surveyors, and sailors all report that they do not consider the curvature of the earth in their daily professional careers, and doing so would in fact cause them to veer off-course. </p>

<p>6) The ISS cannot reliably exist in space without a machine shop on board to fix constant life-threatening failures. </p>

<p>7) Rockets cannot fly in space because the vacuum of space contains nothing to act in opposition to the burning fuel.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave it at lucky number 7, but there are more valid points to be made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use to post articles on my FB all the time regarding 911 and building 7. One of the best responsives I got from a friend was &quot;popular science did a article on 911 debunking the ridiculous claims and how it was obvious it was that the elevated shafts obviously caught on fire and burned down the buildings and how the public from the naked eye couldn&#39;t see how bad the heat from the twin wtc were on wtc 7. That is why wtc 7 collapsed.&quot; I was speechless. I actually didnt respond. At that point...I knew it would. be pointless</p>

<p>Do these differences between left and right matter to all the victims of our regime change programs and drone strikes from Bush to Obama? Wonder how Iraqis, Syrians, and Libyans feel about it. </p>

<p>Do these differences matter to the CIA, NSA, FBI, Pentagon, and MIC?</p>
