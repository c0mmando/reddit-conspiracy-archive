       I recently went down the rabbit hole and discovered what a creep Dan Schneider is. I grew up watching drake and josh and Zoey 101, never got super into icarly or the other shows like victorious or sam and cat but after hours of researching about this conspiracy I can’t get it off my mind. I’ve seen the videos, twitter threads and theories about him impregnating Amanda and Jamie Lynn, and can’t ignore how his “child stars” either end up making millions or going off the rails and having devastating break downs. What the hell is going on? How was this allowed to continue? I recently watched the “an open secret” doc and saw earlier the story about Cory Feldman getting stabbed with a syringe...can someone shed some light on the bigger picture here or point me in the right direction of how the fuck exactly this has gone on for so long with no one doing anything? I can’t imagine that out of all the adults in these kids lives, all the producers and writers and executives, all the extras and regular actors and actresses, that no concrete evidence has surfaced about this creep but where there’s smoke there’s fire and damn there’s a LOT of smoke. With him getting fired from nick a few days ago, Amanda Bynes finally coming out of hiding and Jamie Lynn Spears daughter almost dying I can’t help but wonder if the storm is just starting to brew.

       Good luck my friend. You will never view the world in the same light again. Once you know truth, it’s sobering but saddening. I physically see dark tints in the world now. Not sure what that’s about but my point is, when your eyes are open, you can never close them again. You can never unsee.

       The molesters were always molested themselves which means you've got an unending cycle because the victims hide it from shame then end up doing the same thing through normalization.

       They are in all walks of life and are attracted to situations where they can get alone time with kids, gain trust.  Don't get hung up on just hollywood or just the church, this is going on throughout our society and it's victims being victimized by victims over and over.

       It’s absolutely depressing. One on hand, you want to pity the abused but on the other hand, the second they make the decision to continue the cycle, all pity goes out the window. It’s so easy to try to make things black and white when it very rarely is. So many people want this guys head, I just want the truth and justice for any and all lives ruined. I definitely don’t think this one guy is the only problem, this is horrific and systematic and has been going on for longer than I care to imagine. Just look at the baby burlesque videos with Shirley temple. It’ll turn your stomach and have you wondering what list you’re on after watching even a few minutes. This is way deeper than DS or Nick.

       Yes, but the upper echelons can do this on a scope and scale the likes which the average Joe can't. They build entire industries on the backs of kids no different than drugs or arms, which means they cast the shadow under which the little guys operate. And moreover,
       <em>
        they can get away with it

       because of connections.

       People should absolutely focus on the top, because otherwise it's just cutting off a head of a hydra. The beast itself has to be slain and that only happens from a top-down approach. There's no other way.

       This theory is super crazy to think about especially seeing that we enjoyed these shows even dating back to the ones he did like Amanda show, Kenan&amp;Kel, All that, these were some of the greatest.  Getting into the more recent ones like iCarly, Victorious, Zoey 101, I’ve come to the realization that he has literally touched everything. By that I mean he has written, produced, had some kind of input into all these shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this came out, all of these shows would be removed across all platforms, just as it happened with Kevin spacey when his secrets came out. The loss of revenue would be unreal for the company, and even more so for the victims themselves. They would be getting $0 dollars at that point, if they were to come out and say anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sad part about this is, these were kids/teenagers who’s parents ultimately allowed this to go on, from Amanda to Jamie Lynn and Jeanette mccurdy.. it’s really sick to think about. And for a minute they were all having weird episodes and acting crazy. I’m sure you know about Amanda’s mental history. And Jamie Lynn has pretty much been on the DL since her pregnancy. McCurdy went on a weird kinda episode,including the racy photos that leaked. There is a lot of info out there on this one.

       Yeah I’ve seen them both. The sickest part to me is the parents role in all of this. I remember reading and hearing about the auditions asking pre teens to wear spaghetti straps and short shorts and to come to auditions barefoot, and the two week “acting bootcamp” I believe was run by dan Schneider and either Brian singer or Brian peck (either way, they’re both known for being child molesters). How anyone would hand over their children to anyone asking this of them is fucking beyond me. It also really bothers me how many creepy videos Ariana grande was in during her nick shows, even ones of her rolling around in bed sucking her own toes and now she’s some huge billionaire pop star, and was coincidentally the only female teen to attend the KCA when dan Schneider got an award. This shit is fucked up.

       Thanks to our lazy (or complicit) media, whenever one of these teenagers understandably starts having problems due to what they have been through, the story immediately gets framed as "child star is a train wreck because they can't handle the fact their fame/fortune is diminishing" and the child actor has no credibility with the greater public if they do try and get the truth out.

       It is a bit maddening and mind blowing that this story is being swept under the rug. In my opinion this is WAY darker than Weinstein. How is no one talking about this??

       They will, but not until he's officially accused of anything. As of right now, Nickelodeon and him "parted ways" and all the creepy shit about him is technically still just "rumors". Once Amanda Bynes testifies against him and presents the large amounts of evidence she supposedly has against him, hopefully the story will be too big for them to ignore. Plus you've allegedly got Rupert Murdoch (arch nemesis of Sumner Redstone) supporting the people trying to out these sick fucks with media firepower.

       Amanda isn't going to be the one to speak against him - her mental breakdown will discredit anything she says. I'm betting it's Jamie Lynn Spears, Miranda Cosgrove, or Victoria Justice that comes out against him first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arianna Grande would be the best person to speak out, but she's making so much money, and her career is hot that I don't think she would jeopardize that. Hopefully I am wrong.

       My money is on Cosgrove. Grande stands for nothing and is enjoying total fame and wealth way too much.

       Also, Schneider has been dethroned, so a lot of bit players will be less intimidated to come out a’la Weinstein. I hope.

       Exactly. Now that he isn't protected by the Viacom lawyers, the actors have a leg to stand on.

      <p>
       I was thinking a bit, and I wonder if Josh Peck/Drake Bell/Keenan/Kel have anything to say about this. We're focusing solely on the women - do you think the boys have any evidence against him?

       I'm not entirely sure about the Jamie Lynn Spears or the Amanda Bynes conspiracies, they may or may not be true, but the people who ran the "An Open Secret" documentary have stated that Schneider was second choice to base it around, after Bryan Singer of course.

       But looking back, it makes so much sense. I actually know some people who were on those shows (and one of their mom’s once told me how bad it was and the whole thing kind of went over my head), so my heart is going out to all of them. It also explains why so many Nick kids have a hard time staying sane, seemingly harder time than Disney kids."

       "In college I knew someone who was an extra on a Nickelodeon show during the mid 2000s, and the son of one of the clients at work played a lead character on another Nick show during the early 2010s (I won’t name him OR the show unless a mutual asks). They’re both guys. There’s a reason all those pics are with the girls. He didn’t treat the male actors the same way he treated the female ones, it was ONLY the girls he acted that way with and they have all called him a creep. I also had a friend in college whose cousin dated one of the lead actresses on the same Nick show the client’s son was on, she never talked about the show or her time on Nickelodeon, she refused to mention it."

       It's reported that he's getting $9 million in reference pay from Nickelodean. I bet he suffers zero consequences from this whole thing. If that's how this plays out, it's essentially a message TO US that the Satanists are firmly in control and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.

       Hard to say if we're in the middle of it or it has yet to start. It'd be worth reading through Revelations with particular attention to the Tribulations, and trying to line them up with current global events and/or foreseen events.

       Yeah, I have to say that this smells like a coverup, that they're going to marginalize the guy and hope society forgets about him before the truth gets out.

       You are absolutely right about a lot of all that's going on as a message to those of us who "know" what's going on that the dark occultists remain fully in charge and despite Truth in plain sight, there's nothing society is going to do to stop them. Not sure they're right, though.

       If you want to jump all the way into this rabbit hole, head first -- a book called
       <a href="https://educate-yourself.org/cn/franklincoverupexcerpt.shtml">
        The Franklin Coverup
       </a>
       (written by Republican John DeCamp) is where almost
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of the hollywood/elite exposure started. Before this book it was mostly rumors and murmurs. But he names names, dates, places, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO there's some very wild speculation in the book -- and much of the testimony comes from obviously damaged people. However there is more than enough here to get an idea of where almost all of the rumors/memes we still see today came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when you've wet your appetite and want some more cold hard facts and a more objective take on it, writer Nick Bryant later wrote
       <a href="http://franklinscandal.com">
        The Franklin Scandal
       </a>
       which is a much deeper and thorough investigation of the claims brought up in
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttT6FrMosBk">
        The Conspiracy of Silence
       </a>
       (which in turn was mostly influenced by John DeCamp's book)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Dan Schneider's role in all of this, he's a small fish. And that's what's really heartbreaking/terrifying.

       i don’t think he’s a small fish. he was gonna get ousted a few years back but lawyered up and got equally disgusting dirt on his “Protector” Summer Redstone, proved how many billions he was worth to the company,  and so they forged a disgusting pact to protect themselves and the company. Paramount / CBS / Viacom will be  in trouble.

       In the movie Back to the Future 2, whatever the western one is, go to the very end of the movie. You'll see everyone standing on a train waving goodbye i think, but the shortest kid, hes maybe like 7,8 years old? idk. Either way this little blonde haired kid does a "come here" motion at the camera, then immediately points to his penis.... this stuff has been going on for forEVER. No one in Hollywood cares because it doesn't affect them directly.

       The simple version is that things do leak, but people are paid. And most parents who push their kids into showbiz are garbage, so the main threat to the scheme isn't even there. Also it's been happening from day 1. What was that story in Shirley Temple's biography where she was meeting with a studio exec in his private office while her mother was in an adjoining office and they were BOTH molested(her mother by another associate) at the same time? I read it ages ago but it was something along those lines. And yet she continued on in her career.

       Being a creepy producer using his platform making Nickelodeon shows to showcase his foot fetish and leaving a trail of fucked up child stars in his path. Check out some of the links posted here, this shit is messed up. Many people think he’s behind Amanda Bynes breakdown and there’s been many stories of him asking pre teen and young teen girls to come to auditions barefoot and paying extras to give them foot rubs.

       That's messed up but don't we have more important things to worry about? Like the private international bankers that control America's and most of the worlds money supply? Or how John Bolton is going to lead the world into a war with Iran? Seriously this other stuff is just nonsense distractions! Get out there and start running for office and voting. We need to take back control of our damn countries people! Get the banks off our backs and break the debt slavery chains the central banks have put on us all!!

       MONEY* This one thing is the sole reason all these sick bastards are able to evade being caught and prosecuted. It’s amazing how when some rich elite finally gets pointed out that you see in the news how they were able to pay off the accuser and everything just gets swept under the rug. Is this how our legal system works? Someone can molest a child and as long as they have the funds to pay this person off to keep their mouth shut, the courts just turn their heads? Or they make some big contributions to political groups or organizations? They were never lying when they said “Lady justice is blind.”

       Yeah I’ve seen them both. The sickest part to me is the parents role in all of this. I remember reading and hearing about the auditions asking pre teens to wear spaghetti straps and short shorts and to come to auditions barefoot, and the two week “acting bootcamp” I believe was run by dan Schneider and either Brian singer or Brian peck (either way, they’re both known for being child molesters). How anyone would hand over their children to anyone asking this of them is fucking beyond me. It also really bothers me how many creepy videos Ariana grande was in during her nick shows, even ones of her rolling around in bed sucking her own toes and now she’s some huge billionaire pop star, and was coincidentally the only female teen to attend the KCA when dan Schneider got an award. This shit is fucked up.
