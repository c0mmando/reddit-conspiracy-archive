       Yes, the manipulation is unbelievably pervasive and sophisticated, but there is still value here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The technology of reddit simply does not enable a remedy as far as I know, but the manipulation seems to have reached a peak in the last few weeks, and I will explain why I don't think it can get any worse. In fact, I have noticed a slight decrease in the obvious behaviors such as blatant derailing of productive conversation (thanks to mods I suspect), and a big increase in super sophisticated manipulation that I think 99% (probably even mods) don't see yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       That implies that the goal of
       <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/">
        the players
       </a>
       is to keep 99% (600,000) around so that they can condition us; whereas, they would indeed like for anyone to leave who is calling out their best moves, or who is a threat to their most sacred plays, such as
       <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/beyond-piercing-illusion-legitimacy-social-contract-psyop-zero-squad/">
        The Illusion Of Legitimacy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The new and more sophisticated manipulation seems to be the peak of what is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, certain posts that would have gotten 70-90% up votes just 3 months ago, and which start out getting 100% up votes for the first few votes, are now being taken to about 50% and zero votes after the first few minutes and are held there for the first few hours until they have been neutralized, and then they are usually allowed to float more freely after that. This requires a 1-to-1 counter vote for each up vote as they come in, which thus looks pretty natural; whereas, if they can do that, then they could just as easily have sent the post to 10% and kept it there, but that would have be too obvious and thus counter productive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is similar or greater value somewhere else please let me know. The only other place where I have found sufficient value is ZeroHedge, and since I started using reddit in December, I have been on reddit (primarily r/conspiracy) a lot more than ZeroHedge.

       If it gets much more worse, then that means their goal is to shut down the sub, but it looks like their goal is to condition as many people as possible instead, so I don't think it can get a lot worse if that is their goal, or else they would destroy the sub.

       I disagree again.  The shills manipulate voting in order to get the "correct" and normally discrediting of the submission to the top, downvoting the "wrong" ones.  This occurs because they know that people generally don't read the articles, but go to check the comments for a synopsis.

       I didn't mean to imply that I can always tell, who could?  Most of the time one can.  I also call out those comments when I have time and that's why so many of my non-"shits and giggles" comments are downvoted into the negatives.

       Because I suspect many do as I do and ignore the large majority of them. A lot of threads are hit so hard they could be transplanted into  rpolitics or tmor and you wouldn't even be able to tell it was a post in conspiracy. When they're that bad I just completely ignore the obvious shill/troll/bot fest, as I suspect many do.

       Btw the memo this past week must have included the whole "stop whining." I see it from so many shill accounts all of the sudden.

       The only thing they're currently accomplishing is to completely swarm threads. If they can't post, their votes will not matter. What? Every thread is entirely negative comments? Cool.

       Agree that it is the wrong move to "jump ship" in the middle of a still winnable battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear to me that r/conspiracy was targeted for neutralization both before and especially after the events of 2016 election and related exposures.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a battle, there can be several valid reasons for holding ground rather than retreating, even if that means greater losses and, basically, a lot of pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mantra is that 9/11 is the lynchpin. When a sizable majority of the citizens of the US feel brave enough to act on what they believe did and did not happen, there will be a change in government - not an overthrow, but a transition, something like what happened when the Russian Federation dismantled the KGB in 1991 and moved its functions to other newly assembled state organizations.

       But what is it? You have to know what it is to reject it. We’ve all had the experience of being sure of something until encountering an idea that, after either thought or increases in knowledge, changes your mind. And it’s important to that process that someone was blinded by a lack of knowledge. So unless you think that doesn’t happen, you should acknowledge that we can’t rule that out as a possible explanation. This kind of stuff happens all the time. You’ve had this experience yourself. You’ve known more about something than someone else and they were wrong because of lack of knowledge. They often think their beliefs are obvious. You may believe you are having it right now, to be fair, and there is something I don’t know that if I did would change my position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I understand you want to turn this into a question simply about whether or not you are right or wrong. I’m suggesting it might be impossible for you or I to know that, because there is knowledge we don’t know. Even you seem to believe this because you think most experts agree with you, but won’t say anything for whatever reason. And the movement definitely agrees with this because of the broad support for Engineers and Architects for Truth. Otherwise who cares if they are experts?

       I do not believe that a response is merited for such misdirection and logical errors, but for others who come this far, the official story is that flying debris from the twin towers 300 feet away caused a few sporadic office fires in a wide 48 story building (known as WTC 7), which flexed one of the columns in WTC 7, which then slipped off of its base and not long after that, all of the connections in the buildings broke completely and symmetrically within a couple of seconds of each other, which supposedly explains why the videos seen by hundreds of millions looks exactly like a controlled demolition, which happened just a few hours after the twin towers collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       More important is that whether you believe there is a 1 in 1000 chance that it was NOT a controlled demolition, or a 1 in one million chance it was NOT a controlled demolition, only a globally dominant cabal could have covered that up for 15 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even now, many (perhaps most) people, including engineers and scientists, don't know that a third tower fell. Fewer still have seen the video, and fewer still know the official story ... because most are avoiding the truth as if their reputations, jobs, status, and personal relationships depended on it.

       As far as the official story, kinda. I'd think you would need to dig into the architecture and engineering to shoot down the progressive collapse theory. Do you know whether or not the support structure was designed to support a lateral load? That seem to be pretty crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious where you get the information that say most experts haven't seen the collapse, don't know the official story, etc? You are saying it like you know its true and not a hypothesis. Is that fair?

       Not in this case. We have the video. Only a minimal level of knowledge and experience is required to know that it was a controlled demolition, and beyond that it is much more important that one be honest, intelligent, independent minded, courageous, unbiased, have an instinct for physics and materials, and not have any conflict of interest. Those are worth much more than any amount of expertise in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       To have the minimal level of experience and knowledge, one should have seen 20+ fires and 20+ controlled demolitions, played/worked with metal just as much as the average man, and be about 25 years old to have enough first hand experience with materials and probabilities, so I would estimate that half of adult men have sufficient capability or are very close to having sufficient capability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it would help to remind you that steel flexes before it bends, and it bends before it breaks, and that for the official
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       to be true, hundreds of steel connections would have to have been completely severed all across the first floor of this wide building within .05 seconds of each other, and then .2 seconds later, all of the steel connections on the second floor would have to have been completely severed within .05 seconds of each other, and then .2 seconds later, all of the steel connections on the third floor would have to have been completely severed within .05 seconds of each other, and this pattern would have to repeat for all 48 floors. All of that can only be a controlled demolition. There is nothing natural about it.

       Look into ClimateGate and you will lean that those with the most expertise in the Climatology field were perpetrating a fraud with the hockey stick chart, and that a couple of ordinary engineers from Canada busted them, but only after years of obstruction from the expert "scientists" to stop these two engineers from getting the algorithms and the data used to produce the hockey stick chart. "Scientists" all knew that the results had not been reproduced or peer reviewed, but they still tried to obstruct anyone from invalidating the hockey stick chart. If there had not been an email leak, we may never have learned just how corrupt that "scientists" really are, and just how competent ordinary people really are. Before the engineers finally overcame the corruption, how many hundreds of times do you think they were told exactly what you are telling me?

       Guys, do you think megalomaniacs ever stop? Obsessives with no emoathy or regret? Power addicts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just play a sim game for a bit and think about what you would be willing to do to maintain power. Now think, what if you didn't have a conscience? And you owe huge debts to gangsters that have blackmail material? OK, maybe you're strong enough not to be part of the machine at a high level. Would anyone, anyone at all be tempted in and then drawn in over their head?

      <p>
       Do spy agencies ever conceal information?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is propaganda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do rich people ever lie, cooperate or commit crimes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even without the mountains of evidence, collusion amongst powerful people makes a hell of a lot more sense then everyone is always nice, never has secrets, or never talks to anyone. You can horse laugh at the concept of a conspiracy theory, but the opposite view that secret crimes don't occur is either completely childish or nonsensical.

       Both the context (not a post directly about 9/11 but I was using that as an "arch-conspiracy" example) and the place (a conspiracy forum) just makes your obviously sincere skepticism... strange. Without doubting your motives it's just hard to explain, unless you're playing the "contrary card".
      </p>
      <p>
       So would you find any other conspiracy theory more believable than 9/11? If not, wouldn't you just be fine with everyone "jumping ship", and shouldn't you just announce "I'm here to pour cold water on a sub I think needs to go away"?

       Expert witnesses are experts in the specific, relevant niche, not just a generic field.
       <em>
        The vast majority of them have bachelors degrees.

       The fact that a list was put up for anyone with a certain degree to weigh in should be about as convincing to you or anyone else as the engineers and architect in my family saying the story doesn't have any red flags to them. If they are persuading by pasting a list anyone with a degree can join, I don't find them credible.

      <p>
       The report I find most convincing is the one conducted by the insurance companies seeking to avoid a payout of hundreds of millions of dollars. If they could have debunked the idea that two planes caused a fire that triggered collapses, they would have. No one had more financial incentive to do that than they did. And yet they didn't. I'm not sure how you explain that. I'd be willing to listen to your explanation though.

       That wasn't freefall either. NIST has the time at 5.4 seconds. Freefall would be 3.9 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more investigations than the initial NIST report, which isn't set in stone. IMO, the most convincing are the various people hired by the insurance company to try and shift blame onto the designers of the building. These people have the most motivation to cast doubt on the official narrative.

       You are incorrect, NIST do claim freefall for 2.25 seconds occurred in WTC7, this isn't up for debate.

       I will quote what they say, which is on page 48

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A more detailed analysis of the descent of the north face found three stages: (1) a slow descent with acceleration less than that of gravity that corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns at the lower floors, (2)
        <strong>
         a freefall descent over approximately eight stories at gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.25 s,
        </strong>
        and (3) a decreasing acceleration as the north face encountered resistance from the structure below - NIST
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So once again, what did your relatives say about freefall in WTC7, if they don't have an answer, then they are not qualified to have an opinion on the matter, as ignorance isn't an argument.

        ), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions. During the public comment period on the draft report, NIST was asked to confirm this time difference and define the reasons for it in greater detail.

       So what that describes is a structure that begins to collapse, but what's underneath isn't falling at freefall yet, so its slower. Then, it falls at freefall matching what is underneath. Then it runs into debris and slows once more. Now that's as it seems to me. I'm not an expert and am open to being wrong.

       The simplistic explanation is that there was no evidence they thought would support the claim, so they went with something that was more closely tailored to the evidence.

       But you outright denied freefall just a few posts ago.

       This conversation is over, you have obviously realized your position was untenable and are now using NIST word play, which doesn't change the fact the

       I denied the whole building being in freefall. This is the first time you've suggested why it matters that some of it was in freefall. You are pulling the freefall times from the NIST website. If they are covering this up, why would they post something that would so easily debunk their position? That doesn't make sense. And I don't think it makes sense to me that only a demolition can cause partial freefall.

       I think I've been completely honest and forthcoming in my approach. I've posted linkes, asked and answered questions.

       The GRU is still basically the KGB. They transitioned from soviet style communism to a brief, corrupt and ineffective democracy, to an autocratic kleptocracy run by oligarchs. They aren’t an example of good governance.

       If so, it's an unannounced empire. The UN comes closest, and it does not act at all imperial. Maybe a crypto-empire?

       But what's the use of empire if nobody knows their under it? We have to use new terminology for whatever this is - I don't think anything quite does, but kleptocracy certainly seems accurate all directions.

       But there are counter-examples. Politicians generally want their full authority and want the allegiance if not the affection of their constituents. In many cases a "revered leader" figure emerges. Gandhi comes to mind, perhaps Castro for the Cubans, or Ho Chi Minh for the Viets. I'm not arguing for cults of personality, just saying the range of options available is considerably broader than "secret hand" or "figurehead".

       Lots of people take new user accounts for various reasons. It's not my style but I would not deny that option to anyone else who wants to cash in their old account.

       You can tell the difference between real and fake ones and if you've seen any of my crop circle posts you'd know this but looks like you haven't so I'd give it a look if I were you.

      <p>
       The most well known hoaxers only managed to fake 200. We have over 10,000 catalogued circles and more, something doesn't add up. Also soil composition and wheat stock layering are other methods used to verify if it's faked or not, pretty easy to tell the difference.

       I don’t believe in UFO’s or non-anthropomorphic crop circles myself, but please please continue to post about them. Seriously. I didn’t start coming here to get my biases reinforced. It’s interesting and fun to see other points of view. It doesn’t mean I have to believe them, but I’ll hear you out. There was a time not that long ago where that’s all this sub was.

       Of course people care. In a conspiracy forum which gets targeted and manipulated by brigades from all across the board, and considering the context of infiltration and subversion, the idea of leaving reddit is in a way the current "elephant in the room". We should probably talk about this, especially as Internet censorship is on the rise from companies like Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and reddit.

       I’m sort of mad at everyone who is just quitting.
Not like, ruining my day mad, but when I come to the sub and see all these people just abandoning this sub they supposedly love so much, it’s just like, fuck you then!
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m a pretty casual user here, but I’ve been on this sub for like 6 years, it’s the reason I made an account.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of just “jumping ship” is the same as admitting defeat. They aren’t leaving and reorganizing somewhere else to fight back, from what they’ve said themselves, they are just
       <em>
        leaving
       </em>
       . And hoping they
       <em>
        find
       </em>
       an alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck that. Stay with us. Create an alternative, fight through the storm, there’s still a lot of genuine users here who are getting fucked by this. If you have to sort by new, oh fucking well, big deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I don’t understand the full ‘magnitude’ of whatever it is, “shilling” (a word in so fucking sick of seeing) or bots, or hidden agendas, whatever it is. Personally it’s nothing that’s affecting me in the real life so much that I need to make a post about me quitting. Just seems stupid to me.
Please change my mind if I’m missing something.

       People going off about quitting are probably a part of the shills trying to demoralize others to get people to quit visiting here. Shills have been hitting /conspiracy hard but their attempts do nothing but get called out and fail flat on their face, even mods are calling them out on their shit. I think all these posts about how "conspiracy is
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       political" now and wants to go back to talking about hollow earths and moon people are just shills getting tired of fighting a massive wall of genuine users or trying to create a sense of disinterest among the readers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean of course conspiracies are going to be political, we're living in a really weird time right now with a lot of crazy shit going on politically so of course we're going to be discussing it and all the conspiracies surrounding it. This sub legitimately feels like one of the last big subs that is transparent and doesn't shadow delete comments or all that other crazy crap that goes on in main subs here.. one of the last few subs I even visit Reddit for anymore

       You're absolutely. See I knew people/bots would bomb my threads so I'm glad this one made it to get the message across. I know about their tactics (the ones that try to destroy the subreddit) because I experienced it in a previous subreddit.

       I agree with you, but the deck is becoming increasingly stacked against the organic users. How do we fight upvote/downvote bots? How do we fight against corrupt admins who shut down subreddits for thought crimes? How do we fight against Eglin and its million/billion dollar budget?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm staying because of the new mods in place, to see if they can restore sanity around here. I support their mission and know they need all the help they can get in the form of legit contributors. I understand if they can't win, though, for all of the aforementioned reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may come a point, though, when I can't in good faith support Reddit as a platform due to their endless fuckery and corruption.

       I just discovered this sub. still relatively new to Reddit. What's going on here? I've always asked my own questions and thought for myself. I've abandoned religion, and changed many of the beliefs engraved in my mind throughout school. What are good users to interact with? From what I can tell, people who want to bring down the sub do it through downvoting all the posts, and spamming useless comments, unrelated to the post. it's just sad to see a new sub I've just learned about already going down before I even got to experience it in it's prime. (or at least a good time)

       It is like most places on the Internet that have a large following. Any productive content/discussion outside the mainstream narrative (or one of the controlled opposition narratives), will be neutralized--depending on how much it threatens the most important mainstream narratives.

       Literally nothing. This is a broad stroke, I know, but the nature of people interested in conspiracies is to be contrarian. I think this leads a lot of users here to believe they are being manipulated by manufactured view points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm yet to see evidence of a full scale attempt to influence this sub, so I'm not on board with that idea. In fact I find it quite irritating when the topic of shills usurps any other.

       I like this place. Reading about conspiracies is fun as shit but I genuinely think users paranoia is ruining this place.

       I think once technology gets more advanced, we'll start seeing new tactics. Think about living in 1999, you couldn't even imagine some of the stuff that's going on now.

       It is irrelevant to the context of this discussion whether there "are things that laymen think are obviously true, but most most experts think are wrong", and it is irrelevant whether I think there are such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said the official explanation is ludicrous given the video, and then you implied again that I don't know the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the official story is irrelevant, because no official story is physically possible that contradicts controlled demolition. The facts leave no room for other explanations.

       People don't have to literally unfriend you on Facebook to shun you for not conforming, but some of them will anyway, and it is misdirection for you to have claimed otherwise.

       It is irrelevant what my degree is in. Why do you keep trying to appeal to authority?

       Do you know why its thought to have nearly crumbled? It wasn't freefall, btw.

       If you mean the whole thing was freefall, that is contradicted by the video. If you mean some materials fell at freefall for some of it, you agree with them. I'm not sure why this matters.

       If it had been purposefully demolished, they wouldn't pay out a dime. They are incentivized to agree with the demolition version. It literally gets them completely off the hook for paying anything at all.

       Why are you being rude here? If you can't be civil, I'm gonna stop responding. We are just talking here. No one is threatening you or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what that describes is a structure that begins to collapse, but what's underneath isn't falling at freefall yet, so its slower. Then, it falls at freefall matching what is underneath. Then it runs into debris and slows once more. Now that's as it seems to me. I'm not an expert and am open to being wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, why does this matter?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        or that making the claim the skyscraper was a controlled demolition would have been thrown out at the first step under a national security clause and thus would have had zero benefit for the insurer whilst the method they took gave them a chance.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't think that's how it works. And if the government did something to try and quash it, it would be a huge flashing light for investigation by the entire world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simplistic explanation is that there was no evidence they thought would support the claim, so they went with something that was more closely tailored to the evidence.
