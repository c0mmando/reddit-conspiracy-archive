<p>There is a huge difference between the right for any schmoozing to be able to buy any assault weapons and having a well regulated militia.  The amendment was to preserve our ability to form armed en masse to protect from an over reaching   future government.  It was not to allow access to convenient deadly force against each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true. It&#39;s too bad they don&#39;t have mandatory gun safety training in the U.S.  Could prevent a lot of deaths from stupid/ignorant/careless people.  When I was in junior high school back in the day, we actually had a hunter/gun safety class and test they gave us, but I don&#39;t think they do that anymore. Now instead of teaching kids about respecting guns and gun safety, they teach them to fear guns and to call for more gun control. Anyway, that&#39;s my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Where violent crime plummeted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Gun violence</em> plummeted, not general violent crime. </p>

<p>Ironically, the US has increased it&#39;s manufacture of guns in the same time period, but gun violence is actually <em>down</em>.</p>

<p>Mass shooting gets lots of attention, for a reason. </p>

<p>I also find it funny that users such as yourself completely ignore any assertion that this might be a <em>false flag</em>. There reason for this is once you understand an event to be a false flag, you realize that gun ban is part of a larger program, one that not only lies to Americans in order to attempt to disarm them, but murders them as well.</p>

Even if they take people’s guns away the bad people who want them will still be able to get them. Hell a couple years ago you could straight up buy any illegal drug off of Reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it were easy to buy drugs online... You wouldn&#39;t have violence on the street over gang turf or against arresting officers.  People who don&#39;t fear they are going to serve hard time have little reason to react to authority with deadly force.  Knowing that the fugitive isn&#39;t going to be in axiety fueled fight or flight will also reduce the cortisol responses of cops.   Decriminalizing drugs is part of the solution no doubt to decreasing that kind of gun violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure but the same argument comes up that gun control had worked in Australia.  Gun violence was on the decline in Australia before the gun ban.  They have no where near our population and they don&#39;t have bears or moose, the outrageous deer over population, etc.   You cannot compare one country to another and pretend it is the same.   Australia and The United States are completely different.  What works for one wouldn&#39;t work for the other.   </p>

-Donald Trump to Hilary Clinton</p>

<p>Pull your head out of your ass. He&#39;s literally bold faced rubbing it in what they&#39;re planning on doing to this country&#39;s gun rights, and millions lick it up like it&#39;s fine wine. They somehow got millions of <em>conservatives</em> to flip on gun control with a tweet and a couple &quot;off the cuff&quot; statements, (the ones that didn&#39;t flip are in complete denial) and that doesn&#39;t seem really fucking suspicious to you? Learn to see the writing on the wall. They&#39;re getting the demographic that owns the most guns on board with or apathetic towords gun control, so when the shit hits the fan there&#39;s no resistance. </p>

<p>You are correct that police are becoming a domestic military. 
 They will become the &quot;standing army&quot; that will serve as the implement of totalitarianism over the next few years.</p>

<p>Given that, why would you want to give up your best fighting chance?  AR-15s are literally the best possible weapon we have, <em>and it isn&#39;t anywhere near good enough!</em>  But at least it is something.  Why would you give it up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government would not hesitate to use drones or missile strikes on American citizens if they declare themselves to be in open rebellion like every 2nd amendment proponent says the guns are for.  Originally, yes, the 2nd amendment was for protection from an oppressive government, however today the military would squish any uprising with ease without losing a man if they let loose with all the modern weapons they have stockpiled.  If people think the government would face an uprising with soldiers in the streets getting non gun fights with citizens they are crazy.  They’d rain hellfire on the strongholds of the “revolutionaries” so fast the rebellion would be over in a week</p>

<p>Handguns require a way more work and being part of a club, and anything semi auto requires more work again.</p>

<p>Then again our Police aren&#39;t armed either. They have guns in their cars but have to file a report if they take them out for any reason. As a result our police have shot like 20 people in 50 years, and only half of those are fatal. All of them are heavily investigated also. As a country we find this unacceptable still and push for greater regulation of police.</p>

<p>True. They are much better than anyone could have known about keeping the economy limping along and getting everything they want with false flags and propaganda; however, it is very unlikely they will get <em>everything</em> they want without a fight, and in fact, I think that they think a fight is necessary to legitimize their power and make it permanent.</p>

<p>Their victory over the so-called right had been so complete, that they have had to breath just enough new life into them through their alt-right psyop, so that they will actually have someone to fight.</p>

<p>It was pretty widely reported that infantry intentionally missed <em>identified enemy combatants</em> during actual foreign conflicts. If many were unwilling to shoot armed brown people in the jungle, I doubt they&#39;d be too eager to shoot their own in the local park.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m happy you said “that they’ve been dishing out to the rest of the world for decades”</p>

<p>Because this is the truth</p>

<p>The rest of the world, with a few people exceptions, is a living hell. Conditions you can not comprehend.  Serious suffering and pain 24/7 for most people.  That is total insanity.   Even public housing ghettos in the USA is extreme torture, and that is like heaven compared to most of the world</p>

<p>I cannot say for sure that when/if the guns in america are taken away, if any horrible event will take place. But..</p>

<p>I can say for sure that things will get worse on the same trajectory that we have currently been on</p>

<p>These current protests with these kids are definitely a bad thing.  Something is really off about them and it is by far the hardest, most organized, most energized, most dedicated push for guns so far </p>

<p>It’s not like Americans are finding common ground on political issues, planning the safest, most efficient way forward, and using the vast amount of weapons in public hands to stage an assault on criminal corrupt institutions ..   </p>

<p>So I’d say.. why do we even need our guns?    </p>

<p>The answer is so that in the future we could possibly use them for the right reasons and in the right way.   </p>

<p>Ugh.   What the hell are we going to do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding me?   I’m definitly not sheltered, but I also havent traveled much.  I’ve only been to New York , New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, canada and Mexico.   I read ALOT though and watch the tons of documentaries and videos made by locals around the world.  Plus living in NYC gives me constant contact with people from all over the earth who talk to me all the time</p>

<p>Not sure where you get your information or how your worldview was formulated, but most of the world is poor.</p>

<p>About 80% of all human beings live on less then $10 a day and about half of all human beings live on less then $2.50 a day.  </p>

<p>This is a living hell.   Most of the world lives is torture like conditions. That is fact.  </p>

<p>Maybe we are talking about different things,  can you explain your comment further?   </p>

<p>Saying I’m sheltered does not erase the fact of massive widespread poverty on earth.  Like I was saying,  even in developed countries like the USA  has a majority of people suffering with a low quality of life and a subpar standard of living.  I mean, I thought this was public knowledge.  Remember our economy being destroyed?  Jobs shipped overseas? De industrialization?  Massive opiate addiction and suicide? Hell on earth,  in the worlds richest nation..  so what do you think is going on in the rest of the world? </p>

<p>Excluding the western nations, which we all know have their own misery and poverty and confusion and general economic/ social issues..<br/>
 Excluding them.. the rest of the world is living mostly in hellscape realities and conditions so bad that they would be unlivable if not for the amazing adaptation qualities of the human body and mind. </p>

<p>How can you say that a person who makes these claims must be sheltered!?  I’d argue the exact opposite.  You must be sheltered if you think it’s mostly ok out there across those big blue bodies of water.</p>

<p>Explain!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an American who spends most of their time living across those big blue bodies of water, let me assure you it&#39;s not what you think. I do not doubt that you&#39;ve done your research, and I will admit that the world is rather shit as of late. However, I believe that the &quot;western&quot; style and standard of living has completely polluted your views. You may not be sheltered, but your privilege is showing. Your opinions seem rather steadfast for someone who&#39;s never left North/Central America.</p>

<p>Let me break it down with some numbers. You said that half of all humans live on less than $2.50 a day. That, in the United States, would buy what? A loaf of white bread and a bottle of water, maybe. Take that $2.50 over the big blue body to Morocco, where the current exchange rate is around $1 = 10 Moroccan dirhams, and it goes a lot farther. One kilo of oranges goes for around 5 dirham, sometimes 3 if you&#39;re in the right part of town. So that&#39;s around 50¢ for 2.2 pounds of oranges. That&#39;s a super specific example and cannot be extended to every corner of the world, but it contributes to my theory that $2.50 can go farther than you&#39;re mentally giving it credit for.</p>

<p>Life for so many people is shit. People die every day due to exposure to harsh conditions from lack of proper housing, from hunger, and from preventable so diseases because soap is a luxury that hasn&#39;t reached every country yet. However, to say that &quot;most of the non-western world is living in hellscape realities&quot;, or that everyone living on less than you is living in &quot;torture like conditions&quot; is flatout ignorant and wrong. I highly suggest traveling to literally anywhere. You will find more similarities than differences, and perhaps you will expand your dangerously narrow-minded view of the world. </p>

<p>Things are bad, there&#39;s no denying that, but being &quot;poor&quot; does not equate to unhappiness or an insufferable quality of life. Often the two do overlap, but it depends greatly upon who&#39;s in question: the one living in poverty or the sheltered observer. What may be unbearable to you may simply be every day life for someone else. That does not make the life insufferable, it merely makes it insufferable to /You/.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t understand how that’s relevant.   Like huh?</p>

<p>Yeah I’ve only been to two other countries and they barely count because they were vacations and I was in tourist areas.   </p>

<p>But your argument, if there is an argument somewhere in your vapid statement.</p>

<p>Let me make this easy for you.</p>

<p>Modern technology has advanced rapidly in recent history, culminating in the advent of the computerized cell phone and a thing called the “internet”. I know you will not believe this, and your mind may be damaged beyond repair by the internal explosion of impossibility being reality,  but this internet apparatus allows the human being using it to be able to receive reliable information, including photo, video, personal accounts, historical facts and everything in between...  even allowing the user to find out how people live in other places, how many people are in each economic class, what conditions are like in each class, and what those in the lower classes do to cope with conditions, how bad these conditions are ... and more!</p>

<p>It allows the user to find out about all of this.. WITHOUT THE HUMAN BEING HAVING TO EVEN PHYSICALLY TRAVEL TO THOSE FARAWAY LANDS..</p>

<p>Amazingly, an avid reader can easily have a much firmer, more comprehensive grasp of conditions on the ground in other nations, cities, towns, inside the minds of individual citizens .. then even a local of these nations, cities, towns could have.   A resident of NYC can easily know less about NYC then someone who researches NYC thoroughly...  </p>

<p>Mind blown?</p>

<p>TLDR— we all can tell how proud you are of traveling.. but no one gives a shit and no one is excited about it as you are.  No one thinks you are cool for it.  And no one thinks That is makes you the final authority on conditions in the third world or whatever places you have been too.  It doesn’t matter where you’ve been, how many places you have been, and if you’ve been to more places then another person.   this has no relevancy to if you have more reliable information on how most people live in the world.  Just shut up lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying, but check this. 4 generations in one house means free child care and elder Care. The grandparents also operate some home business on the first floor. Mom dad and adult children work, so according to your 10 per day, that makes $30. That buys a lot of rice and veggies, and a little meat. They have a house which has been passed down. They can save for the future or expand their home business. A cheap motorbike to commute. And they&#39;re all pretty happy. Not a living hell by any means. I think the western standard of life is somewhat ridiculous. These folks are poor, but they are smart. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>=].  I think the lack of awareness of the conditions of the third world is deliberate and needed by a large percentage of Americans. The wealthy know about it and have largely contributed to it, while simultaneously working to keep the middle class apathetic and lacking empathy for it.</p>

<p>People feel nothing for the suffering of others.  It’s a shame.  </p>

<p>Tbh the people living in those conditions are the best prepared for what’s been percolating in the melting pot for years now.  They are living the life of our nightmares</p>

<p>Our apocalypse, economic collapse event is their everyday life and for that I not only applaud them for their perseverance but I also give them my approval of being first class soldiers in the war of suffering and poverty.  I mean,  American prison would be hell for us but it would be a hotel for most.  </p>

<p>It’s amazing. </p>

<p>American lack of entertaining bad conditions has been shown in our rich militant labor history.    We had some pretty bad conditions, as we still do, but these were the days when men were men, and there wasn’t so much technological distraction... and people organized and became violent in opposition to the top down delivery of a shit life and low pay.   We had the means to make a difference..</p>

<p>To attain an 8 hour day..
To stop child labor..
To receive adequate health and dental benefits..
To a decent life-after-work and to retire at a reasonable age..</p>

<p>And our elders took these means and reached a temporary end..
There was a chance to do something and they did it..</p>

<p>That’s why I hate when people complain about protesters or say they are losers or unemployed..   shit, someone has to do it.  If a chance presents itself and someone steps up, we should support them.  Because if we don’t try, we are guaranteed to get the conditions that our bosses and owners feel we should have.. which are never nearly enough for a decent life. </p>

<p>Much work needs to be done.  </p>

<p>It always starts with &quot;This toll will only be temporary until the bridge/tunnel/road is paid for, it will be gone in 10 years&quot;</p>

<p>Guess what, 60 years later the tolls are still there and the prices have gone up!</p>

<p>This is the way government works. Even if they have the strictest regulations, they wont stop there. They will keep pushing for more and more regulation to take away the last line of defense against.</p>

<p>I can agree with that.</p>

<p>Not going to waste my time responding to the rest of your assumptions but I will just say this for anyone who comes across this post:</p>

<p>We do need regulation, no one wants to live in a lawless shit-hole country, we don&#39;t need over regulation which is where we are in general right now.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want gangs roaming the streets, but I also don&#39;t want some assholes I never met, telling me I can&#39;t buy a TV on Sunday because of some stupid blue laws from 1850. As a society, we should start getting rid of old stupid laws before we even think about enacting new legislation.</p>

<p>There used to be media regulation that came out of the New Deal. It remained fully intact until Ronald Reagan&#39;s deregulation agenda. Consolidation is the biggie, but a whole slew of other regulations were repealed and the harm to society from this has been immense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An armed populace cannot be loaded into boxcars.</p>

<p>Banning guns does not move towards totalitarianism.  Rather, the principle effect is to <em>remove a barrier</em> to totalitarianism.</p>

<p>Now it is possible to subjugate an armed population.  The Russians did it in the Ukraine with the Holodomir.  Whenever they found an angry armed farmer, they&#39;d just surround the house, post a watch, wait till he ran out of food, and throw a grenade in the window.  Bang.  Done.</p>

<p>With that said, firearms remain the only known insurance against totalitarianism that humankind has ever come up with.  Yes, we have democracy and free speech and all of these things, but at the end of the day, a change to totalitarianism suspends all of these.</p>

<p>A widely-armed working class maintains their ability to conduct political violence <em>regardless of how totalitarian their government becomes.</em></p>

<p>So you might even say the root cause of the deaths of human beings in the situations you described may have been human malevolence rather than the killing capacity of an inanimate object. Interesting how you&#39;ve all but outright agreed with me, while at the same time laughing at the fault of your own logic.</p>

I left out the Business Insider and Forbes articles on the same paper, because they cover the scenario of full US military might vs. one town.</p>

<p>The TL;DR of those is that if the full weight of the 2.2ish US military members, with no defectors, with nobody who cared about civilian casualties, decided to nuke and WMD and Agent Orange etc. America into oblivion, then they would obviously win. But taking Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam as examples, the American armed populace would win otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I understand you, you&#39;re saying that if the U.S. military, in its entirety, was bound and determined to kill and take over every person on U.S. soil, they would win. I agreed with you on that. </p>

<p>But the entire point of my second paragraph - and mentioned in many of these sources, which I&#39;m surprised you read before replying in 30 seconds - is that the wholesale slaughter of 320 million people on 3.8 million square miles of land is an unlikely thing to happen, and in the event of an occupation where civilian casualties were something to be avoided, smaller and less armed nations have fought America and won.</p>

<p>I think the concept that occupations are technically unwinnable is a false one. Japan kind of springs to mind there, but I pulled up the Wikipedia list of occupations. If your overarching argument is that since an American militia would lose a full-civilian-casualty battle to the death, then there&#39;s no point in even preparing for a winnable occupation, I disagree with you on that, and I&#39;m really pretty sure that such a thing would not happen, in any case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that, and I get that the full-force full-murderous press of the US military could smoke the world to ashes, and no quantity of militia could stop that. </p>

<p>But again, one of my points is that the U.S. military is highly unlikely to do that, especially to its own citizens, especially without significant defection. And in the much more likely event that the U.S. military doesn&#39;t go full WMD, even smaller and less armed nations have put up incredible resistances. Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam, again, are examples of places where the U.S. military attempted an occupation without nuking the place into the ground, and was rebuffed, though not without casualty, and could not be said to have won. I think the Newsweek article is an example of that.</p>

I can&#39;t boil it down to won and lost - the situation deserves more complex consideration - but objectively speaking, North Vietnam achieved their goals and won, and South Vietnam with U.S. support did not achieve their goals, and lost. (I think it&#39;s important to acknowledge here that &quot;winning&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;getting everything you want, perfectly, with no casualties at all&quot;.)<a href="https://thevietnamwar.info/who-won-the-vietnam-war/">1</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/2016/02/05/another-vietnam-photography/#RcUqJSvUjGq4">2</a> <a href="https://owlcation.com/humanities/Who-Won-the-Vietnam-War">3</a></p>

<p>Al Qaeda: 
Again, more complicated than &quot;won&quot; and &quot;lost&quot;, considering that conflict is ongoing. But as far as achieving goals, and not failing to achieve goals, Al Qaeda came out poorly, but not really the loser. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/08/twenty-years-war/496736/">1</a> <a href="https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/al-qaeda-2017-slow-and-steady-wins-race">2</a> Going off 2 here, AQI/ISI did sort of morph into Isis, though, as a previous satellite, so-</p>

<p>ISIS:
Some people saw the Islamic State&#39;s split into JFS as evidence that they were losing in Syria, and there are absolutely hard casualties in Syria, and ISIS/ISIL? has been weakened. That said, the situation is tenser and more complex than I can put into one sentence, and having undergone casualties doesn&#39;t mean that their goals have been failed, nor that America&#39;s goals have been unmet. This, too, is ongoing, also considering the Philippines, Sinjar and Libya, so we don&#39;t have the benefit of looking back in history and declaring a winner. I would consider ISIL&#39;s short-term goals as seizing militia power, and in that respect, they&#39;re succeeding in many places, but you could argue either way. <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/trump-war-isis-syria-putin-assad-iran-islamic-state-middle-east-muslims-saudi-639244">1</a> <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/international/380099-the-philippines-islamic-states-next-stronghold">2</a> <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/isil-video-niger-attack-highlights-troops-vulnerability-180305194318493.html">3</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/world/middleeast/us-bombs-qaeda-libya.html">4</a> I&#39;ve left out American news sources on this one where ISIS wins the tech/social media war, because I don&#39;t think they&#39;re necessarily relevant here?</p>

<p>There are some limits when it comes to drugs.  So for example, antibiotics are OK, but state licensure boards would object strongly to prescribing pain pills to self or family.

<p>It means whatever &quot;arms&quot; are needed to ensure the security of the &quot;free State.&quot;  Furthermore, these arms are allowed to whatever &quot;We The People&quot; folks are described everywhere else in the Constitution.  So if &quot;We The People&quot; means you or me, guess what, we are explicitly allowed whatever &quot;arms&quot; are necessary to ensure security of a &quot;free State.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>False.  &quot;Well regulated&quot; means &quot;working well.&quot;  Like a &quot;regulator&quot; on a steam engine or other kind of motor.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strawman.  I wasn&#39;t talking about fighting the American military.</p>

<p>But to answer the question, there are two answers.  The first answer is that it&#39;s a fuckload better than nothing.  An AR15 is not a good match for pretty much anything in the military, <em>but it is better than rocks!</em></p>

<p>The second answer is that the US armed forces swear first to defend <strong>the Constitution</strong> and many take that oath very seriously.  A gun confiscation would never be performed with the full support of the US military.  Gun confiscation would use domestic local and Federal police, and AR15s are more than enough to stop that.</p>

<p>How are you gonna defend yourself against any military, terrorist, etc with a handgun? A handgun will for sure defend against a robber in most cases... but I think a lot of Americans are worried about something beyond just a robber.</p>

Not that there&#39;s more than a .001% chance of an emergency like that happening, but it is an American right to be able to have that comfort of knowing you can own that if you wanted to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, what are you talking about? They just passed a new omnibus spending bill that gives an extra 70 billion to the already loaded military machine, and they passed a new law that allows police to get your data from tech companies much more easily.</p>

<p>All of these marches are just business as usual because the International bankers who control America&#39;s government and media know this is a decisive issue among Americans. </p>

<p>I just want to say to anyone out there who is dumb enough to think the government is going to take away guns: They are not.</p>

<p>This issue, like abortion, like immigration, like climate change, like racism , is just another red vs blue argument used to divide people into groups so that nobody holds anyone accountable in government. Americans now view government like a sports game, and support their team even at their own expense.</p>

<p>What they do not want us talking about is how we are in about 7 wars right now. Did you know that? Did you also know that the recently passed omnibus spending bill continues to erroneously support our path toward an impending Student loan crisis. What about the fact that we recently gave permanent tax cuts to the 1%, while getting rid of zero of the loopholes they exploit to siphon away wealth from our nations economy?</p>

<p>We have so many problems that need to be addressed before the shit hits the fan. But as long as our Military rules the world we are content to just kick the can down the road. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OF COURSE IT IS!  Have you seen the rhetoric of our country recently?  Topics change from week to week because of this common place bickering.  One week we are literally warning about nuclear war and the next we are concerned about a prostitutes relationship with the president.</p>

<p>The only argument that hasn&#39;t been dropped by the curb during this school shooting debacle is that congress should talk about gun reform.  Hell, even repealing Dickey Amendment would be enough to calm some people down, but they refuse.  If you want to worry about &quot;the government doing something wrong&quot;, look not at your own fears, but their actions.</p>

We don&#39;t have strict border control between states, therefore it&#39;s easy to drive a few hours, get a gun, and bring it back home.

    <div class="md"><p>That is not what I am saying. You totally have the right to defend yourself. And if Martial Law is ever declared you can bet I am going to have a weapon.</p>

<p>But what I am trying to tell you is that the possibility of that happening is slim. Meanwhile, as I type, all of the things I described in the OP are occurring. We are bombing people today. And kids in college are being given $50,000 loans in order to obtain a piece of paper that may or may not help them in life.</p>

<p>My point still remains. Gun Control is another Red vs Blue issue that  is being used to distract Americans from actual shit that is happening.</p>

<p>MSNBC and CNN cover this 24/7 because it riles up democrats who buy into it. Meanwhile, FOX covers it from the republican side, and riles up republicans who are hardcore 2nd amendment supporters.  </p>

<p>The conspiracy here is that the powers that be, want our politics to be simplified down like this. They want people to only care about one or two issues, as long as those one or two issues aren&#39;t US foreign policy, or economic inequality.</p>

Team building and gun operation were part of the research project until it went underground, Seth Rich made threats to expose it...and we all know the rest. My theory is that they plan on disarming the populous, so the military can feign an attempt to stop the chimpanzee attack, and the government can take away constitutional protections while the nation is “continually under immediate threat”. Lincoln’s suspension of Habeus corpus during the civil war and Japanese internment would serve as the precedent. It’s a scary prospect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve kept my mouth shut on all threads of seen on gun control so maybe this is where I’ll talk lol, honestly I don’t know what any of this is going to do. Gun control, no control, sure- they want to ban AR, fine. But that isn’t going to stop mass shooting and high school shootings? People seem to think one gun is causing the problem. Anyone can shoot up a high school with a handgun, a shotgun, a rifle, Hell even a bow and arrow. </p>

<p>It comes down to the impossible matter of weeding out the sick before something happens. Of course people will go on to say well Australia has no shootings and England has no shootings, that’s fine. Maybe not. But America has one of the greatest populations in the world. It’s going to be a higher probability of this happening, also, we are just different here in America compared to everywhere else. Our music, our media, our schools, our people, our culture, mannerisms. I mean shit- we see it all the time here on Reddit Americans and Australians or whoever else going back and forth about countries and what’s wrong with them and what not. </p>

<p>When it comes down to it nothings going to change. AR where actually banned for a while in the states, shit still happened, shootings STILL happened. Kids in high school getting shot that are from middle class neighborhoods concerned about AR calling for a ban? How about all the poor kids in bad neighborhoods across America who are more prone to getting shot by a handgun or something while on the streets. Take all of the kids who have died on drive by shootings caused by handguns and compare it to the kids who have died in every high school shooting in America... the kids that are dying by handguns in the street will blow it out of the water tenfold. </p>

<p>The whole marches and the call for regulations and the everything is just a mess and confusing as hell right now, the funny thing is I don’t even know if the people marching know what they want. I’ve seen so many different signs people made saying different shit. </p>

<p>That said, you know what bothers me about the whole &quot;March for our lives thing&quot;, is that if people really wanted to save lives they would be marching for health care or education or something that would do a lot more to save lives and the safety of the population.</p>

<p>How many people die from Heart Disease and Cancer and Diabetes every day? It&#39;s got to be in the thousands in the U.S. alone. It sounds heartless but mass shootings are a small drop in the bucket in comparison. </p>

<p>If it was really about &quot;saving our lives&quot; then those are the things that need to be addressed to save the most lives. Why aren&#39;t people marching in the streets for healthcare and education reform? But something tells me it isn&#39;t really about saving lives.</p>

<p>Kids have  higher probability of dying from a bicycle accident than  from a gun.</p>

<p>Saying &quot;they are tired of getting shot in school&quot; is no different than saying &quot;I&#39;m tired of constantly worrying about drunk drivers crashing into me and killing me&quot; - Alcohol kills 90,000, firearms kill 60,000  40,000 of which are suicides. </p>

<p>Nobody is protesting to restrict alcohol.</p>

<p>Over 600,000 from heart disease, nobody is protesting about healthy eating and exercise. </p>

<p>The only people who are impacted by these laws are the good people who are trying to obey them. People who want to get a gun and shoot people are going to find a way. </p>

<p>Heart disease isn&#39;t a means of self-defense either. A gun allows a person of smaller size/weight a increased chance of success in self-defense against an opponent who could easily overpower and do them harm.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a big conversation about how cops are trigger happy and targeting certain segments of the population. It seems strange that people are alright with allowing on segment of the population (in uniform) the opportunity to be the only people with guns. Well, cops and the military under Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should also point out that school attendance is compulsory for people between 7 and 16 in ALL states with many other states having requirements for more years. It isn&#39;t like choosing to drive a motor vehicle or eat a certain diet, people must go to school. Their parents can choose to private or home school however, I would say the majority of American&#39;s do not have the means to do so due to work/survival/other obligations. So, public school is a mandatory thing for the majority. </p>

<p>Bad argument. There are tons of restrictions on alcohol (age restrictions, heavily taxed, media campaigns, etc.) and a lot of attention paid to preventing people from drunk driving. In my town they occasionally have roadblocks to check each and every car to make sure people aren&#39;t driving drunk.</p>

<p>I agree with your point about perspective and statistics, I&#39;m just saying this part of your comment doesn&#39;t support your argument. Based on what you said, you probably don&#39;t want similar restrictions on guns that they have in place for alcohol.</p>

<p>In Canada we have the Terry Fox Run, Run for the Cure, all the Heart events like Jump rope for heart. These are done in schools all over the place. So when you ask for marches, it&#39;s disingenuous because so much is being done at the government level for those issues. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not necessarily more important or less important. Humans focus on issues that immediately are affecting them. If humans were emotionless automatons then maybe your argument would hold, but it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re just trying to deflect from the issues or not. Your questions are obviously &quot;traps&quot; in order to get an &quot;aha! I&#39;ve got you! You don&#39;t think they are as important!&quot; </p>

<p>That said, you know what bothers me about the whole &quot;March for our lives&quot; thing, is that if people really wanted to save lives they would be marching for health care or education or something that would do a lot more to save lives and the safety of the population.</p>

<p>How many people die from Heart Disease and Cancer and Diabetes every day? It&#39;s got to be in the thousands in the U.S. alone. It sounds heartless but mass shootings are a small drop in the bucket in comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s reactionary human behavior. People are more terrified of painful/scary perceived threats than the mundane but statistical more likely deadly ones.  Like you said, millions of  people in this country have a great chance of dying as a result of coronary disease, yet there is no united front/ongoing discussions to prevent it. However, if it came out that 20,000 Americans die from shark attacks last year (less than .01 of the US population), there would be outcry, petitions, discussions may be even marches to fix this scary threat.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with terrorist attacks. Most of us are absolutely terrified of falling victim to a violent terrorist attack and will do whatever it takes to prevent it, never mind you have a better chance of being killed by a drunk driver, malpractice, or a family member.    </p>

<p>Here in the USA, we look at guys like Saddam Hussein and we see a homicidal maniac. But imagine if you lived in Iraq and your son had been blown up by a bomb because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time? You&#39;d vote for the biggest baddest person you could.

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines are the topic that I myself have done the most research on. I know it&#39;s a hot-button topic, and everyone has an opinion. So my favorite thing to share nowadays is this article by Slate. Because mainstream media is so, very very reticent to touch this issue, this investigative report is a rare gem. What seems to have happened is, once Slate got deeper into the rabbit hole, they could no longer ignore what was glaring them in the face. The team behind this article may very well have gone into it trying to prove the safety of Gardasil (that was a rumor I heard, that sounds pretty legit to me). I would encourage you to read this in it&#39;s entirety -- it&#39;s pretty damning. Since you mentioned flawed studies, you will find if you read this article that the problem is, the actual safety research being done on new vaccines is <em>insanely</em> flawed. Intentionally flawed. Set up so that any negative reactions reported by test subjects during safety trials are just flushed away. At the discretion of researchers with an agenda, serious adverse reactions are filtered out. There is nothing unusual here. The pharmaceutical companies have a strangle hold on these studies. Millions are riding on the results, which must fall in their favor. Anyway, I&#39;ve TLDR&#39;d it enough; if you read it, you&#39;ll know more than most about the modern vaccine industry. <a href="https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/12/flaws-in-the-clinical-trials-for-gardasil-made-it-harder-to-properly-assess-safety.html">https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/12/flaws-in-the-clinical-trials-for-gardasil-made-it-harder-to-properly-assess-safety.html</a></p>

<p>Consent Coefficients - numerical feedback indicating victory status. Psychological basis: When the government is able to collect tax and seize private property without just compensation, it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender and is consenting to enslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily quantified indicator of harvest time is the number of public citizens who pay income tax despite an obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the government.</p>

<p>I am thinking forced vaccinations. They will release a super flu and force everyone to take the vaccine which will kill more people than the flu itself. This will be forced on the people at gun point and without the 2nd Amendment resistance will be futile. Those the vaccine does not kill outright will be left functionally retarded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, they don&#39;t need to take guns away to achieve that. All it would take would be to put a media blanket on the vaccine deaths and make vaccination a condition for being employed. Most people would want to maintain their debt maintenance and not lose their house and shiny toys, so they would comply. Those that didn&#39;t would no longer be a problem because they would have no money.</p>

<p>In fact, that would be far far easier to do that screwing with the 2nd Amendment because you wouldn&#39;t even have to step on the constitution to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they even can, legally. The worst gun ban there was was the one Clinton signed in 1992 or whenever it was, and even that one grandfathered in existing weapons and was mostly gotten around by making small cosmetic changes like taking away the pistol grip and putting a hole in the stock of your AK-47.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes me think there is no hope for America, that we&#39;re just pitted against each other to argue these useless points and nobody is capable of critically thinking about what they are saying.</p>

<p>With us it&#39;s either &quot;Muh guns!!!!11!!!11one!!&quot; OR &quot;OMG HIGH-POWERED ASSAULT WEAPONS!!!!11!!!11one!!&quot; and that&#39;s about it. Nobody is even trying to reach a compromise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re failing to consider the power of the “Two Party System” that has evolved here in the US.  There’s no law creating a two party system, there have been and are many other parties, but with only two legitimate choices the people are kept down in their partisan trenches, fed a narrative of black and white, pre selected “wedge” issues, by a media that is run by the same Elites that own the politicians.  This leaves voters spending their political energy defending their positions on things like Abortion, Immigration, Gun Control, etc...these are the issues that also happen to fall right along party lines, and have been consistently used to keep the voters locked into their &quot;superior position” on one or more of those wedge issues.  </p>

<p>Any actual opposition is either jointly and roundly condemned or completely ignored by any major media outlet.  Even a rather tame example of opposition in Bernie Sanders was virtually ignored by the US media, The media acted in lock step with Clinton’s agenda, and helped keep Bernie and his movement bottled up.  </p>

<p>Anyway...TLDR...the two party system and a corporate/state media keep Americans locked in partisan bickering while the rug is slowly pull rout from under them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m always confused about this. If the government was all focused on disarming the public wouldn’t they have done it by now...? People have been begging for it for ages and are now literally marching the streets screaming for it and they’re still like “umm. Maybe.” And we all know they’re not going to fully disarm the public. Even the people who are advocating are looking for a properly vetted system rather than full eradication of guns. I’m from Canada and up here lots of people have guns there’s just a really trustworthy vetting system. And our gun violence rates? Well, MUCH MUCH lower than the states, to put it simply. I fully believe the government is up to some weird shit and all that but I really don’t think the gun thing is the way they’re doing it? I don’t know why it’s so hard to see it’s about regulation. And you’re all the same people that preach to look beyond all the mainstream distractions, yet this mainstream distraction is the only thing people seem to be able to see? So is it really about distractions and the government and secrets and the elite or is it more about trying to find the craziest possible ways to support your own political views? Just my two cents. </p>

Each one is a level below the one above it.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean the second protects the first, the third protects the second and so forth...  not every instance is entirely so clear, but the Bill of Rights is in <em>descending order</em> of the most basic and essential freedoms.  The First Amendment <em>is the most powerful of all, but also the last resort</em>!  The Second Amendment is the <em>second to last resort</em> to defend freedom from tyranny.</p>

<p>It is a false argument to claim, as so often happens, “it’s not like people can overthrow the government.”  One it isn’t entirely about overthrowing the government, it is about fighting to defend oneself and their freedom, <em>that</em> is the intent, as in “<em>Gove me liberty or give me death.”</em>. The idea is to go down fighting rather than surrender.</p>

<p>It is important to not that most of the Bill of Rights deals with due process.  And <em>every one of those has been violated!</em> </p>

<p>The tenth has been violated (sometimes seemingly for good reasons, others not particularly executive orders), the ninth has been, the eight <em>absolutely is regularly violated</em>, the seventh mostly has but it is the most archaic, the sixth <em>is constantly violated</em> in Louisiana there is a lawsuit about it and then there is Guantanamo...  the fifth can be argued to be violated in terms of people imprisoned for refusing passwords, the fourth <em>all the time</em> ask BLM or any number of instances of property being seized just for “suspicion of illegal activity” and lost or not returned, the third still stands <em>so far</em>!</p>

<p>So...  we are down to <strong>three levels of basic freedom</strong> intended by our nation’s founders...  and there are people who *wish to willingly give up the second amendment!?  The only reason the third and first still hold is by the threat of the second!  If the right to bear arms is taken away, the rest of your rights will vanish before your eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>US goverment and economic structure of free market capitalism turned corporatism, is failing. As in one bubble almost took down world economy, now US isnt the only major global market player. Moreover the 20 trillion debt isnt going down, there are risks of more bubbles popping (derivates market is volotile as fuck), huge income inequalities, more war spending, cuts to almost all social serives, no health and shit education. Rising economic powers of brics nations is another huge threat to USs world leadership. </p>

<p>So yeah, they are trying to disarm the populace before the system collapses and we have seen this, there is no such thing as too big to fail. Before inflation kicks in overdrive, before recession and depression happens, before the millions of americans lose their jobs to automation and lack of any social security. Basically, a few more issues and there will be movements if not full on civil disobedience. Even US with their police state, cant stop millions of poor (90%) of the population from waking up and realising how the rich have robbed then. (through tax loopholes, market collusion, greedy vile corruption, huge wealth devide and automation). </p>

<p>Unless the current elite swallow their greed and hunger for power and change the american way, the current state of everything is boiling over. </p>

There&#39;s simply too many weapons still for any &quot;easy&quot; plan to be effective, so from the get-go a (full or partial) ban on guns would need to be accompanied by several side measures to actually prove significant.    </p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest setting incentives of some kind for those that turn weapons in, major education campaigns on the dangers of firearms, police actually enforcing the ban by arresting people who own guns and taking them away (yes, this isn&#39;t nice for obvious reasons but at some point or another will necessary happen. There&#39;s quite a sector who wouldn&#39;t give up their guns on their bloody coffin).     </p>

<p>So naturally a ban on selling guns would also need to be a ban on <em>having</em> guns (again, doesn&#39;t have to be a ban on <em>every</em> gun/weapon) coupled with other not-so-nice measures - I&#39;m absolutely no expert and this is what I came up with in 5 mins, I&#39;m sure others can do better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scary thing is,  they don’t even need to take our guns away this next generation will do it for us. There’s three groups of people in the population pro-gun the anti-gun and the indifferent. It’s the in different people that are dangerous because the pro-gun people will teach their kids responsibilities with guns in proper handling etc. etc. the anti-gun people will do the converse of that and probably instill fear in their kids. It’s the people who are in different Who pose the greatest threat. Their children will have no influence from their parents about it and all they will see is these marches and shit and peer pressure or wanting to be socially accepted will lean them anti gun. They will be the ones voting replacing the people who are aging now and are used to the days of guns in trucks at highschool and gun culture being the norm. </p>

<p>Where violent crime plummeted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Gun violence</em> plummeted, not general violent crime. </p>

<p>Ironically, the US has increased it&#39;s manufacture of guns in the same time period, but gun violence is actually <em>down</em>.</p>

<p>Mass shooting gets lots of attention, for a reason. </p>

<p>I also find it funny that users such as yourself completely ignore any assertion that this might be a <em>false flag</em>. There reason for this is once you understand an event to be a false flag, you realize that gun ban is part of a larger program, one that not only lies to Americans in order to attempt to disarm them, but murders them as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An armed populace cannot be loaded into boxcars.</p>

<p>Banning guns does not move towards totalitarianism.  Rather, the principle effect is to <em>remove a barrier</em> to totalitarianism.</p>

<p>Now it is possible to subjugate an armed population.  The Russians did it in the Ukraine with the Holodomir.  Whenever they found an angry armed farmer, they&#39;d just surround the house, post a watch, wait till he ran out of food, and throw a grenade in the window.  Bang.  Done.</p>

<p>With that said, firearms remain the only known insurance against totalitarianism that humankind has ever come up with.  Yes, we have democracy and free speech and all of these things, but at the end of the day, a change to totalitarianism suspends all of these.</p>

<p>A widely-armed working class maintains their ability to conduct political violence <em>regardless of how totalitarian their government becomes.</em></p>

<p>A disarmed working class is helpless.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t use the internet much do you?  This is called an ad hominid attack.  It&#39;s a quick way to discredit an argument by attacking the person making it.  No one is seriously thinking that the NRA is a terrorist organization.  If they were then no one would claim to be a part of them.</p>

<p>You call it an <em>ad hominem</em> attack.  That&#39;s fine, but not so much when it is elected officials saying it on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The UK 1% Banksters used the US to defeat the USSR, and intervene in the ME. As a result, the US has been bankrupt. We are enslaved by our debt. We will not be able to continue to spend on our military in the future, because our economy will not be able to support it. I do not know how much more time we have before things go awry, but it does not really matter whether it is 50 years or 100 years. We are becoming just another banana republic it seems. </p>
