       A month ago there was an article in the WSJ's that discussed the US military was going to be shifting there focus from the Middle East to China &amp; Russia.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://archive.is/vSlrd#selection-1989.0-1993.91">
         U.S. Considers Boosting Asia Forces With Special Marine Units
Shift would promote new strategy emphasizing China and Russia, with cutbacks in the Mideast
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It continues on to say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Military officials said the MEUs are under consideration with other complementary proposals to reposition forces into East Asia to counter a rising China, which the new defense strategy identifies as
        <strong>
         undermining an international world order in place for decades
        </strong>
        . Officials said they didn’t know when a final decision would be made about deployments.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Initially I figured they were talking about the NWO in general, but yesterday I discovered

        China is about to start their own Petro-Yuan that will compete against the Petro Dollar
       </a>
       and it launches tomorrow.  China is the largest purchaser of oil and will most likely be working with Russian, Syria &amp; Iran.  Not only that, but they are backing the

        Petro Yuan with Gold
       </a>
       , which both

        Russia &amp; China
       </a>
       have been hoarding for the past decade +.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know how it goes when countries try to go against the Petro Dollar, i.e Libya &amp; Iraq.  But this time, we have both Russia &amp; China who are also readying themselves.  Putin announced back in
       <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putin-russia-business-war-production-sochi-military-talks-a8069951.html">
        Nov 2017 for manufacturers to be War Ready
       </a>
       , while China recently added an additional
       <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/04/china-raises-2018-military-budget-by-8-point-1-percent.html">
        175 Billion to their Military Budget
       </a>
       .  This is in light of the US have a bloated military budget and recently having Neocon Bolton take the National Security Advisor position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thought I’d give you guys a heads up, since this looks like it has potential to trigger WW3 and almost no one in the MSM news ever talks about the Petro Dollar or in this case the new Petro-Yuan.  Just some food for thought!

       It depends on which country crashes first, if the financial crisis ends up hitting the US first than China, then yeah, this would really weaken the US's influence in other countries which could be taken advantage of by Putin.

       And tgat the whole other side of the story, the US has undermined our economy by not allowing us to feel the full effects of the 08 crash, not punishing those responsible, and floating our economy with Quantitative Easing.  I personally think the erosion of the middle class since the 90's, the waisted trillions on war based off of lies, and the destruction of civil liberties while creating a surveillance state has all been intentialy to turn us into China.  I think TPTB are playing it all, and perfer a Chinese type society where the general population are more controlled than here in the state.  The best way to bring that about it to bottom out pur economy and blame a foriegn entity so they don't have to answer for our policies over the 30+ years.

       Yeah,  well its the end of the US empire as it was hoped to be by PNAC.     There will still be a sphere of US influence probably at least for a while just like there is a sphere of German influence,   a sphere of Russian influence.   But the US is 5% of the world population with a decreasing share of total world GDP relative to everywhere else.    Not only that,  but a lot of things like carbon based energy and unlimited pollution are coming to an end,  the US system of politics is certainly not worth adopting anywhere or worth exporting anywhere,  not if its based on a foreign policy like the US has had since the Spanish American War.    But it is already being copied by China who is now building military bases even in Africa.

       As I like to refer too, the powers that be.  I'm not the one to tell you who's at the top or why I see political shift, I just note them.  Figuring who on top is a shit show from my experience... and that comment isn't designed to say anyone who does is full of shit, It's just not my cup of tea.

       Honestly, the switch to a petro-yuan looks like preparations for war. The US has been stockpiling oil reserves for the same reason.

       The house of cards has become too valuable to knock over. I feel as though China has put itself into a position to pry away power and there is no way to stop it without knocking over the entire house. They have almost engaged in economic bjj to the point where they have even bought out large portions of our western propaganda machine.  The western way of life would suffer without them, and they seem to be playing a more mechanized long game than countries that are considered more “free”. With algorithmic control (see the posts in china’s internal citizen ratings) the Chinese ptb have wedges themselves into a position of creeping control that we will see play outnover the next few decades imo.

       It's amazing how quiet the petro-yuan news is. Aside from the usual doomsday nutcases who have been talking about this for decades, and who really listens to those guys anyways?

       $500 billion says the US military is going to ensure this transition occurs as peacefully as possible. I'll even put the odds at 5 billion to 1. Who's in? I'm totally good for it. Oh, wait, spez is now banning gambling? Well at least I don't have to listen to any more bitching about loot boxes. Oh? They're keeping those? Ah hell

       US dont has the economic power for a war against china. I know americans dont wanna hear this, but China is not Iraq. And Iraq alone doubled the american debt, without fighting back at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what the USA would do after a war? Hold the 1,4 billion people in check with 100.000 soldiers?

       I would argue their brand of thinking is non National like uh doesnt matter the culture if the person or small group of people in charge are dead set on control and destruction.
