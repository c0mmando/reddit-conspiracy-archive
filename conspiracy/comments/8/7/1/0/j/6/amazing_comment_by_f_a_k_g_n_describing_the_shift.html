       There's no question this sub's politics changes every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the run up to the election, a large portion of the sub supported Donald Trump. That changed practically overnight in January 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       One way to see that is to look at average comment scores over time. Awhile ago, I did a comparison of the overlap between r/conspiracy and the_donald. I've seen lots of people say this is "TD 2.0" so I thought it would be interesting to compare.
      </p>
      <p>
       ────────
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a chart showing the average submissions scores over time:
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gmEpN1q.png">
        https://i.imgur.com/gmEpN1q.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Index is the TD average minus the non-TD average.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not much that stands out. After the Republican primary, the average submission score of a "TD user" increased more than a "non-TD user"
      </p>
      <p>
       ────────
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the same thing but for comment scores:
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/K16aXLL.png">
        https://i.imgur.com/K16aXLL.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Average comment scores for Non-TD posters went up significantly after January 2017. Comments flipped from having a slight TD bias to having a slight Non-TD bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       ────────
      </p>
      <p>
       I did the same thing for TMOR vs conspiracy. Here's the comment averages:

      </p>
      <p>
       There's a handful of theories I think could explain why there has been a shift in the userbase, such as:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         "TD users" have left. Banned or just not interested anymore, I don't know why but the percent of TD users is now back to pre-2016 levels
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's an influx of new users who want to discuss conspiracies surrounding Russia and President Trump. That includes temporary surges like when a link is cross posted from r/politics.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Increase in links from meta subreddits like TMOR and their growing userbase.
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xB0EoGk.png">

      </ol>
      <p>
       ────────
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're interested in how I defined "TD users" and the (spaghetti) code I used, I have a post with more details here

       2.0, they're not just talking about the userbase, but the mod team, which is surprisingly pro-Trump. A lot of the tone of the sub can be traced back to the tone the mods set.

       yeah I honestly think the user base kinda fits across the board but if you look at things like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         certain threads being put into contest mode
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the dossier being tagged in away that dismissed it as conjecture
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         things like the Skripar post making an argument that it might not have been Russia being stickied for about a week
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the use of the conclave to pick mods, establish than idea that certain regulars are  “core users of the sub” who just so happen to have similar beliefs
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         an ex-mod who got removed arguing for a “persona non grata” rule in said sub, with those lessons commuting the offense of being liberal and liking conspiracies
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         certain people getting more leeway regarding rule violations than others
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         mods making grandstanding posts of a political nature that promotes belief in certain conspiracies skepticism of certain other conspiracies
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       you can see how people think the mod team on this sub wants to influence things a certain way. That being said the mod team has a difficult job, a lot of them are very fair, things like the SS rule have really cleaned up the sub. But, in my opinion, the mod team is not an agenda free place

       How do any of those bullets support the suggestion that “the mod team supports Trump?”

       By the way, the threads were put in contest mode because they were clearly being brigaded. How do you suggest the sub deals with astroturfing?

       Defaulting threads into contest mode has been suggested about 5000 times already. Maybe also not having a weekly “I’m being bullied by tmor” thread since that clearly only antagonizes other subs.

       And they'll cite teo examples from 2016 (Fly's 'invite to TD' post and a post flaired for being Possibly Misleading) and ignore the fact that we've added two rounds of mods ans actually ousted 3 pro-trump ones in the same time.

       in 2016, I was watching both sides closely and predicted trump would win. One thing that was fascinating to me was watching T-D'ers organically discussing conspiracies as possibilities and as coming true, like the polls lying, deepstate, MSM bias, Operation Mockingbird, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did see Fly's eventual invitation, however, prior to that I saw dozens of times posters there say stuff like, "Damn, r/conspiracy was right all along," and that was bringing in a shitload of users here.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, Alex Jones was pumping up Trump, and he is a conspiracy theorist (hold off for a sec on whether or not he's a psy op argument) and the T_D'ers starting listening to Alex's show daily, as if scripture, and his listenership skyrocketed, which also created a feedback loop of them all coming here.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is, even if Fly didn't put out the roll call, the whole flood would have still happened

       Almost no one here is actually pro-Trump.  It's just an bunch of edgy former Bernie bros trying to rile up liberals by supporting an idiot.  I hate pot smokers, hate gamers and love war.  I voted Trump because I genuinely believe in what the Republican Party has always stood for.  Most of the idiots here are just Paultards, Libertarians, and whatever the hell else "conservative" potheads are calling themselves nowadays.

       their donald fetish is subsiding as they realize they've been conned, possibly more so than other Americans. T_D is a frothing mess of second thoughts and regret. They are disillusioned as trump continues to shit all over everything. they, including donald himself, blame pelosi and 'the dems' for the latest budget, when he personally signed the bill into law after his lame veto threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all coming down and they know it so even a conspiracy board can't offer them a place to hide since their orange god is at the very top of it. When it all collapses and he goes down it will be one giant shitshow.

       For the same reason people get called out for visiting /politics: The culture in both of those subs thrives on echo-chambering.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's likely a bit of history to it as well. TD leapt onto the scene as a highly motivated user-base that was brazenly good at manipulating the voting system (doing a pretty effective job of trolling the liberal-leaning users of reddit along the way), and when they started coming over here (the whole Flytape saga) this made some of the more politically neutral users here nervous that they would take over the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       These days, the /politics and TMoR crowds seem to be getting more brazen and effective here. Political conspiracies are thus increasingly framed in tribal, partisan terms, frustrating, I suspect, TD-leaning users and politics / TMoR users alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sub is increasingly--almost exclusively, some would say--a backwater battleground for partisan manipulation and outrage.

         An article from 2006 talking about George Soros wanting open borders...also not something that would be considered a conspiracy.

       yeah I honestly think the user base kinda fits across the board but if you look at things like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         certain threads being put into contest mode
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the dossier being tagged in away that dismissed it as conjecture
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         things like the Skripar post making an argument that it might not have been Russia being stickied for about a week
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the use of the conclave to pick mods, establish than idea that certain regulars are  “core users of the sub” who just so happen to have similar beliefs
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         an ex-mod who got removed arguing for a “persona non grata” rule in said sub, with those lessons commuting the offense of being liberal and liking conspiracies
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         certain people getting more leeway regarding rule violations than others
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         mods making grandstanding posts of a political nature that promotes belief in certain conspiracies skepticism of certain other conspiracies
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       you can see how people think the mod team on this sub wants to influence things a certain way. That being said the mod team has a difficult job, a lot of them are very fair, things like the SS rule have really cleaned up the sub. But, in my opinion, the mod team is not an agenda free place

       And they'll cite teo examples from 2016 (Fly's 'invite to TD' post and a post flaired for being Possibly Misleading) and ignore the fact that we've added two rounds of mods ans actually ousted 3 pro-trump ones in the same time.

       It's weird how people say this sub is T_D 2.0 yet anything critical of Obama, Hillary, Antifa, CNN, Soros, ShareBlue, Democrats,
       <a href="/r/politicd">

       Seems odd how those "Russian bots" or "T_D users/mods" vote against their interests. Also odd how most top posts on this sub the past few months are crossposts from various

       Almost no one here is actually pro-Trump.  It's just an bunch of edgy former Bernie bros trying to rile up liberals by supporting an idiot.  I hate pot smokers, hate gamers and love war.  I voted Trump because I genuinely believe in what the Republican Party has always stood for.  Most of the idiots here are just Paultards, Libertarians, and whatever the hell else "conservative" potheads are calling themselves nowadays.
