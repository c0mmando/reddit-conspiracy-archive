       simple question. liberals want equal rights across the board but are among the loudest for abortion. abortion is killing. baby has no choice in the matter and no consent. but female has right to end life of baby? what about rape? what about consent? what about non aggression? what about love? what about equality?
      </p>
      <p>
       truth told. liberals have double think. they hold two different and contradicting ideas in their heads. a true whichbuttontopress.jpeg.

       liberals change mind!?

       Brainwashing mainly.  We are taught by public school and MSM and politicians that life isn't sacred. That babies can be "aborted" even when they somehow survive a 40 weeks abortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "mother" of the movement Margaret Sanger saw it as a means for eugenics of the poor and blacks and low class immigrants.  And now in NYC more black babies die in utero than are born.  Their population is under threat.  And most dont even see it nor now this flood of "refugees" and illegal immigrants is their cheap labor replacement and ours too speaking as a dependent of working class and farming white and Cado Indian a couple generations back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Native Americans are going extinct and we can see some od tbe same tactics.  Enforced poverty, gutting of their cultural identity, loss of language and history in the name of progress ie to "civilize" them.  It's always "progress" with Lefitists/Globalist anx their useful idiots Liberals and Neocons.
      </p>

       Add manufactured Lyme disease, HIV and chronic diseases trigger by foul ingredients in vaccines and pharmaceuticals, processed food and fluoridated tap and bath water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Gates has given speeches on the necessity to cull the population by 97% and he runs vaccine "charities" in 3rd world countries like Kenya where they were recently booted out because govt labs tested Tetanus vaccines as having BHCG to trigger spontaneous abortions and infertility.

       Maybe you should learn what liberalism actually is. You're probably just some idiot who says they're libertarian but is actually conservative and uses that as an excuse to hate on people. Judging by your posts, that's exactly what you are. Many libertarians/philosophers would argue: As long as the fetus is a part of the women, it is her property. She can do as she chooses and it is no ones business. Once the fetus is no longer in her womb that is when it is considered to have rights and person. While it's in the womb, it's just like a parasite and an extension of the women. Just like making drugs illegal does not work, neither does making abortions illegal. The government should not intervene in things like this. Libertarians may also argue that while abortion should be legal, that the state/tax payer money should not pay for it. I don't know if you're just really stupid or a troll. Probably both.

       That comes down to the definition of when one goes from being a collection of cells, to being a baby.

       I'm gonna agree with you as far as it coming down to the definition of when a person becomes a person.

       But, when does sex become procreation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it once the egg is fertilized, or is itonce the baby is born?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's once the baby is born, and the mother dies during child birth, can sex also become death?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since sex leads to procreation, and life leads to death, is sex already death?

       Do we trust in the consequences of our choices, and allow them to occur as part of fate/faith?

      <p>
       No, as the act of fertilization is independent to any issues during childbirth which may cause death.

       Sex is an independent precursor, so no. Sex doesn't necessarily lead to procreation.

       Sex is directly related to the impregnation, and so the complications of childbirth

      <p>
       To your second point.

       Sex is the only natural lead to impregnation, and regardless, impregnation inevitably leads to death.

       Yes. People stick to their choices. That doesn't mean they have faith in fate.

       Check your definitions then. Ad Hominem means I made an attack against you.

       It is belittling your point - But that's not an Ad Hominem. By belittling your point i'm showing it's flawed logic. Sperm is life, therefore we need to figure out what we consider to be 'Human Life' worthy of caring about.

       What I'm saying is that you have no problem with OP's sweeping generalization, only what you feel is a generalization by one commenter, which actually seemed pretty fair to me, since there's really no reason to be opposed to abortion if you don't feel life begins at conception.

       People are promoting the right for women to be able to choose. It's a person's body and their life. The idea of having the government force you to do something with your body doesn't seem very conservative to me. I think this is just a big issue because it's a Christian thing. And a lot of conservatives are also christian.

       Yeah that's what I said. The right to have the choice. People aren't throwing up signs encouraging people to abort babies. They are fighting for the right to have that choice.

       Yes. Fighting for the right to abort. That's what I said.

      <p>
       We're in agreement.

       I'm not saying that people are talking about how great abortion is on tv like it's Pepsi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Portion in favor is promotion in favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that, anecdotally, I've known people to talk about their abortions to others as a form of contraception. Not even joking. Their choice, by my standards, wouldnt be mine.

       That's too bad. Most people don't just willy nilly get abortions for fun instead of using contraception. Its usually a pretty heavy decision for someone. But at the end of the day, do you think the government should force you to have a baby? I wouldn't assume you believe that.

       Again, depends on the circumstances and your point of view. "Wrong" or "Right" are concepts invented by human beings. Most of us inherently will say that killing is morally wrong BUT...and all we do is argue around the but.

       Is English your second language? If so I will not make fun of you telling me I have a low IQ and not knowing the difference between calling someone "a troll" and saying that someone is "trolling". The same way, in English, we do not usually say that someone is "a drunk", but instead that someone "is drunk". If English is your first language...I pity you.

       It is legal in the USA for a woman to get an abortion. I'm not going to argue with you about this. You have already made up your mind and just want to scream "murder".

       I simply commented because you seem to think only liberals support abortion. I don't necessarily support abortion, but I do support a woman's right to choose. It is her body and her choice. She is the one who has to live with her decision.

       I'm curious, do you also think an apple seed is the same thing as an apple tree? It has been pollinated, and took time to mature into a seed, has all the genetic information needed to grow into a healthy tree, why not just consider seeds trees?

       Of course it's a potential tree. It wouldn't be a exist if the tree's flower wasn't pollinated, and given time for the fruit to grow. It contains the same genetic information it will have for it's entire existence as a tree.

       California redwoods are protected because they can take hundreds of years to mature. Should somebody who steps on a redwood pine cone while hiking face the same penalties as somebody who illegally logs a 1000 year old redwood since the pine cone could eventually become a 1000 year old tree?

       I'd really appreciate it if you would acknowledge my question with an answer as I'm interested in your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to answer yours, consciousness is a very complicated subject, and the describing exactly what defines consciousness has been the subject of debate at least since the ancient greeks were around.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we define consciousness the ability to react to stimuli to reach favorable conditions and avoid unfavorable ones, then considering a tree will physically move it's own leaves during the day, and avoid growing roots in soil conditions that are too dry and instead grow towards moist soil, then yes, trees do have a certain degree of consciousness. Unless of course, you believe seeds should count as trees.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I'd go so far as to say that a mature apple tree, in many ways, displays more behaviors that we could categorize as evidence of consciousness than a recently fertilized human egg displays.

       You really just want to deflect and not answer my questions. I feel like I've put a decent amount of time and consideration into both the comments I've directed towards you, but you're not willing to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to politely ask for a third time that you answer my original question.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm curious, do you also think an apple seed is the same thing as an apple tree? It has been pollinated, and took time to mature into a seed, has all the genetic information needed to grow into a healthy tree, why not just consider seeds trees?
       </p>
       <p>
        Does an apple count as a tree since it contains seeds?
       </p>
       <p>
        When do you feel it counts as a tree?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'd be happy to answer your question about comas if you answer my question, because that will show me you're interested in having an actual discussion. Otherwise I'm going to assume you're just looking for somebody to validate your preexisting beliefs and thought this sub would be a good place to talk shit about them baby killing libruls.

       Why are you so goddamn salty? I have you respectful, answers and all you want to is hurl insults and baseless accusations.

       If this is the level of respect you normally show to people trying to have a conservation with you, I doubt there are many people who like talking to you.

       OP So when do you think life begins? At concerion? Fertilisation? Birth?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way life begins at fertilisation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s a question... you are in a IVF clinic and it is burning down. In one room is a 1 year old child crying in the other is a room with 1000 fertilised embryos ready for implantation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you save 1000 potential lives or do you save 1?

       Some liberals and conservatives believe in pro-choice. Some liberals and conservatives believe in pro-life. If you look at the history of the feminist movement of legalization of abortion it has to do more than just "its my body" and "this is the definition of when these cells are a baby". Both those are logical arguments. The legalization of abortion was a reaction to women unnecessarily dying. Due to lack of access to legal abortions, they would often resort to doing abortions on their own or doing it in the black market. There were a lot of deaths (for the women and the baby). When you break it down like that the pro-life argument does not make sense. You're not only risking the life of the baby, but also of the women. Even if you make it illegal there will still be a black market. Let people have the choice. There's no reason for unnecessary deaths.

       We've decided as a society that a fetus doesn't have more rights than the mother. You obviously disagree with that. But that's where we are now. It's not going to change.
