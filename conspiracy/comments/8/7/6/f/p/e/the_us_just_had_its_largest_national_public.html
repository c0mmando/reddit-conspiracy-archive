    <div class="md"><p>Glad to hear that said.</p>

<p>No government can &quot;grant&quot; rights to any people. Rights are as natural and inherent as drawing breath. </p>

<p>The only thing any government can do is limit, restrict and deprive a people of their rights.</p>

<p>The Constitution was crafted NOT to restrict the rights of the People, but to confine, restrain and leash the powers of Government - to <strong><em>protect</em></strong> the People from the graft, corruption and abusive forces that inevitably infiltrate and, given the chance, dominate all such powers.</p>

<p>The greatest threat to any corrupt government is <strong><em>the People</em></strong>, but they are no threat unless they have A) the <strong><em>ability</em></strong> to communicate, to organize a cooperative opposition; B) the <strong><em>will</em></strong> to carry the resistance forward, and C), the <strong><em>means</em></strong> by which to oppose attempts to suppress perceived insurrections.</p>

<p>Where are we?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally get that, but the term &quot;self-defense&quot; can be twisted around. I have had anti-firearm proponents say that most firearms in circulation aren&#39;t necessary for self defense (the old &quot;you don&#39;t need an X(enter type of firearm here) to defend yourself against criminals&quot; argument). I think these people don&#39;t understand the 2nd Amendment to the extent you or myself do. We understand that it is a check (perhaps the final check) against government corruption and oversight.</p>

<p>I feel that we should go out of our way to clarify and promote such a position. Pardon me if I gave any offense with my previous comment, that was not my intent.</p>

<p>Trust me I get that the US gov would fail at a civil war for some of the very reasons your link points out. </p>

<p>We can all agree the military would for the most part side with the American people. </p>

<p>Most Americans are not in a position to wage guerilla warfare against a superior armed force. Steve from accounting is not going to be able to handle rucking 100+ lbs for weeks and sleeping in a literal hole in the ground. </p>

<p>Only a very small percent of Americans would be able to live a life of guerilla war. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;the right of the people to keep and bear Arms&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>States are not people, this refers to human beings in America as having the right to own, carry, and use firearms. Full stop. Not for personal defense, not to overthrow the government. It simply guarantees the right to own, carry, and use firearms for whatsoever legal purpose (i.e. not murder or maiming).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, shall not be infringed.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This section specifically refers to the right of the state to put into action an armed militia for the security of a free state (that state with said militia). No mention of safeguarding the security of a free state against a foreign threat, or a domestic threat. The intent is to make secure the <strong>freedom</strong> of the state.</p>

<p>Until the civil war, the debate as to whether secession was constitutional or not, was open. After the civil war, this issue was largely considered resolved: secession is illegal. In truth, the matter is still debatable. Nothing in the constitution explicitly states that secession is unconstitutional. Sections 2 and 3 of the 14th amendment prohibit from public office anyone involved in rebellion against the United States. Under duress (in the aftermath of the Civil War) the southern states were forced to amend their constitutions to declare that secession was unconstitutional. Contracts made in duress are voidable. The same goes for the 14th amendment. The southern states were not allowed to send representatives to congress until they ratified the 14th amendment. Technically the 14th amendment should be voidable, and the same with those amendments made to those southern states&#39; constitutions. By all means, secession is constitutional. Tell that to the military industrial complex, though. I think they&#39;ll disagree.</p>

<p>The second amendment provides for the right of the states to safeguard the freedom of the states by arming a militia.</p>

<p>Obviously they conflict with each other. The 2nd amendment came first, and I&#39;d gather its intention was to ensure the ability of the states to safeguard themselves against a tyrannical federal government. During this time the debate between federalism and anti-federalism was ongoing. Federalism won, revolution, rebellion, insurrection etc. is strictly illegal and will be met by the federal government with violence. I&#39;m not suggesting otherwise, just that some of the founding fathers intended the second amendment to be a protection against a tyrannical government. Secession, however, is a separate issue. That is hypothetically legal separation from the union, and was only made unconstitutional by invalid means, when the union forced the states to ratify the 14th amendment lest they be refused representation in the union. I&#39;m not trying to come here and tell people that if they try to violently overthrow the government it will be constitutional and they won&#39;t be met with resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  </p>

<p>Surely you&#39;ve heard the quote <em>“Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”</em>. It has been attributed to various personalities (including Tomas Jefferson), but what cannot be disputed is its <em>validity</em>.</p>

<p>Government is power, and it is a natural magnet for psychopaths and others who seek to gain office under false pretenses, aspiring to self-aggrandizement and a lust for tyranny. Given time, they will infiltrate, and if left unchecked, they will destroy.</p>

<p>Surely there are <strong><em>some</em></strong> people with fair-minds and good intentions that also aspire in politics, but unfortunately, they usually don&#39;t fare well, as their benevolent nature prevents them from resorting to the lying, dishonesty, graft and corruption that gives the reprobate psychopath an unfair, but often decisive advantage.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Eternal vigilance...&quot;?</em> I&#39;m afraid that We The People have been derelict in our duties. We and our forebears were too trusting in the idea that <em>our system of government</em> would hand us good leaders and ward off tyranny. </p>

<p>Our apathy and lethargy has led is to the brink of irreversible calamity, and thanks to the pursuit of Bread, Circuses and Trinkets, most of us are oblivious of our precarious condition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks you too. I just think we need a couple extra barriers for people that are buying guns. In Japan you have to pass a written test and train with an instructor and pass a shooting test in order to own a gun. They have very little gun crime in their country. Maybe we don&#39;t need all that, but at least training with an instructor would be good for me. I also think we need some heavy ass penalties on people that don&#39;t lock up their guns. Because kids keep stealing their parents guns and shooting up schools. This fuckin sucks and parents need to get in serious trouble if this happens. Stuff like that I think would help the issue. Any thoughts on that?</p>

<p>And a large portion of gun crimes are committed with illegal guns, or people who under our current laws wouldn&#39;t even have them. So <em>more</em> laws wouldn&#39;t stop them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So youre right that most gun crimes aren&#39;t committed by lawful gun owners. But gun owners actually only make up about 1/3rd of households in America.

I just want to acknowledge that these are dangerous tools and people keep using them to kill people. So I really don&#39;t see the harm in asking lawful gun owners to jump through a couple extra hoops to attain those guns. Not trying to take them away from people.

<p>It&#39;s shocking that you (apparently) sincerely saw it as necessary for me to &quot;construct an argument&quot; around something like that. When I asked the thread &quot;where do you draw the line?&quot; I was genuinely interested in an answer. I certainly didn&#39;t expect someone to kinda suggest there was no line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because an Uzi is generally an innacurate POS spitting out 9mm rounds and a saw is a giant fucking unweildy platform generally manned by a two person team. That&#39;s the thing anti-gunners don&#39;t get. There is always a trade off. An uzi&#39;s strength is that is concealable, not particularly accurate or powerful. A saws strength is that it says daown massive amounts of suppressive fire and allows for troop movement in a team setting. So where do u draw the line? A bad guy can sneak a small .22 pistol onto an airplane and kill a bunch of people much easier than I can smuggle a SAW into a similar situation. A bad guy can use a hunting rifle and post up in a bkingd half a mile away and pick people off with precision that most other platforms don&#39;t provide. A shotgun can blast big patterns with little effort to aim. Anti-gunners get fixated on the black rifles not understanding there is always a trade off and always an alternative. You&#39;ll never ban all guns in the U.S. so, where do you draw the line. Personally, I&#39;d rather take my chances with some deranged school kid at medium to short range with a shitty, in accurate bump stock or with a hundred round POS drum mag that is likely to jam on an operator that is unlikely to have the skills to clear the jam effectively (James Holmes was a genius and still couldn&#39;t pull it off) than take my chances with a hunter of average skill shooting a bolt-action with a scope from a hide somewhere so far away I can&#39;t even tell where the shots are coming from. You won&#39;t ever ban hunting rifles. Hunting rifles are sniper rifles for all intents and purposes. Ban assault rifles and the crazies start learning how to sniper instead. Go ask a real Swat or spec ops guy how often they turn their m4&#39;s on full auto instead of taking their time and using semi-auto.</p>

<p>Yes actually.</p>

<p>Ever notice that country folk are more protective of their gun rights that city slickers?</p>

<p>In the country the police can take over an hour to show up in response to a call simply because you&#39;re 20 miles from a station down winding roads. If someone busts into your house you can&#39;t expect the police to help in time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s blindingly obvious to me that the people should be armed in case their government gets out of hand.</p>

<p>Now as a woman who has been raped and suffered child sexual abuse as well I can say before 4 weeks or so it is between her and her doctor and God.  Thankfully the Plan B is good for such cases if given soon enough.</p>

<p>Otherwise she should receive counseling and be told what development stages are and assisted in finding an adoption option.</p>

<p>They also need to realize its eugenics slowly destroying the future of blacks and lower class whites as well.  In NYC a black baby has over a 50% chance of being aborted.  Will we have any American blacks left there in a couple generations?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find the NRA rather too lax on defending the 2nd Amendment actually. Foreign money though is an issue but I&#39;m more worried about how Congressmen come into office with no wealth and get a $250k or less annual salary yet leave multi millionaires.  And their free pass to conduct insider trading is only a small part.</p>

<p>Biden&#39;s son had 3 equity deals with China he signed after he traveled with his then VP pop on Air force 2 to China.  Each worth some 1.5 billion USD.</p>

<p>Clinton Foundation was taking millions and millions from Saudis and Russia and China and others.  No doubt Bush and Cheney were as well.</p>

<p>I say lets clean it all out.  No more earnings for &quot;public servants&quot; beyond their annual salary.  And their friends amd family cant cash in either. No more lobbyists allowed and campaigns are set at a fixed rate offered to whomever gets the minimum number of signed petitions. No more tax money to RNC and DNC.  And no more PACs amd Super PACs.</p>

<p>Non profits cannot hire lobbyists anymorenor their affiliates. Here in Texas we havr the Animal Rights Industry working very aggressively to get all animal ownership and use outlawed. Pets too. And I am sick of trying to grassroots fundraise enough for a lobbyist when they have millions funneled in from Soros and idiot celebrities and PETA and HSUS etc.</p>

<p>Until all that&#39;s done the NRA should be allowed to play by the same damn rules.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t take things away from the people because you failed to provide them with things they need in the first place. You just start providing the things they need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can never provide <em>everything</em> everybody needs 100% of the time. Governments just don&#39;t work like that. Therefore in any system there are bound to be someone wanting to do f.ex. a school shooting, so if guns are easy to get hold of guess what will happen? and if guns are difficult to get hold on maybe, just maybe, you have prevented a massacre. In European countries you rarely see school shootings and massacres although it does happen from time to time, how no way near as frequent as in the US where guns are plentiful and a 14yo can by ammo in Walmart...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>War weapons are exactly what our founding fathers demanded we have.</p>

<p>And the AR-15 was civilian designed not military. AR doesn&#39;t stand for &quot;autorifle&quot; or &quot;assault rifle&quot; either. It&#39;s the brand ArmaLite.</p>

<p>Now I want you to consider some scenarios like Hurricane Katrina and the only thing standing between your family and looters, your wife and daughter or sister or mother and rapists is you and what? A BB gun? A phone with no service ans police that won&#39;t be able to reach you for weeks?</p>

<p>We are as important as the Military.  We are the first line of defense at home.  Especially with our military stretched over 100 countries.</p>

<p>And that doesn&#39;t even take into account rogue government agents much less a rogue government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth hurts. I&#39;m not a religious person who believes a sperm touches an egg and that&#39;s a life. But there&#39;s countless undercover videos where they say in some cases the baby cries shortly after being aborted. There&#39;s videos of aborted fetuses moving. I remember Ron Paul became pro-life working as a doctor and said he saw a crying, moving baby tossed in a bucket to be thrown out.</p>

<p>I used the word &quot;discover&quot; because Common Law is not about instituting law but rather it is about figuring something out.  We have rights.  They intersect.  But how?</p>

<p>This is an unsolvable problem.  Its anachronistic complexity is one of the major things that drives people (consciously or unconsciously) to simpler philosophies like Communism and Fascism.</p>

<p>You have a right to life.  You have a right not to be shot.  If I point a gun at you (thereby threatening an immediate infringement on your right to life) then I automatically lose my own right to life and you may shoot me dead in that moment.</p>

<p>US gun laws are a joke. Parkland shooting was done using Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P15 and after quick google check on Maryland gun laws and to buy one you wouldn&#39;t need a permit or background checks. If this is your hardest then you need to get your act together.</p>

<p>I’m going to respectfully somewhat disagree with you here.  If a bunch of people being armed means safety, the inner city should be a veritable paradise because of all the armed gang members.  This suggests to me the problem isn’t a simple matter of how many people are armed, and other factors need to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Education and training are factors also, plus the gun violence topic is one of many topics where the various sides aren’t always talking about the same thing.  One side might be talking about gang violence and another side is talking about school shootings, both of which are very different beasts.  </p>

<p>&quot;God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion.
The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is
wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts
they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions,
it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. ...
And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of
resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as
to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost
in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from
time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.

<p>I graduated 3rd grade, so yes, I understand the concept of a slippery slope, but I&#39;ve also seen the Right clutch their pearls at Slippery Slope arguments surrounding gun control since Clinton was President, and then right before Obama was elected when everyone said he&#39;d take all our guns, and then right before he was RE-Elected when everyone said &quot;last time we were just kidding, but he&#39;s definitely gonna take all our guns THIS TIME&quot; and he didn&#39;t. The unwarranted, unrewarded hysteria around slippery slope arguments has wasted them on me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people have other ways around that and people who commit crimes dont care about laws. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, again, are you applying this principle to other laws? Seatbelts? Drunk driving? Illegal drugs? (btw I&#39;m all for legalizing marijuana - meth, not so much) What about Abortion? Assault &amp; Battery? Car theft? Murder? People have ways around all those laws too, and people who commit crimes don&#39;t care about laws. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>when an enemy army invades we the ARMED people are the bottom line on weather or not you are raped and killed, if the government chooses to turn on us(our forefathers set it up to protect us from that), or if we had civil war, how would you protect your children?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re taking the Red Dawn approach? Or talking more like, if we decided to rise up against the government? Either way, I&#39;m not seeing the issue, because none of the gun control proposals I mentioned above are about taking away all your guns. They&#39;re about making sure there&#39;s as much accountability around purchasing a gun, as there is in purchasing a car, which makes sense, because a car at least has a practical purpose, whereas a gun&#39;s only purpose is for putting lethal holes in things. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>what will those to poor to own a gun or to poor to buy ammo, use to protect their children, a knife? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they&#39;ll have guns, which will be available for purchase at many different locations throughout the nation, because For Fuck&#39;s Sakes, No One Is Trying To Take All The Guns Away. We&#39;re just trying to make sure that dangerous tools have appropriate accountability measures surrounding them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>lowering the number of armed people is dangerous and making it harder to get a gun wont change the wrong people from having them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is great, because again, No One Is Trying To Take All The Guns Away. You will never convince me that I want all of our guns gone, nor that I would be okay if they were. Not every rule and regulation is a slippery slope. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it would be more effective to teach gun safety, and require people to at least know how to use one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m with you that this is important! It&#39;s my opinion that every gun owner should go through a rigorous &amp; regular training protocol. They&#39;re too important to just have as a fashion accessory. </p>

<p>And this is why you people will never understand what&#39;s going on. Their not just marching for fewer guns for ownership (not outright ban) but also for strengthening their right of not getting shot or in other words. Their right for life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no doubt that most of those participating in the marches are passionate and sincere. They believe that gun violence is a big problem in America, and understandably so: There are thousands of homicides committed with firearms in the US every year.</p>

<p><strong><em>But what exactly do they hope to accomplish?</em></strong> </p>

<p>Have a look at the primary demands they are repeating: </p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/03/25/us/politics/ap-us-student-gun-protests.html">&quot;...an assault weapons ban, prohibition of sales of high-capacity magazines and universal background checks.&quot;</a></em> </p>

<p>Are they hoping to achieve a significant reduction in <strong><em>all</em></strong> gun violence, or simply to the reduce the likelihood of <strong><em>mass public shootings</em></strong> such as in Parkland that, thankfully, <em>are very rare</em>, and whose victims account for only a tiny fraction of all gun murders in the us?</p>

<p>What is their goal here? If their &quot;demands&quot; are met, will it have any significant impact on the problem, as they perceive it?</p>

<p>If one does not understand the true nature of any problem, any effort to &quot;fix&quot; it will likely be fruitless.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Except you used to be able to, and slaves <em>were</em> considered property.</p>

<p>Rights are things we&#39;ve made up and all just sort of agree to and go along with. All human culture is just stuff humans have made up. I mean, the Constitution is just a piece of paper some guys wrote and signed. If someone took over the country tomorrow and burned it, then that&#39;s all gone, and we&#39;d be given another set of &quot;rights&quot;.</p>

<p>So rights should probably be called allowances, because they&#39;re really more like the things the people in power allow you to do so you continue to support them.</p>

We have &quot;big&quot; protests every few weeks to give people the illusion that they&#39;re participating in &quot;democracy&quot;.  Many people who &quot;protest&quot; don&#39;t even vote.</p>

<p>Gun lobby, IMO, shoulders a pretty heavy amount of the blame here.  Their stated goal is to protect gun ownership - but they act like fucking psychos.  This particular brotest stems from a general feeling by scared millenials that gun owners all carry AR15s in public - they&#39;ve been saying this for years.  <a href="https://media.koin.com/nxs-kointv-media-us-east-1/photo/2016/09/23/salem-gun-rally-09232016-mike-bivins_29622447_ver1.0_640_360.jpg">Good job showing up to protests like this guys</a>, really good job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there no way possible to get actual intelligent people to sit down educate and discuss? I am a proud gun owner and defender of 2nd amendment, but at the same time I think it is upon us to actually listen to these people and what they are asking for. I live right out side DC, and I have yet to have a discussion with anyone that is on the “opposite” side that has brought up wanting to take all of our guns. They are scared and afraid and the only thing they see from gun ownership are the “officials” calling them names and screaming back NEVER! We need MORE GUNS! And neither of our points are getting across. 
Most of the discussions I have had revolve around 2 things. One of course has been the AR, which each time has been a lack of knowledge, and the second has been about keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally unstable. Which I am not so sure is a that unfounded of an idea. If we could just have a representative stand and listen and discuss ideas on how we keep guns out of the hands of “bad guys”with out equal and opposite irrational screaming maybe we could come to some sort of common ground....I know maybe I am crazy ( irony). 
We all want our kids safe. And I hope we can as a people work together to make that happen. Because until we do larger and larger separations being created that will bring an eventual clash that is not going to end well for anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rhetoric coming out of people on both sides is just insane. I would think it almost humorous if not for the chilling effect it might have one day.

<p>I don&#39;t own any guns, but grew up with quite an arsenal in the house. I learned from an early age the rules of gun safety and to have respect for guns and what they can do. The reason I don&#39;t own any guns right now is merely because I&#39;m just not that into owning guns. </p>

<p>But I have no problem with other people owning them, even scary &quot;black plastic&quot; &quot;semi-automatic&quot; &quot;high-powered&quot; &quot;assault weapons&quot; with terrifying pistol grips and freaky bayonet lugs. And I might even own a few one day after my kid is grown and I have time to go shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s something that bothers me as someone neutral* on this debate. The pro gun side won&#39;t just come clean and say &quot;I like guns and strongly support the second amendment, and I consider the current level of gun violence an acceptable price for freedom&quot;.</p>

<p>Instead it&#39;s always &quot;just arm more people&quot; which reads more like an NRA/gun manufacturer wish than a serious attempt to reduce gun violence. Then there&#39;s the claims that the events didn&#39;t happen or were orchestrated by the government, which side steps the issue. And then there&#39;s all of the people that bring up mental health for the clear purpose of deflecting the issue (not saying mental health and pharmaceutical overuse isn&#39;t a real issue, but several people only care about it when guns are being criticized).</p>

<p>It just feels like the pro gun side just wants the discussion to go away while pretending they care about gun violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I think if you actually discuss with the pro gun side (me and other people) you will find that we don’t say “it is acceptable” because we don’t think it is acceptable. Making up you mind on what we think and accepting what media is saying and portraying is hurting both our sides. I want the discussion to go away because we have worked together to stop violence as much as possible. I am tired of these mentally I’ll individuals having access to guns and destroying lives and families. 
Just throwing our collective arms up and saying it will be to little or nothing will change, does none of us any good and only exacerbates  the situation leaving open the access for the next incident and a furthering of deviation. </p>

<p>Believing in gun control does not limit your rights. Arms sales are already limited as it relates to public safety.  For instance, you cant buy a Stinger missile at Wal Mart because of the threat it poses to commercial air flights.  It&#39;s an arm, and you have the right to bear arms, but nobody is really bitching and moaning that you cant buy a surface to air missile under the 2nd amendment.  At some point, all of us believe that limiting the sale of some arms benefits the general public.</p>

<p>People that use this argument simply aren&#39;t thinking it through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im being a little cheeky with it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the government ever truly wanted to turn on its citizens, and use the military to do so, how much of the military, filled to the brim with corn-fed good old American boys, would obey those orders? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesnt address the original intent of the second amendment although I agree with you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That leaves us with 80%+ of the military fighting back. The government knows this, it simply wouldn&#39;t happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus is the issue Im speaking about. </p>

<p>If we interpret the 2nd amendment to mean civilians should be as armed or as capable of resisting the firepower that the government has shouldnt that include such things as the ability to resist an air attack with the appropriate defenses? </p>
