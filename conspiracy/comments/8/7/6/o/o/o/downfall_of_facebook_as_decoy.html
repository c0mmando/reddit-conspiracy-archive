If Facebook is “brought down” eventually for breachs with data. The public thinks this is great, Facebook being punished for sharing their personal data. Since only Facebook is being punished, they’re the only ones soliciting our personal info right? (wrong of course)</p>

<p>So basically, is Facebook going to be a sacrifice/scapegoat to appease the masses and make them think websites/agencies/entities aren’t collecting personal information?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe look at the stock ownership of Facebook. Has all the smart money cashed out to the dumb fucks&#39; retirement funds? If so the only people shafted are Facebook senior people who have already started selling their shares. Forget what MZ was worth on paper a few weeks ago, he knew he would at some point walked away from the car crash with a few billion. All the smart money would have flown in other social media or farmland in NZ. Facebook is a controlled demolition.
So why did they pull it?
My own view is that within the superficial hugfest of deepstate/ Uniparty/Silicon Valley/Hollywood the all fucking hate each other. Zuck was likely working on AI to pull all this data into some master project of mass mind control ( Look how fucked up ppl are already by FB and they weren&#39;t even trying)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually quite difficult to determine why the PTB launched this campaign against their own data collection tool.<br/>
I&#39;d like to think it&#39;s more evidence of a second, good power faction but if that were the case, MSM and all associated players (shills &amp; bots included) would be against it, not supporting it.<br/>
It could be an effort to move people into a new box where they think they&#39;re not being surveilled and will therefore behavior more candidly.<br/>
My best guess at the moment, because of the timing, is that they concluded that Facebook actually made it more difficult for them to garner support for their White House puppet during the 2016 election (instead of making it easier as they expected), and they now need to get rid of FB in time for the next election circus, which is starting now.</p>
