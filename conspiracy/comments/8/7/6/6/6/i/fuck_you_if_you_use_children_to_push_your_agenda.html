       Notice how they always obsess over Satanic ritual child abuse? You wouldn't want them actually investigating their church officials now would you? You have to just trust in God. These people are here for your kids to make sure they don't turn gay or let an atheist teach them about science.

       Ah yes, the dwindling rate of Christianity and general apathetic religious beliefs if not outright atheism is really an oppressive force in the U.S society. Millennials &amp; Gen Z are extremely left-leaning and non-religious or if a little, it's "spiritual but not religious".

       Of course your side is concerned with children. Granted, imaginary children but concerned nonetheless. The other side? The one that has made gun control a recent issue in response to children being killed in classrooms? Real children who are actually dead? They’re not really concerned with children. They’re pushing an agenda.

       The shortcomings by the mental health care system, local police and fbi can all certainly be addressed. School officals are encouraged to not cooperate with local police and to fluff disciplinary records to receive more federal funding.

       I know you think you are morally superior for wanting to ban guns, but unless you call for a constitutional convention it’s not happing.

       We need more people like you in r/conspiracy. Wish they would reflect on themselves and realize their hypocrisy. The latest trend in r/conspiracy is how Florida was a false flag and that these kids are just controlled opposition trying to take away guns away completely, but the Maryland shooting proves we need more guns in schools.

       I will and regularly do. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, and then Trump and blue team for every other option in the general, weren't any third parties that I saw to choose from outside the presidential ticket. Trump sucked nuts and lied to us, not entirely surprisingly. It's not impossible he will still do something good, but I am not going to hold my breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want candidates with integrity. That is part of the justification for me saying Trump sucked. He made it obvious he wasn't going to drain the swamp before he even swore in. Bernie Sanders is at least mostly consistent, harps on billionaires (who, imo, got us into this mess), and seems to have more integrity than any of the other options. Ron Paul is the only other presidential candidate I've ever seen with a measure of integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we had politicians who were held accountable for their actions and had integrity, the political process would be working. Alas, we do not, and the media on either side makes claims like "red team bad, blue team good!" and conversely "blue team bad, red team good!" dividing the population on imaginary lines when virtually everyone wants the same things, and virtually none of our politicians are even trying to get us those things.

       This isn't true, and depending on your beliefs one party definitely IS worse than the other. My parents don't want transgendered people to be able to use the same bathrooms as them, and I could not care less. Now, I would agree with you if you were to say that this issue was created by politicians as a ruse to keep people divided over shit that doesn't matter, but that doesn't mean it isn't an issue. I mean, those politicians artificially created this issue, but it was still created. There were actual laws passed. You can't say the party divide in America is pointless, because one party being in power makes different REAL things happen than when the other party is in power. It DOES matter.

       Both parties make the military industrial complex richer at the expense of the lives of civilians in countries all over the world, both parties want us to hate each other for things like skin color, sexual orientation, and various sky fairies who will either give us presents if we are good and coal if we are bad, and both parties want to keep us confused, dumb, and misinformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your bathroom point is exactly what I'm talking about. It genuinely does not matter, but the media is making it into a big issue to divide us so we do not work together to topple the oppressors.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say that there are no politicians with good intentions.  There absolutely are, on both sides, but the majority of politicians on both sides are coopted in one way or another to just maintain the status quo for the billionaire elite. There are Democrats who want to dial back on the military (though not many who vote that way consistently.) There are Republicans who believe that the federal government is overstepping the bounds of the Constitution and believe states rights should be preferred (though not many who vote that way consistently.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think even with abortion that people on both sides have some good points, I lean left, but I honestly couldn't care less while we're murdering people in the Middle East with bombs that were paid for by money we don't have at the expense of American taxpayers who don't want the bombs dropped in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's figuratively a reality TV show and a sleight of hand to keep us distracted while they literally pick our pockets and murder innocent people all around the world.

       I think you're missing my point. The transgender bathroom stuff should NOT be an issue, it literally is a distraction from more important stuff, like you said. But, IT IS HAPPENING.
      </p>
      <p>
       If somebody is robbing a bank, and then right as they leave the bank they toss a grenade over their should back into the bank, are you supposed to say "well that grenade is obviously just a distraction so that we don't call the police, I'm just going to ignore it even though it's about to explode in my face" ? Or do you overcome the grenade "obstacle" and then figure out how to stop the guys from doing it again?
      </p>
      <p>
       The bathroom bill stuff is the same thing, it shouldn't have been made to happen, but these laws really were passed. And it affected the real lives of real people. What are we supposed to do, let those people suffer because their lives aren't the "real issues"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so there's people fighting tribal wars over access to clean water right now. Should we ignore that so we can focus on the real issue of domestic surveillance? Or is domestic surveillance just a distraction from the real issue of perpetual warfare? Or is perpetual warfare the distraction from the real issue of central banking?
      </p>
      <p>
       The media didn't make the bathroom stuff into an issue in order to divide people. People where already divided over it, and the media talked about it, for ratings, because they make money when people watch them. My parents wanted those kinds of laws before it was controversial. The media didn't give them that view.

       This appears artificial to me. A discomfort for a few people that was delicately nurtured into an intense hatred. As it became more common for people on TV to express this bigotry, others adopted the feeling.

       No, this is all real. Artificially inflated poverty is exacerbating a lot of the contention over shit that doesn't matter because people think it's some power they can flex, and they think they will feel better if someone send lesser to them.

       Well, it depends on the proposals, of course.  But my position is that gun owner/operators should be subject to similar regulations as other participants in dangerous activities--private pilots is the example I tend to point to, just because it's something I know a little about, but there are others.  So, in a nutshell: training, background checks, registration, and limitations on the kinds of equipment non-professionals can have.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Such regulations are
         <em>
          modest
         </em>
         .  They present a slight burden on those who wish to participate in an activity that presents a heightened danger to the public, but that burden is proportional to the potential for harm.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Such regulations are
         <em>
          Constitutional
         </em>
         .  Justice Scalia's articulation of the Supreme Court's decision in
         <em>
          District of Columbia v. Heller
         </em>
         does an excellent job of interpreting the Constitutionality of firearms regulation.  It acknowledges that the Second Amendment articulates an
         <em>
          inherent
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          individual
         </em>
         right of Americans to bear arms (and let's face it, anyone who argues otherwise is being pretty disingenuous).  But Scalia famously goes on to acknowledge that this right, like most natural or Constitutional rights, is not unlimited: it is "not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."  It is not the right to carry "dangerous and unusual weapons".  And the Court explicitly upheld the Constitutionality of "longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing
         <em>
          conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms
         </em>
         " (emphasis mine).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Such regulations are
         <em>
          common sense
         </em>
         .  Most people would agree--that is, it is
         <em>
          commonly
         </em>
         held as
         <em>
          sensible
         </em>
         --that individual citizens should not be permitted to own and operate high-yield nuclear weapons.  Most people would agree that the law should not permit someone like Khalid Shiekh Mohammad or Timothy McVeigh to walk the streets with a Barrett M82.  So it is common sense that
         <em>
          some
         </em>
         kinds of regulations are called for.  Where people start to disagree, where things start to get messy, is where to draw the line on those regulations.  I would argue that my proposed regulations present the minimal level of regulation possible to ensure that the commonly-held concerns about criminals and nutcases having easy access to firearms and about private ownership of extremely dangerous weapons.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So, there you go.  A framework for modest, Constitutional, and common-sense regulation of weapons.

       In light of the high ranking pedos in the U.K., I feel like pizza gate hit a nerve with some powerful folk in America. But then I think it was completely co-opted and driven to the point where it seemed ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that the whole pizza parlor thing was probably not true. But there are almost certainly politicians who are pedophiles and I'm betting they're controlled by our intelligence agencies because that sort of leverage is unbeatable. And I wouldn't be surprised if that is why this conspiracy theory went from being seen as plausible to bat shit crazy in no time flat. After all, agent provocateurs are easy to enlist in online battles and if anyone knows how to tarnish an image it's the spooks.

       Pizzagate was an attempt to construct some kind of conspiracy out of a bunch of emails that would otherwise be pretty boring. It was used as a political tool before an election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretending that pizzagate was actually about general pedophiles in positions of power is an attempt to rewrite history. After it had run its course and went nowhere, people gradually changed the discussion to pedogate and pretended that critics of pizzagate where actually denying any pedophilic crimes instead of a made up email code.

       That's not a very accurate portrayal of pizzagate.  Hell, there wasn't even a basement!
      </p>
      <p>
       Suffice to say  that when a creepy looking dude who was going to be secretary of state?  is being invited to take part in satanic rituals, some people get curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most don't.  Most people let people like stephen colbert tell them what pizzagate was by way of incorrectly rattling off various things about it and what it alleged.

       But anyhow, why don't you go to your father John's house.  I think the hot tub is all warmed up.

       I think your comment was pretty badly written  but to summarize  what I got from it: Podesta had it coming anyways, the people who think Pizzagate is bullshit can’t think for themselves and I‘m a shill. I love that level of discussion.

       People can think pg is bs all they want.  But when people say things are debunked when they're not, they lose a bit of credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with the seth rich case.  media outlets repeatedly say things like "debunked" but in reality nothing's debunked because the case isn't solved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if Hillary won, and Podesta was among the most powerful people in the country, and then people found out he's getting invited to take part in satanic rituals.  Or that his brother has an underground theater for viewing "sensitive" materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alot of this is fun to talk about right now because so many people are hot for russia despite the lack of evidence, and many people are caught defending one thing while saying another equally questionable thing is ok.

       Hey, I actually agree with you that calling it debunked is wrong. You can’t actually debunk that stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could claim the sentences you wrote summoned demons and there is no way you could debunk that. That’s why I call bullshit just bullshit.

      <p>
       But if you think a made up email code is better evidence than personal meetings of affiliated persons with Russian operatives and lies over lies about that topic I really think it’s a hopeless case.

       Look at us.  You agreed on the internet... my god.  headway.
      </p>
      <p>
       "making up" email code is one of the fallacies of pg though.  You can go google the cop that recently got arrested looking for cheese pizza on craigslist.  I'm not even into pg per-se.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that with many of the examples given for code, there are huge leaps.  pizza isn't one of those leaps though, as it's been shown to have been around for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see anybody recognizing the positives that came out of PG.  It brought alot of attention to topics like human trafficking, online predators, cp.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know, it's just so easy to coopt things.  Or ridicule something to the point that most people don't look further than a silly name.

       You’re right with the pizza thing. That’s the word they used to start the thing. Then the rest followed as it fitted the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       PG also definitely brought more attention to other thing in specific places on the internet, but everything involving kids has always been a huge scandal once it became public knowledge. The influence on the perception of the general public is pretty insignificant as far as I can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while the name pizzagate does sound silly, the thing is in itself ridiculous when looking at how it developed. I don’t even want to call it a conspiracy theory, because I believe the original inventors knew exactly that they made something up for political reasons. I guess that’s my conspiracy theory regarding the whole thing.

       It also wasn't targeted at Democrats, in particular. There's no way that a massive pedophilia ring would only be perpetuated by one party. It either doesn't exist (at that level of government, the existence of child prostitution isn't really questioned afaik) or it's a blackmail scheme for powerful figures regardless of political affiliation.

      <blockquote>

        Among friends, we all (well those of us who
        <em>
         have
        </em>
        friends, which I know excludes many pizzagate proponents) we all develop secret codes and terms that make their way into our communications. Sometimes these codes conceal serious or even illegal topics—marital infidelity, say, or recreational cocaine use.
       </p>
       <p>
        So when you see someone using such a code, it’s natural to say “hmmm”.  But to jump right to kiddie touching in a pizza joint with no further evidence takes a special kind of dumb and sick.

       I fully agree with you about the podesta email codes.

       The pictures on the Instagram however lead directly to conclusions of possible child abuse.

       If you have a second, and if you can send me a link (PM is fine), I'd be happy to review and re-evaluate.  I like to try to keep an open mind, even when it comes to stuff I've already "made up my mind" on!

       Go to the pizzagate sub of voat (reddit admins have banned direct links).  They have a stickied post that summarizes the (circumstancial) evidence and has links to archives of the Instagram posts.

       Thanks; another commenter linked me to a collection of Instagram posts by James Alefenatis, and while I think his sense of humor and taste in art are highly questionable, I don't see anything that rises to the level of a "smoking gun".  To be honest, to me the fact that people see his (admittedly weird) posts and immediately jump to fabricating a sick, intricate, elaborate, and detailed fantasy about kids being molested raises more questions about the theory-makers than about Alefenatis (who again, I must stress, seems like a very odd and rather unpleasant character).

       If the need for vengeance is ignored then I think pizzagate has actually achieved a goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the amount of exposure he's recieved, Alefanatis certainly isn't going to be able to do anything he's been accused of in the future. Too many eyes are on him.

       Well that's just terribly twisted logic...by your reasoning, we should just accuse everyone we think is a little weird of horrible horrible crimes
       <em>
        just in case
       </em>
       they
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       someday consider committing those horrible crimes, and thereby prevent them from doing so.  It's all bit too Orwellian and anti-Due Process for me.

       So we should lay false accusations against all people with friends in high places?  Or just those who have weird tastes in art? Or just those  whose political opinions we disagree with?

       I read through all of them. They’re a bit odd, at times, and maybe reflect a secret understanding of some kind among the parties—a sort of “isoculture” of this particular group of powerful people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nowhere did I see any evidence pointing to pedophilia, much less pedophilia in a pizza restaurant.

       Pizzagate has legitimate circumstantial evidence that should be looked into. What is wrong with you people who want to just brush it away like it’s nothing. There’s far more evidence of pizzagate than Russian collusion lol

       I've reviewed the so-called "evidence" of pizzagate, and find it completely baseless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've reviewed the publicly available evidence of Russian interference in the US democratic process, and find it compelling.  I also--cautiously and with a shaker full of salt--give weight to the conclusions drawn by 100% of our intelligence agencies based on non-public information they have access to.

       Well, as the OP of this particular thread, I can only speak for myself, but yes, I’m a real person and not a shill. I own guns. I’m a mainline Protestant Christian.

       I do my best to think critically about history and current events.  And in doing so,
       <em>
        I may come to very different conclusions than you
       </em>
       —that doesn’t make me a “shill”.   I suspect that is the case for many people who don’t agree with you.

       Doesn't change the fact that taxpayers still have to shell out money to have little thot Stacy suck the fetus out of her womb because she was too stupid to use protection. People are using abortion as a form of birth control and it's fucked up.

       That’s the point - that’s a big if. Kids get lost on waiting lists andget shuffled from adoption lists to Foster homes all the time, and some of them are Never kept anywhere long before they turn 18. You’re speaking as if the system they go into has an even decent track record of success. This is not the case.

       Pretending people use abortion as birth control is nonsense. Besides it's the people that are too stupid to use protection that end up fucking up their kids. I wouldn't even trust them not to fuck up the pregnancy.

       How much shock are you to learn that the average tax payer's cut to Pp abortion services like 10 cents? It took me about ten minutes to figure that out. But then again, I try not to look like a tool when I comment.

       Think about the arguments. “They’re not fully developed.” Cool, so you wanna exterminate all the disabled people? “I can’t afford to give this baby a good life.” So you wanna kill the poor people? Even the rhetoric is exactly the same as the Nazis.

       Day one is an egg and a sperm... Would ending that be "killing" it, in your view? Day 270ish is a baby ready to be born. Somewhere in there is a line that starts to be crossed between person and hopefully cellular growth.

       No, the argument was in response to someone saying “BUT I DON’T WANT MUH TAXES GOING TOWARDS AN ABORTION, IT’S TOO EXPENSIVE,” followed by someone pointing out that if your worry over abortions is about Cost, a child floating around the foster system is a Far greater burden on the system financially. Anti-abortionists brought up costs first. Scroll up and see.

       and yet practising forms of Eugenics strengthens the gene pool and could make our species hardier to diseases and genetic disorders.

       It's like when stem cell research was banned in the US and the UK because of dumb religious ethical arguments and scare tactics of "playing god" and "designer babies" I remember the scare articles in the paper from when I was really young ignoring the obvious medical benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are only now starting to see the benefits of stem cell research medically and I ask myself how far behind are we now because of that ban. It's like when sciences were banned by the RC church and Islam and put as in a one thousand year black hole all because they didn't want to lose their power. Imagine where we could be now if it wasn't for these corrupt institutions.

       “In Iceland, upward of 85 percent of pregnant women opt for the prenatal testing, which has produced a Down syndrome elimination rate approaching 100 percent. Agusta was one of only three Down syndrome babies born there in 2009. Iceland could have moved one-third of the way to its goal if only Agusta had been detected and eliminated. Agusta’s mother is glad the screening failed in her case.”

       My brother has downs syndrome, and it sickens me that the right wing has taken to using people like him as a bludgeoning tool in the abortion debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once somebody is born with downs syndrome, they should be able to lead a happy and as close to normal life as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they detect ANY significant birth defect well enough in advance, the parents shouldn't be expected to bring that pregnancy to term and create a person that will suffer from an affliction or a condition unnecessarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using people that have already been born, that have downs syndrome, to evoke sympathy for
       <em>
        potential
       </em>
       people with downs syndrome,
       <em>
        that haven't even been conceived or born yet
       </em>
       , is disingenuous.

       I have a brother on the Spectrum and t sickens me to the core, and all but destroys my faith in humanity, that any quasi-reasonable person could argue that terminating a life is preferable to suffering any sort of condition. It’s absolutely disgusting, and not all that far removed from Hitler and his cronies wanting to kill people who “suffered” from the condition of being Jewish. What you’re arguing when you “detect it early and stamp it out” is eugenics, simple and plain.

       Okay, instead of going around in circles in this conversation, let's agree that the thing we ACTUALLY disagree on is whether early abortion really is "terminating a life" or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you understand that I
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       believe early abortion is "terminating a life", you can probably imagine that comparing me to Hitler and my beliefs to eugenics is a little bit of a non-starter.

       Not from tyranny. It is literally a contradiction. If a government is tyrannical, then you have no right to defend yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I think its tyrannical that the government tells me I cant smoke weed. I truly do. Why does the government have the power to tell me that with the penalty of locking me in a cage? Now lets say the FBI or DEA or whatever raided my house and found alot of drugs. They attempt to arrest me and my family so I use my "2nd amendment right" to fight against the tyrannical government. Its pretty easy to imagine what would happen to me in this scenario.

      <p>
       This is why the "protect yourself from a tyrannical government" argument is bullshit

       Huh? You essentially said nobody is trying to reduce rights. Just open your ears and you will hear the talking heads and students from Parkland trying to stop people from owning certain items. "They" range from people speaking their minds on cnn, to signs protestors were carrying for the march, to the stated goals of organizations such as Everytown, to Diane Fienstien saying that the stated goal is to have "Mr and Mrs America" "turn in their guns". Or maybe the gun laws that were introduced to ban and confiscate semi-automatic rifles? Do the new state minimum age laws not reduce the rights or US citizens who are 18-21 years old?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me which one of those example you can't Google yourself. How can you possibly be aware of the current political climate and say nobody is trying to reduce rights?

       What are you talking about? The fact that they don't want to use clear backpacks to show their tampons, or if they want some rights to privacy? Why not make other real suggestions instead of giving one answer and acting like that nothing can exist outside of that? Seems very ignorant, and obviously more like you have an agenda.

       Yes, that is exactly what I am talking about.  Some of the most vocal protesters do not know the difference between a want (non-clear backpacks) and actual acknowledged rights.

       Now, you ask for some suggestions, I ask for what?  The roughly 15,000 gun murders per year?  We can start to worry about that when it becomes more than a five-thousandth of the percentage of deaths in America.

       I agree, to an extent.
This was hotly debated post constitution / pre Bill of Rights. Many thought it would take away from the natural rights if you codified some but not "all". (and look where we are now).
Just I don't think it is a second amendment violation to disallow firearms in schools, I also do not believe it's a forth amendment violation to disallow certain items. Do you feel it would be a rights violation to say no one can bring backpacks into the school?

       Minors don't have the rights afforded to adults, so the easy answer is that no it is not a rights violation because they are minors.

       I don't really know, though.  I'm not an expert on the 4th Amendment.  My thought is that the examples you mention are indeed violations of those amendments.

       My stance softens quite a bit when on public or other's property. I feel you have absolute rights at you home (ie, full auto, sbr, surpressor, etc). But when you step into public I bit of those rights are waived as a member of society.

       HIPAA, for example, is an attempt at enacting a generalized protect for medical data.  However, I believe we have a generalized right to privacy which is largely unrecognized at the moment.

       Now in the specific case of schools, the students are minors and I suppose one could attempt to make an argument that this gives some excuse for infringing on their right to privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But generally speaking, mandating public inspection of your personal effects seems to me to be an infringement of the right of protection against unreasonable search.

       Oh I do. And it's hard. Today I challenged him to define militia, regulate, and "the people".
This is exactly why I argue with those that oppose me. To strengthen my counters to him. I know I'll never change an adults mind, but I can try to allow my son to know his beliefs are beliefs and no body truly has the best answer on anything thing.

       Of what? Pictures of people advocating for banning all guns? Sure, I'm sure that you will find some, but many and most (from what I could tell) people at the March were responsible gun owners themselves that simply wanted to make sure that loopholes did not exist. Which students were advocating for banning all guns? What did Hogg suggest exactly that you felt indicated that?

       Well for starters more kids would be alive at Parkland High School. Ultimately we'll never know how much good it will do. You can't count things that didn't happen. 15-100(?) People die in mass shootings by rifles every year. Where do you draw the line? How many people need to die before you consider it important? It may be inconsequential to the vast majority of Americans, but to those unlucky few it means everything. So yes, I consider those 15-100 people's right to not get shot by a rifle more important than your "right" to own a semi-automatic rifle with a large magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is claiming that gun control will stop every shooting. Violence will continue with or without guns. That doesn't mean steps shouldn't be taken to prevent it.

Why? It doesn't make much different if you use a 9mm vs a 7.62 against unarmed civilians.
And changing mags takes seconds. Besides, one can always hack it since it's a really simple design.
       </p>
       <p>
        That doesn't mean steps shouldn't be taken to prevent it.
So you are imposing a restriction on everybody while knowing that it won't make any difference.
Can't you instead go for a solution that could have a positive effect? Like banning all guns to the mentally ill and ppl who had social problems?
Of course you can't, because you really only care to smear the Trump administration and cancer the right to bear arms for everyone!

Same for bumpstocks (which are toys for kids, no use whatsoever).
Oh, and all of a sudden, YT and Reddit banning weapons from their content is also fascist and useless, other than ruining a dying platform even more.

       If a series of events selectively, exclusively, repeatably affects kids, it's hard to talk about those events without bringing the kids into the conversation. It'd be cool if they weren't being murdered at school, though.

       "pretty obvious" is an opinion.  If you present me with some solid evidence supporting your assertion, I would be happy to do so.  Nothing I've seen thus far has been very convincing--based on what I've seen, my sense is that increased regulation of firearms is a goal shared by many American teenagers, and that those teenagers are allying themselves with likeminded adults, and thus a loose "movement" in support of that goal has emerged.

       It is 1000% backed by proponents of firearms regulation, and not even "behind the scenes".  Some kids got fired up about this issue after seeing their friends get killed, the issue resonated with some other kinds (including some who probably just wanted to skip class--but not all), and then some likeminded adults joined up with them and lent them resources and a platform.  No conspiracy there, and nothing wrong with it. No movement starts or grows in a vacuum.

       The kids we're hearing from didn't see anyone die. The kids who did but who don't have the "politically correct" opinion have been silenced and/or ignored by MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's blatantly obvious to any unbiased individual (which I am, whether you feel I sound like it or not – I'm a bleeding heart liberal who has never even shot a gun and didn't know what AR stood for until last year) that these kids are being used to further a political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt they believe what they say. And I do believe every person should have a platform to espouse their beliefs. But these kids have been cherrypicked by those who have the most to gain from a political fight on the 2nd Amendment.

       Is this a conversation our country needs to have?

       Sure. Of course. But it's disingenuous to pretend like these kids are up there just speaking from the heart. They are being coached. They are being
       <em>
        groomed
       </em>
       . They and their political handlers are capitalizing on a tragedy that is more personal to others than it is to them in order to further a political agenda.

        intentionally
       </em>
       shutting down the conversation by using children to speak for them.

       Hell, there are people on the other side at that DC march holding up signs in disagreement (vulgar though they may be) and they are being publicly targeted and shamed with the intention of
       <em>
        SHUTTING DOWN ALL DISCOURSE

       Times have changed, indeed.  I remember as a kid in elementary school &amp; middle school the only thing we had to worry about was the occasional bully thumping our ears and the only drills were for tornadoes. That was a little over 20 years ago for me.

       I think for some, they feel it’s okay to criticize them because they are overstating their experience of the shooting. For example, David Hogg was in no danger at any point and you can tell this from his videos
       <em>
        during
       </em>
       the shooting.

       Right? It's just like all those phony 9/11 'victims' who were in no immediate danger during the attack but who still claim to be 'scarred' by the experience. So what if you live in the same city? If you weren't breathing the ashes of the dead you're obviously fine!

       I'm talking about folks who lived in New York but were nowhere near the attack. Some of them shot video at the time, too. Would you tell those people that they had no right to feel disturbed? Or to express their opinions of the attack politically?

       This idea that you can't be legitimately affected by an event unless you were at ground zero and/or crying in the fetal position is weak nonsense. Give it up.

       It has nothing to do with not being legitimately affected by a tragedy. It has to do with taking advantage of that tragedy to benefit personally (like David Hogg) or using the victims of that tragedy to further a political agenda.

       Agree. Is it really so scary to realize that the human beings who will take over the planet after you are dead and gone are going to radically alter it to the point where the threat of violence will not be the leverage upon which social interaction is based? Apparently it is for some.

       I agree if this is talking about the protests in the USA about gun violence. I was politically active from the age of 14 as my government had been meddling with student finance. I was kettled by the police back in 2010 when I was 15. I learned at this age that my government does not care for me and that society will not stand up, only for themselves. As austerity has dragged on in Britain, as the first canaries in the coal mine, everyone is still complacent to the neoliberal disaster which is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Children can be political, (12-18), don't doubt this for a second. My parents opposed me protesting but I lied to them so I was let out. Young people are capable of critical thinking and as adults we need to nurture it, not insult their capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The really outrageous use of children is in war propaganda, e.g.
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony">
        Naimyirah Testimony
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2015/09/04/deceivers-western-complicity-in-tragic-death-of-drowned-syrian-boy/">

        Omran, Boy of Aleppo
       </a>
       to say the least. They get used to justify actions which causes suffering to 100'000's + children that do not get photographed, just called "collateral damage" for western interests.

       Back in the day when everyone was worried about FEMA camps and marshal law the one thing that made me know everything would be okay is that our military is made up of people who live here and have family and friends here.

       They would never do something to their own country that they wouldn't do to themselves, their family, and their closest friends.

       As you were typing "with no outside influence from adults?" was there a moment where you paused and thought, "as far as strawman arguments go, this one might be a little bit too obvious, I mean I'm 100% putting words in his mouth, maybe I shouldn't say this" or are you just cynical enough for that to not even register with you anymore?

       Yes they are- the law for the vast vast isn’t some switch where you’re either a “super good law dude” or a “baddy Wild West outlaw”. Some folks speed. Some folks speed and smoke pot. Some folks follow the letter of the law except commit massive securities fraud. Some folks follow the law but one time get into a heated fucking argument and at that particular moment grab for the most deadly weapon available. Clearly laws often work as a deterrent, even to people who may otherwise break other laws.

       That would be bad if it happened, but so far it hasn't been a problem in those states which allow teachers to carry firearms.  So I don't know why it would suddenly become a problem when it has not been a problem thus far.

       Solving gun violence in schools isn't going to be accomplished by throwing

       guns at the problem, just like eating more peanuts isn't the solution to helping you when you have an allergic reaction to peanuts.

       Sure, from a practical perspective it can be. Try arguing with a flat earther then tell me whether it was worth your time.

       If you really can’t see how obvious it is I can’t help you. Conspiracy never used to have mainstream media, pro government pro authoritarian top comments like it does now.

       You still didn't address the point. Just because there are people here who disagree with your views on the government doesn't mean a "coordinated brigading effort" is underway.

       If somebody believes in the conspiracy theory that George Bush did 9/11, but they are happy with the gun control and public healthcare system in their country, where are they supposed to go? If somebody believes there's an internal right wing conspiracy to dismantle public welfare systems in an effort to create a permanently wage-slavery-dependent population, where should they go? Or are conspiracy theories only for right wingers?

       Conspiracy theories are here for anyone willing to believe in conspiracies. Regardless of political belief, pushing pro government rhetoric should be highly frowned upon. Not my fault those on the far left push pro establishment views when it comes to gun control.

       This is what the right wing believes. This is not the view of 100% of people who believe in conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       People on the left believe that bad people have done bad things while in government offices, but that doesn't mean that there shouldn't be a government. You can't claim that people who are into conspiracy theories should be anti-government and that conspiracy theories aren't just for right wingers, because those are two contradictory ideas.

       You don’t have to be completely anti government. I just find it ridiculous the people in a conspiracy forum pushing for more government regulation and control. Like that hasn’t gone wrong before.

       Also the narrative in r/conspiracy was never this pro establishment government. The amount of r/politics users here is even more obvious then when the influx of TD users came in 2016.

       Children are not fit to decide on their own about everything. Having an opinion and having power to change are two entirely different things. They have not seen the world and have no life experience. Much of their knowledge is what they are told and learn from others. They are prone to false impression and at young age are fighting to find their own ideology and standards. Let children be children and leave decisions to adults.

       Life lived long enough to experience majority of situations that one can face in a society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Children do not understand what socio-political issues made specific laws as they are. They are not educated enough by life. Let children be children who are guided into right paths by mature adults guided by elderly who collectively have faced enough to share their wisdom. That is why even in primitive societies elderly were held in high regards and consulted in serious matters.

       Taking away guns will not solve anything. It's not like countries where guns are restricted crimes by gun doesn't happen. It's a socio-cultural problem. You take away guns knife will take its place. Guns from black market will surface. Cars,trucks and bombs will be used. Deranged people will make use of anything if they want to harm.

       What is this bullshit? Laws and societal norms were made to enrich the elite at the expense of the commoner. A lot of the conspiracy theories that get bandied about today, many of us figured out in high school. I knew that the Fed controlling our cash flow without our currency being backed by anything but fairy dust was going to be a bad deal. We did a research project that basically proved that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't just acting as a lone wolf back in 2002 for high school. Hell, some adults are flat idiots. You don't get an honor of distinction just for being old.

       So much of this is completely subjective though.  There's countless examples of the pitfalls and shortcomings of societies being guided by "mature adults" whose life experience has made them cynical or callous or uncaring.

       I agree it's a socio-cultural problem.  It's so socio-cultural that we can't even discuss it apparently - any attempts at even restrictions of guns are blocked out by a variety of tactics, including saying "why bother doing anything at all, people will still die regardless", which entitely misses the point, intentionally I believe.  Be it at the public discourse level or at the political decision making level (where research into gun violence has been blocked for decades).  The right has effectively made any discussion on guns a non-starter for years

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Just checked, it does vary and most states require &gt;18+ unless you're an exception. Rural Minnesota sells &gt;to 14+ without parental consent, then in 5 other &gt;states you are able to buy a gun at 16+, 4 of them &gt;allowing you to buy rifles.

       It's not that these children are going to have a direct say in gun law, they will have to wait til they're 18 to vote on any issue. It's that they are inspiring talk and debate on a topic in which they are very heavily involved in. Some people have a problem with this, and I really don't see why.

       For me it's mostly that every adult knows they were idiots when they were younger. I'm fine with letting them do their own thing as an after school hobby. I'm not ok with the media clearly picking sides to push their own agenda. Especially when these same outlets will be calling kids clueless idiots the moment the next time pod fiasco begins or they start talking about subjects they don't want heard.

       What about inner city schools that are violent and disruptive to what you just stated? Or are those just glossed over because they're not high-profile enough?
       <br/>
       I live in a bad neighborhood. My male roommate was gone all weekend. You bet we have guns, and not for no reason. We've had people come up on our property threatening us just because we tell their kids to stop throwing things at our dog. We look out our back window into the alley and see people having sex in their cars, using that space to drop off/strip stolen cars, do drugs, etc. 
Sorry, but the laws on the books need to be enforced and kids in schools that are disruptive need to be disciplined, not coddled because they're the wrong skin color and their parents will sue the schools for racism.

       Impressive how you can use "literally" to qualify a "vague concept" (subjective)  that is supposedly "universal" (subjective) and, of course, "reasonable" (subjective) so as to discount my LITERAL RIGHT to KEEP AND BEAR ARMS which is REASONABLE seeing as how the SECOND amendment guarantees the FIRST, being among the TEN amendments we call the BILL OF RIGHTS which does not GRANT rights, it PROTECTS our rights from the Government's interference.

       It’s insane how much the media has used these kids to push an agenda for more gun control. First articles advocating for being able to vote at 16 years old, now this. I’d bet not one of these kids would have the smarts to articulate how we should go about gun control.

       More people die from handguns than rifles. This is how the government works they chip a little bit slowly. First it’s a magazine ban then it’s an “assault rifle” ban. Pretty soon “semi automatic weapon ban” and wouldn’t you know it pistols are semi automatic! That’s a scary word let’s ban them too!

       Almost universally, you can find people who will push for more, so this means we can use that argument to oppose almost any change. It's a fallacy used to avoid actual meaningful debate on what changes are appropriate.

       Stop viewing it as "giving an inch" and start viewing it as "let's talk about what's best for the country." it's not about "listening" to anyone about how far they want to go, it is about listening to and judging the merits of an argument.

       There are sides on this issue. Not because there should be but because one side is drawing a line (the protesters in DC made that very clear). You're on "their" side. I'm on the other (and I'm a non-gun-owning liberal lol).

       It sucks that your side wants to start by banning bump stocks and use that as a means to banning many other weapons and (their hope) to repeal the 2nd amendment.

       I mean, go ahead and state your argument if you want. But you did not come at me as if you wanted a one-on-one discussion on this issue. We're talking about a national debate... which has been stifled because we've been forced to pick sides and one side (the left) is attempting to silence the voice of the other.

       Look at your first response to me. If you were so concerned about talking solely about using children to push the political agenda, why did you harp on and on about defending the slippery slope fallacy, until it was obvious you had lost that point, before effectively saying "well, this isn't about the topic at hand"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it is harder to admit you were wrong on the point than it is to try and pretend you were actually talking about something else, but the only person you might fool here with that is you.

       Go ahead and tell me how the fuck I “lost the slipper slope argument.” Wtf are you talking about? I’ve granted you the opportunity numerous times to state your argument if that’s what you wish to do. But I’ve never admitted to whatever imaginary loss you’re dreaming up. You just wanna distract from the point of OP’s entire fucking post.

       Interesting narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       To clarify, I didn't mention banning assault rifles, I just think there should be more accountability for gun owners in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has a problem that no other developed country has, so I think there are some things we can learn from them to work on the way we approach ownership of weapons. We're not tasked with doing something new.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone can objectively look at our situation with full understanding and say that the current state of things is okay. Something has to happen, but a ban obviously isn't the solution.

       Not sure, but it's shameful that everyone seems to have this figured out except us. Most important thing is to get leadership from both sides onboard with working toward something that is on par with the countries we would like to be more like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the same about healthcare - we essentially are able to leverage "second mover advantage" to emulate the most efficient systems that currently exist in the world. That or we can keep bringing up the same solutions that have been pitched endlessly for the last 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       My biggest criticism of this country is that we're so convinced that we're superior to everyone in every way that we're unable to learn from anyone else or be inspired by other countries. To me that lack of inspiration is what's leading to overall decline.

       We should start by actually enforcing the laws that we have on the books.  LEOs aren't being held accountable for their failures in enforcing law, and in turn the conversation instead switches to gun control.

       Correct me if I'm wrong, but can't a 16 year old own a gun in America? If they're responsible enough to own something as dangerous as a firearm, how are they not able to debate the legislation regarding it?

       Just checked, it does vary and most states require 18+ unless you're an exception. Rural Minnesota sells to 14+ without parental consent, then in 5 other states you are able to buy a gun at 16+, 4 of them allowing you to buy rifles. Even if it's 18 and over, that's close enough to 16 that you should be allowed to have an opinion on the matter.

       Why would you bet that? A teenager cannot be educated on an issue in which they’re passionate about? To degree in which it is a problem in America, gun violence isn’t rocket science. We have an ever loving shitload of guns, available to anybody who wants one and, remarkably, often that goes poorly. It’s a pretty good start to say strategically and intelligently lowering those numbers and availability would help- as it does literally everywhere on planet earth.

       Yes, my source is common sense.  What is your source that says these kids are protesting by their own free-will?  Do you really think those kids stopped buying Tide-pods long enough to pay for all those buses to get them there?

       This is typical of the Left to require a source like the NYTimes to tell them exact what &amp; how to think instead of using their own common sense.  I said, "it doesn't take a rocket scientist" but I guess it does takes someone with an IQ higher than a Leftist.  Apparently.

       The problem is pretty simple.. You say "I thought critically and I come to conclusion A" someone else say "I thought critically and came to conclusion B".. Who's right? This is why sources matter.

       okay, so this is the talking point among right-wing reactionaries, yet what is the proof? also, i think it's a little delusional to claim that these protests are part of some grand hollywood scheme to outlaw guns. like, if you take 1 second to look at the organizer's platform, you can see its pretty watered down, centerist bs.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, why does their matter? and who is saying its a gold standard? like, these teenagers are protesting something they feel passionately about and all people can say is basically "shut up you're too young to know anything" honestly, if you want some kind of real change to happen, it needs to be cohesive, and obviously middle-aged dolts are supper reactionary. your cynicism is saddening.

       Just because it's the reality doesn't exactly make it a talking point. This is a conclusion I came to on my own as did many others. If these politicians want to attack the 2nd amendment, grow some balls and go after it. They won't though, because it's political suicide. But you know what isn't? Giving teenagers a pat on the back for doing just that. It's so transparent it's sickening.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the 'gold standard' because it's how the left is able to attack guns while more or less keeping their hands clean. They aren't attacking guns, they're supporting kids! I don't want them to shut up, I want the media to stop putting them on a pedestal when just 2 months go they were worried they were going to commit genocide with tide pods.

       you keep talking about them "attacking" the 2nd amendment. how long are you guys gonna keep banging that drum for? in what world has the government, since sandy hook and even before, done ANYTHING to guns?  this gun-owner victim fetish is ridiculous because in the real world, nothing is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       teenagers, and let's not forget millions of other adults, are protesting to stop the deaths of other kids and other americans, and yet all you people can do is say "THE HOLLYWEIRD ELITES ARE USING THEM AS PAWNS! BAHHH THEY'RE COMING FOR OUR GUUNSS! IM SERIOUS THIS TIME!"
      </p>
      <p>
       yet, nothing happens, and you keep playing right into the NRA's hands. you guys are so dense you can't even see how the NRA is exploiting your rambo cosplay fantasy towards their own end: making money and buying politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       get over your victim complex and see the reality: if these kids were protesting against gun control, you would be fine with it being kids and you'd see nothing wrong with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       just admit that all the genuflecting is a long winded rant against something you don't like, not against the fact that they're "kids" -- tho i reject the idea that  the age of someone discounts they're ability to have an individual opinion.

       No my opinion would not change in the slightest. Kids are retards, I don't want the media putting them in front of any side an issue of this scale. Again, this is the same group of people the entire media chased for a straight month over fucking tide pods. You cannot in one breath warn every parent in the United States that their kids might eat a pod of laundry detergent and then in the following breath call that same group of people the most insightful generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me this is less about the gun debate and more about how the media is yet again playing sides and changing narratives when it suits their goals.

       Falsi uck you if you create meme magic bullshit to sew hatred against a kid and use that to push your agenda.
Photoshopping the constitution is lame enough but they squashed and contrasted her face, darkened her eyes and widened her nose. Subltoe enough that you wouldn't notice without the real pic. That's more than an anti gun control agenda.

       Anyone who has spent any amount of time working with teenagers as an adult finds the idea of them being the intellectual or moral compass of our nation completely ridiculous. Teenagers are irrational, emotionally driven, and programmed through mass schooling to fall in line with whatever is the popular opinion of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically if you think that using teenagers to convince anyone besides other teenagers to change their minds on guns is a good strategy I have a beautiful ocean front property I'd love to sell you, here in Kansas.

       As a teenager I was never interested in politics, so I admire the trend and hope it continues into their adult years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you that teens are in many ways inferior to adults, but at the same time our current generation of teens are more well-informed than any generation before them.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this being an issue that directly impacts many of them, I find that it makes sense for them to vocalize their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't feel like they're trying to change people's minds on guns. I feel like they're trying to direct attention toward this issue that loads of people are dying and nothing seems to be done about it, no matter how many times it happens.

       What do you base this on? Don't just say the internet. Having access to the internet is not the same as being informed. Again, youthful exuberance and optimism is great, but the truth is mass schooling is indoctrination and programming. The further out you get from that indoctrination the more you will understand.

       You don't agree that technology has helped enable us all, even teens, to become well informed? Some of the most profound things I know came from YouTube, Wikipedia, and Coursera.

       It seems like you're saying that because violent incidents imply we should make changes you may not be in favor of, those incidents are a farce. Does that sound right?

       No I did not say anything close to that. Also it takes time to find correct info on a tool like YouTube/internet at large (it is large).

       Conspiracy theories are ignored precisely because there is so much utter shit out there. I do not think a 16 year old, or an 18 year old without proper guidance can find the truth because our schooling actively works against the development of reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The development of your ability to reason, and think critically for yourself is crucial to your ability to decipher truth from lies, emotional manipulation from sound rational evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until you have worked to develop your critical thinking skills (learned to think entirely for yourself) you like most everyone else will be unable to have even the most tenuous grasp on reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth remains that it is the mark of an intelligent mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. Most people won't even look at anything that disagrees with their worldview, and those who do come only to mock that which they do not understand.

       Most people don’t realize how bad it is. You’re in a conspiracy forum so awareness is higher here. I think if the nation at large understood how many of our rights have already been infringed, they wouldn’t be so eager to support stripping the 2nd Amendment.

       Their “free speech” is going in the same direction as ours now. The state has been suppressing free speech and freedom of the press through press clubs that guarantee that the State is in control of the narrative.

       just admit you're mad online about kids saying something you don't like. stop trying to make it out like some grand intellectual point, not the grandpa yelling from his porch like it is.

       The interesting ironic part about this tactic being used, along with the Nazi rhetoric is the use of politicalized children. Its a page directly out of the Nazi playbook. Welcome everyone to Hitler's Youth 2.0 (now with WiFi)

       Do you honestly believe that these kids, with the support of some democrats, holding a rally devoted to a single issue, is the same as the Hitler Youth program?

       Or do you just enjoy comparing things to Hitler, knowing that since you're doing it to left wingers nobody is going to mock you for it (like when right wingera mock liberals who compare Trump to Hitler?)

       Any kid under 18 being used politically on either side is suspect since their being manipulated doesn't matter if its right, left or upside down. Kids don't belong being political side shows. Let them privately grieve and adults should do a better job of protecting them regardless of which side they are on.

       Some are.  Some aren't.  Personally I have a great deal of respect for the folks who have a consistent pro-life stance:  no death penalty, no abortion, no guns.  (That is, I respect them even though I'm not one of them--I have more nuanced positions on each of those issues).

       My niece and nephew marched. Unless they are cleverly hiding something from their uncle, the only agenda I saw was them wanting to feel safe in school. No one is using them. Their generation is finding their voice and they are learning to use it. I'm proud of them.

       The fact that an organization stepped in to help, doesn't delegitimize their movement. They asked my sister to take time off of work and to take them to D.C. It was not her idea. It was not mine, it was theirs. She's a good parent, providing the resources for them to exercise the first Amendment rights.

       What difference does it make who pulled the permit?  If a high school football team is awesome and wins their game, do we say they don't deserve the credit and question their passion for the sport on the basis that adults built the stadium and paid for the lights to be turned on?

       These kids are protesting the very object that they should rely on to defend their-selves and their liberty.

       Millions of innocent people have died in the Iraq Afghanistan war, if they want to protest something, protest that.

       Not the fucking object that was half the reason our forefathers fought a war over, the right to bare arms.

       Of all the things to protest over, of course it would be something that has a 1 in a billion chance of happening to them, as long as they dont see dying people across the world, why would any of them every give a flying fuck it doesnt have a direct impact in their lives.

       I can assure the average teen doesn't know anything about a "gun loophole" or NICS databases. Maybe they recognize the words now they hear the talking heads on TV repeat it over and over, but these are not things you discuss organically as a teenager. They are doing this because at this very moment, it is the "cool" thing to do. As I can recall from being one, teens do not have a good perspective on the long term, and have NO real understanding of what the long term repercussions may be for trying to alter a Constitutional Right.

       This is not about being "anti Second Amendment".  It is about calling for regulations that are permitted within the context and scope of the Second Amendment.

       So you just admitted those laws are already in place. Would you admit that if they restricted everything but muskets that would be a violation of the second amendment? An AR 15 is a semi automatic weapon. 90% or more of the weapons sold are semi automatic. The police do not use revolvers because long ago they were deemed insufficient. The new billHR 5087 bans lever action weapons!!! This is not gun control, it is an attack on the second amendment disguised as a " dangerous gun" ban.

       I didn't "admit" anything; I merely pointed out that the Supreme Court has indicated that certain kinds of restrictions on gun ownership are Constitutional--meaning that some additional ones can be implemented without infringing on the rights articulated by the Second Amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "everything but muskets" thing is also resolved with a fair amount of finality in
       <em>
        Heller
       </em>
       , where Scalia sets forth the boundaries of the Second Amendment rights as it pertains to
       <em>
        type
       </em>
       of weapons permitted by the Constitution.  In essence, he summarizes a long line of jurisprudence that says that the Second Amendment limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no, I don't think a blanket ban on semi-automatic firearms would be constitutional (in point of fact, I am legally carrying a concealed semi-automatic handgun at this very moment).

       So what's the difference with an AR 15. Exactly the same thing. Semi automatic no difference. Your handgun kills far more people every year but your fine with that. The Virginia school shooter used your weapon to kill 30. You need to give up your gun.

       Literally nobody--other than you--has said a single thing about HR 5087.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that there can and should be modest, Constitutional, and common-sense regulation of dangerous articles--that gun owner/operators should be subject to similar regulations as other participants in dangerous activities:  training, background checks, registration, and limitations on the kinds of equipment non-professionals can have in their possession.

       The current regulations in these areas--to the extent they exist at all--are a complete joke and must be strengthened.  There are zero requirements for background checks or registration if I want to purchase a high-capacity, high-caliber semiautomatic rifle in a private transaction. My concealed carry license "training" and evaluations could have been passed by a Neanderthal.  Better regulations and better implementation are imperative.

       From a legal system standpoint, sure. They are the top level of a hierarchy and that's it. They have no special ability of judgement and infact show a complete lack of it with a regular basis. It's almost like the ruling that police have no duty to protect is what started the latest gun control debate in the first place. Weird how that works.

       They are certainly not perfect, but with the exception of Justice Thomas, they are all exceedingly intelligent people who have committed their entire adult lives to the study and analysis of extremely complex legal matters.  So yeah, they do have a "special ability of judgment" which I respect even when I'm displeased with the outcome of cases that go before them (again, with the exception of Justice Thomas, who is about as intelligent and intellectually curious as a toad).
      </p>
      <p>
       But even putting that aside, under our Constitution, their position at the top of the hierarchy set out by that document is of paramount importance:  you can disagree with them all you want, but you have to abide with their rules or become an outlaw.
      </p>

       You are of course free to go live somewhere with lower levels of regulation around gun use and ownership, but I suspect you won't find the Central African Republic or Baghdad very hospitable, and Mars has proven really difficult to get to, so...for all practical purposes, the Supreme Court is the last word on the subject for you, brah.

       It's funny how you argue rules of law yet your final arguement is "submit to force or die". Which really sums up what you and your cohorts are really about. Can't let that ounce of control slip away.

       Do you find it weird or offputting that all those supreme court justices you seem to respect and admire all went to Harvard or Yale? Does it bother you that Yale and Harvard alumni are responsible for the needless deaths of hundreds of millions? How good of a judgement do you have if you can't help but associate with subhuman murderers? I guess when it comes down to it the law only applies to the wealthy.

       Where did I even remotely suggest that the only options are to "submit to force or die"?  At most I said that you must submit to the law or become a criminal, which is of course an inescapable fact.

       I don't really know where to start on your second point (to the extent there
       <em>
        is

       a coherent point in that mishmash of words). But I'll try:

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         I will admit that I know a
         <em>
          ton
         </em>
         of people who went to Harvard and Yale, but to the best of my knowledge none of them has
         <em>
          ever
         </em>
         killed anyone.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I do think that I'd rather have the body responsible for interpreting the law be made up of people who have committed their lives to studying the law rather than random people off the streets.  Even better if they were guided in that study by previous generations of smart people who committed
         <em>
          their
         </em>
         lives to the study of the law.

       <li>
        <p>
         as to your final sentence, I agree 100% that the law applies to the wealthy, as you point out.  But I would also argue that day-to-day life shows that it applies with equal force--if not more force--to the average or underprivileged.

       Sure, it must be the fault of guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       It couldn't have anything to do with:
1)The police standing down, actively allowing the shooter to go on a spree.
2)The FBI stood down, the shooter was already known to the government as a potential threat.
3)Another SSRI-connected mass killing. The media can't talk about those because they are the largest paid advertisers and the politicians can't talk about them because they are some of the highest donors to campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns are the easy red-herring, to emasculate the population and to keep them under control.

       All of the things you mentioned are potential contributing factors and should be examined.  The lack of sensible regulation around gun ownership and use--
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a "ban", mind you--is another factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people, including some kids, are pushing for that factor to be addressed because they feel strongly about it.  Just as you are free to prioritize action around the other factors you described.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, this argument around "emasculating the population" and keeping us under control is the real red herring in this debate.  If the United States government, with its immense firepower, manpower, intelligence apparatus, wanted to take all of us gun owners out, they could do so in a heartbeat.  No amount of armchair John Wayne "pew pew pew" with our pissant 1911s and AR-15s would stop the strongest military and law enforcement complex in the history of mankind.

       The numbers don't work out in the establishment's favor. Only a couple million active soldiers versus 50 million gun owners, not even taking in to account that most of the military would refuse to take down their own citizenry.

       Guns are the easiest right to attack because they have a "fear-factor" associated with them. If we willingly give away most of our 2nd amendment rights, how does that look when people want to start attacking our other constitutional rights?

       Your opinion, while correct, is sadly very unpopular nowadays. It's just so much easier to claim people who disagree with you are "paid bots" or shills and just throw whatever noncoherent shit around without any explanation. Classic Reddit.

       It's pretty amusing that, in the end, they couldn't even get the college kids to fully buy their bullshit.
       <br/>
       They had to drop down to grade school children who have no clue whatsoever how the world works; no clue that their government has been hijacked by murderous psychopaths who stage shootings &amp; terrorist attacks to accelerate the conversion of the U.S. to a corporate police state.

       No.  You can only have an opinion if you're over the age of 18.  The one exception is that if you are under 18 and get shot and killed; in that case you are permitted an opinion, but to date all such minors have been silent on the issue of gun control.

       It’s protected under the Constitution as a result of equal protection not federally legalized.  Huge difference. Before the Supreme Court made a decision states passed laws banning gay marriage and used the argument of “protect our children” to get those laws to pass.

       The Supreme Court had to specify that gay marriage was legal under the equal protection clause.  There is no law or amendment that specifically says gay marriage is legal, there is the equal protection clause which says that all citizens must be treated equally under the law and have their rights to legal due process.  So in the absence of legislation that specified gay marriage, states had the latitude to make laws.  They passed those laws, they got challenged as unconstiutional since they treated gay citizens different than married citizens, and since marriage is a legal institution recognized by the state falls under legal due process.  So denying gay citizens the right to marriage violated their equal protection and due process rights.  The Supreme Court agreed those laws violated their rights as citizens and that rendered state and federal laws that sought to discriminate against gay citizens to be unconstitutional.

       How is this even a relevant conspiracy post? No intelligent submission, just a profanity laden opinion. You’re entitled to your opinion yes, but so are the kids who are tired of being killed at school, which I can only assume is the reason for this post because you don’t even offer that much of an explanation. If you think that their participation in protests is a conspiracy lay out some solid facts and present them in a way that doesn’t ignore that 1 -teens are supposed to rebel against society, it’s what teens have always done, and 2- teens also express opinions for and against abortion, immigration laws, religious freedom, drug legalization etc etc etc.

       I think it's safe to say that any kid who is tired of being killed at school is part of something much larger.  ...Like human cloning or vampires.

       It's pretty amusing that, in the end, they couldn't even get the college kids to fully buy their bullshit.
       <br/>
       They had to drop down to grade school children who have no clue whatsoever how the world works; no clue that their government has been hijacked by murderous psychopaths who stage shootings &amp; terrorist attacks to accelerate the conversion of the U.S. to a corporate police state.

       Maybe uhh the children that escaped the massacre feel compelled to act. And uhh maybe they’re being misguided by organizations, but nonetheless these kids want to really change something. And I don’t think they really know what they want to change but ya know uhh banning guns is just the first thing people latch onto as a panacea.

       Children are not fit to decide on their own about everything. Having an opinion and having power to change are two entirely different things. They have not seen the world and have no life experience. Much of their knowledge is what they are told and learn from others. They are prone to false impression and at young age are fighting to find their own ideology and standards. Let children be children and leave decisions to adults.

       What about inner city schools that are violent and disruptive to what you just stated? Or are those just glossed over because they're not high-profile enough?
       <br/>
       I live in a bad neighborhood. My male roommate was gone all weekend. You bet we have guns, and not for no reason. We've had people come up on our property threatening us just because we tell their kids to stop throwing things at our dog. We look out our back window into the alley and see people having sex in their cars, using that space to drop off/strip stolen cars, do drugs, etc. 
Sorry, but the laws on the books need to be enforced and kids in schools that are disruptive need to be disciplined, not coddled because they're the wrong skin color and their parents will sue the schools for racism.

       Most people don’t realize how bad it is. You’re in a conspiracy forum so awareness is higher here. I think if the nation at large understood how many of our rights have already been infringed, they wouldn’t be so eager to support stripping the 2nd Amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1st Amendment is Freedom of Speech. We’re the only nation in the world that guarantees that right. Why? The 2nd Amendment.

       I will and regularly do. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, and then Trump and blue team for every other option in the general, weren't any third parties that I saw to choose from outside the presidential ticket. Trump sucked nuts and lied to us, not entirely surprisingly. It's not impossible he will still do something good, but I am not going to hold my breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want candidates with integrity. That is part of the justification for me saying Trump sucked. He made it obvious he wasn't going to drain the swamp before he even swore in. Bernie Sanders is at least mostly consistent, harps on billionaires (who, imo, got us into this mess), and seems to have more integrity than any of the other options. Ron Paul is the only other presidential candidate I've ever seen with a measure of integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we had politicians who were held accountable for their actions and had integrity, the political process would be working. Alas, we do not, and the media on either side makes claims like "red team bad, blue team good!" and conversely "blue team bad, red team good!" dividing the population on imaginary lines when virtually everyone wants the same things, and virtually none of our politicians are even trying to get us those things.
