<p>I will and regularly do. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, and then Trump and blue team for every other option in the general, weren&#39;t any third parties that I saw to choose from outside the presidential ticket. Trump sucked nuts and lied to us, not entirely surprisingly. It&#39;s not impossible he will still do something good, but I am not going to hold my breath.</p>

<p>I want candidates with integrity. That is part of the justification for me saying Trump sucked. He made it obvious he wasn&#39;t going to drain the swamp before he even swore in. Bernie Sanders is at least mostly consistent, harps on billionaires (who, imo, got us into this mess), and seems to have more integrity than any of the other options. Ron Paul is the only other presidential candidate I&#39;ve ever seen with a measure of integrity. </p>

<p>If we had politicians who were held accountable for their actions and had integrity, the political process would be working. Alas, we do not, and the media on either side makes claims like &quot;red team bad, blue team good!&quot; and conversely &quot;blue team bad, red team good!&quot; dividing the population on imaginary lines when virtually everyone wants the same things, and virtually none of our politicians are even trying to get us those things. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t true, and depending on your beliefs one party definitely IS worse than the other. My parents don&#39;t want transgendered people to be able to use the same bathrooms as them, and I could not care less. Now, I would agree with you if you were to say that this issue was created by politicians as a ruse to keep people divided over shit that doesn&#39;t matter, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t an issue. I mean, those politicians artificially created this issue, but it was still created. There were actual laws passed. You can&#39;t say the party divide in America is pointless, because one party being in power makes different REAL things happen than when the other party is in power. It DOES matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both parties make the military industrial complex richer at the expense of the lives of civilians in countries all over the world, both parties want us to hate each other for things like skin color, sexual orientation, and various sky fairies who will either give us presents if we are good and coal if we are bad, and both parties want to keep us confused, dumb, and misinformed.</p>

<p>Your bathroom point is exactly what I&#39;m talking about. It genuinely does not matter, but the media is making it into a big issue to divide us so we do not work together to topple the oppressors.</p>

<p>This is not to say that there are no politicians with good intentions.  There absolutely are, on both sides, but the majority of politicians on both sides are coopted in one way or another to just maintain the status quo for the billionaire elite. There are Democrats who want to dial back on the military (though not many who vote that way consistently.) There are Republicans who believe that the federal government is overstepping the bounds of the Constitution and believe states rights should be preferred (though not many who vote that way consistently.)</p>

<p>I think even with abortion that people on both sides have some good points, I lean left, but I honestly couldn&#39;t care less while we&#39;re murdering people in the Middle East with bombs that were paid for by money we don&#39;t have at the expense of American taxpayers who don&#39;t want the bombs dropped in the first place.</p>

<p>It&#39;s figuratively a reality TV show and a sleight of hand to keep us distracted while they literally pick our pockets and murder innocent people all around the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re missing my point. The transgender bathroom stuff should NOT be an issue, it literally is a distraction from more important stuff, like you said. But, IT IS HAPPENING. </p>

<p>If somebody is robbing a bank, and then right as they leave the bank they toss a grenade over their should back into the bank, are you supposed to say &quot;well that grenade is obviously just a distraction so that we don&#39;t call the police, I&#39;m just going to ignore it even though it&#39;s about to explode in my face&quot; ? Or do you overcome the grenade &quot;obstacle&quot; and then figure out how to stop the guys from doing it again?</p>

<p>The bathroom bill stuff is the same thing, it shouldn&#39;t have been made to happen, but these laws really were passed. And it affected the real lives of real people. What are we supposed to do, let those people suffer because their lives aren&#39;t the &quot;real issues&quot;?</p>

<p>Okay, so there&#39;s people fighting tribal wars over access to clean water right now. Should we ignore that so we can focus on the real issue of domestic surveillance? Or is domestic surveillance just a distraction from the real issue of perpetual warfare? Or is perpetual warfare the distraction from the real issue of central banking?</p>

<p>The media didn&#39;t make the bathroom stuff into an issue in order to divide people. People where already divided over it, and the media talked about it, for ratings, because they make money when people watch them. My parents wanted those kinds of laws before it was controversial. The media didn&#39;t give them that view. </p>

<p>This appears artificial to me. A discomfort for a few people that was delicately nurtured into an intense hatred. As it became more common for people on TV to express this bigotry, others adopted the feeling.</p>

<p>No, this is all real. Artificially inflated poverty is exacerbating a lot of the contention over shit that doesn&#39;t matter because people think it&#39;s some power they can flex, and they think they will feel better if someone send lesser to them.</p>

<p>People had opinions about &quot;deviants&quot; and the media stirred that shit up for ratings and agenda shaping.</p>

<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not trying to discount your perspective on how things are, but rather, I am explaining my perspective. Experience has led me to believe these things, but it&#39;s fluid, and as I learn more, I readjust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it depends on the proposals, of course.  But my position is that gun owner/operators should be subject to similar regulations as other participants in dangerous activities--private pilots is the example I tend to point to, just because it&#39;s something I know a little about, but there are others.  So, in a nutshell: training, background checks, registration, and limitations on the kinds of equipment non-professionals can have.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Such regulations are <em>modest</em>.  They present a slight burden on those who wish to participate in an activity that presents a heightened danger to the public, but that burden is proportional to the potential for harm.</p></li>
<li><p>Such regulations are <em>Constitutional</em>.  Justice Scalia&#39;s articulation of the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em> does an excellent job of interpreting the Constitutionality of firearms regulation.  It acknowledges that the Second Amendment articulates an <em>inherent</em> and <em>individual</em> right of Americans to bear arms (and let&#39;s face it, anyone who argues otherwise is being pretty disingenuous).  But Scalia famously goes on to acknowledge that this right, like most natural or Constitutional rights, is not unlimited: it is &quot;not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.&quot;  It is not the right to carry &quot;dangerous and unusual weapons&quot;.  And the Court explicitly upheld the Constitutionality of &quot;longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing <em>conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms</em>&quot; (emphasis mine).</p></li>
<li><p>Such regulations are <em>common sense</em>.  Most people would agree--that is, it is <em>commonly</em> held as <em>sensible</em>--that individual citizens should not be permitted to own and operate high-yield nuclear weapons.  Most people would agree that the law should not permit someone like Khalid Shiekh Mohammad or Timothy McVeigh to walk the streets with a Barrett M82.  So it is common sense that <em>some</em> kinds of regulations are called for.  Where people start to disagree, where things start to get messy, is where to draw the line on those regulations.  I would argue that my proposed regulations present the minimal level of regulation possible to ensure that the commonly-held concerns about criminals and nutcases having easy access to firearms and about private ownership of extremely dangerous weapons.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, there you go.  A framework for modest, Constitutional, and common-sense regulation of weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In light of the high ranking pedos in the U.K., I feel like pizza gate hit a nerve with some powerful folk in America. But then I think it was completely co-opted and driven to the point where it seemed ridiculous. </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that the whole pizza parlor thing was probably not true. But there are almost certainly politicians who are pedophiles and I&#39;m betting they&#39;re controlled by our intelligence agencies because that sort of leverage is unbeatable. And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that is why this conspiracy theory went from being seen as plausible to bat shit crazy in no time flat.

<p>Same with the seth rich case.  media outlets repeatedly say things like &quot;debunked&quot; but in reality nothing&#39;s debunked because the case isn&#39;t solved.  </p>

<p>Imagine if Hillary won, and Podesta was among the most powerful people in the country, and then people found out he&#39;s getting invited to take part in satanic rituals.  Or that his brother has an underground theater for viewing &quot;sensitive&quot; materials.  </p>

<p>&quot;making up&quot; email code is one of the fallacies of pg though.  You can go google the cop that recently got arrested looking for cheese pizza on craigslist.  I&#39;m not even into pg per-se.  </p>

<p>I agree that with many of the examples given for code, there are huge leaps.  pizza isn&#39;t one of those leaps though, as it&#39;s been shown to have been around for a long time.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see anybody recognizing the positives that came out of PG.  It brought alot of attention to topics like human trafficking, online predators, cp.  </p>

<p>PG also definitely brought more attention to other thing in specific places on the internet, but everything involving kids has always been a huge scandal once it became public knowledge. The influence on the perception of the general public is pretty insignificant as far as I can see.</p>

<p>And while the name pizzagate does sound silly, the thing is in itself ridiculous when looking at how it developed. I don’t even want to call it a conspiracy theory, because I believe the original inventors knew exactly that they made something up for political reasons.

<blockquote>
<p>Among friends, we all (well those of us who <em>have</em> friends, which I know excludes many pizzagate proponents) we all develop secret codes and terms that make their way into our communications. Sometimes these codes conceal serious or even illegal topics—marital infidelity, say, or recreational cocaine use.  </p>

<p>So when you see someone using such a code, it’s natural to say “hmmm”.  But to jump right to kiddie touching in a pizza joint with no further evidence takes a special kind of dumb and sick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the need for vengeance is ignored then I think pizzagate has actually achieved a goal.  </p>

<p>Given the amount of exposure he&#39;s recieved, Alefanatis certainly isn&#39;t going to be able to do anything he&#39;s been accused of in the future. Too many eyes are on him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s just terribly twisted logic...by your reasoning, we should just accuse everyone we think is a little weird of horrible horrible crimes <em>just in case</em> they <em>might</em> someday consider committing those horrible crimes, and thereby prevent them from doing so.

    <div class="md"><p>I read through all of them. They’re a bit odd, at times, and maybe reflect a secret understanding of some kind among the parties—a sort of “isoculture” of this particular group of powerful people. </p>

<p>But nowhere did I see any evidence pointing to pedophilia, much less pedophilia in a pizza restaurant.  </p>

<p>Among friends, we all (well those of us who <em>have</em> friends, which I know excludes many pizzagate proponents) we all develop secret codes and terms that make their way into our communications. Sometimes these codes conceal serious or even illegal topics—marital infidelity, say, or recreational cocaine use.  </p>

<p>So when you see someone using such a code, it’s natural to say “hmmm”.  But to jump right to kiddie touching in a pizza joint with no further evidence takes a special kind of dumb and sick. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like when stem cell research was banned in the US and the UK because of dumb religious ethical arguments and scare tactics of &quot;playing god&quot; and &quot;designer babies&quot; I remember the scare articles in the paper from when I was really young ignoring the obvious medical benefits.</p>

<p>We are only now starting to see the benefits of stem cell research medically and I ask myself how far behind are we now because of that ban. It&#39;s like when sciences were banned by the RC church and Islam and put as in a one thousand year black hole all because they didn&#39;t want to lose their power. Imagine where we could be now if it wasn&#39;t for these corrupt institutions. </p>

<p>“In Iceland, upward of 85 percent of pregnant women opt for the prenatal testing, which has produced a Down syndrome elimination rate approaching 100 percent. Agusta was one of only three Down syndrome babies born there in 2009. Iceland could have moved one-third of the way to its goal if only Agusta had been detected and eliminated. Agusta’s mother is glad the screening failed in her case.”</p>

<p>Once somebody is born with downs syndrome, they should be able to lead a happy and as close to normal life as possible.</p>

<p>If they detect ANY significant birth defect well enough in advance, the parents shouldn&#39;t be expected to bring that pregnancy to term and create a person that will suffer from an affliction or a condition unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Using people that have already been born, that have downs syndrome, to evoke sympathy for <em>potential</em> people with downs syndrome, <em>that haven&#39;t even been conceived or born yet</em>, is disingenuous. </p>

<p>For example, I think its tyrannical that the government tells me I cant smoke weed. I truly do. Why does the government have the power to tell me that with the penalty of locking me in a cage?

They attempt to arrest me and my family so I use my &quot;2nd amendment right&quot; to fight against the tyrannical government.

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? You essentially said nobody is trying to reduce rights. Just open your ears and you will hear the talking heads and students from Parkland trying to stop people from owning certain items. &quot;They&quot; range from people speaking their minds on cnn, to signs protestors were carrying for the march, to the stated goals of organizations such as Everytown, to Diane Fienstien saying that the stated goal is to have &quot;Mr and Mrs America&quot; &quot;turn in their guns&quot;. Or maybe the gun laws that were introduced to ban and confiscate semi-automatic rifles? Do the new state minimum age laws not reduce the rights or US citizens who are 18-21 years old?</p>

<p>Tell me which one of those example you can&#39;t Google yourself. How can you possibly be aware of the current political climate and say nobody is trying to reduce rights?</p>

<p>Yes, that is exactly what I am talking about.  Some of the most vocal protesters do not know the difference between a want (non-clear backpacks) and actual acknowledged rights.  </p>

<p>Now, you ask for some suggestions, I ask for what?  The roughly 15,000 gun murders per year?  We can start to worry about that when it becomes more than a five-thousandth of the percentage of deaths in America.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, to an extent.
This was hotly debated post constitution / pre Bill of Rights. Many thought it would take away from the natural rights if you codified some but not &quot;all&quot;. (and look where we are now).
Just I don&#39;t think it is a second amendment violation to disallow firearms in schools, I also do not believe it&#39;s a forth amendment violation to disallow certain items. Do you feel it would be a rights violation to say no one can bring backpacks into the school? </p>

<p>Now in the specific case of schools, the students are minors and I suppose one could attempt to make an argument that this gives some excuse for infringing on their right to privacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for starters more kids would be alive at Parkland High School. Ultimately we&#39;ll never know how much good it will do. You can&#39;t count things that didn&#39;t happen. 15-100(?) People die in mass shootings by rifles every year. Where do you draw the line? How many people need to die before you consider it important? It may be inconsequential to the vast majority of Americans, but to those unlucky few it means everything. So yes, I consider those 15-100 people&#39;s right to not get shot by a rifle more important than your &quot;right&quot; to own a semi-automatic rifle with a large magazine.</p>

<p>Nobody is claiming that gun control will stop every shooting. Violence will continue with or without guns. That doesn&#39;t mean steps shouldn&#39;t be taken to prevent it.</p>

Why? It doesn&#39;t make much different if you use a 9mm vs a 7.62 against unarmed civilians.
And changing mags takes seconds. Besides, one can always hack it since it&#39;s a really simple design.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean steps shouldn&#39;t be taken to prevent it.
So you are imposing a restriction on everybody while knowing that it won&#39;t make any difference.
Can&#39;t you instead go for a solution that could have a positive effect? Like banning all guns to the mentally ill and ppl who had social problems?
Of course you can&#39;t, because you really only care to smear the Trump administration and cancer the right to bear arms for everyone!</p>

<p>And the same on background checks for buying weapons.</p>

<p>But banning an entire set of weapons that have been around since WWII is stupidly idiotic.

Oh, and all of a sudden, YT and Reddit banning weapons from their content is also fascist and useless, other than ruining a dying platform even more.</p>

<p>Sure. Of course. But it&#39;s disingenuous to pretend like these kids are up there just speaking from the heart. They are being coached. They are being <em>groomed</em>. They and their political handlers are capitalizing on a tragedy that is more personal to others than it is to them in order to further a political agenda. </p>

<p>Hell, there are people on the other side at that DC march holding up signs in disagreement (vulgar though they may be) and they are being publicly targeted and shamed with the intention of <em>SHUTTING DOWN ALL DISCOURSE</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree if this is talking about the protests in the USA about gun violence. I was politically active from the age of 14 as my government had been meddling with student finance. I was kettled by the police back in 2010 when I was 15. I learned at this age that my government does not care for me and that society will not stand up, only for themselves. As austerity has dragged on in Britain, as the first canaries in the coal mine, everyone is still complacent to the neoliberal disaster which is happening.</p>

<p>Children can be political, (12-18), don&#39;t doubt this for a second. My parents opposed me protesting but I lied to them so I was let out. Young people are capable of critical thinking and as adults we need to nurture it, not insult their capabilities.</p>

<p>The really outrageous use of children is in war propaganda, e.g. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony">Naimyirah Testimony</a>, <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2015/09/04/deceivers-western-complicity-in-tragic-death-of-drowned-syrian-boy/">Alan Kurdi</a>
 <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/06/06/update-the-return-of-omran-to-no-fanfare-from-western-media/">Omran, Boy of Aleppo</a> to say the least. They get used to justify actions which causes suffering to 100&#39;000&#39;s + children that do not get photographed, just called &quot;collateral damage&quot; for western interests.</p>

<p>Certainly not, and that&#39;s not what I said.  I said that &quot;Everyman&quot; is going to lose their political power if they are serious about disarming.  I stand by that statement.</p>

<p>This is what the right wing believes. This is not the view of 100% of people who believe in conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>People on the left believe that bad people have done bad things while in government offices, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there shouldn&#39;t be a government. You can&#39;t claim that people who are into conspiracy theories should be anti-government and that conspiracy theories aren&#39;t just for right wingers, because those are two contradictory ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is this bullshit? Laws and societal norms were made to enrich the elite at the expense of the commoner. A lot of the conspiracy theories that get bandied about today, many of us figured out in high school. I knew that the Fed controlling our cash flow without our currency being backed by anything but fairy dust was going to be a bad deal. We did a research project that basically proved that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn&#39;t just acting as a lone wolf back in 2002 for high school. Hell, some adults are flat idiots.

<p>So much of this is completely subjective though.  There&#39;s countless examples of the pitfalls and shortcomings of societies being guided by &quot;mature adults&quot; whose life experience has made them cynical or callous or uncaring.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree it&#39;s a socio-cultural problem.  It&#39;s so socio-cultural that we can&#39;t even discuss it apparently - any attempts at even restrictions of guns are blocked out by a variety of tactics, including saying &quot;why bother doing anything at all, people will still die regardless&quot;, which entitely misses the point, intentionally I believe.  Be it at the public discourse level or at the political decision making level (where research into gun violence has been blocked for decades).  The right has effectively made any discussion on guns a non-starter for years </p>

I live in a bad neighborhood. My male roommate was gone all weekend. You bet we have guns, and not for no reason. We&#39;ve had people come up on our property threatening us just because we tell their kids to stop throwing things at our dog. We look out our back window into the alley and see people having sex in their cars, using that space to drop off/strip stolen cars, do drugs, etc. 
Sorry, but the laws on the books need to be enforced and kids in schools that are disruptive need to be disciplined, not coddled because they&#39;re the wrong skin color and their parents will sue the schools for racism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said nothing about sides. I&#39;ve explicitly, multiple times, said it is important to focus on the actual issue. You have, subsequently, put me on a side, then bitched about how <em>that</em> side has put you on another side. LOL. The hypocrisy is laughable.</p>

<p>You have latched onto a logical fallacy, put words into my mouth, pigeonholed me, hypocritical did exactly what you are whining about other people are doing, and then falsely accused me of having children speak for me. It&#39;s like you are pulling out every stop to avoid an actual debate. You just want to personal attack, because that is much easier than honestly looking at the situation and coming to a reasonable conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at your first response to me. If you were so concerned about talking solely about using children to push the political agenda, why did you harp on and on about defending the slippery slope fallacy, until it was obvious you had lost that point, before effectively saying &quot;well, this isn&#39;t about the topic at hand&quot;?</p>

<p>I know it is harder to admit you were wrong on the point than it is to try and pretend you were actually talking about something else, but the only person you might fool here with that is you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting narrative.</p>

<p>To clarify, I didn&#39;t mention banning assault rifles, I just think there should be more accountability for gun owners in general. </p>

<p>The US has a problem that no other developed country has, so I think there are some things we can learn from them to work on the way we approach ownership of weapons. We&#39;re not tasked with doing something new.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone can objectively look at our situation with full understanding and say that the current state of things is okay. Something has to happen, but a ban obviously isn&#39;t the solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure, but it&#39;s shameful that everyone seems to have this figured out except us. Most important thing is to get leadership from both sides onboard with working toward something that is on par with the countries we would like to be more like.</p>

<p>I feel the same about healthcare - we essentially are able to leverage &quot;second mover advantage&quot; to emulate the most efficient systems that currently exist in the world. That or we can keep bringing up the same solutions that have been pitched endlessly for the last 50 years. </p>

<p>My biggest criticism of this country is that we&#39;re so convinced that we&#39;re superior to everyone in every way that we&#39;re unable to learn from anyone else or be inspired by other countries. To me that lack of inspiration is what&#39;s leading to overall decline. </p>

<p>okay, so this is the talking point among right-wing reactionaries, yet what is the proof? also, i think it&#39;s a little delusional to claim that these protests are part of some grand hollywood scheme to outlaw guns. like, if you take 1 second to look at the organizer&#39;s platform, you can see its pretty watered down, centerist bs.</p>

<p>also, why does their matter? and who is saying its a gold standard? like, these teenagers are protesting something they feel passionately about and all people can say is basically &quot;shut up you&#39;re too young to know anything&quot; honestly, if you want some kind of real change to happen, it needs to be cohesive, and obviously middle-aged dolts are supper reactionary. your cynicism is saddening.</p>

If these politicians want to attack the 2nd amendment, grow some balls and go after it. They won&#39;t though, because it&#39;s political suicide. But you know what isn&#39;t? Giving teenagers a pat on the back for doing just that. It&#39;s so transparent it&#39;s sickening. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the &#39;gold standard&#39; because it&#39;s how the left is able to attack guns while more or less keeping their hands clean. They aren&#39;t attacking guns, they&#39;re supporting kids!

    <div class="md"><p>you keep talking about them &quot;attacking&quot; the 2nd amendment. how long are you guys gonna keep banging that drum for? in what world has the government, since sandy hook and even before, done ANYTHING to guns?  this gun-owner victim fetish is ridiculous because in the real world, nothing is happening. </p>

<p>teenagers, and let&#39;s not forget millions of other adults, are protesting to stop the deaths of other kids and other americans, and yet all you people can do is say &quot;THE HOLLYWEIRD ELITES ARE USING THEM AS PAWNS! BAHHH THEY&#39;RE COMING FOR OUR GUUNSS! IM SERIOUS THIS TIME!&quot; </p>

<p>yet, nothing happens, and you keep playing right into the NRA&#39;s hands. you guys are so dense you can&#39;t even see how the NRA is exploiting your rambo cosplay fantasy towards their own end: making money and buying politicians.</p>

<p>get over your victim complex and see the reality: if these kids were protesting against gun control, you would be fine with it being kids and you&#39;d see nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>just admit that all the genuflecting is a long winded rant against something you don&#39;t like, not against the fact that they&#39;re &quot;kids&quot; -- tho i reject the idea that  the age of someone discounts they&#39;re ability to have an individual opinion.</p>

You cannot in one breath warn every parent in the United States that their kids might eat a pod of laundry detergent and then in the following breath call that same group of people the most insightful generation. </p>

<p>For me this is less about the gun debate and more about how the media is yet again playing sides and changing narratives when it suits their goals.</p>

<p>With this being an issue that directly impacts many of them, I find that it makes sense for them to vocalize their opinions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re trying to change people&#39;s minds on guns. I feel like they&#39;re trying to direct attention toward this issue that loads of people are dying and nothing seems to be done about it, no matter how many times it happens. </p>

<p>I agree with you that teens are in many ways inferior to adults, but at the same time our current generation of teens are more well-informed than any generation before them.</p>

<p>What do you base this on? Don&#39;t just say the internet. Having access to the internet is not the same as being informed. Again, youthful exuberance and optimism is great, but the truth is mass schooling is indoctrination and programming. The further out you get from that indoctrination the more you will understand. </p>

<p>It seems like you&#39;re saying that because violent incidents imply we should make changes you may not be in favor of, those incidents are a farce. Does that sound right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I did not say anything close to that. Also it takes time to find correct info on a tool like YouTube/internet at large (it is large). </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories are ignored precisely because there is so much utter shit out there. I do not think a 16 year old, or an 18 year old without proper guidance can find the truth because our schooling actively works against the development of reason.  </p>

<p>The development of your ability to reason, and think critically for yourself is crucial to your ability to decipher truth from lies, emotional manipulation from sound rational evidence. </p>

<p>Until you have worked to develop your critical thinking skills (learned to think entirely for yourself) you like most everyone else will be unable to have even the most tenuous grasp on reality. </p>

<p>The truth remains that it is the mark of an intelligent mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. Most people won&#39;t even look at anything that disagrees with their worldview, and those who do come only to mock that which they do not understand. </p>

<p>This is not about being &quot;anti Second Amendment&quot;.  It is about calling for regulations that are permitted within the context and scope of the Second Amendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you just admitted those laws are already in place. Would you admit that if they restricted everything but muskets that would be a violation of the second amendment? An AR 15 is a semi automatic weapon. 90% or more of the weapons sold are semi automatic. The police do not use revolvers because long ago they were deemed insufficient. The new billHR 5087 bans lever action weapons!!! This is not gun control, it is an attack on the second amendment disguised as a &quot; dangerous gun&quot; ban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t &quot;admit&quot; anything; I merely pointed out that the Supreme Court has indicated that certain kinds of restrictions on gun ownership are Constitutional--meaning that some additional ones can be implemented without infringing on the rights articulated by the Second Amendment.</p>

<p>The &quot;everything but muskets&quot; thing is also resolved with a fair amount of finality in <em>Heller</em>, where Scalia sets forth the boundaries of the Second Amendment rights as it pertains to <em>type</em> of weapons permitted by the Constitution.  In essence, he summarizes a long line of jurisprudence that says that the Second Amendment limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.</p>

<p>So, no, I don&#39;t think a blanket ban on semi-automatic firearms would be constitutional (in point of fact, I am legally carrying a concealed semi-automatic handgun at this very moment).</p>

<p>My point is that there can and should be modest, Constitutional, and common-sense regulation of dangerous articles--that gun owner/operators should be subject to similar regulations as other participants in dangerous activities:  training, background checks, registration, and limitations on the kinds of equipment non-professionals can have in their possession. </p>

<p>But even putting that aside, under our Constitution, their position at the top of the hierarchy set out by that document is of paramount importance:  you can disagree with them all you want, but you have to abide with their rules or become an outlaw.</p>

<p>You are of course free to go live somewhere with lower levels of regulation around gun use and ownership, but I suspect you won&#39;t find the Central African Republic or Baghdad very hospitable, and Mars has proven really difficult to get to, so...for all practical purposes, the Supreme Court is the last word on the subject for you, brah.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I will admit that I know a <em>ton</em> of people who went to Harvard and Yale, but to the best of my knowledge none of them has <em>ever</em> killed anyone.  </p></li>
<li><p>I do think that I&#39;d rather have the body responsible for interpreting the law be made up of people who have committed their lives to studying the law rather than random people off the streets.  Even better if they were guided in that study by previous generations of smart people who committed <em>their</em> lives to the study of the law.</p></li>
<li><p>as to your final sentence, I agree 100% that the law applies to the wealthy, as you point out.  But I would also argue that day-to-day life shows that it applies with equal force--if not more force--to the average or underprivileged.</p></li>

<p>Many people, including some kids, are pushing for that factor to be addressed because they feel strongly about it.  Just as you are free to prioritize action around the other factors you described.</p>

<p>If anything, this argument around &quot;emasculating the population&quot; and keeping us under control is the real red herring in this debate.  If the United States government, with its immense firepower, manpower, intelligence apparatus, wanted to take all of us gun owners out, they could do so in a heartbeat.  No amount of armchair John Wayne &quot;pew pew pew&quot; with our pissant 1911s and AR-15s would stop the strongest military and law enforcement complex in the history of mankind.  </p>

<p>Guns are the easiest right to attack because they have a &quot;fear-factor&quot; associated with them. If we willingly give away most of our 2nd amendment rights, how does that look when people want to start attacking our other constitutional rights?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Supreme Court had to specify that gay marriage was legal under the equal protection clause.  There is no law or amendment that specifically says gay marriage is legal, there is the equal protection clause which says that all citizens must be treated equally under the law and have their rights to legal due process.  So in the absence of legislation that specified gay marriage, states had the latitude to make laws.  They passed those laws, they got challenged as unconstiutional since they treated gay citizens different than married citizens, and since marriage is a legal institution recognized by the state falls under legal due process.  So denying gay citizens the right to marriage violated their equal protection and due process rights.  The Supreme Court agreed those laws violated their rights as citizens and that rendered state and federal laws that sought to discriminate against gay citizens to be unconstitutional.</p>

You’re entitled to your opinion yes, but so are the kids who are tired of being killed at school, which I can only assume is the reason for this post because you don’t even offer that much of an explanation. If you think that their participation in protests is a conspiracy lay out some solid facts and present them in a way that doesn’t ignore that 1 -teens are supposed to rebel against society, it’s what teens have always done, and 2- teens also express opinions for and against abortion, immigration laws, religious freedom, drug legalization etc etc etc.  </p>

I live in a bad neighborhood. My male roommate was gone all weekend. You bet we have guns, and not for no reason. We&#39;ve had people come up on our property threatening us just because we tell their kids to stop throwing things at our dog. We look out our back window into the alley and see people having sex in their cars, using that space to drop off/strip stolen cars, do drugs, etc. 
Sorry, but the laws on the books need to be enforced and kids in schools that are disruptive need to be disciplined, not coddled because they&#39;re the wrong skin color and their parents will sue the schools for racism.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll show up and post the same response the next time somebody is criticizing democrats. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will and regularly do. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, and then Trump and blue team for every other option in the general, weren&#39;t any third parties that I saw to choose from outside the presidential ticket. Trump sucked nuts and lied to us, not entirely surprisingly. It&#39;s not impossible he will still do something good, but I am not going to hold my breath.</p>

<p>I want candidates with integrity. That is part of the justification for me saying Trump sucked. He made it obvious he wasn&#39;t going to drain the swamp before he even swore in. Bernie Sanders is at least mostly consistent, harps on billionaires (who, imo, got us into this mess), and seems to have more integrity than any of the other options. Ron Paul is the only other presidential candidate I&#39;ve ever seen with a measure of integrity. </p>

<p>If we had politicians who were held accountable for their actions and had integrity, the political process would be working. Alas, we do not, and the media on either side makes claims like &quot;red team bad, blue team good!&quot; and conversely &quot;blue team bad, red team good!&quot; dividing the population on imaginary lines when virtually everyone wants the same things, and virtually none of our politicians are even trying to get us those things. </p>
