       I'm referring to the Skripal case.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/87rztf/the_poisoning_of_skripal_unsupported_by_any/dwf3238/?context=3">
        Here's what I had to say earlier
       </a>
       (naturally this was buried):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The most interesting thing about this behavior is that usually they attack "inconvenient" stories with barrages of logical fallacies and ad hominems, but sometimes the story is so sketchy that they don't want to give it any attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        This seems to be the case for the Skripal poisoning. Despite being an obvious conspiracy (regardless of your opinion on the subject) of the highest geopolitical level, there's been a dramatic push against us for even
        <em>
         discussing
        </em>
        this case.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The most disturbing thing of all is that
       <em>
        this is the exact same bullshit
       </em>
       they pulled in Iraq and Libya; the "shoot first, ask questions later" school of political posturing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as they keep attacking those for daring to question this narrative, I'll keep pointing it out!

       There are a whole lotta redditors who flat out hate Russia and anyone who posts anything at reddit which does not disparage Russia, its people and anything to do with Russia.  Reddit is a pretty good way to collect evidence of Russophobia (not just fear of Russia, but also hate of Russia).    I note a comment just about yours here where someone offers that
       <em>
        "Russia likes to kill people."
       </em>
       .  I am speechless (for a brief moment).

       I'll tell you right now that there is nothing wrong with Russian people, it's the government, their  oligarchs, and their mafia that I will never let up on. I don't even hate them persay, I find their corruption and the efficiency that their government and oligarchs infiltrate American political organisations absolutely fascinating.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7yqkbx/the_cohen_memos_ukrethanol_and_the_viktor_topolov/">
        Take a good look at Michael Cohen
       </a>
       , look into his family and his own ties to the Russian mafia, and you will know exactly what I am talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in a research lab with half a dozen Iranians. They don't hate Americans, they hate the American government. They have valid reasons to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also knew a Ukrainian grad student that was from Eastern Ukraine and she has zero love for Russia's government. I'm pretty sure she has a valid reason to do so.

        Other British agents involved in the Skripal case are Pablo Miller who recruited Skripal for the MI6. He was a friend of Skripal, also lived in Salisbury and worked for Christopher Steele, the former(?) MI6 agent who produced the 'dirty dossier' about Donald Trump for the Clinton campaign. Both are involved with Russian mafia emigres in Britain like Boris Berezovski and the deceased Alexander Litvinenko who's father says that he was killed by an MI6 or CIA guy.

       why do you honestly think that the CIA would go out of there way to murder Russian nationals in Britain if they were providing valuable intelligence against Russia with their allies? Why would the CIA murder potential information sources?

       Also, do you think every single murder of a Russian national providing intelligence or is about to provide intelligence to Western intel agencies was murdered by the CIA? Do you think the CIA murdered Mikhail Lesin right before he was about to devolve information about Russia Today to DoJ officials?

       Why not answer the Lesin question? It points to a pattern that becomes hard to ignore and is therefore relevant to the Sergei Skripal story.

       Russia may very well be a criminal state run by thugs, but I'm not going to champion the further destabilization of the geopolitical climate over the wide-eyed claims of the same institutions that have

       Exactly, except this pattern is being perpetrated by Western intelligence agencies in a broken record-like attempt to whip the population into a xenophobic frenzy to excuse their addictive propensity for war and conflict.

       What I have seen is you being defensive and not willing to entertain any theory other than "it wasn't Russia, and even if it was, we have to ignore it to avoid war."  We can't just ignore a country run by a dictator and his oligarchs because we're afraid he'll start WW3.

       This can also be about how it's not hard to come to a conclusion that Skripal was murdered by Russian intelligence agencies due to the fact that he was a source for Western intelligence agencies and follows a mold for other Russian nationals murdered in the UK over the last 5-10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is possible to find reporting on these murders that comes from FOIA lawsuits and outside sources not from the CIA.

       Have you read any of the reporting that Buzzfeed Investigations has done into the deaths of 14 Russians in the UK, and how British Intelligence services have been reluctant to classify them as murders?
      </p>
      <p>
       And only now after Skripal was murdered, they are looking into their deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, have you looked into Mikhail Lesin's death right before he was supposed to give information on Russia Today to DoJ officials? Have you seen the reporting that has been done on that?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a pattern with these deaths. If there is a pattern to Russian nationals dying who have given information, are about to give information, or have crossed the Kremlin, why is it improbable to assume that Russian intelligence murdered these people?

       I can only speak for myself, it's fine to question the narrative of mainstream reporting on a single suspicious death. That's what we are here for.

      <p>
       My problem comes in when you make these posts about Skripal but fail to mention that his death follows a pattern of Russian nationals murdered in Britain and now the US that went against the Kremlin. I think if you provided that information, you would see a warmer response from me and possibly from others.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is up to the reader of your posts to come to a conclusion that Russian intelligence were behind the pattern of murders of dissidents living abroad.

       So which news agency was able to do a 6 part investigation into 14 suspicious deaths of Russian nationals in the UK that were completely ignored by UK investigators that has now become a national focus after the Skripal poisonings?

      <p>
       Which news agency was able to corroborate Felix Sater's story into his work for the CIA and the FBI?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which news agency was able to find out the FBI had secretly determined Mikhail Lesin's death was a homicide and find out that Chris Steele gave them a memo in 2015 that said the same about Lesin's death.

       The biggest problem for me, is that if Russia wanted to kill him, they had the opportunity to already. Skripal was already convicted in Russia and serving a prison sentence. Russia agreed to give him away in a prisoner swap.

       Convicted of Treason in 2006, sentenced to only 13 years

       Practically no one doubts that it
       <em>
        could

       have been Russia. The problem is jumping to conclusions beyond what the evidence justifies. "This seems like something the Russians would do" isn't much of an argument. "This chemical agent could only have been made in Russia, so it could only have been Russia responsible" was a more compelling argument, but has been thoroughly debunked.

       So, Russia murdered a guy, in a foreign country where it would create international outrage, and they did it in a way that made it clear they were behind it, even though the country is run by a former KGB agent? No motive, and Russia knows how to get away with killing people.

       Nice, I must have missed the articles regarding them starting the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I only say it is a good start. The OPCW aligns generally with the Western globalist  powers who have a bias for war. I am glad that you linked their Syrian chemical weapons report, since it is a good case study on how these narratives are formed.
       <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/11/04/the-trumped-up-syria-sarin-case/">
        Rick Sterling does a great analysis on this.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think their reports are useful in determining what chemicals were used and other technical details, but to derive the perpetrators, motive, and means from this is ill-advised. Just like with the Syrian gas attacks, the motive for these attacks is non-existent, other than the usual "Russians kill people, you know?" repeated ad-nauseum.

      <p>
       Honestly aside from TMOR doing their usual bullshit to your posts I think the issue with this conspiracy not gaining as much traction here as you think isn’t because it’s being buried. It lacks a suspect on the other side. It’s one thing to say I don’t believe the media, we can talk about that all day here, but since there’s no ‘Theresa May did it because’ or ‘Cheney is making money off of it because’ it is hard to converse about in anything more than the abstract. Maybe not a fair assessment, but that’s why I think it doesn’t gets the people going. Did a rogue intelligence group do this, possibly, I also think it’s not impossible the Russian government did it too.

       Agree here that the Skripal affair is simply too complex and uncertain at this point to make any kind of packagable conspiracy meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the difficulty, for me, is seeing, at the minimum, two arcs in this kind of high-stakes geopolitical knife fight. In one arc the sides intend to cooperate and avoid war, and in the other arc the two sides are attempting to hurt each other badly enough to get some kind of message across; presumably that message we simply cannot with our limited knowledge make out clearly and have to guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, we cannot at all isolate two spy vs. spy opponents like we used to (US vs USSR or West vs. Communism), let alone factor in now at least multiple factions inside the EU and it seems now China must be weighed no matter who else is playing, and if Middle East players aren't involved it's a wonder why not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that Axol's approach of analyzing carefully the way in which stories are spun to assess their true impact, but I think that approach has to result in a meaningful "what's the game score?" and back that up (since there is no accepted scoring system here) based on our best effort to be perceptive, non-partisan, and especially, subtle (unlike most of what I have seen so far).

       I am the same way. The problem is that when I asked the question of, why would we go to war with Russia? No response. I don't see us doing it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a storm brewing in the Middle East and Trump's new cabinet members all hate Iran, the Iran Deal, are cementing a relationship with SA right now. And it seems as if they all went on Fox and Friends, said those exact things and BOOM! You're hired. WTF? If anything, I see a war with Iran on the horizon so SA can lock up it's dominant status in the Middle East, continue to lock up oil prices and give us a larger ally there outside of Israel. I do not agree with going up against Iran and trying to somehow strengthen our bond with SA whatsoever. SA has been, and will more than likely always be, the largest supplier of terrorists in the world. Iran on the other hand has the largest population of Shia Muslims, the group that the Sunni Muslim ISIS slaughters.

       "The problem is that when I asked the question of, why would we go to war with Russia? No response."
      </p>
      <p>
       We have run proxy wars against Russia/the U.S.S.R. since the end of WW2. That's what the Korean war and the Vietnam war were all about and that's why we were in Afghanistan in the 70's as well as a host of other hotspots around the globe since. We never went full out conventional war against them because they were too strong and they have a sizable nuclear arsenal. I hope we are still smart enough to not to engage in a conventional war with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, who knows what secret development's have been made to the Iron Done/Star Wars type programs that may be giving secret confidence to those who would consider war with modern day Russia. They are not as powerful as they were when the U.S.S.R. was a thing. They do have a tone of oil and threaten our business interests and supremacy in various places across the globe. Hillary Clinton and her neocon cronies wanted to throw up a no fly zone over Syria against the Russian air Force. Let that sink in. Syria is an autonomous state that poses zero threat to us and Russia is arguably a super power that was invited by the Syrian government. Conversly, Trump, doesn't seem to be nearly as shy about the use of nuclear weapons (and the blowback associated with using them) as most of his predecessors. Im glad he seems friendly with Russia and hope he's in it  for the money from a business perspective simply because its better  than him being in it to size them up for war.   We've been gunning for Syria for awhile now and obviously Iran has something we want. They are both part if General Wesley Clark's now infamous statement about 7 countries in 5 years. Obviously that plan is behind schedule. Depending on who you ask, the only reason we haven't gone full bore after those two nation's is because of their support from Russia. But I've seen a lot of estimates recently that Russia is not a genuine threat militarily to the U.S. any longer in a conventional war. Idk how one quantifies something like that. How can Russia not be a threat if Afghanistan and Iraq were?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I hope you are right, that we won't go to war with them, but dude, holy shit, look at the frenzy people are being whipped into about these Russian hackers and the DNC leaks and interference in our election process. The writing is on the wall.

       Unless they attack us, I don't see anyway that we go into a conventional war with them. I def see unconventional warfare and possibly a major uptick in that, but not troops on the ground or planes overhead dropping bombs. They are destabilizing the Middle East to go against our interests, trying to get us into a war there and Trump has brought on the exact type of people they wanted.

        It’s one thing to say I don’t believe the media, we can talk about that all day here, but since there’s no ‘Theresa May did it because’ or ‘Cheney is making money off of it because’ it is hard to converse about in anything more than the abstract.

       Theresa May/British intelligence did it to isolate Russia and justify further sanctions or outright aggression against them. They may have worked with

       , who created Novichok gas:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, who has been challenging the British government’s claims regarding the poisoning of British double agent Sergei Skripal, reported in a blog posting on March 17 that he had been sent “vital information” showing that in 2016 Iranian scientists synthesized Novichok nerve agents under the supervision of the Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Warfare, so that they could be added to the OPCW’s data base. “This makes complete nonsense of the Theresa May’s ‘of a type developed by Russia’ line, used to Parliament and the UN Security Council,” Murray writes.
       </p>
       <p>
        “This explains why Porton Down [Britain’s Defense Science and Technology Laboratory] have refused to cave in to governmental pressure to say the nerve agent was Russian. If Iran can make a Novichok, so can a significant number of states. [emphasis in original]
       </p>
       <p>
        “While Iran acted absolutely responsibly in cooperating with the OPCW, there are a handful of rogue states operating outwith the rule of international law, like Israel and North Korea, which refuse to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, join the OPCW or destroy their chemical weapons stocks,”
       </p>
       <p>
        Murray continues. He further states that Russia, in cooperation with the OPCW, completed destruction of its chemical stocks last year. “Why nobody is even looking at the rogue states outside the OPCW is a genuine puzzle.” Murray concludes that despite what the lying media are regurgitating every day, “ ‘of a type developed by Russia’ has zero evidential value and is a politician’s weasel phrase designed deliberately to mislead the public.”

       The problem I have with this theory is that this kind of thought process is exactly what Russia was trying to accomplish with there online manipulation. They built up tons of conspiracies with their online personas knowing full well that when something like this happened they could use regular Joe Schmos to back up their absurd claims of it being a false flag or whatever. They are fundamentally manipulating a well known problem in the Democratic system, group mentality.

       The data units are burying anything challenging. I think russia america and Israel are all in on this. They want the world to think they are at odds. Prety soon a world event will happen that will see Israel America and Russia all team up to dominate the region. We see OPEC branching out to russia and also China entering the oil futures with the yuan.

       It's not the only story that is relevant to most people's interests that isn't getting the attention it deserves. This one here got almost zero traction even in this sub:

       It's an outstanding example of the theory that our politicians pretend to disagree over stupid stuff all the time for the sake of appeasing their voter base, but at the end of the day, they are more like each other and more on each other's team then they ever will be on ours.

       But yeah, Stormy Daniels is really a fucking top priority while it looks like a huge sector of our government is gearing up for a big fucking war and another collapse of our economy at the same time. Huh, it's almost like these stories could go hand in hand with a plot to make the .1% a whole shitload of money since they are gonna be the only ones who know how to hedge their bets and come out ahead.

       Am I seeing this right? The CIA is not interested in getting intelligence from Russian dissenters? Is this a joke?
      </p>
      <p>
       By this logic, Russian intelligence never wanted to recruit Carter Page.

      <p>
       So a nothingburger results in FISA warrants on American citizens that are suspected of being Russian intelligence assets?

       Unless they attack us, I don't see anyway that we go into a conventional war with them. I def see unconventional warfare and possibly a major uptick in that, but not troops on the ground or planes overhead dropping bombs. They are destabilizing the Middle East to go against our interests, trying to get us into a war there and Trump has brought on the exact type of people they wanted.
