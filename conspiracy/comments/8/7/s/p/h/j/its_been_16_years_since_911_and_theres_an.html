       Yes, that first one is
       <em>
        today
       </em>
       .  Since we're dealing with a nonlinear pattern, the best predictions are merely probabilities but I still expect to see similar events on more of these dates than not.  These "likelihood" values are loosely-based on the number of occurrences in the previous list.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        edit:
       </strong>
       The day is practically-over for most of the world.  There were no major events but we did see something that's likely foreshadowing events to come:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A U.S. judge rejected Saudi Arabia’s bid to dismiss lawsuits claiming that it helped plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and should pay billions of dollars in damages to victims. -
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/87w9q9/saudi_arabia_must_face_us_lawsuits_over_sept_11/">
         r/worldnews post
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, exactly 16y6m16d later, the door has been opened for the official story to be challenged in court.  That case could very easily be what officially disproves the "official" story, or at least casts enough doubt in the court of public opinion to expose
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6kr3al/technology_thousands_of_years_ahead_of_whats/">
        the truth.
       </a>
      </p>
      <h2>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Numbers All The Way Down
        </em>
       </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
       Numerology is one of those subjects we're collectively taught to dismiss.  Meanwhile, these impossible alignments of dates and events keep occurring.  I've never studied numerology and intentionally so-- to me, it's all just
       <em>
        data
       </em>
       and assigning specific meanings to the numbers is welcoming observer bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a year and a bit of research, there's three things I'm certain of:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        #1) It's all symbolic.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no difference between 666 and 999 besides rotation.  To not confuse it with the mathematical
       <em>
        value
       </em>
       of a number, I refer to this property as the "vibration".  116 and 911 have the same
       <em>
        vibration
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        #2) Larger numbers reduce to a single digit.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Except in the case of repeating digits (i.e. 11, 22, 33,
       <em>
        etc
       </em>
       , the "master numbers"), numbers have both their own vibration
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the vibration of the summation of the digits.  E.g. 123 has its own vibration and the vibration of
       <em>
        (1+2+3=)
       </em>
       6.  This year is 2018 so it shares a vibration with both
       <em>
        (2+1+8=)
       </em>
       11 and 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        #2) It's too precise to be manifested by man.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The coordination required to manifest these events at such specific dates (as well as specific times, locations, landmarks,
       <em>
        etc etc
       </em>
       ) is nothing short of
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       .  Well-beyond the capabilities of man (or even the most-ancient of beings.)  Much like
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/872eo5/everyone_is_lying_to_you_the_mandela_effect_and/">
        the global effort to dismiss the "Mandela Effect"
       </a>
       , the precision of these events suggets they manifest from
       <em>
        the very design of this reality itself.
       </em>

       There's a little something your eyes likely glazed over in that last chart: June 6th is 6111 days after 9/11 or, to say it in numbers, 9/11+6111=6/6/11.  If you were to ask me "when does Trump get his 9/11?" that would be my answer: June 6th.

       In the 16 years, the far right and the homegrown fascists have committed more terror attacks in the United States than any other group - by far.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it has been increasing in recent years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy we need to be looking at is why the current administration is cutting funding for combating these groups purely for political gain.

       Since then — from Sept. 12, 2001, to Dec. 31, 2016  — there have been 85 attacks in the country by violent extremists resulting in 225 deaths. GAO reported citing data from the U.S. Extremist Crime Database.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of those 225 deaths:
      </p>
      <p>
       • 106 individuals were killed by far-right violent extremists in 62 separate incidents;
      </p>
      <p>
       • 119 individuals were killed by radical Islamist violent extremists in 23 separate incidents;
      </p>
      <p>
       • The number of people killed in a given year ranged from one to 49.

      <p>
       And:
      </p>
      <p>
       White supremacists in the United States killed more than twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before, and were responsible for far more murders than domestic Islamic extremists, helping make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America, a new report states.

       OK so not to sound like a know-it-all but right wing violence is no where near as much of a  problem (If even a problem at all) as mainstream left wing domestic terror groups and riots. Be honest though, the issue of most mass violence comes form Islam and it needs to be stamped out, denied or reformed.

       I worked downtown Manhattan during Occupy Wall Street,and my building was targeted. The police kept the entrance clear, and even though I worked on the 32nd floor I wore headphones to down of the chanting.

       Do you truly believe right wing violence is more of a problem than mainstream left wing violence and Islam? Do you HONESTLY believe that Islam kills less people per year than people who believe in a smaller government do? That is seriously worrying.

       Completely missed my point but good luck with rabbit hole you've started to fall down. One day at your tin-foil hat wearing peak you'll understand what I meant by a hardened conspiracy theorists would never support the Clinton family. Your ignorance isn't your fault though, I feel as if you've been fed so much disinformation and forced to watch this facade for so long you still haven't disconnected from the game reality the elites stage for you. The fact that you're on this sub is a good start but please refrain from posting anything purely politically motivated that is wrong then argue FOR an elite who has done you more harm than good. Disconnect your political ideals from your critical thinking.

       Sure, if you bury your head in the sand and forget his the lawsuit he settled for marking prospective black tenants with (C) next to their name, or calling for the Central Park 5 to be put to death after they were exonerated, or saying a judge was biased against him because he was Mexican (ignoring that he was American). Oh! And he started, "Laziness is a trait in blacks”

       You mean the same Trump who has done more for the black community in his term already than Obama did in 8 years (that's a measurable fact that cannot be argued please do not embarrass yourself you'll only look like you don't know what you're talking about, so many have tried). It has literally never been confirmed that he said that ever and he had as much faith in the justice system as every other person who knows how corrupt the world is does. If you're going to argue he is racist cite something that is factual and actually to do with race. Saying he supported punishing those people just because they were black and not because he has little faith that the system will produce the correct verdict doesn't make him a bad person, it makes you a bad person for jumping to such conclusions about someone you don't even know. As the left would say, don't be prejudice. It's like saying Trump is racist for the Muslim ban, pure emotional response with no logical thinking in play.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, my step-dad also supported punishing central park 5 due to his faith in the court's competency to produce an accurate verdict. Would you call him racist too? Or do I need to baselessly accuse him of saying something racist first?

       Believe it or not but there are alot of people who don't believe in the final verdict, a cover-up, incompetency whatever it just doesn't sit well with alot of people. Are you forgetting which sub you are on? Trump also never said that specific quote was true just that "the stuff she wrote was probably true" bearing in mind he probably never read the book and doesn't know every single thing she said which is testimony to the fact he later realised what O'Donnell had been saying and went back on it after realising it wasn't true. If someone wrote a hit piece on me and I was in Trump's position I probably would have said the same thing especially if I hadn't have read it word for word, because it's fun, it stirs the pot and what is anyone gonna do about it. It's Trump afterall, he's an egotistical person. I'm still waiting for you to show me something that could make me believe he genuinely believes white people are genetically superior. What has he done to non-white people do disadvantage them since he's been in the 2nd most powerful position Earth? When has he 100% confirmed said or did anything racist? The only people who claim he is racist are the misinformed or those too stupid to actually look up what he has done for non-white people.

       You're clearly quite ignorant. CP5 were convicted and spent years in prison despite their DNA not matching what was found. In 2002 a different man who is a convicted murder confessed, whose DNA was at the scene, and knew details that weren't released to the public. The CP5 verdict was vacated. And Trump still called them guilty after all this.

       Under Obama african-american unemployment rates went up from 2008 - 2010 during the biggest recession in 30 years.  After that it went down continuously for 6 years until they reached their lowest rates since the stat was measured in Jan 2017.    They continued downward after that

       With the policies enacted by Trump that has helped the significant growth of the US economy and with everything he has done for the black community (again, measurably more than Obama has done) you could quite easily make the connection that growth (thanks to Trump) = more jobs = lower unemployment rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wether you like him or not you cannot argue he has done very well at restoring the US economy, as expected, I mean he is a billionaire.

       I'm sorry but how is a religious government in anyway whatsoever conservative? That's the complete opposite of conservative. If anything Islam can be more related to the progressive movement, breaking down people into their identity groups and establishing an actually real oppressive system based on group identity alone that ignores individual identities. There's a reason they actively hunt and kill Christian people in a lot of majority Muslim countries further East. In the future please think about the definitions you use as it can paint a false image in people's minds about certain perspectives and view points that you don't seem to share or understand fully. For example, the KKK could be labelled as right wing but their version is a very minor fringe element of society that generally isn't accepted nor is it considered modern conservatism as we don't define groups of people by outliers, if at all. Again, those people who say "only white can be racist" are a fringe element (although very more prevalent today) of modern day leftism.

       Design meaning intent of creation by someone or something right? So what do you think designed our reality? Is it a religious point of view I.e. God, Allah or something more plausible but still very out there? Because the only thing that stops me from seeing your point of view is the possibility of it being an argument from authority, an authority I may not believe like you do.

       See now I can understand your point better thanks. I normally dismiss anything that argues from a holy book because the amount of times people have tried to argue about something and say that their holy book is a source or a standard is staggering. An undefined omnipotent force is something I can get behind but if you said it was God from the Bible it would be harder to stand with you. Thanks for clarifying. I've never taken into account that these things that always seem to be connected in some way through numbers could be something weaved into the fibre of reality itself. I would have said, if anything on the subject, that it was the people orchestrating it having some fun or maybe it's relevant to them who knows, but the natural way of the world kind of theory sounds intriguing. If there is a way of gathering more evidence of this and you have the time or resources to do it please post in future. I'll sure be looking into this now.

       Lol, if you were meant to be posting here youd clearly not be bringing up the current "divide and conquer" rhetoric that is the alt right. Homegrown fascists. What is this 1920's Italy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there even such a thing as a homegrown grass roots movement anymore? Everything is funded by someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have to give you credit though. You managed to hide what everyone says about the Trump administration in a lot more words than they usually use. But once again, divide and conquer.

       The power we all have lies in the middle. Remember that, and maybe we can all collectively tap in to it.

       Arrange good events on every day. Give them literal fucking hell (their perspective) for a while while we have some god damn fun for once.

       Obviously then balance it out a bit, else you become as bad, but a good bout of sucker punches would be nice to dole out, they won't know what fucking hit them.

       What you experience here is one particular way of experiencing a particular thing through the particular set of the senses you have within this manifestation in the human form. Reality does not say anything, it doesnt sell you a story of itself. It does not say what you see is all there is to it. The idea that this visible reality is all there is was introduced to you by society and other people, not by reality itself. When you go to sleep at night various different realities manifest for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you call a natural happening is a concept you have about what constitutes natural. How do you know that what is actually the nature of existence is not something else than what you consider as natural through your limited perception? Also if you conclude this reality is not natural then your very concept of natural is within the unnatural and as such is already wrong.

       I didnt want a tldr, I am a different guy than that one. What do you think about my points? I think they are worth thinking about for you. Since to me it appears that your idea of false is a mere assumption based on the notion that you know what is real.

       I am asking how you draw the conclusions that you have from what you have told me.
      </p>
      <p>
       You already question the very nature of this existence. That is doubt. You dont know what this is. But if we dont question we dont find. If we make up conclusions before really finding we are quite possibly wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets imagine that in the normal state that we are brought up by society we are in a kind of a dream or illusion, which by the way is one common thread in all spiritual traditions that aim at the realisation of the nature of reality, that before waking up you are in a kind of a distortion, a dream.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is so, then if you do not investigate and doubt your current experience there is no possibility of waking up.

       Every pushed narrative is opposite and has a twist.. The matrix: Pick both pills, find balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The red pill represents: The elite believe themselves to be neo. "we" plebs are the enemy, coming to defeat and take over. While they hold up in the last human city, zion.

      <p>
       Fits the greater state of Israel agenda, fits why they want control, they saw the potential to be god, unlimited potential to do anything in this reality, and let greed and desire (ego) take over.. They want to stop the second coming of Christ/consciousness, in order to have total control over all within the system. They don't want you to fulfill your potential. They want you to work for them so they don't have to. So they can live forever through a singular family legacy for generations to come.. The last human bloodline.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make a film, so you sit and watch it, wasting your precious time so you die without realising your potential.

       Maybe, I think it's more likely a couple crazy families with all the power. Maybe they THINK they are the devil? or doing his bidding or something? Or maybe they just love power and find that the best way to keep control is to keep people scared through carefully crafted and scheduled "events".

       One thing I’m truly fascinated in is old religious scriptures as well as tribal mythology and looking at them through a mondernntechnological lense. This guy mentions on the page you linked that “Star” refers to nuclear power plant. Well, that makes sense as stars are basically nuclear reactors and changes the entire meaning of the scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, Native American culture mentioning flaming dragons from the sky seems like an interpratation of a space ship but nothing to relate it to.

       There's more than one pattern at play. This post is demonstrating the 116/ 911 pattern as it's the most obvious.  Other patterns revolve around master numbers, 115, 3137, and 4118 but I haven't deciphered those yet.

       First time I saw Eht Namuh it reminded me of Timecube. It seems a bit crazy on the surface, but I'd say it is more abstract than crazy. Probe a bit deeper into the site and you will see it is full of universal harmonics and wisdom across the ages, connecting the dots on so many things. Lots of "reduce to deduce" type mathematics that remind me of gematria. And its message is benevolent, unlike some of Timecube.

       Whether it is a work of art by someone who lost their mind, a magnum opus (the pages describe this in several ways; philosopher's stone / jewel in the lotus / om mani padme hum), or a key to the universe, it is of a highly intelligent mind, and I doubt the original author David Denison is still maintaining it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here some users discuss magnum opus on the Eht Namuh forum:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;amp;t=11913">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the more creative theories suggest Eht Namuh is a message from higher dimensional beings, or artificial intelligence. I haven't been able to draw a conclusion yet. It doesn't feel like an ARG or elaborate troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some weird discussions on the Eht Namuh forums. One guy in particular posts cryptic diagrams that seem to have some meaning. I went through his post history and its 40+ pages of these diagrams. I don't really understand why.

       That tengri person you linked is interesting. I found many more accounts like that and even stranger ones through my Eht Namuh research. Check out
       <a href="/r/libraryofbabel">
        /r/libraryofbabel

       and what the user accounts post there. Check out
       <a href="/r/textualstatic">
        /r/textualstatic

       . I don't know if this is high autism at work, or if there's something more to this, but it's a rabbit hole so be prepared.

       Some people understand the universe is all numbers, others don't. I think you should change the likelihood of the dates with 3 6's in them to high. 616 is also considered an alternative of this number, which matches your dates well too.

       That's what I was wondering. Are these the only terrorist attacks or are they only picked cause they match up with the supposed pattern? As we can see, these are only showcased cause they match the supposed pattern.

       When you look for stuff like this and disregard the stuff that doesn't fit what you want, of course things looks suspicious and spooky.

       It may be that there are certain things that are objectively wrong in the world, precisely and fundamentally in (and not despite) their impact as psychic events, the marker of their objective wrongness would then be their subsequent manifestation as spontaneously occurring material/empirical phenomena in unfolding time.

       Perhaps it has to do with this: "This minus or gap is not simply nothing, it is a minus that materially affects the structure with which it appears. It is a non-being with serious consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In this sense, the fact that there is the unconscious — together with the fact that the unconscious is not simply subjective but has an objective dimension to it, related to the structure of speech/language — tells us something about this structure itself. The very existence of subjective distortions tells us something “objective” about the structure involved in them. It tells us that this objective structure is ridden by a minus, asymmetry, contradiction. It is not simply neutral or indifferent. This is also an important epistemological point. There is an objective side to subjective distortions."

       Right now is the Season of Sacrifice. Wasn't there a big theatre fire in Russia? Yup. Check the dates and times of cabal owned media. They'll report 33 or other predictable numbers that mean something to them (therefore WE NEED to understand the system to expose them).

       It was a mall fire in Russia.  I'm (of course) suspicious of such things but couldn't to begin to see how the symbolism of a mall fits into anything.  The "tower sacrifice" of things like 9/11 and Grenfell Tower are obvious reenactments of the Tower of Babel.

       That being said: thinking religions have prophesied modern events is putting the cart before the horse.  It's real easy to "predict" your own plans, ya know?

       but I don't know how much faith I put into it myself.  It's a useful tool for abstract research but I can't see it as any sort of real proof of anything.

       You know it’s shady when the number 666 is brought up. The oldest and more reliable Biblical manuscripts have the number as 669. 666 and it’s “connections” is some imaginary fairy tale.

       I do wonder if the change of 666 to 616 is one of the (numerous) "Mandela Effect" changes in
       <em>
        Le Holy Bible

       .  Either way, that little fact adds a bit more weight to my 116 theory.

       It's no coincidence that the UK's emergency number is 999, just as it's no coincidence it's 911 in the US.  There's a concerted effort to have people (subconsciously) associate fear with these numbers.

       Interesting theory OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m of the opinion that most, if not all, “terror” events in the mainstream media are fiction. Nobody gets hurt, let alone gets killed. It’s all just made for TV entertainment to keep the zombie masses enthralled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without wishing to get bogged down on whether or not I’m right about that (which is a waste of time), do you think the symbology still holds if these events are manufactured and stage-managed, thereby ensuring physical harm to bystanders is actually
       <em>
        minimised
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d say yes, it does. If enough people believe something is real then it may as well be real. All the symbolic effects are the same without the many downsides of actual murder.

      <p>
       I lean that way too, but it's not just the symbolic effects that are the same,  they have used these "attacks" to justify a very real police state, and several very real wars.

       Almost entirely with implied or explicit consent. We all tolerate these violations to stay within the perimeter of a societal sandbox constructed for the exclusive benefit of those who created it. A group that long ago entrenched themselves outside of it to guarantee the survival of their bloodlines.

       No idea. It’s logical to assume that recorded history which cannot be personally verified may as well be fake, and likely is fake, to whatever extent is needed to maintain the containment sandbox; in fact, this is the

       So you're not saying that something like Vietnam, or WW2 were completely fake, just that it was much different than we were told, and they are lying for whatever propaganda reasons they might have?   Personally I've just been noticing the fakery post 9/11, but I suppose it's logical that it has been going on for longer than that.

       Nobody is forcing anyone to live inside the system. It’s just easier to do so. Much, much easier. Hence “consent”.

      <p>
       That surveillance relies on a baseline amount of consenting participation. The state cannot be omniscient outside its own boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is surveillance possible if the state doesn’t know you exist? If you chose to live “off the grid”, receiving no taxable income and consuming or bartering with the spoils of the land and your personal labour instead?
      </p>
      <p>
       Admittedly I don’t live by those rules myself, I’m on reddit for starters... but it’s theoretically possible.

       Absolutely.  Ultimately it's all about consciousness and collective belief.  The only reason

       makes
       <em>

       I get the point, but arithmetic is an objectively provable construct. The semantics don’t make any difference to the outcome. Subjective examples of collective beliefs are language, culture and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to convince me otherwise though!
      </p>
      <p>
       Understanding subjective vs objective truth leads one to a certain conclusion:  that observed reality is the product of a relatively small amount of objective truths surrounded by layer upon layer of subjective lies, misdirection, deception and voluntary capitulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We each project a synthetic version of reality, most of which the zombie herd gobbles up directly from the media trough. Then confirmation biases and feedback loops reinforce those projections as “truth” in our minds.

       One thing I’m truly fascinated in is old religious scriptures as well as tribal mythology and looking at them through a mondernntechnological lense. This guy mentions on the page you linked that “Star” refers to nuclear power plant. Well, that makes sense as stars are basically nuclear reactors and changes the entire meaning of the scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, Native American culture mentioning flaming dragons from the sky seems like an interpratation of a space ship but nothing to relate it to.

       It may be that there are certain things that are objectively wrong in the world, precisely and fundamentally in (and not despite) their impact as psychic events, the marker of their objective wrongness would then be their subsequent manifestation as spontaneously occurring material/empirical phenomena in unfolding time.

       It was a mall fire in Russia.  I'm (of course) suspicious of such things but couldn't to begin to see how the symbolism of a mall fits into anything.  The "tower sacrifice" of things like 9/11 and Grenfell Tower are obvious reenactments of the Tower of Babel.

       That being said: thinking religions have prophesied modern events is putting the cart before the horse.  It's real easy to "predict" your own plans, ya know?

       <em>
        interesting

       but I don't know how much faith I put into it myself.  It's a useful tool for abstract research but I can't see it as any sort of real proof of anything.
