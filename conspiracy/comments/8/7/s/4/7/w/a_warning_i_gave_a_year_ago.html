If you posting information about your personal life on places like reddit, make sure you are scrubbing those accounts.  It won&#39;t keep you safe from the government, but it will help keep people from figuring out who you are.  If you make a new account, make sure you nuke the last one.  I like to change accounts on reddit at least once a year.  Karma is a number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if we were to completely extricate ourselves from all of our connected devices - ceasing any form of direct online interaction - we are already well past the point of no return. </p>

<p>Heh...&quot;deleting&quot; your information from Facebook, Google, wherever,  and/or &quot;closing/deleting&quot; your accounts is an utterly futile exercise. Our information has been so extensively disseminated into the databases of organizations that we have never even heard of, it is literally impossible to wipe our footprints away. Each and every one of us have been profiled, cataloged and contained. They know more out us then we know about ourselves.</p>

<p>Our most intimate and private information is routinely flying around the interwebs, through our medical records, credit card/atm activities, and any and every company we do business with on a daily basis. Utilities, groceries stores, even our own vehicles. Facial recognition advances have wiped out any hope of our ability to control our privacy. Walk into many of our major grocery chains, and you are immediately registered/identified via your image, and (if you have your wifi on and in certain cases, even if you don&#39;t, just via apps and your mobile connection) your mobile device, and your loyalty card if you have one. They record where you go in the store, and even where you look on a shelf, then coordinate the information with what you actually end up purchasing, parsing it back to your &#39;unique user id&#39; to update your continually evolving profile.</p>

<p>The only thing left that we can do is accept the inevitable. AI is setting itself up to rule the human race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think at this point the chilling effect of the Panopticon is more dangerous than the information they have on us. If we take the Snowden revelations at face value (this recent FB shit is irrelevant), then we truly do have no privacy, neither from the government itself, nor any of the private contractors and every other private company they can share that data with. If PGP encryption isn&#39;t breakable with quantum computers today, it will be in 5 years, 10 tops. </p>

<p>I think that really leaves us with two options: never do anything online that would be seen as subversive at all (meaning this sub, for sure), or speak out loudly and more unabashedly. &quot;They&quot; don&#39;t just want to suck up all your data, they want you to <em>know</em> they&#39;re sucking up all your data, because the last thing they want is for real communication to break out amongst the populace. </p>
