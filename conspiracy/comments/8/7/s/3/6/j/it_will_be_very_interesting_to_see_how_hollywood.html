       Already on r/television and other default subs, there is a crazy amount of shilling going on to defend Dan Schneider, and pointing out that there is "zero proof" of him doing anything to anyone and that it's all just rumors.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's how these people operate. They minimize potential witnesses so that it all comes down to a he said/she said argument which no lawyer or judge would ever touch, especially against powerful people.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Kevin Spacey admitted to touching underage boys, the media was VERY quick to shifting the conversation strictly to Weinstein and inappropriate behavior with
       <em>
        adult
       </em>
       actresses, and started the whole #MeToo thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that such a prominent kid show creator in Hollywood is close to the chopping block, it will be interesting to see how they'll try to deflect the conversation away from pedophilia in Hollywood. And the more I see people claiming that because there is no PROOF, that this is all just a witch hunt, the more hypocritical everyone in the #MeToo movement will look. We all look back at all the Weinstein references and think "Wow, EVERYONE knew for so long. Why didn't anyone do anything!?" Well, that's why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, just ranting. If anyone has some more thoughts on any of this I'd love to get a good conversation going.

       It's not just that there isn't any proof, there have been zero actresses to accuse him of ANYTHING. Once again, there is no credible proof that Dan Schneider is a pedophile. This LARP is insane.

       Here's the thing. Past 2 years, when someone says we'll see what happens or only time will tell, the person is usually right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no problem with you saying there's no proof, but once their is (if) I'm sure you'll be saying you assumed it.

       So much shit get buried, of course only time will tell. Set a reminder for 1 month.

       Him getting fired was a LARP?

       And LARP isn't even the right term to use here.  Sounds like you are kinda spouting off for some reason.

       Pedophilia is protected because it touches people with real power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take Bryan Singer for example - the average pedophile predator...He's gone radio silent and no new stories have come out against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, who does he know that has the power to silence the media like that? Why would they feel the need to silence the media the way they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to bet that Dan knows some very powerful people himself and will be protected.
I mean, he was given a 7 million dollar "thanks for playing" golden parachute. 
I'm yet to hear about any of his shows being cancelled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stories about him will go away and nothing will happen.

       I almost feel bad.  You know they're all entrapped and considering you are just what you learn, they're likely bred into this before they're even aware.  Gotta destroy the system and those involved will pay, but just seems like some of these people were likely never given a real chance and it just hardens them quickly to cope, otherwlse we likely have more like Kurt Cobain, Chester Bennington, and Chris Cornell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Geez this just makes me think about all those celebrities and how many were likely unable to cope with learning the truth knowing no option out of it other than OD, busted, or continue.

       I don't know how much stock I buy in it but a while back there was a blind that included him and Dan in reference to a meeting they had.
Where the cards came out so to speak and they came to an agreement. Now with the alleged coup going on at the top with Viacom it may be ending. I think however that he will still remain protected because it touches too many people of real power. I doubt they'll let him become disgraced like Weinstein. I doubt anyone wants Dan talking about what he knows.

       Apparently Sumner is a creep himself who was blackmailed by Dan, and that was how he had his protection. This might have been according to the same blind. What really leads credit to it, is that back in the day Dan Schneider was good with computers. It is likely that from email servers he found the information he now blackmails Sumner with.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is the case it makes sense that he was let go now. Sumner is likely ill or close to dying with his age, meaning he can not protect Dan anymore.
