       I deactivated Facebook a few months ago but found out recently that people can still search for you and send you messages even after you've done that.  Don't believe me?  Even if you don't have the app installed, you can go to Messenger.com and log in and see all the messages people have been sending you even if you haven't used Facebook in ages.  I had people complain that I wasn't responding to them even when I thought I had it completely gone from my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way to turn this off.  I found this page of instructions for how to deactivate it from the Messenger app, but it says to go to Privacy &amp; Terms and there should be a link to deactivate it, but there is no link to do that anywhere.  They removed any possible way to get rid of it.  I was asking in a different thread if anyone knew how to get rid of Messenger and no one could tell me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am really, really frustrated by this.  I hate thinking that Messenger still has my account open and available out there to track any messages people send me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am thinking to just delete my Facebook account entirely at this point.

       I can't tell if you're serious or not, but I really want to know... if I delete Facebook will it delete the Messenger part too?  Like, will people no longer be able to search for me and send me messages?  I know that Messenger is some kind of separate entity now but I really want the entire thing gone from existence.

       I'm not saying I'm right but when I've deleted it in past it doesn't actually do anything apart from signing you out and takes a little longer to sign back in after, and I don't believe it does anything to/with messenger. I think people can still search for you and that.
Just wanna say this is how I believe it works they're are way smarter people out there that should know better/more than me soz

       I think I am going to do it.  I don't know why I feel attached to it.  I haven't used it in months and I deactivated it already so it shouldn't make any difference.

       Deactivating your account is not much more than logging out. People can’t tag you or write on your timeline, but all your previous tags, likes, comments, etc are still there and visible. Messenger still works as well, only difference being that people on the website will not see you as online/offline but can still send messages if they know your name.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get rid of Messenger totally you need to delete the Facebook account that it’s tied to. It currently takes two weeks for the deletion to process, just in case you “change your mind “ so don’t log in or you’ll have to delete it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can confirm that this also deletes Messenger. A friend and I both recently deactivated our accounts, we both could still use Messenger. A week later I went through with the deletion, and she texted me as she could not contact me through Messenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don’t know if this works if you set up the account with a phone number instead of an email.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t be fooled though, they already have whatever info you’ve given them and whatever else they’ve taken. Deleting your account only means that you no longer have access, they’ll do what they please with that data.

       Messenger is just the standalone version of Facebook chat. They used to be essentially one thing but now they are two.  You don't even need a Facebook account to use Messenger anymore.  And once you sign up for Messenger, you can't get rid of it or turn it off.

       Yes... they can find you on messenger even if you had a FB account any point in the past.  That's how I found out that you can't delete your info from Messenger or disable it at all.  Some people were sending me messages even after I disabled Facebook... I thought my entire account was invisible and nope.  They still could look me up and message me.

       You can't uninstall the FB app on any of the phones in my house. It's always freaked me me. I've disabled it as much as possible, denied any permissions, etc. But I know.

       I did the same thing but when I go to app details its still useing data. I havr all permissions turned off, deaticavted both FB and messenger apps, and even took all updates off of them before deactivated. Even after all that its still useing data. I have an LG V30. I have contacted LG multiple times and still no response.

       How did you deactivate Messenger??  That's what this whole entire post is about!  I can't find a way to do it!  Do you just mean that you uninstalled it from your phone?  Because even if you don't have it installed you know you can still go to Messenger.com and access it there... people can still find you and send you messages.

       Oh there's no way to deactivate it to my knowledge. I was just adding on that at least on the LG V30 you cannot uninstall the apps and even when deactivated they still transfer data

       But will it also delete my account from Messenger??  Because all I am seeing online through the many searches I have done is that even if I delete Facebook, that doesn't delete your account from Messenger and people can STILL find and message you!

       Nah, I deactivated it months ago and haven't felt any urge to use Facebook.  The only reason I am posting about this is because people said they were messaging me through messenger.  I was really shocked to realize that messenger stays active even if you deactivate Facebook.  I think I am probably just going to delete it.

       It will only be a few more years before I get rid of my electronics entirely and rely on the Library for any internet needs.

       The Telescreen from Nineteen Eighty Four exists,  and it is built into the vast majority of the electronics we own. The only question is, when will they
       <strong>
        fully
       </strong>
       implement the system they've already built and distributed?
      </p>
      <p>
       "The telescreen recieved and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever the wanted to. You had to live- did live, from habit that became instinct- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.

       This is like saying, I deleted Outlook and if I log into my email's web portal, my emails are still there. It makes no sense to not understand this is the expected behavior. Facebook servers store all your chat, not their application to interface the chat.

       I know it must be frustrating not getting a straight answer to what seems like a very simple question. However, it is truly a very murky &amp; way past too deep subject, with no simple answers at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end-all definitive reply is a hard no. 
Once you have a FB account, it's for life. No matter your approval/disapproval.
      </p>
      <p>
       This includes all services used/offered by FB. Specifically speaking, messenger. There is no way, at all, evereverer, to NOT have messenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only options available to you can be found in FB account settings. While far from ideal, these options can &amp; will effectively LIMIT how findable youare.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can choose to not allow your profile or photos you've posted to show up in any search engine results (such as Google Search,) you can choose to not allow people to search for you on FB by entering your email address or phone number, you can choose to not allow anyone to tag you in future photos or link your profile to a future post they make, and you can choose to not allow people to send you messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you're at it, don't forget to also do all of these things for Instagram because they're intrinsically linked. Also, don't forget your Google privacy settings. Again, linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I recently discovered that you can have a messenger account even if you don't have a FB account. I found that interesting.

       Do you have to reactivate Facebook to change the setting to not allow people to search for me on Messenger?  I am willing to reactivate it if I have to do that from FB.  I just want it out of my life.  Now that I know how intrusive Facebook/Messenger are, I am so freaked out that I can't control the accounts I created years ago.
