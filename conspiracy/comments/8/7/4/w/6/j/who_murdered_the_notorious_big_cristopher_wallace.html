        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay, the murder of Biggie has stumped me. All the suspects and possible motives that lead to several possible killers has confused me. I&#39;ve spent time collecting evidence on the topic and came up with the most likely situation. 
-It is obvious that the killing was well planned, the shooter would have to have known which car Biggie was in and which seat. This would have relied on constant communication between the killer and a possible &#39;spotter&#39;; watching biggies every move. The more the planning, the higher the motive is likely to be. This pretty much rules out a gang hit as Biggie reportedly owed the Crips a large amount of money.
- Witnesses reported hearing police radios towards the exit of the Peterson Automobile Museum. 4 black muslims wearing black suits and bowties. The shooter was also reported as being black muslim wearing a black suit and a bowtie. 
- A &#39;dirty&#39; cop named David Mack had used radios and meticulous planning to steal $772,000 from a bank. He is rumoured to be part of the shooting. 
- When detectives went to Mack&#39;s house after the bank robbery, the found a shrine to Tupac Shakur in his garage. Bearing in mind that police uncovered that David Mack was on Death Row Record&#39;s (a rival to Biggie, also Tupac&#39;s label) payroll. 
- Also, detectives found five 9mm handguns, the gun used to murder Biggie, and a cabinet full of ammo of foreign origin. The brand used to kill Biggie was &#39;Geco&#39;, which is very rarely used in the US. This ammunition was found in Mack&#39;s house. 
- A key eyewitness, Damien Butler, was sat right behind Biggie when he was killed. He picked Mack&#39;s photo out of a lineup and said he saw him at the carport and when they went in and out of the Peterson Automobile Museum. </p>

<p>We now have a eyewitness recount placing Mack at the scene, near where police radios were heard. Another big clue was the shooter possibly had a middle-eastern name, possible &#39;Amir&#39;. When detectives looked at the people who had visited Mack in jail, they found a record off a guy named &#39;Amir Muhammed&#39; visiting him. It turns out Muhammed had left a false social security number and address on the visitor form, further raising suspicions. They found 7-8 previous addresses, all of which no good. When Detective Poole of the LAPD wanted to follow this lead up, his superiors denied him. They knew it was going to lead to a cop. This is just like the Rampart scandal, and example of the LAPD refusing to follow leads that led to a cop. By this point, the detectives had no doubt enough evidence to warrant the following up of Mack, but it was never done. Another point would be that the credibility of Poole&#39;s evidence can more or less be confirmed. XXL magazine spoke to former bosses, DAs, attorneys etc. All of which said he is to be trusted. </p>

<p>In most gangland killings, there is no evidence. However there was a minimum of 2 witnesses that produced a composite drawing that closely resembles Amir Muhammed. I don&#39;t know how to insert an image so if you type &#39;Composite drawing of biggies killer&#39; it is there.</p>

<p>This evidence took a long time to compile, feel free to leave your theories in the comments.</p>

<p>EDIT
Here is the image of the main suspect of the murder based on my evidence, his name is Amir Muhammad with the alias of Harry Billups.

I&#39;m 50/50 on Big, part of me thing that Pac&#39;s influence was big enough that a die hard Pac fan could have flipped thinking Big had something to do with Pac&#39;s death (given mafuckas still thought he set him up with Jimmy Henchman at the studio) and killed Big. Being an advocate of body language, Puff&#39;s body language was foul when he talked about Big&#39;s death... like he know something....  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orlando Lane killed Pac, people involved have confessed over the past few years, Keefe D etc. A big player known in the streets. Orlando is his nephew. They&#39;re south side crips.</p>

<p>Puff had a &#39;hit&#39; on Suge &amp; Pac through Zip/Keefes crew, though it was more drunk talk from what I gather, but it wasn&#39;t planned - Zip, Keefe and Orlando were in Vegas for the fight too, Keefe was strapped in the white caddy. Orlando was in the lobby waiting for them to meet. One of Pacs crew got jumped in the mall previously by Orlando &amp; crew and got the Death Row chain snatched. Orlando wore it and got kinda fame in the streets.  Dude saw Orlando (Orlando was well known too in the crips), told Pac etc. they jumped him. Some say Orlando was wearing the chain when he got jumped but not sure.</p>

<p>So later after the fight Pac &amp; Suge etc. were gonna go to club 662. That night though it was full of Southsiders/crips (videos of that night on youtube) Not sure if they heard and changed plans or what but they were driving one way, white caddy with Zip and them passed as Pac was out the sunroof being Pac and hollering at girls.</p>

<p>Caddy uturns, follows them to the lights, rolls down the window and Orlando shoots from the back seat.</p>

<p>Pac dies, Suge puts out 10k for any SS Crip dead. Gang war kicks off a bit. Cops raid.</p>

<p>Its known on the southside what happened and Orlando got fame obviously, but was shot and killed not long after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Biggie’s music better. He has a better catalogue as far as just more listenable songs.</p>

<p>Tupac had a message/point of view, being the son of two Black Panthers. I dunno about ‘real.’ He wasn’t a street kid. He went to Baltimore School for the Arts and was active in poetry drama, etc. in high school in Baltimore and California. He wasn’t from some hood where all of his friends were being killed or going to prison before they turned 20. Both of them projected a persona but neither were raised in the ‘thug life.’</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree on the cataloge, even though Life After Death is top 5 for me. What&#39;s your definition of &#39;street kid&#39; though? Sell rocks? Gang affiliation? He grew up in poverty, simple as that. He had a gift, so he decided to use his mind n that gift and do something better than dumb shit that was going on around him. He went back home, saw all the BS going on around him, even though he was clean, being black and being from the neighborhood&#39;s he was from, he was labelled a thug without explanation. That&#39;s where &#39;thug life&#39; came from, a voice against the power. Biggy didn&#39;t do shit but wear a school uniform. Moved to Brooklyn, heard good stories and created a gangster persona, &quot;I got a story to tell&quot;, is a true story, but it was not Big who robbed Anthony Mason lol..... That mafucka could flow though.... </p>

<p>But none of that matters to me. I like Biggie’s music better. That’s all that’s ‘real’ as far as I’m concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said he was a street thug kid, I just said he grew up in poverty. If ya never grew up in the hood then it&#39;s hard to understand. Police have a different set of rules for these neighborhoods. Biggy wasn&#39;t influenced by what he saw though, he would have been rapping about private school, white kids, n getting picked up after school in a nice car lol.....  If that&#39;s what you listen to music for, then all the power to ya, you are entitled to you opinion.....  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn’t.</p>

<p>Rolling Stones weren’t street fighting men but Street Fighting Man is a great song. Gordon Lightfoot wrote Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald based on a story he read in Newsweek or Time. I could go on and on.</p>

<p>Biggie’s music is more appealing to me than Tupac’s. If you played their 5 or 10 best songs for 100 people who knew nothing of either artist, I figure most would like Biggie’s better.</p>

<p>But everybody likes what they like. I like some of Tupac’s stuff but I think he was in a slave contract (kinda ironic) and just churned out stuff day and night because he had to. His better work is awesome, but a lot of it seems less inspired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t feel any of those songs though - so you may like them but a lot of people won&#39;t. I just feel music is all. We will have to agree to disagree about Pac n Big. I will 100% agree with you about Nas though, he to me is the GOAT. His discography is stellar, Nastradamus was his worse, and still have some gems on it n cleans out most the shit today. Brings us back to real vs fake though lol, Nas was real, Hova was fake... Nas murdered him on wax yet Hova got the commercial success. sorta fucked up....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically if you read Poole&#39;s book LAbyrinth, it tells exactly that. There&#39;s no way all those cops working the desk/parties/security off record for death row, along with witnesses and people being silenced, it almost all comes back to Muhammad/Billups. Highly recommend that book. Straight from the man himself (RIP POOLE) who was lead on the case and had enough to prosecute but was canned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely read it, it was great. So much info and things you may not know, I never heard half the stuff in there. It&#39;s all a big murder/coverup by police/gangs/record labels/money makers galore. So many cops were working off record for gangs and record labels, banging each other&#39;s wives, selling drugs and guns trying to do the &quot;mafia&quot; thing. Super complex web, I don&#39;t even know how people get that deep into shit, it&#39;s so hard to comprehend. So many levels and layers of corruption. Definitely check the book out!!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, there is another story in the streets about this; don&#39;t know how mainstream it went. Anyways, Suge was obviously a blood, he wasn&#39;t high up or anything, he was bringing in coin, so he was protect. Yáll heard the story about when him n his goons beat down Easy over Dre&#39;s contract, how he pricked Easy with a needle, that had HIV, which ultimately led to his quick demise. His promiscuousness was a good cover story. (They always say the story is Suge called Easy, this is false, Dre called Easy to set up the meeting with Suge, he didnt know about the needle, thats why everytime Dre talks about Easy, you see guilt and voice often cracks). Easy was a Crip, Kelly Park Compton Crips, he never bragged or nothing, but he was a made man. So when they got word about how he died and Suge was responsible, they went and saw him..... made a deal, he gets to live but they would come collect at some point. 2pac was that point. </p>
