       10 years ago we were friends with Putin. Now we're at war with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 years ago the MSM constantly warned us about DOSE EBIL MOOSLEMS. Now they're like #NotAllMuslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 years ago conservatism was mainstream. Now its the counter-culture (according to PJW).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did all these things change? In case you don't know what an Orwellian Retcon is, it's a reference to 1984 in which Oceania constantly flip-flops between fighting Eurasia and Eastasia, hence the phrase "We have always been at war with Eurasia/Eastasia."
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone help me explain what has happened?

       Are you aware of the petro dollar and how the US hegemony influences our Foriegn policy?  If you're not, no worries, it isn't exactly a hot topic in the MSM since the 70's.  If you Are, this

       FYI: You're possibly witnessing one of the most I influential geo political moves in decades... tomorrow China fires up their petro-Yuan and it will greatly impact the petro dollar.  I'm even curious if Saudi Arabia will hope on board, that's a huge linch pin for the petro dollar.

       10 years ago, Russian intelligence was not accused of attacking a political party's private emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's okay though because republicans don't care about foreign governments attacking their political rivals. One can only hope China attacks the republicans for shit talking them.

      <p>
       I won't say one word. I'll be the one with the, "China was our friends" post while republicans say they were attacked.

       speaking of Orwellian...how Orwellian is it for someone with an antifa username to be speaking of something about hacked emails as an "attack". It's not even clear from history about wars which started from physical attacks actually happened, and now they want us to believe that "attacks" are happening with electrons and bits of data.

       Because a decade of change affects who the US's allies and enemies are, changes popular perception on groups of people and opens people's eyes to discrimination, because culture and counter-culture are always changing (although I don't agree with you that conservatism was mainstream 10 years ago and isn't now). Ten years is a long time in relation to the zeitgeist.

       Total fucking nonsense. Annexation of Crimea, invasion of Ukraine, shootdown of MH17, multiple assassinations (Litvinenko, Nemtsov, Skripal, etc.), international sanctions, kicking Russia out of the G8, 2016 election interference- any of this ring a bell?

       US relations with Putin were, at best, "It's Complicated." There's always been pushback against stereotyping all Muslims after 9/11. And "counter-culture" conservatives are just trying to sound cool for a younger audience while playing the victim of those meaniepants liberals.

       What happened is the Democrats got humiliated in an election they were supposed to win to Donald Trump in epic fashion. The GOP also looked like fool after Trump dragged his orange ballsack all over their champions faces.

       So instead of taking the blame, the uniparty makes false accusations so an outsider to the club never wins again.

       Nah, pretty sure it was the fact that the Trump campaign was stocked to the brim with illegally unregistered foreign agents compromised by Russia (like Flynn and Manafort), and that Trump campaign people kept showing up in communications with known Russian intelligence assets (and then lying about it). Also Trump's foreign policy advisor drunkenly bragging that Russia hacked the DNC months before it was publicly known.

       First of all, any narrative from PJW or other so-called "classical liberal" edgelords ought to be thrown out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alignment of America's foreign policy is insane and stupid, but I don't think the narrative they're spinning is out of the ordinary.  What happened is simple - the neocons went to the Democratic Party, at the invitation of the Clintons, and CNN/MSNBC/et al changed their messaging to embrace and rehabilitate the neocons.  Of course, the organs of the American capitalist class - the MSM you're talking about, and both political parties - were always for the wars and everything they entailed, going back to Desert Storm and well before that.  The American press and information channels (including the Internet) are under tight control.  The only difference is which talking heads are saying what things, and that Hillary Clinton is a crazy and evil woman who threw a fit after losing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real mindscrew will come when the media tries to rehabilitate straight-up fascism - and you'll know when that's happening when you read wall-to-wall news articles about how the disabled are life-unworthy-of-life and how the SSI/SSDI system needs to be abolished right now.  (There's certainly a lot of that in the media among conservatives and among elitist liberals, but imagine those stories appearing EVERYWHERE, to the point where you can't avoid them - that's when you know they're gearing up to not just take away their money, but their lives.)

       Because Putin is fighting mass immigration across the board by supporting nationalist political parties and so is fucking up the NWO divide-and-conquer agenda  (21). Keep the EU and US distracted and in a state of near-civil war, by pumping into their countries a never-ending stream of foreigners and cheap labour. He is empowering sovereign nations when their governments want you to think that the most pressing problem is which bathroom a trans person gets to use.
