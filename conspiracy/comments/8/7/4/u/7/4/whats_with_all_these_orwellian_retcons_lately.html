        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>10 years ago we were friends with Putin. Now we&#39;re at war with him.</p>

<p>10 years ago the MSM constantly warned us about DOSE EBIL MOOSLEMS. Now they&#39;re like #NotAllMuslims.</p>

<p>10 years ago conservatism was mainstream. Now its the counter-culture (according to PJW).</p>

<p>Why did all these things change? In case you don&#39;t know what an Orwellian Retcon is, it&#39;s a reference to 1984 in which Oceania constantly flip-flops between fighting Eurasia and Eastasia, hence the phrase &quot;We have always been at war with Eurasia/Eastasia.&quot;</p>

<p>Can anyone help me explain what has happened?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, any narrative from PJW or other so-called &quot;classical liberal&quot; edgelords ought to be thrown out.</p>

<p>The alignment of America&#39;s foreign policy is insane and stupid, but I don&#39;t think the narrative they&#39;re spinning is out of the ordinary.  What happened is simple - the neocons went to the Democratic Party, at the invitation of the Clintons, and CNN/MSNBC/et al changed their messaging to embrace and rehabilitate the neocons.  Of course, the organs of the American capitalist class - the MSM you&#39;re talking about, and both political parties - were always for the wars and everything they entailed, going back to Desert Storm and well before that.  The American press and information channels (including the Internet) are under tight control.  The only difference is which talking heads are saying what things, and that Hillary Clinton is a crazy and evil woman who threw a fit after losing.</p>

<p>The real mindscrew will come when the media tries to rehabilitate straight-up fascism - and you&#39;ll know when that&#39;s happening when you read wall-to-wall news articles about how the disabled are life-unworthy-of-life and how the SSI/SSDI system needs to be abolished right now.  (There&#39;s certainly a lot of that in the media among conservatives and among elitist liberals, but imagine those stories appearing EVERYWHERE, to the point where you can&#39;t avoid them - that&#39;s when you know they&#39;re gearing up to not just take away their money, but their lives.)</p>
