       Eclipse is a software IDE for Java, C, C++ among other many other things. I'm not sure how Leader's technology was integrated into it though.

       I'm glad you like the post but I was aiming more toward exposing a conspiracy regarding another post. There is a lot of info in the links that might be able to help you. You can also do a search for leader technologies lawsuit. You do bring to light some good questions from a different angle that I wasn't looking at.

       So I was looking at the Eclipse source code just now. The OP article claims that the Eclipse source code grew by something like 100MB.
       <a href="http://archive.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">
        Eclipse 2.0.1
       </a>
       was only 38MB. I don't see the connection here, unless something was purged. I wasn't using Eclipse that long ago to remember it.

       Seems related to the Great Man theory of history. People like to make organizational actions about one specific person. It's easier to care about a subject once you put a face to it, whether they're playing the hero or the villain.

       I was an expert witness in one of the Leader Technologies lawsuits against Facebook. See
       <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/l5u4jb8b/delaware-district-court/leader-technologies-inc-v-facebook-inc/">
        https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/l5u4jb8b/delaware-district-court/leader-technologies-inc-v-facebook-inc/
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=23863125&amp;amp;z=1b74103b">
        https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=23863125&amp;amp;z=1b74103b
       </a>
       . My impression from the case was that Leader was at some point granted an overly broad patent that it thought should cover social networking. It didn't. The company's link to Facebook is tangential at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ComplaintsBoard link in this post (above) is the work of Diego MasMarques, formerly known as Diego Mas Howard, a convicted murderer and apparent rapist who is upset with me because his various cases—all of them public domain material—are displayed on PlainSite, a legal transparency site I run. See
       <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/profiles/masmarques-diego/">
        https://www.plainsite.org/profiles/masmarques-diego/
       </a>
       . For the past year, MasMarques has harassed my family and me over this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, all of this is nonsense.

       I was leaning that direction after looking at all the info. It's hard to trust anything I see on the TV or internet anymore, but my gut says you are right. Thanks for the info. Regardless, I still think everyone that still uses Facebook had better delete that crap.

       I think they are reaching in trying to claim patent infringement.  Zuckerberg is stealing everyone's info no doubt, but I think the truth lies somewhere else, like his college classmates or something. I would love to see Facebook erased from history. We need better proof damning him. Fuck that guy and everything he claims to have created.

       Surprise, Surprise. I don't believe you had anything to do with FB. I'm not going to your website. I'm sure anyone that exposes your work is a rapist and murderer. 
You certainly were NOT an "expert witness" in the Leader lawsuit, I already have copies.

       Wow thinkcomp so he is upset at you for putting his name in Google Search.  Sounds like you are trying to taunt him. Since you mentioned he has harassed your family. Has Dr. Neil Greenspan informed Case Western Reserve University campus security. Seems as if you and your family are putting all the students on campus in danger.

       Here are so other sites. I read about about Aaron Greenspan and Dr. Neil S Greenspan at case western reserve university and Judi Greenspan running fake charities.   The entire facecash project got closed down because Aaron Greenspan was a felon.  Does he really have STDs.
I wouldn't trust a word from Aaron Greenspan.  Look at these complaints.

       Aaron Geenspan is psycho. Aaron Greenspan has even hit a new low. Aaron Greenspan is an obsessive stalker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaron Greenspan is a pathological liar who lies without effor. Aaron J Greenspan Is someone for whom telling a lie comes more naturally than telling the truth.   Its part of aaron Greenspan everyday life, to the point where their whole existence is a fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all roots to Aaron Greenspan childhood trauma growing up in shaker Hights. Aaron Greenspan didnt have any friends . No one liked him. Not even his twin brother Simon Greenspan who more severely autistic. Aaron Greenspan is very insecure individual raised by very authoritative and strict parents who were not excepting to Aaron having Aspergers. Therefore Aaron Greenspan had to create a persona that was lovable and acceptable by Judi keene Greenspan  and Dr. Neil S. Greenspan to avoid punishment, embarrassment, and vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pathological lying can be difficult to treat there isn't hope for Aaron Greenspan. Aaron Greenspan understands he has Asperger Syndrome and is ashamed by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaron Greenspan brother Simon keene Greenspan is autistic as well  has caused huge disturbances in shaker heights. We were all afraid of him had the police called over 100 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaron Greenspan is a big supporter of the 2nd amendment and brags about a gun. The 2 should not mix. This is insane how one crazy white guy is able to own so much free data and also own a gun. IRS and FBI need to investigate. Aaron Greenspan avoids paying the IRS. Neil S Greenspan is the nutty professor at case western reserve university.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaron Jacob Greenspan is a ticking time bomb. Normal people would not stalker others like Aaron Greenspan is doing.
