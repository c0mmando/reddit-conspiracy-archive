    <div class="md"><p>I was an expert witness in one of the Leader Technologies lawsuits against Facebook. See <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/l5u4jb8b/delaware-district-court/leader-technologies-inc-v-facebook-inc/">https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/l5u4jb8b/delaware-district-court/leader-technologies-inc-v-facebook-inc/</a> and <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=23863125&amp;amp;z=1b74103b">https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=23863125&amp;amp;z=1b74103b</a>. My impression from the case was that Leader was at some point granted an overly broad patent that it thought should cover social networking. It didn&#39;t. The company&#39;s link to Facebook is tangential at best.</p>

<p>The ComplaintsBoard link in this post (above) is the work of Diego MasMarques, formerly known as Diego Mas Howard, a convicted murderer and apparent rapist who is upset with me because his various cases—all of them public domain material—are displayed on PlainSite, a legal transparency site I run. See <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/profiles/masmarques-diego/">https://www.plainsite.org/profiles/masmarques-diego/</a>. For the past year, MasMarques has harassed my family and me over this issue.</p>

<p>Basically, all of this is nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aaron Greenspan had a shady past. Post here is that Aaron Greenspan had stds.  <a href="http://www.stdregistry.com/neil-s-greenspan-neil-greenspan-case-western-reserve-university-2.html">http://www.stdregistry.com/neil-s-greenspan-neil-greenspan-case-western-reserve-university-2.html</a></p>

<p>Here are so other sites. I read about about Aaron Greenspan and Dr. Neil S Greenspan at case western reserve university and Judi Greenspan running fake charities.   The entire facecash project got closed down because Aaron Greenspan was a felon.  Does he really have STDs.
I wouldn&#39;t trust a word from Aaron Greenspan.  Look at these complaints. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aaron Geenspan is psycho. Aaron Greenspan has even hit a new low. Aaron Greenspan is an obsessive stalker. </p>

<p>Aaron Greenspan is a pathological liar who lies without effor. Aaron J Greenspan Is someone for whom telling a lie comes more naturally than telling the truth.   Its part of aaron Greenspan everyday life, to the point where their whole existence is a fabrication.</p>

<p>This all roots to Aaron Greenspan childhood trauma growing up in shaker Hights. Aaron Greenspan didnt have any friends . No one liked him. Not even his twin brother Simon Greenspan who more severely autistic. Aaron Greenspan is very insecure individual raised by very authoritative and strict parents who were not excepting to Aaron having Aspergers. Therefore Aaron Greenspan had to create a persona that was lovable and acceptable by Judi keene Greenspan  and Dr. Neil S. Greenspan to avoid punishment, embarrassment, and vulnerability. </p>

<p>Pathological lying can be difficult to treat there isn&#39;t hope for Aaron Greenspan. Aaron Greenspan understands he has Asperger Syndrome and is ashamed by it. </p>

<p>Aaron Greenspan brother Simon keene Greenspan is autistic as well  has caused huge disturbances in shaker heights. We were all afraid of him had the police called over 100 times.  </p>

<p>Aaron Greenspan is a big supporter of the 2nd amendment and brags about a gun. The 2 should not mix. This is insane how one crazy white guy is able to own so much free data and also own a gun. IRS and FBI need to investigate. Aaron Greenspan avoids paying the IRS. Neil S Greenspan is the nutty professor at case western reserve university. </p>

<p>Aaron Jacob Greenspan is a ticking time bomb. Normal people would not stalker others like Aaron Greenspan is doing. </p>
