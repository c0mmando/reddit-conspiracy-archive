       If people at top minds of Reddit are so smart, according to them, every conspiracy theory is an idiot, then debating and a conspiracy theoist should not be a problem. Should it? Does online digital manipulation exist on reddit? Whose behind it? Who are the agent provocateurs?
      </p>
      <p>
       The way the people in top minds of Reddit talk about conspiracy theorists is so disgusting, so bigoted, unfunny, and so negative that they must address the core philosophy of their sub. If such a subreddit is solely about humor why are none of the jokes actually funny? If you look at every comment on that sub they are all very assholish. Is being an asshole funny? I beg to differ. You can clearly see how they react when the joke is turned around on them. Every comment I posted yesterday saying "pheephee" was reported for harassment. Yet they make fun of people all day. You don't like being called pheephee? Too bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's sub is just about humor, why does their most active moderator also run a sub dedicated to media manipulation? Why does Phoenix call
       <a href="/r/digital_manipulation">
        /r/digital_manipulation
       </a>
       his quote-unquote homework? If their sub is just about the lol's then should they not be involved in humorous subreddits? And not subreddits dedicated to cataloging user information, media manipulation, and metadata on Reddit communities?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe you're afraid to debate a conspiracy theorist, someone you have repeatedly called a dumbass and insane. It really shows the nature of your character, pheephee, that you have to hide behind your wall in tumor, just talk shit it makes you look really good. Address me in public like an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typical they already made a post mocking this thread. Very adult of them.

       Dunning-Kruger effect hits the nail on the head I believe, they can't see further than their own thoughts and the ones ingrained by the control matrices. Hell, even Fallout 4 has more dialogue options than them.

       I got some private messages from users I do not know saying that you are indeed unbanned. If you want a debate, we should plan it carefully, not spam them, just find users willing to come and set a time somewhere tomorrow preferably.

       Pheephee's reaspnse. I guess I won the debate since he is too weak to show up.

       I don't barely use the report function in any sub, nor do I even d/upvote people that much. Same habits for over a decade now. Here's a thought, perhaps (and to quote a fine-good pal): "We're winning. I have more support than you'll ever know".
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, consider that the audience simply doesn't want that sub, or the other 9 you've posted in repeatedly to be used in that manner. Keep it going though, it's hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's baffling as to why the mods in these subs are allowing that to continue. "Fighting back", are ya?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're merely exasperating your own issues further, which will undoubtedly lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       E:

      <p>
       They banned me after I came into tmor to defend myself from the multiple posts calling me insane for my beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inaccurate. You were given ample opportunity to come here and speak your piece, 2.5 hours IIRC. Unsurprisingly, you didn't show, but rather wanted to maintain the appearance some force was holding back all of the truthy when it wasn't. Well, now it is, because I banned you myself."
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't informed of being unbanned until I was already banned again. Try again. If your mod logs were public people could easily see you're lying through your teeth, pheephee.

       Well, people say that the Freemasons are some sort of "gentleman's club", which I suppose is true to a certain extent.  What they don't tell you is that it is a cover for something more sinister.

       Morons are doing little but exposing their PR operation and best, exposing major operations at worst. Whenever you see TMOR going apeshit about [whatever] topic, calling you stupid for even considering it, spinning up multiple threads to make you look foolish.. you might be onto something.

       No, I just haven't had any trouble from anyone if I've posted talking about shills. There are lots of threads about shills here and even subs dedicated to exposing them.

      <p>
       Some users here have even got good at spotting them like that f_a_g_n_n guy or whoever it is. His posts are quite popular actually.

       I can't question the existence of shills because I know they exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I've encountered one or two in my time here but they generally don't engage in discussion at all or will cease discussion after exhausting their tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the real drivers of control here are virtue signalling self posts and this sort of obsequious commenting style that makes a mockery of anyone who engages them seriously.

       I won't mention any names here but back in the conspiratard days, one of their prolific members followed me around calling me a retard.  After looking at his history I discovered he was actually a mentally handicapped person still living with his parents at 40 and bagging groceries with 14 year olds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I called him on it and he made a big scene with the admins so I don't speak his name anymore.  But he is literally retarded and is allowed by the admins to run around here calling people retarded while insulting him is "off limits" because it's true in his case.

       Pretty much everything on Reddit is a double standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even Reddit requested a sub one time that had ZERO mods, the TMOR trolls didn't want me to have it so they found the guy who originally created, it had been abandoned for years, and they had him claim that he didn't mean to abandon it all supported by the well known vote brigades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well the admins awarded the sub to the guy who hadn't cared for years even though by their own rules the sub should have been awarded to me.  Then the guy just signed it over to the trolls and they set it to private where it sits unused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything on this site is a mix of a good ole boys network and hostile SJW administration.  They even retroactively suspended my account once for a new policy that didn't exist when I supposedly violated it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you look at how
       <a href="/r/the">
        /r/the
       </a>
       Donald isn't allowed to link to other subs because they are "disruptive" but TMOR is allowed to disrupt wholesale for years and the admins won't even respond to any discussion about it outside of a canned message that says they are looking into it.
      </p>

       Another conspiratard story. I had a user accusing me of being a horrible person for not banning people talking about the Holocaust.  I looked through his history and he was a drug addict who stole a classic car from his best friend's dad and crashed it on a dope binge, regularly steals cash from his elderly parents to fund his habit and probably gave his GF a nasty social disease from living loose on his drug fueled adventures... But he is morally sound enough by his own estimation to judge me in some capacity.  No no! Nevermind that he's literally what people mean when they talk about the armpit of society, we should listen to his virtue signaling because he is a proud socialist.

       I think you're giving them too much attention and power, it validates them.  Same playbook as DT actually: say a bunch of outlandish, incendiary shit to keep them talking about you, to stay in the headlines.  Look how easily America took the bait and the divisive climate it has brought.  I got banned from TMOR within seconds of visiting that shithole, and I'm proud of that.  Fuck those fools.  Forget about 'em.  Let them splash around all they want. They are pathetic.

       If you wanna fight the fight, go ahead, but there will always be assholes and trolls trying to rain on anyone's parade.  Is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for bickering with assholes, or is it for discussing conspiracies?  Use it how you wish.  I'm simply suggesting to ignore the folks who feed off the attention you give them.  If you keep trying to fight back the tides you'll just wear yourself out and drown.  It's not surrendering.  It's having the wisdom to not feed into it.  Let them have there stupid, arrogant little sub.  Who cares about those fucks?  They're obviously miserable losers as it is, if that's how they choose to spend their time.

       The debate is happening here so you can't just remove my comments when you start to lose. Nice try. But I'm not going to comment somewhere where I have been banned and apparently without being told unbanned repeatedly. You're track record is too off pitting to make me feel comfortable even engaging there again.

      <p>
       The debate is going to be serious. It isn't going to take place in a meme "humor" (harassment and bigotry) sub.

       I don't think that would work, because one of the most important debates to be had would be: is TMOR making reddit a better place, and do conspiratists deserve to be bullied? Both of which I highly doubt you would be able to represent the proposition to.
