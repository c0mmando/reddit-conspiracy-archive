<blockquote>
<p>Globalism is a group of ideologies that advocate the concept of globalization. It tends to advocate for such policies as increases in immigration, interventionism, and global governance. Economically, globalism varies between free trade and lowering tariffs to Marxist proletarian internationalism. It is typically viewed as opposite of nationalism, and has become increasingly divisive in politics in many developed countries, such as the United States.

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it. They admit to it themselves. </p>

<p>&quot;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent.&quot; <strong>—Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950</strong></p>

<p>&quot;We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.&quot; <strong>--David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission, in an address to a meeting of The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991</strong> </p>

<p>&quot;Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; invasion or Russians!!], whether real or promulgated [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.&quot; <strong>—Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991</strong></p>

<p>&quot;In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn&#39;t such a great idea after all.&quot; <strong>--Strobe Talbot, President Clinton&#39;s Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in Time, July 20th, l992</strong></p>

<p>&quot;For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot; <strong>—David Rockefeller&#39;s Memoirs (Random House, New York, 2002)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. <strong>—Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical. What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nationstates involved. As managers and creators of the system ,they will rule the future.&quot; <strong>—U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater in his l964 book: With No Apologies</strong></p>

<p>For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn&#39;t. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared &quot;ammunition&quot; in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... &quot;The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. &quot;The depression was the calculated &#39;shearing&#39; of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank. <strong>—Curtis Dall, FDR&#39;s son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but you could have said the exact same thing about urbanization pre-industrialization. People thought that moving to the cities would destroy the agricultural communities and ruin the ability to effectively travel and trade. In reality, it allowed for the creation of mass-production, destroyed the final vestiges of Feudalism (a super dysfunctional socioeconomic way to function), and allowed for a superior education system, a properly established middle class, and the (oft-brutal) advancement of any country that adapted it. </p>

<p>Russia did not properly adapt to urbanization, and serfdom continued to exist almost 100 years later for them. There were countries in the Russian empire that peasants much preferred to live in (looking at Siberia), because its population centres were better established and therefore had greater social mobility and a higher standard of living.</p>

<p>History has shown us that collectivism fuels progress. Look at the agrarian revolution, look at the Greek leagues and the Hellenic phenomenon, look at urbanization, look at colonialism (as messy as it was), look at the birth of nationalism. </p>

<p>I think globalism could be implemented messily and to the detriment of the average citizen, but it is both inevitable and necessary as a state of society if we wish to advance beyond national disputes and the limitations of earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I worry that people may sometimes be mistaken and think this requires a single nation-state, when they really want to simply <a href="http://www.joeplummer.com/">control things from the shadows</a> with the illusion of maintaining separate nations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In both Tragedy and Hope and The Anglo-American Establishment, Quigley reveals the existence of a secret network that formed to bring “all the habitable portions of the world” under its control...</p>

<p>Advances in technology have enabled modern rulers to dominate larger and larger areas of the globe. As a result, the substance of national sovereignty has already been destroyed, and whatever remains of its shell is being dismantled as quickly as possible. The new system they’re building (which they themselves refer to as a New World Order), will trade the existing illusion of democratically directed government for their long-sought, “expert-directed,” authoritarian technocracy.</p>

<p>Most have no idea it would mean <em>minimal</em> government - and a government that <em>works</em> (e.g. roads, fire departments, etc), not bloviates as useless and duplicitous &quot;representatives&quot;; thorough arming of the civilian population; and increased financial and regulatory autonomy via employee-owned workplaces.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you know this, just elaborating on the point for those who don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I was willing to give OP benefit of the doubt in thinking perhaps they meant that marxist movements have been co-opted.

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly counts as a banker? At what point does an employee of a bank become part of the conspiracy?</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably not the tellers, since they&#39;ll give that job to anyone. It&#39;s probably not the collectors, since they can&#39;t be trusted. How about the loan officers? The branch manager? </p>

<p>When you dissect the actual structure of a bank, you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s just people working jobs. There&#39;s no &quot;bankers.&quot; There&#39;s no &quot;oligarchs.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you that a lot of people have an ignorant view of the banking and financial services industries, I don&#39;t think conspiracy theorists typically attack tellers or branch managers. These are people who are told what to do and are there because the pay is good rather than having a love and passion for the industry.  </p>

<p>I think what conspiracy theorists refer to is the entity themselves. If JPM fails, our entire economy falls apart. It isn&#39;t Jamie Dimon sitting on a throne, it&#39;s the collective mindset of the executives in power at the <em>big banks</em> that people refer to as &quot;bankers&quot;. The banking industry and image has changed dramatically over the last couple decades. Example: the majority of people working at banks now are in their 20s, if I had to guess.</p>

<p>The idea of a world-government isn&#39;t what&#39;s bad,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I beg to differ. Governments by their very nature are evil. The Founders knew this and several talked about it. </p>

<p>Thomas Paine in his book <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/paine/commonsense/sense2.htm">&#39;Common Sense&#39;</a> wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one: for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this one has been reported as coming from George Washington:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Government is not reason, it is not eloquence,—it is force! Like fire, it is a dangerous servant, and a fearful master; never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But my real problem with world government is that we lose control of our lives and laws. It&#39;s hard enough to make changes to a central government (federal), which is why the constitution gives sovereignty to states. It would be impossible to make changes to a world government.</p>

All of the regulations he is repealing is helping the mega corporation pollute and suppress the worker. He is taking away the rights of the worker to organize. He is taking away the right of citizens to have a clean environment all for making corporations richer. Look at his cabinet! Rich bankers and oligarchs.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really going to step out on a limb on this one and as I look back over my shoulder I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see many folks hugging the tree working on sawing the limb off. Here goes:
Biblical prophecy tells us there will be a one world government and yes there will be a short period of peace before all hell breaks loose.
With that being said, the bible states the LORD won&#39;t return until all to be saved, will be saved. Thus we don&#39;t know the hour of his return. Now for the real mind bender, knowing this do I continue to fight/resist evil or should I lay down and believe the LORD&#39;s return is extremely close? Faith vs. feelings, difficult choices.
Humanly speaking, I&#39;m fighting. Spiritually speaking in this case - I&#39;m weak!!
Ultimately I know I&#39;m not in control, how humbling.</p>

<p>Thomas Paine in his book <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/paine/commonsense/sense2.htm">&#39;Common Sense&#39;</a> wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one: for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this one has been reported as coming from George Washington:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Government is not reason, it is not eloquence,—it is force! Like fire, it is a dangerous servant, and a fearful master; never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But my real problem with world government is that we lose control of our lives and laws. It&#39;s hard enough to make changes to a central government (federal), which is why the constitution gives sovereignty to states. It would be impossible to make changes to a world government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s liberal naivete to think meaningful  progress can come without blood. Capitalism ousted feudalism with bloody revolution and socialism will replace capitalism through revolution.  What words can you possibly say to make the oligarchs give up their billions and their ownership of the political machine?</p>

<p>Dictatorship of the proletariat means rule of the working class. It means class domination of the working class over the capitalist class. It doesn&#39;t mean a single dictator. Currently we effectively  have a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie but they euphemistically call it democracy. </p>
