      <p>
       I went to a play on Saturday night in downtown Orlando. It was called ‚ÄúThe Waitress‚Äù. It seemed like everyone in the crowd was enjoying it greatly. After all the masses are stupid cowards that do what they‚Äôre told and they laugh at things in the play that were supposed to be jokes but weren‚Äôt funny at all. The main demographic of this play was old white Liberals, so obviously not the most redpilled of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What ticked me off about the play was the blatant Jewish propaganda that nobody seemed to notice but me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The star of the play was a beautiful Aryan woman. Nordic woman. She was a southern waitress at a pie shop. She is conflicted because she lives at home with an abusive husband. The way they portray this guy is absolutely laughable and is a complete caricature. The guy is a physical laborer, has a country accent, is extremely stupid and is an abusive husband. This is definitely the way the Jew feels about the white working man in Rural America. When the girl finds out she is pregnant with him, she wants to leave him because she doesn‚Äôt feel he would be a good father. When she finally tells him that she is going to be a mom, he hugs her real close and says something just really stupid. He says ‚Äújust promise me you‚Äôll never love that baby more than you love me, ok.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the girl starts to fall in love with her new doctor. The doctor that will deliver her baby. This doctor is like a 5 foot 10 skinny guy with a high pitched nasally voice. I don‚Äôt know if the character was supposed to be a Jew or not but the actor definitely was. The character was like a Liberal doctor from Connecticut, he was the complete antithesis of her husband. Of course this shy well meaning Jew is portrayed as a good guy. Anyways they end up falling in love and the girl tells her former husband to scram and tells him that he will never see her and his kid again and of course the crowd roars in applause as the woman tells the man to screw off even though it is his kid too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also heard them use references that only a true conspiracy theorist could catch. They shouted out the number 33. We all know the significance of that number and the Free Masonic connections. Also she was getting advice from an old man and this old man talked about the time he had sex and made his wife scream. All the way back in 1948. Well what do we know that happened in 1948? The State Of Israel was founded.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have to say this play was totally produced by Jews. From the caricature of the white working man, the goy, who was portrayed as an idiot, someone with no control over his temper as he had fits of rage, an egotistical megalomaniac, and kind of rapey. To the Jewish doctor that was portrayed as some type of innocent saint like man and he ends up getting the beautiful Aryan girl away from the bosom of her own people. To the amount of affairs and gay propaganda and feminist propaganda and race mixing propaganda going on in the side stories of the play. I have to say I hated this play, it was Jewish Propaganda, and it was not funny even though pretty much everyone in the crowd was laughing. Also I looked at the names of the people who donated money to this performing arts center. Probably 50% of the names on the list were Jewish looking names despite the fact that they make up just 2% of the General population. It‚Äôs just a disgrace.
      </p>

       Here‚Äôs a video of an Indian Bollywood producer exposing the sheer amount of Jewish influence in Bollywood too

       Sort of reminds me in a way of
       <em>
        Rosemary's Baby
       </em>
       , what a mind-fuck that whole thing is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frank Sinatra is married to Mia Farrow in real life at the time she decides to take the role in the film (late 60s). Spoiler- It's about a na√Øve blue-eyed frail beautiful woman wanting a wholesome family life with her actor husband in NYC, but ended up getting drugged and raped by these neighbors and ends up giving birth to Satan's baby, by virtue of Jewish Satanists living in the same building. The husband in the film (cassavettes) basically sells his wife's first born to these producers who, in exchange for her baby with Satan's seed, open doors of opportunity for his acting career.
      </p>
      <p>
       A catholic in real life himself, Frank Sinatra vehemently opposed his new young wife accepting this role in a Jewish-produced film depicting her character giving birth to Satan's baby - lol. She accepts anyway, and weeks later Sinatra marches
       <em>
        on set
       </em>
       of Rosemary's Baby filming, and delivers Farrow divorce papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony is overwhelming on all fronts. One of which, in real life she ends up with a frail, black-eyed, hunch-back Jewish nerd (Woody Allen), in what would be the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       tradeoff for her real acting career amongst the cabal.

       Whattaya know that film you mentioned was produced by Roman Polanski. We all know what a scumbag he is. I just pray to God that we can get out of this Satanic grip of power and control. They can‚Äôt control my mind anymore but everyone in that audience other than me did not realize the filth that the play had to offer. It‚Äôs good to see some great support in the comments, though most people disapprove of it, a very large minority of people in the Conspiracy subreddit are well aware of all these Jewish tricks being played on us.  That‚Äôs a beautiful thing

       Thanks!.. It gets even worse when you deep dive into older flicks (30s-60s), seen a thousand or so over the last few years. They are fine movies across all genres. It's just that you notice the credits a bit more, who's producing, and it's damn near 99%-100% Jewish. The only non-Jews are
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of the actors. So yeah for people to dance around that fact his hilarious stuff. Just accept it, we do.

       Dude watch this video right here. These are the exact same actors that were in the play and I can‚Äôt believe how I sat through 2 and a half hours of this (((Bryan Fenkart))) dude.

       Yeah. A conspiracy of self-frightened individuals to spread Antisemitic sentiments and make the hapless Jewish man the bogeyman of all his life's personal problems.

       We see this EVERYWHERE in this community. Obviously there are influences to be discovered, and questioning is healthy, and looking for toxic systems to divest from and replace are healthy. But the second someone hangs all personal failings on The Other, and identifies as a victim of a conspiracy, they gave up their power to the excuse. It has no bottom and these folks alienate everyone that might otherwise provide a support system for healing. They become constricted, reactionary emotional cripples and affect no change at all. The punchline is that it's a conspiracy against the self, whoever the scapegoat of choice may be.

       It is a conspiracy against the self. That's the widest conspiracy out there. It's world-wide, civilization-wide, eras-wide.

       People get scared and they want to peg that fear to the wall. They lose their cool and they start getting cloudy in the head. Any next person they see is their fear. Then one of those people says who their fear is. Now the scared person has a new friend and a new enemy. It almost feels normal. It even sounds like a form of normalcy from a mythological better time. They feel like they finally got a key to go through a door into the real world, out of the nightmare. They don't know yet, they step through that door, they're just going deeper into the fear.

       OP I‚Äôm half Jewish and not longer in the religion. I‚Äôm not here to agree or disagree, but these posts lead to this sub becoming branded a hate sub which means it‚Äôll be banned under spez at some point most likely as they roll out their IPO. don‚Äôt become an example.

       You can use Hollywood in general or AIPAC or Israel or even the Khazars or usury or the Rothschilds.

       I don‚Äôt care how anyone brands this subreddit. Listen, I thought this sub was a beacon of free speech. You could say whatever, whenever. All of my posts provide a lot of content. It isn‚Äôt spam, and it isn‚Äôt graphic content. After all this sub is called Conspiracy, does it really matter how big or small the Conspiracy is?

       Did I mention I don‚Äôt care how this subreddit is branded? I sort of live by the motto ‚Äúif I‚Äôm not called anti-semitic I must not be telling the truth.‚Äù
