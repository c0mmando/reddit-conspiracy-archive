       Thanks to the conspiracy subreddit and other non-mainstream sources of information, I've been able to weigh both sides and make up my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it just me or is it blatantly obvious to anyone who's studied the matter that this incident was a hoax?
      </p>
      <p>
       I count among my friends some pretty intelligent, educated, well meaning people, but that doesn't stop them from attacking me personally when I make a plea for reason, offering evidence of a hoax, and requesting evidence to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm okay with all this, since I've tried to accept a certain fallibility in human nature permeating relationships of all kinds -- but I have to tell you I'm kind of rattled. That we could live in a world where deception is so orchestrated and truth, suppressed -- and people of all shapes and stripes seem to be clueless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll just have to keep conveying my best understanding and trusting that all will be well in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to hear others' experiences on this topic.

       Sometimes- you need to sacrifice. There's no point in trying to Red Pill friends when they are just going to stop talking to you and end the relationship. You need to be smart, and tactical with what you say. Don't talk about Parkland, Sandyhook, or anything like that. They have to work their way there. Start with simple things- government corruption, and isolated cases of pedophilia, for example. Then work in something like the 30s Building 7 clip. You need to work on wearing away their memetic structures one step at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       A full on memetic mental attack will almost always result in failure- their mental defensive mechanisms will kick in and shut down any incoming information. You need to present them information in a way that they don't even realize they're being shown the Truth. They must realize this on their own. Work slowly, don't feel the need to "Crusade". It's not worth losing friends over this shit, especially when if you play your cards right, in a few years time they'll actually believe you and thank you for your efforts...once they realize it themselves.

       I dont necessarily think its a hoax, but i do belive theres way more going on than was reported or where being told. The way the news interviewed victims before the cops did was a big flag. Also the fact that 4 deputies sat outside while a active shooter ran through the campus is highly suspicious.

       Absolutely, penguin. The stand-down
       <em>
        screams
       </em>
       at least a false flag if not hoax, in my opinion. If real officers draw their weapons and enter during a drill (they don't know about), or even black-ops scenario, and that messes up "the plan" that maybe only a few know about. Maybe they have shit so verticalized and in silos, that nobody knows shit, since they are in a drill and taking orders from the commanders like shitiff Israel, etc.

      <p>
       Why is this such a big red flag?  There were literally 100s of students, and you somehow expect the cops to sequester them all until they were all interviewed.  Be realistic, the cops were as just unprepared as any other person.

       I think it's important to be strategic though. There's no need to scare away your friends by trying to throw them into the deep end. Take your time, work your way past their mental defenses, even if it takes months or years. No reasons to alienate them and yourself just because one lacks the patience to wait.

       Not at all obvious and not at all obvious enough to lose friends over.  There is zero proof of it being staged.  Zero.

       Some people find it hard to believe that a mans daughter tells him she hears gun shots at a church he runs there with his AR 15 and engages a man who also had an AR 15 . One gets in a car and drives away and the other runs at a stranger in a truck convinces that driver in to committing a felony by perusing a murder suspect.

       It doesn't get me any closer to believing these are staged events.  That needs some kind of proof.  I'm not trying to be dismissive, but a hoax shooting is just too far to go with no evidence.  Occam's razor and all.

       Isn't o r extremely subjective. Basically I have to assume that you are familiar with all of the evidence. Which I really doubt. So it shouldn't apply. Familiarize yourself with all the contradictions and suspicious anomalies in these events and then see where the razor cuts.

       Plus worst of all, no gun laws have changed after 20 years of this.  These days are the closest we've come to even getting real background checks.  If the staged shooting are false flag: worst FF in history of world.

       Here is the best response, sounds counterintuitive...but I’ve been dealing with this weird stubbornness from friends and family as well, but this tactic seems to work...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I do: Agree that kids don’t feel safe, and then EXTEND the discussion to the following teen/youth epidemics plaguing our country:
      </p>
      <p>
       -teenage texting and driving, 
-teenage drunk driving, and 
-teenage opioid/suicide/abuse
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn a couple facts, anecdotes, and use them with the following question:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Doesn’t it seem odd the real epidemics have received such little attention, doesn’t all the focus on gun control exacerbate these other problems?”
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you get good at this you’ll be able to talk nearly anyone into at least expanding their thinking about the events related to Parkland, Las Vegas, Pulse, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       [Pro Tip: Do not talk about their views, don’t vilify them, it’s not your job to change anyone’s mind. It’s their job. It’s your job to show them the path and get out of the way.]

       I have forgone discussion with hopes of dialog. When it comes up, I now just tell it like I see it, no punches pulled, and I don't give a shit. I state it like there's no disputing it with God looking down on me, and that the official MSM story is pure bullshit. I mention the drills, how they go "live", how crisis acting companies exist for EMS training and enactments, and are used regularly.
      </p>

       It's getting easier because people in my family or convinced 9/11 was inside, lol.  This, about a year after I quipped something about Bldg 7 when people were talking about "the hijackers", and mentioning Lucky Larry's big win, the people who were "absent" from the towers that morning, etc. Now when I say some shooting was staged with maybe one dead patsy, if that, they actually listen. hehe

       The entire world has been thoroughly brainwashed by the one world power that already exists.  All of this worry about the "NWO" coming to power is just a red herring to distract us from the fact it's already been here for a very long time.  When you realize truths such as the one you are espousing it can cause you to change your perception of reality.  Someone who hasn't had all the various experiences you have on your journey to discover this stuff is in no way mentally prepared to handle this kind of information.  They would rather brand you crazy and separate from you than accept it.  This video describes the process of climbing the "staircase of disbelief."

       Here is a shortcut to the ultimate truth that everyone will cause everyone to separate from you once you come to realize it but there is nothing more important to realize in this life:
      </p>
      <p>
       The spiritual world is very real and there is a battle going on for eternal souls.  God has given spiritual control of this earthy realm to Lucifer.  Lucifer is doing whatever he can to make sure every human spends their eternity separated form God in the lake of fire that was prepared for him an his rebellious angels.  He is creating all of these deceptions and distractions for one purpose.  To prevent you from realizing that Jesus Christ really was God who humbled himself by becoming a human and giving himself up as a final blood sacrifice for all sins.  Anyone who repents (changes their mind about God, sin, Jesus) and accepts his blood atonement can receive eternal salvation through Jesus Christ.  All one needs to do is repent and believe this gospel:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the ultimate truth that the world is trying to distract you from.  All the religions of the world reject the above gospel by making their followers believe there is something else they must do.  There is nothing else to be done.  Simply  repenting and believing in the above Gospel is what saves a soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       You already know about the lies and deception.  You know it's at a level that is virtually impossible to believe yet it is so.  This is the evidence of the great serpent deceiver (Satan/Lucifer/the Devil).  Don't deny the truth of Jesus Christ like your friends deny what you are telling them.
