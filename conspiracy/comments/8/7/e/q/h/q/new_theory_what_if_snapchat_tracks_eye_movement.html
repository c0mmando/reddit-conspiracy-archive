        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the shadow of the recent FB story, I began thinking about how Snapchat may be gathering data on users. The app is designed differently than FB, but their opportunity for gathering data on users is just as critical. in order to use Snapchat, users basically always stare directly into their well-lit screens or directly into the forward-facing camera, presenting a well-lit face ready for machine-learning. It is very conceivable, in my opinion, to think that they are tracking our eye movements (and possibly dilation) while looking at different images. Users must allow the Snapchat app access to their cameras in order to send a snap, so it is possible that the camera is watching you, even when you are just looking at content. </p>

<p>With these in place, Snapchat could very easily track your eye movements and determine what exactly you are looking at, for how long, and in what order for every picture, video, and piece of content you see. If they are able to track eye dilation, then they can also determine what excites you, scares you, etc. The value this holds for commercial and political applications terrifies me.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t post much and not sure how this works but I figured I&#39;d see what everyone else thinks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I thought about it tonight and wanted to make sure I didn&#39;t sound too insane. It would be so easy to watch you and see if you laughed, gasped, or were disgusted by something as well just by watching what your face does...

    <div class="md"><p>Snapchat, like twitter, is a &quot;company&quot; that has never turned a profit. Means something else is going on. Personally I think the &quot;filters&quot; section, and snapchat in general is building a facial recognition database and the &quot;silly dancing hot dog filter meme&quot; is inorganically created so people open snapchat, open the filters and upload their smiling mug to whoever needs facial recognition data.</p>

<p>You know what seems &#39;inorganic?&#39; The use of that word in this sub lately. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just a meme or confirmation bias on my part but it&#39;s appearing far too often for my liking.</p>

Track eye movement, facial responses, and human interaction in stressful situations where they aren&#39;t sure of the correct answer. Also track any interaction that occurs when having to make split second decisions when you&#39;re not sure of the right answer and store how humans get to the answer they think is correct based on the limited input given to them. </p>
