        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Around the time of 9/11 Trump is quoted as saying he had a desire to have the tallest building in New York</p>

<p>After the fall of the towers Trump said</p>

<p>&quot;40 Wall street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually before the World Trade Center the tallest, and and then when they built the World Trade Center it became known as the second-tallest, and now itâ€™s the tallest And I just spoke to my people, and they said itâ€™s the most unbelievable sight, itâ€™s probably seven or eight blocks away from the World Trade Center, and yet Wall Street is littered with two feet of stone and brick and mortar and steel â€¦&quot;</p>

<p>Trump at the time before the 9/11 was close friends with Bush&#39;s, Giuliani, Clintons and every major corrupt elitist domestic and abroad</p>

<p>Saudi princes were famous for living in his towers</p>

<p>Prince Alwaleed being a main suspect and conspired with Trump during the election to pretend they were enemies</p>

<p>soon after Trump sold the Saudis a record breaking deal in arms to the Saudis they pretended they were arresting Prince alwaleed
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5256603/Saudi-Crown-Prince-Trump-backs-round-princes.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5256603/Saudi-Crown-Prince-Trump-backs-round-princes.html</a></p>

<p>He was released soon after the sheep ate up their slight of hand diversions</p>

<p>...........</p>

<p>Murdoch was also involved....he is a long time friend of Giuliani and Trump and was also investigated for illegal ties to Russia years before Trump. No coincidence. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akKHnOXbOC4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akKHnOXbOC4</a></p>

<p>Here is the saudi prince with Giuliani soon after 9/11 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGwSdAWsJww">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGwSdAWsJww</a> (skip to 1:50) He gave Giuliani a huge check and there is video of that. Also unsurprisingly. this same saudi prince alwaleed holds a huge stake in Fox news. It&#39;s true look it up.</p>

<p>This is only the beginning of the information I know.  I will release more as time goes. Just remember that they want you to believe that nothing is true. But the more truth you find. The harder it is to deny.</p>

<p>Edit: oops pasted wrong video</p>

<p>meant to post this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGwSdAWsJww">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGwSdAWsJww</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>MOSSAD is on video assasinating people and that is a fact. Was american and Saudi elites involved for sure but it is possible MOSSAD was also involved. There is many accounts of Manafort and Trump walking his hallways plotting Ukraine takeover. Same thing happened with Trump and alwaleed plotting 9/11. Trump gave home to Gaddafi. Think about it. A guy who blew up americans and had a statue of a hand crushing an american plane placed in Libya. Trump is the definition of a traitor and it is not beyond him to do these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m doing so now, just simply pointing out that worrying someone will ignore your truth is more reason to gatekeep and it can eventually discredit you. I have no interest in shutting you up, or telling you you&#39;re wrong. Simply extending a feeling I&#39;m having, which could ultimately  benefit the reception of your posting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MOSSAD is on video assasinating people and that is a fact. Was american and Saudi elites involved for sure but it is possible MOSSAD was also involved. There is many accounts of Manafort and Trump walking his hallways plotting Ukraine takeover. Same thing happened with Trump and alwaleed plotting 9/11. Trump gave home to Gaddafi. Think about it. A guy who blew up americans and had a statue of a hand crushing an american plane placed in Libya. Trump is the definition of a traitor and it is not beyond him to do these things.</p>
