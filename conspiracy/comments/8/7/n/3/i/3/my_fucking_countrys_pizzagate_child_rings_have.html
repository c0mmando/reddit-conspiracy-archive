<p>There is a woman in a prison right now who cant be named I&#39;m not doxxing she&#39;s on wikileaks for fighting against this. This woman has not had no trial and she been in custody for trying to reveal all this for YEARS!</p>

<p>We all know about Jimmy saville, friend of the royals paedophile also a necrophilliac. This guy on my TV growing up was everywhere there&#39;s so many comedians knowing he was a nonce it&#39;s got past the point of not being funny.</p>

<p>:1 <a href="https://youtu.be/esKnWAIgpLY">https://youtu.be/esKnWAIgpLY</a> John Lydon being banned by the BBC for calling Jimmy saville out as a predator.</p>

<p>:2  <a href="https://youtu.be/3a-vb3Nd9mU">https://youtu.be/3a-vb3Nd9mU</a>  over 30 kids being covered up by police establishments over ex prime minister of my country abusing children.</p>

<p>There is much more and more fuckin more. I don&#39;t even wanna go too deep into because I don&#39;t want to end up on a list with these fucking life takers. 
Because a life has the name pizza next to it that don&#39;t make it not true. You take a look at YouTube and all that nonce shit there that has since been removed and tell me why that even existed on that platform in the first fucking place? It&#39;s fucking numbing down Google searches of the fucking people who get away with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of. One is a very broad catch all that includes any elite pedo investigation. The other one is about Podesta, Alefantis, etc. It’s like saying you found government corruption, so why does anyone doubt watergate. They are both corruption one is just a specific incidence and the other is a catch all term. Using them indiscriminately causes comments like the one you’re responding too, and while I don’t think you are doing it on purpose here, others have used that intentionally to slander people that don’t think Podesta and Alefantis run a child sex ring by implying they don’t believe in any kind of elite pedophelia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are people so against Podesta and Alefantis could be pedos? The see no evil hear no evil thing some people have with the subject is uncomfortable. Anyone that&#39;s actually looked into the whole thing should think it&#39;s a little weird. The Instagram pictures are what made me question things. To see some people &quot;irrationally&quot; against it makes me think there might be something to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh, there are literally no victims. All of the ‘evidence’ is ‘weird’ but far from evidence of what they have been accused of. Art is not all paintings of sunsets, and while none of the Podestas art is what I would have in my home, I’m not going to call him a pedo because he likes an artist that paints about her experiences growing up in a war torn area. The stretch people go through to make the emails seem sinister is almost laughable. They never mention the phrase cheese pizza, they talk about a gift basket of pasta, and there are some ages listed of kids going to a pool party. The weirdest one is about a pizza handkerchief and while I don’t know what that means it doesn’t read like code to me. The Instagram photos are far from sinister as well. The girl taped to the table is the biggest one I see spread around here. It’s like 8 pieces of masking tape, if you look at that and think child bondage you are looking for child bondage. And I don’t care if a gay guy has jokes about cum on his Instagram. I get it if you think they are weird, I’m not arguing that. I have not seen enough evidence (and I’ve seen everything this sub has seen multiple times) to actually call someone a pedophile. Much less be certain about it. I can say for sure though if my skepticism only reinforces your belief, you are doing it wrong. Skepticism should lead you to reassess your evidence not double down because you think I’ve ‘turned irrationally’ against it. </p>
