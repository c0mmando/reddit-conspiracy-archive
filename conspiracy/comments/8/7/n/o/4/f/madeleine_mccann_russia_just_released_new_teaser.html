       With all the things happening between TPTB and Russia, I think it is more than a coincidence this video is being released at this time. With so many countries expelling Russian diplomats, I think that Russia, being the super power it is, and some very damning evidence about Madeleine McCann. I don't see any other reason they would be releasing this now.

       It just makes it harder for me to imagine people can deny that Russia was involved in, at the very least, pushing the popularity of Pizzagate, when they are clearly still doing just that.

       Flynn the ex-spymaster(aka professional liar, subversive, and expert in psychological warfare) and his son were pushing Pizzagate harder than anyone. Funny seeing as how the Fancy Bear trail leads right back to the NSA and Mike Rogers.

       Can’t see much wrong with that. Anything encouraging the potential uncovering of massive pedo rings is a great thing to me. Russia and the US are constantly baiting each other out. I don’t care who does it as long as we find the truth.

       They are just pointing out that the British government is wasting money on a crime that happened in Portugal with no chance of catching those that are guilty due to the cover up by elites. When everyone involved is dead it will be revealed no doubt that's how these paedo rings work on the UK.

       They are not images of abductors plural; they are two images of one abductor, as described by different members of the same family, who in their accompanying description made it clear they were talking about someone much younger than either of the Podestas.

       They are images of two different people.  They are not images of the same person.  I have been through this with people for over a year now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The resemblance is enough to establish probable cause for further investigation.  At the very least, the police need to determine if either one of the Podesta's was out of the U.S. at the time.  If they were, then that is probable cause to check if they were in Europe at the time.  It can continue from there, or not...

       Proof it's two people?  I looked into it awhile back and concluded it was one suspect from two eyewitnesses.  It would be very suggestive if those sketches showed two different suspects considering, if I remember correctly, the Podesta emails begin from the day after she went missing.

       one way or another... what are the chances that even ONE of the abductors looks like a podesta.

       Different witnesses could have seen only one or the other of the Podesta brothers at slightly different times without seeing the other one which would account for two different and separate sketches that are so remarkably similar to each of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far more similar and readily recognisable, in fact, than most police sketches are to the actual person ever is in most instances.

       The shapes of the faces are very different.  One has a box jaw and the other does not.  It is not likely to mix that up.  It is very coincidental that one of he Podesta brothers has a box jaw and the other does not.

       Either way, it would take less than five minutes to check if either one was out of the country during that time.  It would not intrude on their right to privacy because the sketches provide probable cause.

       Yes, and I believe it.  It should be really easy to establish they were there.   I think they would not pass up such an opportunity.   Hell, the parents may have even been involved.  Based on what I know now, it would not surprise me.

       She was being pimped by her parents for the intelligence agencies and someone got carried away and killed her. Or maybe a snuff movie. No idea who did it but kate and jerry and the government at the time do I'm sure.

       I believe she was killed in the hotel room and that the parents were somehow involved. The evidence of the cadaver dogs, and the inconsistencies in the story from the family and friends just doesn’t add up to an abduction to me. There is also a possibility that some of the friends that they were holidaying with were child molesters. Also the dodgy companies and people the family have employed to help them look for her are a red flag.

        video of the cadaver dogs

       ? With the car, the handler does not appear to be treating all cars equally, repeatedly calling the dog back to the McCann's car:

       It's the same in the apartment. The handler keeps drawing the dog back to the cupboard:

      <p>
       As well, Britain's National Policing Improvement Agency looked at the use of such dogs and found that they were not trained to approved standards and there was no way of gauging their competence.

       Yup I’ve seen them, I believe what your saying was the excuse used by the McCanns and I don’t buy it. Those particular dogs had been used in many cases before and had been proved correct many times. I will try and find the details on that tomorrow.

       If the parents did kill their daughter then they wouldn't be fighting to find her after all this time, just be quiet and let it go away. I know in South Australia, word from the police is it was the parents but I dont buy it. Pommy cops can transfer to south Australian police service easily. They keep rank and if they stick around for two years, they can become Aussies. Theres so many of them in SA because of this rule and.thats where they heard about Madeleine.
