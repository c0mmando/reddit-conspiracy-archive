       If a Mexican National (a citizen of Mexico) happens to be present in the USA when an election is in action, is that Mexican National entitled to a vote in the election?
      </p>
      <p>
       This sounds like a stupid question, but it is exactly the principle embraced by some Politicians, many in California.
      </p>
      <p>
       Efforts to identify Foreign Nationals via the Census are being touted as UNFAIR TO AMERICANS.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is a Mexican (or other) National, standing on American soil an American? Is that all that is required to be entitled to the rights, privileges and protections available to all Americans?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, some would say NO. Standing on US soil does not an American make. But some are insisting that Foreign Nationals have the same rights as citizens. And are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections provided to the US Citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can this be?

       Fact, the citizenship question has not been on a census form since 1950.

       Here is a question for you. Why isn't CA NVRA compliant? This was known prior to the 2016 election and still hasn't been corrected.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Judicial Watch sent notice-of-violation letters threatening to sue 11 other states having counties in which the number of registered voters exceeds the number of voting-age citizens, as calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2011-2015 American Community Survey: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Tennessee. Judicial Watch informed the states that should they fail to take action to correct violations of Section 8 of the NVRA, it would file suit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judicial Watch previously filed successful lawsuits under the NVRA against Ohio and Indiana that resulted in those states taking several actions to clean up their voting rolls. Judicial Watch is currently suing Kentucky over its failure to remove ineligible voters as required by the NVRA, and is suing the State of Maryland and Montgomery County over their failure to release voting-related records.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Judicial has won successful lawsuits under the NVRA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you made any attempts to verify Judaical Watch's claims that CA counties are not NVRA compliment? What claims do you disagree with?

       You disliking Judicial Watch doesn't change reality. Can you answer any of these questions? Did you bother to read what was provided to you? Did you bother to verify claims that CA counties are not NVRA compliant? These are not difficult questions to answer but you won't answer them. Why is that?

      <p>
       That is a question you really don't want to answer. I pointed out some CA counties are not NVRA compliant. You can verify this for yourself. The simplest claim is certain CA counties have not not cleaned rolls. They haven't. It isn't debatable. That nothing to do with Judicial Watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal was to have a discussion but you refuse to acknowledge facts and answer simple questions.

      <p>
       Should non citizens be allowed to vote in us federal elections- no, constitution's clear on that
      </p>

       Are non citizens in the us entitled to the protections of the us constitution including rights against illegal search and seizure and right to not self incriminate-yes the supreme court has ruled that before multiple times in varied situations

       I'm 100% against illegal immigrants but I would support any state wishing to join the country as long as they don't want special status.  But you understand the police would have to clean up all the drug Lords like immediately.

       Politicains are often back moniteraly by corporations , corporations want illegals to remain to continue the decades old tradition of exploitation (low wages ) who else is going to do all those jobs that a lot of Americans deem as below their pay grade . Heres a fun fact I work in construction , and %98 of the people I see on these big commercial jobs are ... you guessed it from  South of the border, the other %2 are usually white bosses of companies , just something to consider before you go about thinking you know something about the wonderful world we live in

       Some Constitutional protections do extend to foreign nationals on US soil. The right to vote does not extend to them, and it should not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The census question about citizenship is unfair to American citizens because census data is used to make decisions that affect American citizens. That data is used to determine how many hospitals, roads, schools, etc. are required in a given area. You may dislike illegal immigration, and you may believe that illegal immigrants shouldn't be using our hospitals, roads, and schools. But the reality is, these people are here, and they use those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the census adds a citizenship question, then immigrants are going to be less likely to respond. If regions are under-counted as a result, then that is going to negatively impact the American citizens in those regions.

       They have rights here, just not the rights of a citizen.  They don't lose all their rights as soon as they cross the border but ALL the privileges require that they do their part too, which is applying for citizenship.
