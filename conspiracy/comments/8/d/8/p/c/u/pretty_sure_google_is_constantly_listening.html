    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I have no idea if the one product the shill is talking about does or does not record and send everything because I will never own or work with those worthless things. I was calling him bullshit not specifically what he said in the first post. However, the post was about google, in total through all of their devices, not only the one product that the shill was attempting to divert to. The way he responded was enough to confirm that he is in fact bullshit. Additionally lets review what he did admit to: 1. He agrees he is a douche. 2. The product &quot;could&quot; do what everyone thinks it does but it doesnt because he knows. 3. He later admits that the product is always listening just in case you say &quot;hey google&quot; or &quot;hey Arnold&quot; but it only sends things it hears after the magic words are said, but not anything else because he knows and google wouldn&#39;t do such a thing or else he would blow the whistle himself and he is clearly an altruistic person based on his responses. No thanks, how about you give it a whirl and tell us all about it. Perhaps you work for google too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I re-read your post and thought you deserved a real reply. </p>

<p>Yes, it’s “listening” at a very basic level all of the time. It’s got internals that are listening for a wake word. This is done without context. The hardware, without network assistance, can understand a <em>very</em> limited number of words. Physical restrictions in device memory limit and processing power keep the number of word small.  This is easy to verify, just watch for network traffic. There won’t be any.  There is no saved data. Not on the device, not on the cloud. No where. </p>

<p>Once it hears the wake word, it will record everything you say and send that off to a server for processing.  Everything at this point is recorded. </p>

<p>Computer/web/Alexa is not some magic box! With tools, anyone can verify it’s behaving correctly. </p>

<p>I’m definitely not fan of listening devices. I unplugged all of my personal assistant devices long ago. Not because they are always recording but because someday, if we let them, they will be. </p>

<p>Regardless, fact is fact. They are not actively spying on you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No kidding. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: this is the first I&#39;ve ever typed it on any platform.</p>

<p>I had two that were impossibly precise this week. Ads I would&#39;ve never seen based on my browsing or search history. Anyway, my SO recently had a birthday, and her mom sent (via USPS) booking info for a themed bus tour in NYC, the theme being an old HBO show I have never seen and probably haven&#39;t <em>ever</em> searched for: Sex &amp; The City. Sitting next to my SO, she explains to me the gift. 15 minutes later, we&#39;re planning grocery list for the week and she asks for a specific flavor of a Lean Cuisine. We don&#39;t usually eat them, but she&#39;s working off-site for the week and has a long commute, so she wanted easy dinner. Point being: I never search for Sex &amp; The City bus tour in New York or Mac &amp; Cheese Lean Cuisine. </p>

<p>So the next morning when I see ads on my social media accounts <em>for both of these things</em> I get a little pissed off. We had <em>only</em> spoken about them in person. They were never so much as typed into a note on a phone. Only spoken about. </p>

<p>tl;dr: this shit is fucking ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Story about my phone always listening: </p>

<p>I bought 100 rounds of 50 BMG ammo for my rifle, as you may know 50 BMG ammo is very large, I ran out of space to put it in my ammo storage shelf, so I said to my father yesterday &quot;I need to get some ammo cans, for the 50 cal ammo that came in&quot; </p>

<p>today I went on amazon to check the shipping status of some items I was expecting to arrive (a usb card reader and a hard drive, nothing gun related), after having never searched for ammo cans online, because I always just buy them from harbor freight, the first recommended item that pops up on the amazon app for iPhone is &quot;Three pack of 50 cal ammo cans&quot; </p>

<p>THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Went to Walmart last week to buy plants for my garden and grabbed one of those Bai5 drinks on the way out. Got home from store and put on Spotify maybe 20 mins after. Two ads.... first one is for Home Depot talking about spring gardening and the next... for the exact fuckin drink in the exact fuckin flavor....?????? Never heard an ad for either of those things and it was Spotify on my computer. How the hell did it know? I didn&#39;t even talk to anyone between then so it couldn&#39;t have been my phone listening, weird coincidence maybe idk?</p>
