    <div class="md"><p>I believe we are still learning about our universe and our own abilities and our relation to everything. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like to use the words supernatural and spiritual because they are loaded with centuries of myths and misunderstandings. </p>

<p>The quantum physicists might be the modern versions of &quot;spiritual leaders,&quot;  if we want to use that limited and loaded word. </p>

<p>I think we can admit there are physical events that we can&#39;t yet explain, that doesn&#39;t mean they are separate from our senses of perception and abilities in the way the word &quot;supernatural,&quot; suggests. </p>

<p>I am fine with, we don&#39;t know much, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t  keep learning.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to ascribe what is not yet understood to a category, that implies, it is never to be understood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it makes complete sense. I saw the same things that other people  eventually build delusions around. I known its bullshit. I also understand history well enough to understand why religion, of any kind, is completely ridiculous. People try to rely on science but history explains exactly why we became spiritual in the first place. Also, psychs is just slang for psychedelics. You sound like some sort of theologian that has little to no experience with these substances, as well as an extremely tenuous grasp on this subject in general.</p>

<p>Id be happy to answer any questions, but won&#39;t be berated for having done more research than these people who believe taking dmt makes them open their third eye and all of that ridiculous nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That depends on what you mean. Anything that happens has an explanation. I don&#39;t believe in &quot;magic&quot; or ghosts as somehow being outside the realm of terrestrial understanding. That said, there is tons of shit we don&#39;t know and can&#39;t explain because we haven&#39;t figured it out yet that may as well be paranormal. Much of what we do today would be magic at different points in history.  </p>

<p>Heck, alchemy is real as we can now turn lead into gold with science as a prime example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what the definition of paranormal is.<br/>
UFOs: Yes, Yes<br/>
Ghosts: Maybe, Maybe<br/>
&quot;Evil&quot;: Yes, if nothing else, some people believe it gives them power, and do things towards &quot;evil&quot; ends, so we must be aware of it.  Yes<br/>
I think we need a little more direction as to what exactly you mean.  The list could be endless depending on what it could encompass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both no and yes, i have experienced enough things to know that what science has learned us in no where near capable of explaining all there is. But what is the word supernatural other than a word for what we haven&#39;t already learned? If you went back I  time people would call all modern electronics supernatural. We live in a extremely large universe and there is alot of things that would leave even the brighets people speechless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t before I woke up; now, I&#39;m not one to dismiss much. I&#39;ll go on my conspiracy rant:</p>

<p>As a doctor that practices &quot;alternative&quot; <em>cringe</em> medicine, I know for a fact that the AMA tried to sully my profession and others. I know for a fact the FDA, CDC, and most other government agencies don&#39;t give a fuck about your health. They train and brainwash people into thinking they are in certain profession acting on altruistic virtues. Modern doctors are so blinded due to pharmaceuticals and money due to the way they are taught; even though we all have the same education minus our &quot;specialities&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a cheating spouse; if I can find one lie, I can find another. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve served in the army as a medic in the infantry and a few tours in the middle east. I was in basic training when the towers fell. Soldiers have no clue what we are really fighting for, we get brainwashed basically.  We hear about Audie Murphy, especially as an NCO, and the others but never an word about Smedley Butler. </p>

<p>False flags all around. </p>

<p>War is a racket. </p>

<p>There&#39;s technology we used back then that I see in use today by law enforcement here. </p>

<p>The more I&#39;ve learned I&#39;ve realized that I don&#39;t know a god damn thing so me personally, I&#39;ve seen the shit. I&#39;ve been in the shit. And I&#39;ve seen the dark forces that the &quot;crazy&quot; ones speak of. I personally don&#39;t think Alex Jones is too wrong about shit. The chemicals are kind of making the frogs (and affecting the sexual reproduction of many other animals) gay. His products are actually good for you (depending on the source; bone broth is really good for your gut and immune system).  It hurts my soul to admit any of this but I can&#39;t dispell interdimensions, aliens/ETs/UFOs (which probably exist and we know, I just can&#39;t prove it but it adds up pretty easy to me), or the supernatural. </p>

<p>The same government who told MLK to off himself, that kills and poisons it&#39;s own people along with those who speak out against it; president, whomever, or physician (RIP to all of my fellow naturalists), brainwashes the disenfranchised to fight wars to fatten the elites pockets, and allows rampant pedophilia while engaging in it due to some cultish crazy ass ideology....</p>

<p>Nah fam. </p>

<p>&quot;Anything is possiblllllllllllllle&quot; - Kevin Garnett. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that our senses are a limitation and a capability, so naturally there exists phenomena we can&#39;t even perceive or think about because we were not built to be capable of that. Like the distance between a tree&#39;s intelligence and the intelligence required to consider logic or imagination. </p>

<p>I think the popular denial can be simply explained, and not necessarily by a cover-up. </p>

<p>Mainly due to the culture of &#39;scientism&#39; and optimization. Governments and businesses are so focused on usefulness that all the supernatural stuff is left to people who <em>&#39;have too much time on their hands&#39;</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really a critic of &#39;scientism&#39;, I respect that governments prefer to trust their sources 100% of the time, in order to keep citizens safe and do a good job. </p>

<p>But it follows from it that society takes a path towards &#39;the more obvious&#39; rather than the mysterious. When everyone are dedicated to this process of betterment of society, it&#39;s difficult for individuals to break out and carve their own path of exploration. And these dissidents risk alienation from society and culture, and risk that they will find themselves speaking a strange language after their journey, a language that the government culture does not understand or care to understand.</p>
