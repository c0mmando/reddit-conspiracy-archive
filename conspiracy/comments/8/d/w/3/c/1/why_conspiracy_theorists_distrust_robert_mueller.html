    <div class="md"><p>Thanks to <a href="/u/murderalaska">/u/murderalaska</a> for the following:</p>

<h1>A history of cover-ups</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that some people are aware that Mueller was the director of the FBI but most people are probably unaware of his history of white washing important deep state events.</p>

<p>Former FBI agent Coleen Rowley charged that Mueller presided over a cover-up with regard to his handling of 9/11. Mueller also, of course, was in on the Amerithrax investigation which sought to find who mailed the anthrax letters in the wake of 9/11, and bungled that case too. Mueller was appointed to head the FBI a week before 9/11 and reaching even further back into Mueller&#39;s past, when he was a U.S. attorney he abetted the cover-ups in Waco, Ruby Ridge, and the Oklahoma City bombing by changing rules of evidence so that the FBI did not have to share as much with defense counsel in those cases.</p>

<p>Mueller was also a senior Justice Department official and ran the criminal division there from 1990-1993 when the BCCI scandal was being investigated. What was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and why haven&#39;t most Americans even heard of this?</p>

<p>Even mainstream news orgs like Newsweek connected the dots on the BCCI scandal and were able to uncover that BCCI &quot;(...) was involved in some of the most sensitive intelligence operations of the Reagan-Bush years, including the secret sales of arms to Iran&quot; but out of that entire affair which interlocked with the Iran-Contra affair, basically the only government figure to suffer any sort of consequence was Oliver North and a couple of other minor figures even though the case was still being probed by a special prosecutor right before 9/11.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more that I haven&#39;t gotten to but suffice it to say that Mueller has long been an insider and to me it is not surprising that he has been called out of the bullpen to be the designated white washer of this most recent series of deep state events. <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/06/21/good-agent-bad-agent-robert-mueller-and-9-11/">This CounterPunch piece</a> does a great job of summarizing Mueller&#39;s complicity in the 9/11 cover-up. Let me know if I&#39;m missing any other instances of Mueller&#39;s cover-up work or if anyone knows any other interesting details about Mueller and his career.</p>

<p>How can you say that so definitively lol? The margin for victory was very tight on election night. Russian collaboration with Trump could have swung the polls just enough to secure his victory. I could understand this argument if Trump won by 40 points or something, but that&#39;s not what happened. </p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Hamilton said FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III acknowledged to Inslaw attorney C. Boyden Gray in late 2001 that the FBI system was based on &#39;the Inslaw software,&#39; a fact the bureau had vigorously denied for more than a decade. He said Mr. Mueller referred further inquiries to the Justice Department, although a requested meeting never was scheduled.&quot;</p>

<p>He is a messenger. The head of the investigation, of truth-seeking. And focussing on his past is a way to gaslight the investigation by assasinating his public image. This is not controversial, is it? Even if the man is guilty of what people accuse him of now, it is still a way for those people to delegitimize the investigation. I don&#39;t think this is a very controversial statement, honestly.</p>

<p>See, I don&#39;t agree to this. All I&#39;m asking for, is that people co-operate with the investigation so that the truth can be found. If he&#39;s guilty, he&#39;s guilty. If he&#39;s not, he&#39;s not. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The investigation might suit some agendas, but the crimes they are investigating are very real and serious, and that means that it is also legitimate. Trump might not be guilty of them. If this is the case, the investigation will probably linger on for some while until Trump is cleared. The more likely case is that Mueller won&#39;t find collusion, but will find financial crimes such as tax evasion, which to be honest, I also find quite a bad look for a president. </p>

<p>you are essentially ignoring his checkered history, and yet you are quite ok with assuming he is an honest investigator in this case when his past misdeeds cast doubt on that. this is not good enough, and i question your political motive because of it. </p>

<p>i disagree. he is a billionaire, and it is extremely rare that you get to be a billionaire through hard work only. i takes bribery, political manipulation, blackmail and all sorts of other dirty deeds to get to that place. Trump has skeletons in his closet, its the nature of 99% of billionaires.</p>

<p>justice isnt being served. Hillary shouldve been charged &amp; convicted many times over, but she is connected, and successfully steered the FBI away from her destroying evidence and hosting illegal government correspondence on private email servers, which she destroyed. this amongst many other things she shouldve answered for. </p>

<p>what im saying is yes, its good that there is an investigation, but lets investigate ALL the leads, and not just Trump. Trump is being shafted from all directions, and nothing is secret in his private discussions with his appointees, something almost unprecedented. the intelligence services are falsifying evidence to discredit him, the media has been against him since day one, and this investigation (if it gets trump fired) will install Pence as PRESIDENT. if you think shit is bad now, wait till that cunt gets in. </p>

<p>IMO this has been set up from the start. </p>

<p>the problem is that the investgation is being steered in a very obvious direction (ie Hillary and Uranium one went nowhere) and it seems that the evidence is being reverse investigated and very selective in who is being exposed (it was most likely Trump AND Hillary ion a partnership when it suited them)</p>

<p>you shouldnt get the option to expose certain rocks to see whats underneath, you have to expose them all to daylight until all are exposed. then, and only then, do you get truth. not this half arsed politically driven media trial. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely, but it&#39;s going to require a massive paradigm shift in the minds of the average Joe <em>and</em> career politicians. So yeah, it&#39;s going to have to be massive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you encourage other people to abstain from voting?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I once was a wide-eyed optimist who didn&#39;t know that voting in the US is almost 100% rigged. However, I <em>definitely</em> don&#39;t want to discourage folk from being politically active. That can mean voting, and that can mean other things to...as long as people stay engaged and informed! Wilful ignorance, especially among the intelligent and well-meaning, is a large part of why we find ourselves in this unfortunate political predicament.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t see how things can get better without voting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, they&#39;ve spent generations honing their divide and conquer 2 party system illusion. This entire dualistic system needs to be dismantled, and <em>then</em> we can talk about voting.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it surprising that Mueller&#39;s coverups are only being talked about more frequently now that he is in the spotlight? Crazy huh! /s</p>

<p>He was never at the forefront of these scandals to begin with. He was always the supporting character that was overlooked. Now that he is in the spotlight people are more readily pointing out his reputation of covering up these conspiracies. But this considered unacceptable to you because it might make Trump look good? With that attitude you&#39;re no different than the Trump lovers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This subreddit only put him at the forefront of the story after he started to investigate Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, he is mentioned way more in r/conspiracy because he is talked about way more by the MSM and reddit. Does this shock you?</p>

<p>This subreddit is not putting him as the ring leader or the front man to these conspiracies but merely pointing out his involvement in these coverups now that he is in the lime light. It&#39;s sad it took this long for Mueller&#39;s involvement to be recognized.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that you&#39;re telling me I need to CTRL+F for Mueller&#39;s name, just so I can read a comment that received no upvotes, says a lot.</p>

<p>Yeah it does say alot. It says how manipulated we are by the MSM to only start giving a fuck about anything that they report on. Eg. Mueller.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet you say that while trying to justify partisan attacks against Mueller from right-wing sources</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, realclearpolitics and thefederalist are right wing. But <a href="https://shadowproof.com/2009/11/01/fbis-robert-mueller-still-engaging-in-an-anthrax-cover-up/">shadowproof</a> and the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2017/05/21/comey-mueller-bungled-big-anthrax-case-together/">orange country register</a> are not right wing. Why are you being deceptive or are you just ignorant of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78c4kd/special_counsel_robert_mueller_covered_up_911_the/">sources posted</a>?</p>

<p>The Trump investigation is considered a positive thing because it shines a light on corruption. But you think it&#39;s a bad thing to shine a light on the corruption that involves those who are doing the investigating? That is some sad mental gymnastics.</p>

<p>There are Trumplets that attack anything that would make their dear leader look bad and there are anti-Trumplets that attack anything that could possibly make Trump look good. Please, don&#39;t be the latter (or either).</p>

<p>The dude was literally involved, and <em>directly</em>, in the greatest coverup in American history (9/11). </p>

<p>Trying to pass this off as a &quot;hit job&quot; in a conspiracy forum is disingenuous at best, and downright disinformation at worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say anyone was claiming whataboutism, just that they soon would be if an argument ensued due to the leftist belief that if someone points out your hypocrisy rather than defending themselves from your attacks, all you have to do is say &quot;whataboutism&quot; which means you win and the argument is over.</p>

<p>As to why liberals are stupid, and I say this as someone whose vote for Trump was my first time voting Republican at age 31, well, what&#39;s he done that&#39;s so bad? Say some things that <em>could be</em> construed as racist, but weren&#39;t necessarily, say some mean things, win when <em>it was her turn?</em> The mental gymnastics you people go through must be exhausting, the cognitive dissonance mind boggling; coming up with reasons every good thing he does is actually bad, or failing that, someone else&#39;s doing, changing your position weekly so you never agree with <em>him</em> on anything... Tell me, now that he&#39;s talking about possibly negotiating us in to the TPP are you against it again? And I know I had to spend a year listening to you whine about how Russia is our greatest enemy and we should attack them, but now that we hit their ally Syria you&#39;re against it because you&#39;re worried about WW3? The best example, since you asked, is Colbert telling his audience that Comey got fired, and when they started cheering he had to make them stop and say &quot;no, no, we&#39;re angry about this&quot;. You know, <em>because Trump did it.</em></p>

<p>And you can argue and say I&#39;m not the left, I&#39;m me and you don&#39;t know what I think, and that&#39;s true, but I know who you support, and by doing so you&#39;re tacitly supporting everything &quot;the left&quot; does.</p>
