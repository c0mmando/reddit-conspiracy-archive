       Shit is hitting the fan in a big way in the UK. The Thought Police have been created,  and they are gaining momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what you post online is deemed "grossly offensive" by any random person that wants to censor your expression, you're in some shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It won't be long before expressing 9/11 truth or talking about False Flag Operations is punishable simply because someone finds it offensive.  This is regoddamndiculous and simply must not be allowed to prosper as an institutional protocol.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chelsea Russell, 19, from Liverpool posted the lyric from Snap Dogg's 'I'm Trippin'' to pay tribute to a boy who died in a road crash, a court heard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russell argued it was not offensive, but was handed a community order.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecutors said her sentence was increased from a fine to a community order "as it was a hate crime".
       </p>
       <p>
        She was charged after Merseyside Police were anonymously sent a screenshot of her update.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Russell was found guilty of sending a grossly offensive message by a public communication.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was given an eight-week community order, placed on an eight-week curfew and told to pay costs of £500 and an £85 victim surcharge.

       WTF
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted a few weeks ago about how the London police had a firm definition of thought crime posted on their website.  The normal naysayers cruised through and made fun,  saying things were being blown out of proportion.

       Kid gets in
       <strong>
        legal trouble
       </strong>
       merely for posting Snoop Dogg lyrics because a single person took offense.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have gone over the edge of the slippery  slope, and we're all fucking covered in grease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single comment made against the establishment on a public forum such as this can be found to be "grossly offensive", especially to the uneducated masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Haha! Gotta love the immediate downvotes,  dealt out before it's even possible to read the post.  &lt;3

       DI is still Alex Jonesey, he gets all the airtime he wants now and is not harassed in the way some people who have real information do.  He talks about Lizard people and that's what keeps him in the limelight.  They want and need him there so you and I can be associated with him.  No traction, no progress made in waking people up from the real misinformation being spoon fed to them.  No investigations into 9/11 and Sandy Hook because you probably beleive in lizard people or flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be able to separate yourself and in the end when you have the attention of enough people, if that friggin lizard idea turns out to be true, it will speak for itself.  No need to carry it all along with the real evidence of thermite in the dust, or FEMA keystone community events being held.  It only serves to make sure people disregard.

       It isn't about getting them arrested, it's about flooding the system. We know nothing will happen to them, so they are "safe" targets. Only report the untouchables, let the normal folks go unreported. How will they say the system works then?

       And, since I live in Texas and can freely say so without fear of a reprise panopticon: fuck the U.K. Lawmakers and fuck the U.K. Police that enforce these infringements on personal liberty. I'd love for them to hear these words: "you are the problem, you slavery loving, money-licking, boot and Ass-kissing ignorant fools".

       Every 6 month refresh your accounts and usernames on any and all social websites. Never use two passwords or similar usernames on the same forum and avoid at all costs using the same usernames across different forums and sites.

       Avoid posting on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook unless you use fake details.

       Yes, they can trace you easily by using your IP, but in the UK that requires the prosecution to jump through more legal loopholes.

       I live in Estonia. I use my non-legal name in Discord and don't post much personal information there(selfies, age, country of origin, some details from life but nothing that'd be too easy to identify IMO). During a certain period of my life, I joked on public Discord server about shooting down my school and expressed suicidal thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       My teachers got a call from police that night and my mother was called to school. According to them, I was lucky to not have police burst into my house. It hasn't been brought up later, but after that incident I didn't feel safe speaking to online friends even in private for a long time - even if I trusted them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use VPN, my dudes.
      </p>

       (For anyone curious, I'm doing much better now. Don't be afraid to reach for help if thoughts like this overwhelm you.)

       WTF.  It makes me wonder though.  Whenever there's a new shooting here in the states we get people from the UK ridiculing our society.  IMO, rights of free speech are far more important than the right to bear arms.

       It wouldn't have, it's just something people say all the time on Reddit whenever refering to the UK. Like, because we are not all armed to the teeth then suddenly we are the most oppressed nation that ever existed. Some people like to reduce every discussion back to guns. Happens every time.

       It only takes one guy to decide if he's going to prison for some of the ridiculous shit they're charging their citizens with then he might as well tack on a few murder charges to take out a judge or two and maybe a few of the shitlicking footsoldiers. Depending on the circumstances, the public might even view him favorably. It would certainly make them rethink trying to enforce that in the future.

       Funny how "more liberal (liberating) gun laws" should mean more lax and free gun laws, while "conservative (conserving) gun laws" are supposed to be more controlled and tightly managed. The opposite. Feels almost like by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       A liberal should be saying "everyone who wants a gun should be able to receive one in a free/liberal and open society!", while a conservative should say "I think we should be more careful about who we give guns to and need to be selective to save money and resources!".

       Are you aware of how close we recently came to a military coup to stop erosion of the Constitution and Bill of Rights? 100% chance an armed citizenry would have come into play, most certainly as a deterrent against resisting the pending coup.

       That would be an option, yes. Ideally you'd have everyone rallying behind defending their rights in a violent rebellion against unconstitutional laws and injustice. You can guarantee foreign governments would be helping the rebellion, and there would be rogue factions of the military willing to pitch in as well, so long as the people are armed and capable of forming an organized insurrection militia.

       Exactly why they want to suppress free speech, particularly on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       One guy with a gun and no voice gets surrounded by cops, none the wiser. Same guy has access to media, you get Harney County or Ruby Ridge. Those didn’t turn out so well for the citizens at hand, but they were shitshows for the government and a warning to other citizens. They control the old media now to prevent the Ruby Ridge scenario; they are trying to strangle social media to prevent the Harney County one.

       I am talking about right now, here in the United States, today this very moment and over the past say fifty years. Cops arrest people for shit all the time that should be considered unconstitutional or whatever but you don't see any armed rebellions happening. When someone does do that they are on the news as a terrorist. I never said that it was odd to me, just saying that they are already doing fucked up shit and have been for a long time, yet if you go shooting at the cops, you will rot in their prison as a slave for the rest of your life.

       Can you elaborate further on the subject of the alien and seditions acts and what happened due to them? I am not disagreeing or attempting to debate, I am genuinely curious about this topic. Was it an attempt to imprison people who criticized the government?

       It isn't really constructive to analyze history in terms of what we believe a political act was intended for. It's impossible to discern such a thing now, let alone 200 years ago. What we can do is demonstrate what a piece of legislation allows for, and the consequences of the legislation. The seditions part of the aliens and seditions act made it illegal to criticize the government with false allegations. If you were accused of such a thing, you could use truth as your defense. The biggest legal problem here is that our justice system presumes that one is innocent until proven guilty, however you can't prove that someone is guilty of not speaking the truth. Specifically, the only argument for proving a negative in this situation is asserting absence of evidence, but absence of evidence in a justice system where the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty essentially shifts the burden of proof from the prosecutor to the accused, resulting in the opposite-guilty until proven innocent. It would be up to the defendant to prove that they are not making a false claim about the government by providing evidence for the truth of their claims. When this comes down to criticisms of policy, you can imagine how this might be particularly problematic. There's a lot to touch on here, but I recommend studying about the early American politics of federalists versus anti-federalists. The alien and seditions act was passed by a majority federalist Congress and signed off by a federalist president. They did not even want Americans to have the bill of rights. The political result of the act was Jeffersonian anti-federalists/Democrat-republicans being accused and convicted, essentially imprisoned for holding political views contrary to the state.

       Other world powers (China, and yes, even Russia) would be frothing at the mouth for an opportunity to arm and influence opposing American factions in order to sow discord and permanently dismantle the union. The US would be utterly fucked if the people ever took up arms against the government. People like to talk about how the 'lefties' would be screwed because they don't own guns. Guess what: the righties are going to be fighting foreign nationals as well, complete with bombing campaigns, heavy artillery, armored vehicles, you name it. It's going to be a fucking free for all and every player on the world stage is going to pour as much gasoline on us as they can.

       You haven't been paying attention to history if you think for a moment that there will not be a host conflicting foreign influences in any hypothetical Civil War II, and that there will be no actors looking to permanently cripple the country, or to install leaders of their choosing from the numerous competing factions.

       That's true but if there were any competing factions they'd be propped up by Russia and China vs. the E.U. and the commonwealth, and those factions would be the people supported by Russia and China versus the U.S. tyrannical government supported by Russia and China. The people would win, it would be bloody, and we would probably replace the government with a temporary fascist state in the wake of the chaos that may or may not return to a more representative government. It's not a desirable outcome, but the people would pursue it over the certain tyranny we have now, and the government would be wise to make sure they present a more lucrative outcome.

       yes.  You exercise your God given right to free speech.  Then government officials come to your door to take you away.  Then there is a firefight.  An armed citizenry is the ultimate check and balance.  I don't know why this is so hard of a concept for people.

       My point was that police arrest people all the time to be slaves in prison for things like drug addiction and yet they get away with it even though we all have guns. The ones who die in a firefight as you put it are dead, and the rest are arrested and imprisoned. Go ahead and shoot at the cops right the next time they harass you. You'd die and they'd still be collecting slaves before the evening.

       Based on the idea that WHERE WE GO ONE WE GO ALL, a heavily armed population that refuses to allow your arse to be hauled off to prison - because someone didn't like your words - or you put bacon on a mosque doorstep - eventually the bullies in the government would realise they cannot enforce their will.

       I am not saying that it would not deter complete tyranny. All I was saying is that our rights are slowly being dissolved even though we are armed. Guns could stop a complete takeover, but how do we stop the Totalitarian Tiptoe?

       Tbh, we're all in the same boat for slightly different reasons but you have guns and have been utterly shat on by your government - you have no real rights, your media is fucked, your country is overrun by deep state/lobbyists/think tanks/military industrial complex &amp; you think you're free!

       That is not thought crime. She did commit a supposed crime. Thought crime would be thinking about committing a crime and then being arrested for it. You can disagree with this case, as I do, but that doesn't make it thought crime.

       I'm sorry but that is flat out retarded. You have this guy who clearly has no expertise in engineering or physics conclude that missiles are fake because they don't have wings and planes do.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's pretty dumb on its face, but then you have to think about how much footage there are of missiles. We're not talking about the moon landing, one trip, totally could have been faked. We're talking about what, millions of videos showing missiles in action, over the period of hundreds of years, from hundreds of different countries and sources. Hell, you can buy a model rocket yourself and shoot it horizontally.

       Oh Those Embarrassing Moments: Atlantic Council's Ben Nimmo Outs 'Russian Bot' That Turns Out To Simply Be A UK Citizen Tired Of UK Government Warmongering

       <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@clarityofsignal/oh-those-embarrassing-moments-atlantic-council-s-ben-nimmo-outs-russian-bot-that-turns-out-to-simply-be-a-uk-citizen-tired-of-uk">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For the past few months, Ben Nimmo, the head of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Labs has had his eye on one Twitter account in particular and he has relentlessly framed that account as being that of an influential "Russian bot" that is linked to the Kremlin. This post will reveal that the Atlantic Council's Ben Nimmo has displayed utter incompetency and a shameful display of research (or lack thereof), considering his position as head of DFR Lab, and considering the large amount of money that the Atlantic Council receives and spends on supposedly 'countering' disinfo (to be read as acting as "Thought Police") for the global elitist establishment.

       Whatever the charge, whatever the political leaning this is shit law because of the way it's being used.

       It's a 'crime' that is only enforced when the police, or tbtb, want or need it to be enforced.

       The NWO is trying to stamp out nationalism,  because it is one of the few aspects of human nature which stands in the way of one world government and ultimate tyranny.

       Most Americans really like the UK, but for whatever reason guys are always derided when these subjects come up.  When someone who has been brainwashed into thinking guns are bad or useless tried to push that idea here? Bad idea. Expect backlash, because we get enough of that crap in our media every day. No offense to Brits in general. Everyone hates seeing your rights going down the toilet about as much as we hate seeing ours under attack.

       You’re right on the net Brits get all stuffy about guns. It’s like we are better than others because the government doesn’t think us grown up enough to use them, that is just crazy and righteous. As it happens s I’m in the uk and do own a gun but that aside I see no need to get uppity about it. What they fail to realise most Swiss homes have guns and they are far better off that we are. As do many Swedish and Finnish homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our guns were taken away in the 1930s because the government was afraid of an armed revolution. And they had reason to be as well. Now it’s because of our own health and safety we can’t have them. Load of bollocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it daft that Brits brag about not being trusted with guns when in fact they have no idea what they are talking about half the time. Still you lot got to stop shooting each other as much as you do. But hey that’s the world we live in these days

       Yes, a ceasefire from the nutballs of this world would be wonderful, though from what we've seen going on with trucks and bombs, even making sure they are disarmed doesn't seem to stop some of them. Always a good day when they accidentally blow only themselves up!

       Victim Surcharge isn’t paid to an alleged victim. Even when there was no victim, someone found guilty in court who receives a fine will also have a victim surcharge added, which is added to a pool of money for victims of crime.

       This is a molly coddled state with paper tigers leading it. Let’s whale on a 19 year old teenager who knows no better but let’s not investigate grooming rings made mainly of Pakistanis because it’s racist. This country needs to wise the fuck up sometimes.

       DI is still Alex Jonesey, he gets all the airtime he wants now and is not harassed in the way some people who have real information do.  He talks about Lizard people and that's what keeps him in the limelight.  They want and need him there so you and I can be associated with him.  No traction, no progress made in waking people up from the real misinformation being spoon fed to them.  No investigations into 9/11 and Sandy Hook because you probably beleive in lizard people or flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be able to separate yourself and in the end when you have the attention of enough people, if that friggin lizard idea turns out to be true, it will speak for itself.  No need to carry it all along with the real evidence of thermite in the dust, or FEMA keystone community events being held.  It only serves to make sure people disregard.

       My point was that police arrest people all the time to be slaves in prison for things like drug addiction and yet they get away with it even though we all have guns. The ones who die in a firefight as you put it are dead, and the rest are arrested and imprisoned. Go ahead and shoot at the cops right the next time they harass you. You'd die and they'd still be collecting slaves before the evening.

       It isn't really constructive to analyze history in terms of what we believe a political act was intended for. It's impossible to discern such a thing now, let alone 200 years ago. What we can do is demonstrate what a piece of legislation allows for, and the consequences of the legislation. The seditions part of the aliens and seditions act made it illegal to criticize the government with false allegations. If you were accused of such a thing, you could use truth as your defense. The biggest legal problem here is that our justice system presumes that one is innocent until proven guilty, however you can't prove that someone is guilty of not speaking the truth. Specifically, the only argument for proving a negative in this situation is asserting absence of evidence, but absence of evidence in a justice system where the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty essentially shifts the burden of proof from the prosecutor to the accused, resulting in the opposite-guilty until proven innocent. It would be up to the defendant to prove that they are not making a false claim about the government by providing evidence for the truth of their claims. When this comes down to criticisms of policy, you can imagine how this might be particularly problematic. There's a lot to touch on here, but I recommend studying about the early American politics of federalists versus anti-federalists. The alien and seditions act was passed by a majority federalist Congress and signed off by a federalist president. They did not even want Americans to have the bill of rights. The political result of the act was Jeffersonian anti-federalists/Democrat-republicans being accused and convicted, essentially imprisoned for holding political views contrary to the state.
