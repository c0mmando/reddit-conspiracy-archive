    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my belief that the two-party system was implemented to better divide, distract, and control the American people. We constantly bicker and argue over political figureheads like they&#39;re celebrities on a TV show rather than debating and solving real issues.</p>

<p>We just need to abolish the two-party system and have no parties at all. Every candidate can run on their own platform with their own specific goals, and it should be up to us as voters to properly educate and allign ourselves with the candidates who we think will do the best for the American people.</p>

<p>We have either never had a third party president, or Lincoln was the first and only if you consider the Republican Party prior to the abolishment of the Whig Party as a third party. Regardless, our strict adherance to the two party system is archaic, and we need to change that.</p>

<p>You could straight out abolish people running on party platforms, and de facto party coalitions would still exist. It&#39;s just the end result of game theory. There&#39;s strength in numbers and candidates will flock to like-minded allies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well maybe that would be a problem of the proposed solution that would need to be worked out somehow. I&#39;m no political scientist, so I&#39;m not entirely sure what those possible problems and solutions would be. </p>

<p>look at jfk, the last politician to actually try and bring change to this world, he wound up with his head blown off.</p>

<p>go further back in history, look at how the jesuits assasinated kings queens a popes that didn&#39;t go along with church.</p>

<p>look at the year 1215 when the king of england signed england over to the vatican</p>

<p>Than look at americas &quot;revolution&quot; where they fought for independance from the roman owned crown, they call it the &quot;revolution&quot; for a reason, because the war ended exactly where it started.</p>

<p>sure the 1 party&#39;s votes oppose the other partys, but the war still continues, corporations still rape and pillage all the lands that they inhabit, corporations are still allowed to poison the food, water, air, and minds of the people...</p>

<p>No real change will ever come from one of your votes, ever</p>

<p>And which party has passed regulations corporations in the last 50 years? If it was up to the GOP, there would be complete chaos - no regulation whatsoever. Be thankful for what constraints we do have in place and vote for candidates who will continue to push for further regulation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The regulations are weak and some of them are cronyist.
This is due to the shills in government pushing for extreme-deregulation (NEOliberalism) which is extreme right economics.</p>

<p>Obama/Reagan/Bush/Clinton, etc. were all pushing NEOliberalism bit by bit. 
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg</a></p>

<p>Decades ago we didn&#39;t have many insane far right Repubs and Dems. They used to be something like moderate left, moderate right, centrist sort of area, a balance of regulations and lower cronyism (now we have Obamacare which is privatized crony capitalist expensive garbage that&#39;s easy profiteering for big pharma/insurance companies and they STILL have over-priced drugs and service despite funding from us the tax payer -- we need to switch to clean single payer).</p>

<p>The world isn&#39;t black and white my friends!
Bad regulations are shit like cronyism, putting barriers against small startups, etc.
while good regulations are things like worker rights, environmental protections, ethics, product safety and quality, etc.</p>

<p>I think I read something about the government having politicians with Monsanto links, and Obama flip flopping on GMOs. Dems/Repubs are different shades of the same corporate wallstreet bullshit economics.</p>

<p>If we get money out of politics, our politicians will stop kissing corporate ass,
and start doing what the people demand!</p>

<p>The way I see it, it&#39;s the proletariat versus the bourgeoisie aka the public class versus the corporate class. This isn&#39;t new, the song I linked to was written in like 1987 or something. It&#39;s just that due to media constriction over the 40 years, it&#39;s a lot more apparent nowadays since there&#39;s fewer players left on the field.</p>

<p>Most of the media nowadays is corporate connected. They push partisan bias because it keeps the left/right fighting each other over controlled issues. Meanwhile the US is like 21 trillion in debt and counting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to guess your agreements with Hispanics aren&#39;t with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Their views on homosexuals</p></li>
<li><p>Their views on blacks - Because if anyone hates blacks as much as Whites, its Hispanics</p></li>
<li><p>Them being even more religious on average than Whites</p></li>
<li><p>Their knack for having tons of kids</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m going to guess your agreements with Blacks aren&#39;t with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Their views on homosexuals. Go ahead, ask a black person walking down the street if he&#39;s gay and see what happens.</p></li>
<li><p>Their views on and treatment of women - One could assume &quot;bitch&quot; is a pronoun for women with how often it is used.</p></li>
<li><p>The prevalence of them using violence as a way to solve problems</p></li>
<li><p>Their 72% out of wedlock birthrate, which leaves millions of innocent kids fatherless.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But it really doesn&#39;t matter whether you agree with either group or not. Once Hispanics have the numbers, your vote will be nullified, because there&#39;s going to be a lot more of them than there are non-Hispanics.</p>

<p>Your vote means nothing with superdelegates. Ask the Berniebros how much their vote meant during the last election. And there&#39;s no reason for the DNC to change that either, since people like you are still going to vote for them anyway.</p>

<p>4 beats 1 every time. Not only is your vote going to mean nothing, black concerns will mean nothing as well. The politicians don&#39;t need to worry about the black vote when it&#39;s going to be about 1/10th of what the White and Hispanic votes will be.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t even begin to explain how wrong this is. You really think that nothing would be different without the FDA and mandatory testing? Without the EPA and Cap and Trade? Without conservationist requirements? </p>

<p>If you really think these things don&#39;t do anything then you have no experience in government. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to guess your agreements with Hispanics aren&#39;t with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Their views on homosexuals</p></li>
<li><p>Their views on blacks - Because if anyone hates blacks as much as Whites, its Hispanics</p></li>
<li><p>Them being even more religious on average than Whites</p></li>
<li><p>Their knack for having tons of kids</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m going to guess your agreements with Blacks aren&#39;t with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Their views on homosexuals. Go ahead, ask a black person walking down the street if he&#39;s gay and see what happens.</p></li>
<li><p>Their views on and treatment of women - One could assume &quot;bitch&quot; is a pronoun for women with how often it is used.</p></li>
<li><p>The prevalence of them using violence as a way to solve problems</p></li>
<li><p>Their 72% out of wedlock birthrate, which leaves millions of innocent kids fatherless.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But it really doesn&#39;t matter whether you agree with either group or not. Once Hispanics have the numbers, your vote will be nullified, because there&#39;s going to be a lot more of them than there are non-Hispanics.</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. But if it&#39;s easier for you to believe so, then go right ahead. As I&#39;ve said, I tend to see the world as my neighbors do. The same might be true for you?</p>

<p>And a civil war spell be the end of the USA. Foreign powers - our adversaries, largely - would swarm like vultures, arming and training opposing factions, sowing chaos and discord, installing puppets and promoting their favored agents as faction leaders from the inside, spreading disinformation, running bombing campaigns, etc. Surely you know this is inevitable? It won&#39;t be &#39;left vs right&#39; - it will be a clusterfuck, and the only winner will be the next rising superpower to take the throne (China?)</p>
