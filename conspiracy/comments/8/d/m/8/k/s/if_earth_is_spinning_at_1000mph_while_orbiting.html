    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In  fact, it hasn’t always been the North Star even within recorded history - the star Thuban was used from the 4th to 2nd millennium BCE.</p>

<p>This is due to something called the Precession of the Equinoxes. Over a period of about 25,700 years, the direction of the earth’s axis slowly changes, moving in a circle with a radius of 23.4 degrees. This means what star is closest to true North slowly changes. The star we call the North Star now has only been the closest to the north celestial pole, counting just stars easily seen with the naked eye, since 500 CE. Before then, Kochab and Pherkad were used as a pair, moving in a circle with north between them. Prior to that, Thuban was the used as the North Star.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always hated this numerology stuff (is that the correct word?) because what you just said really makes no logical sense. You have the number 2.34, but why do you decide to convert it to .234 and subtract it from 1? That&#39;s just a completely arbitrary formula designed to get you to the specific number you want. It would make just as much sense to say 2*(34) = 68 and 68+1=69 and haha you said 69. There&#39;s no logic to what math you do and it is all just to force a certain result. If you add in enough arbitrary math you can always get to 666 or 777 or whatever number you want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Earth&#39;s motion relative to Polaris is laughably insignificant. The distances involved with our orbit may seem impressive from an Earthly perspective, but are absolutely <em>meaningless</em> on the scales of interstellar astronomy. Visualise it like this: if you set an ant loose in a large hall and have it walk in circles, the central chandelier will always remain roughly above its, in spite of the enormous distances that have been crossed from the ant&#39;s perspective. Distance is relative.</p>

<p>There is also the fact that your very premise is incorrect: Polaris hasn&#39;t always been the polar star and won&#39;t always remain so. Just a few thousand years ago, a star named Kochab fulfilled the role, and before that it was Thuban. As the Earth&#39;s orbital tilt continues to evolve, one day Polaris too will be replaced.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Study the game before you declare a checkmate. If you don&#39;t, you might just make a fool of yourself.</p>

To extend a great answer with &quot;math&quot; and &quot;Google&quot;...</p>

<p><em>polaris distance from earth</em>
433.8 light years
<em>light years to miles</em>
1 light year = 5.879e+12
433.8 light years ~2.6e+15

<p>Without then delving into the relative radius differential in galaxies, you can already see there is a 100 million scale difference between the entire orbital radius of the Earth and Sun - or viewing an ant from around 100km away to use <a href="/u/Gibcakes">/u/Gibcakes</a> example...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea is not as impossible as you make it out to be. Sure, the individual probability of a star being above true north is exceedingly low, but because stars are just so goddamn plentiful, the <em>collective</em> probability is actually pretty high.</p>

<p>An example: the probability that any given oxygen molecule is in your mouth at this time is close to zero, but the probability that <em>an</em> oxygen molecule is on your mouth is more or less 100%.</p>

<p>Besides, the Earth&#39;s axial tilt is on a cycle just like its position is, so what star is allowed to call itself the polar star changes every few thousand years. Yesteryear it was Kochab, yesterday it was Thuban and today it happens to be Polaris.</p>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which makes the interstellar distances explaination obselete. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect. A brick wall will always block a flashlight. Whether I&#39;m at 50, 100 or 100.000 meters from the wall in question is entirely irrelevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>now tell me again how earth with all its spinning and orbiting it does so orientated to polaris.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Polaris is in the same orbit around the galactic center as we are, the only variable involved is our Solar orbit, which is teensy-tinsy compared to the light years we are removed from the polar star.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a dead giveaway someone is grasping for straws is when they become illogical and convoluted </p>

<p>I&#39;m not grasping for straws, I&#39;m trying to explain a relatively abstract concept to somebody who is--no offense--by all intents and purposes scientifically illiterate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that is complicated is not automatically untrue. Of all people, I&#39;d expect a conspiracy theorist to understand that.</p>

<p>About Occam&#39;s razor: sure, it might point to a flat Earth at the most superficial level, but it turns towards a globe as soon as you start digging a little deeper. If the Earth is flat, gravity as it is conventionally understood does not exist. If gravity as it is conventionally understood does not exist, how do you explain orbits? How do you explain gravitational lensing? How do you explain that the apparent force with which things fall down is measurably less atop a mountain than it is at sea? Why do things even stick together? If you deny gravity, the inconsistencies start mounting really fast.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the thing that the predictions done by the theory of relativity, which cannot in any way be unified with a flat Earth, are spectacularly accurate. So accurate, in fact, that it&#39;s hard to take the theory as anything other than the truth.</p>

<p>Before you bring up the kool aid again: you might want to know that I&#39;m currently pursueing my master&#39;s in astrophysics, so I certainly do know what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the earth isnt in an insane orbiting spiral. its impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can mathematically prove that it is, in fact, as possible as night and day. Can you prove the opposite or are you just using &#39;impossible&#39; as an euphemism for &#39;I don&#39;t understand it&#39;?</p>

youve done a horrible dis-service to the globe earth illusion, youve COMPLETELY failed to explain earths magical ability to keep the north pole orientated to polaris while </p>

<p>1.) spinning on its axis at 1000mph</p>

<p>2.) orbiting the sun eliptically at 67 000mph</p>

<p>thats a lot of spiralling and spinning for our little blue marble to stay locked in with polaris at its north pole.
nasa and astronomy tell us polaris is apprx 2 quadrillion miles away from earth.

<p>See how the axis of that top points upwards? It does that because it is spinning very fast. But because it is not perfect, there is a slight wobble so that direction of the axis moves around ever so slightly.</p>

<p>A child&#39;s toy demonstrates <em>exactly</em> why the Earth&#39;s axis points at Polaris, and also why it hasn&#39;t <em>always</em> pointed at Polaris and will eventually no longer point at Polaris.</p>

<p>Earth is a gigantic spinning top.</p>
