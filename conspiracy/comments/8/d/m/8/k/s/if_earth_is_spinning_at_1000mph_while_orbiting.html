        In  fact, it hasn’t always been the North Star even within recorded history - the star Thuban was used from the 4th to 2nd millennium BCE.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is due to something called the Precession of the Equinoxes. Over a period of about 25,700 years, the direction of the earth’s axis slowly changes, moving in a circle with a radius of 23.4 degrees. This means what star is closest to true North slowly changes. The star we call the North Star now has only been the closest to the north celestial pole, counting just stars easily seen with the naked eye, since 500 CE. Before then, Kochab and Pherkad were used as a pair, moving in a circle with north between them. Prior to that, Thuban was the used as the North Star.

       Your ignorance of basic historical facts, along with your complete utter ignorance of the distances involved (the very simple, scientifically proven reason why stars seem to
       <em>
        not move
       </em>
       in the sky over the poles), does not mean it's a conspiracy.

       I’m guessing that’s this posters whole point.  A lot of people don’t believe main stream science. Can you prove the math?  So we have to have faith in scientist. Science is the new religion.

       I've always hated this numerology stuff (is that the correct word?) because what you just said really makes no logical sense. You have the number 2.34, but why do you decide to convert it to .234 and subtract it from 1? That's just a completely arbitrary formula designed to get you to the specific number you want. It would make just as much sense to say 2*(34) = 68 and 68+1=69 and haha you said 69. There's no logic to what math you do and it is all just to force a certain result. If you add in enough arbitrary math you can always get to 666 or 777 or whatever number you want.

       But 23.4° tilt is not the same as 23.4%, so converting it to .234 makes no sense. It's actually 6.5% (23.4/360). And we all know that 6.5 + .4 = 6.9, and a 6.9 is just a 69 interrupted by a period. See, arbitrary.

       But 9 is just 6 upside down, so in your 6.5 + .4 = 6.9 phrase you have three sixes, five which is mystical, and 4 which is also mystical.

       Because the Earth's motion relative to Polaris is laughably insignificant. The distances involved with our orbit may seem impressive from an Earthly perspective, but are absolutely
       <em>
        meaningless
       </em>
       on the scales of interstellar astronomy. Visualise it like this: if you set an ant loose in a large hall and have it walk in circles, the central chandelier will always remain roughly above its, in spite of the enormous distances that have been crossed from the ant's perspective. Distance is relative.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the fact that your very premise is incorrect: Polaris hasn't always been the polar star and won't always remain so. Just a few thousand years ago, a star named Kochab fulfilled the role, and before that it was Thuban. As the Earth's orbital tilt continues to evolve, one day Polaris too will be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: Study the game before you declare a checkmate. If you don't, you might just make a fool of yourself.

       Notice how the 'north pole' always faces the ceiling, regardless of the fact the top is spinning? In fact, the 'north pole' always faces the ceiling
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       the top is spinning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing happens with the Earth. The Earth's North Pole is pointing at the Polaris "ceiling" and it keeps pointing at that ceiling
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       it is spinning.

       so that moots your vast distances and scales of interstellar astronomy. the ONLY reason the south pole dont see polaris is because they live on the dark side.
which means we HAVE to accept the impossible idea that earth spinning on its wobbly axis, circling the sun, within a spiralling galaxy somehow manages to orientate ONLY its north pole to polaris. thats a long bow to draw

       The idea is not as impossible as you make it out to be. Sure, the individual probability of a star being above true north is exceedingly low, but because stars are just so goddamn plentiful, the
       <em>
        collective
       </em>
       probability is actually pretty high.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example: the probability that any given oxygen molecule is in your mouth at this time is close to zero, but the probability that
       <em>
        an
       </em>
       oxygen molecule is on your mouth is more or less 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the Earth's axial tilt is on a cycle just like its position is, so what star is allowed to call itself the polar star changes every few thousand years. Yesteryear it was Kochab, yesterday it was Thuban and today it happens to be Polaris.

       Something that is complicated is not automatically untrue. Of all people, I'd expect a conspiracy theorist to understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       About Occam's razor: sure, it might point to a flat Earth at the most superficial level, but it turns towards a globe as soon as you start digging a little deeper. If the Earth is flat, gravity as it is conventionally understood does not exist. If gravity as it is conventionally understood does not exist, how do you explain orbits? How do you explain gravitational lensing? How do you explain that the apparent force with which things fall down is measurably less atop a mountain than it is at sea? Why do things even stick together? If you deny gravity, the inconsistencies start mounting really fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the thing that the predictions done by the theory of relativity, which cannot in any way be unified with a flat Earth, are spectacularly accurate. So accurate, in fact, that it's hard to take the theory as anything other than the truth.
      </p>
      <p>

       I can mathematically prove that it is, in fact, as possible as night and day. Can you prove the opposite or are you just using 'impossible' as an euphemism for 'I don't understand it'?

       I did everything I could to explain it in a way that's easy and intuitive for you to understand, but you seem either unwilling or unable to grasp the concepts I've discussed here. You're not going to convince me and I'm not going to convince you, so perhaps we should just spare each other the time and cease this discussion.

       i shot your 1st argument to pieces. the ant and the chandelier? you forgot the globe the ant is supposed to live on. if the ant represents us humans then in your example we are walking around in space, no globe. add the globe and then youve got the impossible and embarrassing task of convincing people that earth is performing all its orbits and spinning while being perfectly aligned to a star 2 QUADRILLION MILES AWAY. you failed! your only recourse was to convolute and hope to muddy the waters by amping up the rhetoric.
you have no choice but to slink away as your position is indefensible. ill hand you your hat and your "masters" and you can frack off. lol

       Your increasingly nonsensical replies are draining my ability to remain polite, so I'm going to be plain here: you're as dumb as a rock and disregard anything that escapes your limited capacity for understanding as 'rhetoric' and 'convoluted nonsense'. You have not provided
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       recourse whatsoever to the multitude of problems with gravity denialism that I pointed out, either because you are so locked into your beliefs that you refuse to acknowledge contradictory evidence or because you don't want to admit to yourself that you might not be as smart as you think you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forgive me the ad hominems, but until you are able to provide a satisfactory rebuttal to the arguments I've presented here instead of dismissing everything the tiniest bit more complicated than 2 + 2 = 4 as dishonest demagogy, you are impossible to take seriously.

       See how the axis of that top points upwards? It does that because it is spinning very fast. But because it is not perfect, there is a slight wobble so that direction of the axis moves around ever so slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       A child's toy demonstrates
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       why the Earth's axis points at Polaris, and also why it hasn't
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       pointed at Polaris and will eventually no longer point at Polaris.

       Do you know how a gyroscope works?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the Earth's axis points in essentially the same direction is proof that the Earth is a spinning object acting like a gyroscope.

       What does it even change ? The only thing it affects, is how insane you look when talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat, round, triangle (If it's flat, what tells you there isn't 2 other surfaces ??????), there is nothing to prove since everyone has already taken for granted it's round.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are 100% sure it's not round, I challenge you to build a device that fly to the limit of the surface we are om, with a livestream of your findings, hopefuly not un 240p. Then, we'll start calling checkmate.

       i think your parents are more impressed with your impending masters than i am...dick move lol...when you need to pull your imaginary internet 'masters card' *clap clap youve done a horrible dis-service to the globe earth illusion, youve COMPLETELY failed to explain earths magical ability to keep the north pole orientated to polaris while
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) spinning on its axis at 1000mph
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) orbiting the sun eliptically at 67 000mph
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) while our solar system is spiralling at 500,000mph within the milky way
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) all the while our galaxy is itself spinning at 670mil mph!
      </p>
      <p>
       thats a lot of spiralling and spinning for our little blue marble to stay locked in with polaris at its north pole. nasa and astronomy tell us polaris is apprx 2 quadrillion miles away from earth. time to discard ridiculous, embarrasing theories and look for a more realistic provable model. regardless of what walt disney and star wars tell you about our 'universe'

       so that moots your vast distances and scales of interstellar astronomy. the ONLY reason the south pole dont see polaris is because they live on the dark side.
which means we HAVE to accept the impossible idea that earth spinning on its wobbly axis, circling the sun, within a spiralling galaxy somehow manages to orientate ONLY its north pole to polaris. thats a long bow to draw

       the only reason the southern hemisphere cant see polaris is because its always facing away. which makes the interstellar distances explaination obselete.
