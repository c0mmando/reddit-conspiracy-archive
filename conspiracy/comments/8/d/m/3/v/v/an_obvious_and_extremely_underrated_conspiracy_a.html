       Plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not allowed, through either enforced ignorance or worse criminal prosecution to heal ourselves with plants that grow from the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few exceptions, for example, the Aloe Vera plant can be grown and slathered on your skin to soothe sunburns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples of plants that are CONFIRMED to be of varying benefit to humans either physically or mentally yet will land you years in federal prison include
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Psilocybin (magic mushrooms)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cannabis
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Peyote
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>

       Think about it, we have been brainwashed into believing there are NO natural remedies, that if we want to feel better we need to pay for proprietary formulas that we dont understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, if it isn't a pill, an ointment, or a medicinal syrup bought from an official pharmacy we simply refuse to believe it has anything to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, we are encouraged to overdose on caffeine and sugar, to suck down nicotine to our heart's content and drink ourselves to death on alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be laughably simple to put together a comprehensive program mandatory for all youths that plainly explains the reality of a healthy diet and exercise routine while providing inexpensive healthy foods to the population while taxing cancer and obesity causing "luxury foods" to subsidize the lowering of cost on healthy foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       No the food industry likes us as gluttons
      </p>
      <p>
       which benefits the medical industry as the gluttony gives them dozens of widespread basically life long incurable diseases we must pay them to ease

       Plus one on the Corbett plug, I wouldn't say it's the only reason but it's definitely a keep factor. So many people are ignorant as to why 99 percent of our medicine is based off a snake oil salesman and what he taught to his oil tycoon son.

       John D Rockefellers dad was a POS snake oil salesman with a second family, the only time he'd spend with his boys was to swindle and trick them, to him that was teaching them to be the ultimate businessmen.

       The part that bothers me is the education of our youth. We set them up for failure and they never even get a chance to make their own choices. It takes curious people to start seeing past the 1 dimensional bland world we are forced into, and the education system does not breed curious people.

       Eventually when she becomes a teenager she just won't want to go anymore and become isolated and depressed.  I would recommend you look into alternative schools or home schooling, it's sad, but private school seems to be the only real option left if we want our kids to have a chance.

       I had the opportunity to attend private school from grades 3-6. I thrived and was given many top of the class awards. Before that, I was always in trouble for ADD behavior like bothering other kids. When I had to go back to public school, I found it a waste of time. I skipped class to smoke and go to movies downtown. Nobody cared then because I still got As, but I flunked out of university due to bad work ethic and attitude towards school.

       It's important to nourish your kid's interests, even if it's video games or makeup. Try to guide them in how to turn those interests into projects that give something to the community and the world. That perspective is the part kids need help with.

       We’ve taught our kids to do this in a respectful manner. My kids are 14 &amp; 12. They are both straight A students but are subversive in a private way. We are teaching them to question authority in an intelligent way that is not disruptive.  My thought is they’ll get threw school to be functioning members of society but they will be decades ahead of everyone else. It’s working so far.  More so with my son (14 year old).

       Don’t do that to your daughter. Tell her different sides. All that you have learn but also what other claim to be the truth and facts. That way she could potentially discern. My mother is catholic and she taught me about all different religions and gods that ever existed. That was mind blowing to a kid: knowing your parents believe in something but at the same time they tell you about what others believe. It started that way.

       Not to mention the most obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are high schoolers not educated in filing taxes, seeking employment, filling out job applications, dynamics of credit and debit cards, how loans work, how to look into the viability of career choices, alternative options to college (ect, ect, ect)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are things that could be done to DIRECTLY increase a childs likelihood of success but instead they are forced to take more and more "high brow" book smarts classes, not that those arent important but 50% - 75% of students will not put those classes to use, whereas the subjects I listed could help even a harvard student.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention of course I believe there should be a class focused on educating people about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals and when it becomes  actually neccessary to try those pharmaceuticals

       Ayahuasca Ceremonies is a great way, trained Shamans will guide you. Other ways are finding Tantra Courses, they are also great. Just make sure the facilitator is actually understanding the dymanics of dark and light, so you dont end up with a light preacher. 
I have a great teacher and place I can recommend if you're into it. 
What kind of treatment is it that you hypothetically want?

       By Light preacher I mean a typical "guru" who promotes the idea of Light defeating the dark. In spiritual terms it could also be understood as "getting rid of" the Ego. 
Hm I am not great at expressing this, so if I am not making myself clear, feel free to ask more questions!
      </p>
      <p>
       To illustrate the Picture. Light can be seen as Positive and dark as Negative. In a painting you can only ever draw Dark if you have a White contrast and vice versa. Even if what you only ever want is White (Light) there has to be Black (dark) to illuminate. By trying to get rid of the Black (dark) the chase begins and one becomes trapped again. It is a game after all that alot of humans want to play, which is fine. Still there are humans who are tired of that game and wants something else, these people usually turn to spiritual teachers, and some spiritual teachers use this opportunity to play the Light vs Dark game again. What I mean by Light preachers is basically someone who sees Light and Dark as forces that is trying to "win" over the other, trying to defeat the other.

       You can always find a good clinical psychologist but they aren't very likely to prescribe anything in the way of drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact they very much oppose psychiatrists who almost always do prescribe something to alter your brain chemistry in order to deal with whatever your problems or symptoms appear to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there's no proof and no way to test that there's actually anything wrong with your brain chemistry that may lead you to have those problems or symptoms, however, or that what they're actually prescribing to suppress or stop them will ever do anything more than that, rather than ever cure them, so you have to keep on taking it, or something else like it to avoid becoming addicted, which is not a particularly good way to deal with them in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychologists, on the other hand exist to help you identify and unravel any mental or emotional problems that are almost always the result of untoward events and experiences in your past that have upset and caused you to think and react in certain ways that have eventually evolved to the point where they're interfering with your life and that of others around you and getting in the way of what you actually want to do and should be able to do but find that you somehow can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychologists train to recognise the nature of those mental and emotional hang-ups and to get their subjects to recognise and come to grips with them in a gradual and positive way in order to overcome them and get their lives back on track.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what your interest in psychedelics is based on or if you yourself have a particular problem that others have clamed to derive some benefit from using them, but I wouldn't recommend that anyone go that route without trying to resolve whatever it is with the help of a clinical psychologist first and without experimenting with their own psyche in a way that may profoundly effect them without knowing beforehand if that would actually be a good thing or not for the kind of person that they happen to be.

       Thank you, this reads as very sound, level-headed advice which I appreciate. I guess my interest in psychedelics in this regard is that I've heard it can almost act as a shortcut to the long, expensive process of cognitive therapy. But then I worry it might just be a shortcut to psychosis if not done properly in a medical context. I think it's obvious that talking-therapy with a clinical psychologist is the most logical way to go but opening up to someone feels like the last thing I want to do (equally a distrust in psychiatric medicine).

       I'm afraid that there's plenty to distrust when it comes to psychiatry, as is evidenced by the more than 10 million children and adolescents currently being prescribed psycho-active drugs to presumably control and prevent their so-called social and behavioral shortcomings.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also been a lot of deeply disturbing incidents involving some of them that has resulted in some sudden and completely unexpected outbursts of a violent, murderous, and suicidal nature while taking those drugs that I'm far less inclined to consider as being as "coincidental" as the psychiatrists and medical establishment are in order to keep right on prescribing those meds.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an old saying that anything worthwhile takes time to accomplish, and another old cliché that a journey of thousand miles always begins with just one step.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jordan Peterson, a remarkably good clinical psychologist and professor of psychology who's gotten a lot of press both positive and negative due to people trying to make political hay out of his psychological assessments of the kind of subtle and even overt "mind manipulation" he sees going on in both our universities and society at large has a fair number of his lectures and seminars on You-Tube that I think you'd find more than worthwhile in perusing simply for the information he provides on the fundamentals of human psychology and how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sort of a risk free way to familiarize yourself with it and then perhaps take the next step towards finding a clinical psychologist to help you explore and better understand your own personal psychology in relation to what you see as being a problem.

       you mean the average life expectancy was ~50 years old, almost entirely due to the impact of the massive infant mortality rate and child birth deaths. If you survived to adulthood, and if you were a woman and survived child rearing, your life expectancy was roughly what it is today.

       You are seeing things in black and white. With great evils that came great progress would occasionally follow. The basis of modern medicine is largely due to Rockefeller but it doesn't mean many millions haven't worked in the field with good intent, intent to help and cure. It's not all so cut and dry imo

       To me it's a stretch to say that psilocybin, cannabis, peyote, and kratom bring "a lot of negatives" to the equation. I'd say "few" negatives exist, especially when these four medicines are compared to the doctor-approved deadly opiates sitting in my mother's medicine cabinet.

       Exactly. Even if there are “a lot of negatives” it’s still less than the amount of negatives associated with most shit doctors give out. Good luck overdosing or becoming addicted to peyote or psilocybin.

       I agree.  While I love the psychoactive plants, there are many, many more plants with incredible benefits that are not psychoactive.  Turmeric, Gotu Kola, Ginkgo Biloba, Ashwaganda, Meadowsweet, Brahmi... the list goes on and on.  Each with tons of clinical evidence that they work.  And all with no serious side effects.

       Got the point.  But op gives us a list of plants that are criminalized, and the first thing on it isn't a plant.  To anyone with a basic understanding of biology (you know, the topic he's commenting on) he looks like an idiot.  Better to correct it, so he doesn't continue to look like an idiot if he decides to argue the point anywhere.

       Have an orange arrow. Should be corrected but he's using "plant" colloquially as any growing thing... you're missing the forest for the trees here but I agree most non conspiracists will get turned off too easily as well. If they were interested in learning they would already know right?

       I'm a medical cannabis patient.  I understand all too well what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to prevent natural remedies.  I just think that if you're going to start making arguments about anything in the medical field, you need to get the ABCs of biology right.  Or be content with not being taken seriously by anyone who knows what they're talking about.

       Mushrooms aren't plants but that's not the point of your post.  Those things you list off should absolutely be researched and used for therapies that they help with.  None of what you listed however is a 'cure' or 'treatment' for an ailment.  They help alleviate other symptoms of illnesses.  Cannabis is amazing at helping someone going through cancer to give them the ability to want to eat food when otherwise they wouldn't feel the want of eating.  It doesn't cure cancer itself.

       The FDA should still be involved if those drugs are made available to the public.

       Cannabis has been found to have anti-tumor effects. More studies are needed, very promising though. Imagine how much we'd know about this if the govt didn't block research?

       I mean, look at it this way. Older generations were much less likely to get sick than us and had very little use of pharmaceuticals. They tried healing themselves with natural resources. Plants, leafs, tea. My grandmother still does this, because she still lives in her native village and is growing her own food(vegetables, fruit e.t.c). If she gets a head-ache, she doesn't take pills(Panadol), she makes a drink from some leaf/tea and she instantly gets better.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really the same as weed. Natural sources/plants have amazing abilities to heal us. But if that was happening, just imagine how many BILLIONS of dollars the pharmaceutical companies would loose. Same reason weed is being attacked so much.

       We have cannabinoids and DMT in us already. Selected by our own genetics, and incorporated into our own bodies. They help make us who we are. It is no surprise that nature also has these things readily available to all humans and animals.

       My brother is going through detrimental chemo right now and it breaks my heart every day to not be able to help him more, and even worse knowing "untested" alternatives exist that can potentially be much better. I have tried, but what if the plants or vitamins don't work and he never tried potentially "lifesaving" chemo. He thinks I'm gullible and all the alternative treatments are only trying to take advantage of sick people. I'm too chicken shit to live with the guilt of being more aggressive at questioning his decisions. Feels like you are a lone ranger trying to shine unwanted light to the masses and it's even harder when is a sick loved one :(

       Curious about the aloe thing you brought up. Why do you think aloe and some other plants are "okay" to have by the powers that be? Aloe is amazing and has multiple uses too, so why hasn't the government banned that..........yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just curious about what psychology of it all.

       Well, another commenter showed that Aloe is actually a conspiracy and is ineffective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couldn't really believe it considering the walls of products that claim to contain Aloe as an argument for their usefulness.
      </p>
      <p>
       And besides that the only ones left around legally have likely been genetically neutered of their original abilities and provide equal or worse benefits than a low strength aspirin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything above that power is unattainable for us. I imagine we dont know and would not be able to find info on many ancient plants of proven benefit as they have been intentionally pushed into extinction (if we're lucky their are seeds in some vault somewhere) by profit hungry corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And besides that it could just be the typical needle in a haystack technique, maybe some plants that are relatively common have amazing properties if utilized in a specific way but all the techniques and knowledge on the topic is suppressed

       Interesting! I must have missed the comment about it being a conspiracy, now I need to look it up. So I'm guessing that soothing feeling you get from it if you put it on a burn is placebo maybe?

       Soothing feeling in most cases is Lidocaine mixed in with the gel.

       That's just not true. You can get an aloe vera plant from Walmart, I have one. You can break off one of the leaves and rub it on your burn. If the data shows it doesn't heal burnsa any faster, okay, but I know first-hand it does soothe the pain even without lidocaine.

       Sad to say it goes much deeper than this, plant knowledge is apart of ancient knowledge which is being wiped out. Just as the ancient scrolls have most all been destroyed and burned (or hidden in the Vatican) throughout the world. Indigenous people are also being wiped out, we've destroyed Native culture as well as decimated their populations. This goes back even further with Spain conquest of Mexico. These populations have also been killed off in a more recent Guatemalan genocide of indigenous people who carried plant and spiritual knowledge (the aggressors were armed by Israel who is also apart of the quest to eliminate ancient cultures which hold information detrimental to banks and their institutions).
      </p>
      <p>
       What can we do? Well we are doing it, learn about ancient cultures and ancient medicines and make them MODERN medicines by consuming them and saying fuck you to pharmaceuticals.

       It's not just ignorance about the wonderful healing properties of plants, but also ignorance about how to prepare these plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it goes without saying that the plant kingdom is our medicine chest (or poison). Every culture on earth has a tradition of using plants to keep us healthy and alive. 
But how do we prepare them so that we can actually take into our bodies all of the beneficial compounds? The human digestive system is not always up to the task of breaking down plant fibers. All of these compounds are essentially locked up within the body of the plant. How can we release them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people would make a tea out of the herb. The problem with this is that many of the compounds within plants (i.e. essential oils) are not water soluble. So, no matter how long you let it steep, only water soluble compounds will dissolve into the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next best thing is to make a tincture. This is the same thing as making tea, except a solution of ethanol (grape alcohol) and water is used. The alcohol has an affinity for all the compounds hidden inside the plant material and pulls it out. Then it's strained to get rid of the plant material and you now have a tincture containing all the compounds that had been locked up in the plant. Many people think this is the most potent form of herbal medicine, however there is more...
      </p>
      <p>
       The mineral salts! Instead of throwing out the plant material it's incinerated to white ash, washed with distilled water, filtered then the water evaporated away. 
Pure, white crystals form. The are the water soluble mineral salts the of plant. They are purified by repeating the process. Each time, the salt becomes whiter. A pound of plant material produces about a teaspoon of salts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So. Why are these mineral salts so important? Well, first off, you want to get the whole plant. The salts are alkaline. When they are added back into the tincture it raises the PH level and converts the oily compounds into water soluble compounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So adding back the mineral salts is the missing key. It truly makes the extraction complete. The result is called a "Spagyric". This process was written down by the famous Paracelsus in the 16th century but somehow we forgot all about it!
      </p>
      <p>
       I first learned about this method when I began my study in Alchemy. There is more. Much, more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else interested in this stuff?

       I'll be honest when you started talking about alkaline I got worried. But this actually makes sense when I read it all! Crazy that "dose makes the poison" guy has much more to teach us and I never heard it in school. I've taken organic chemistry and biochem, let me know where I can get some alchemy knowledge.

       Yeah.  Most people get concerned any time you mention lye.  The thing is there are only so many salts because you are using the limited salts from the very plant itself.  I believe (but haven't tested it yet) that by the time all of the oily compounds have saponified the alkalinity is all used up.  It's a beautiful concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a definite and immediate reaction when the salts are added back to the tincture.  It darkens and takes on a faint, almost "inky" scent.  Turmeric turns from yellow into the most beautiful spectrum of red to orange to yellow to green.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day I did an experiment thus.  Having a tincture of cannabis I took a teaspoon and poured it onto a plate to evaporate.  I then added the salts of the cannabis to the tincture (making the Spagyric) and did the same thing pouring a little onto a plate for evaporation.  After both were dry of alcohol such that there was only a residue left behind, I poured distilled water on top.  The Spagyric residue immediately washed away, while the oily tincture wouldn't budge no matter how long it soaked (because it's oily).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious what this means for increasing our body's ability to absorb these saponified compounds.  It makes so much sense!  How could we have forgotten this?  I'm pretty sure it's no accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's my goal to help to re-introduce this knowledge to the world at a time when we need it the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are actually even more powerful extracts that can be made, however they are made in private and are only administered to those who created them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most powerful plant extract is called a "Plant Stone". It is the same thing as the philosopher's stone, but for the plant kingdom. With a plant stone, you could take any other plant, chop it all, put it in a jar, cover it with water and toss the plant stone into it. Within 15 minutes the plant stone will penetrate the plant and extract the "quintessence" of the plant which will float on top. The stone will be unchanged. The plant stone is literally a KEY to the plant kingdom.

       I do think it's interesting how they are going after Kratom, specifically. Because it is so obviously an alternative to opiate addicts dying from their addiction, though it's not the best way of course. Makes me think they don't want to "tackle the opiate epidemic" as they say they do. I agree with your sentiments for the most part, but you would have a stronger argument if you also provided examples that are not psychoactive drugs used recreationally. I don't know if CBD oil is legal everywhere, but from what I've heard it does amazing things and doesn't get you high.

       Just scratching the surface. So many plants and herbs are BETTER than the pharmaceutical counterparts, with fewer (if any) negative side-effects. Turmeric as an anti-inflammatory is a great example.

       Look I understand where you’re coming from but those are all drugs and no matter how you try to swing it they are drugs. Drugs are illegal for a reason. Do I agree with that not always. If they were legal a lot of problems they cause wouldn’t be as bad. But as it is right now there is violence and crime surrounding drugs. It’s not some grand conspiracy drugs are illegal. They are illegal in almost every other country too. While they may offer benefits for s small group of people let’s be real here. Most people aren’t smoking weed for the “medical benefits” most people are smoking weed to get high. Sure you can throw some bs in there like it’s for my anxiety or my depression but I can tell you right now yea in the moment it makes you think it’s cures those things BECAUSE YOURE FUCKING HIGH but the moment you come down the depression comes back and even more so if used consistently because your brain sees all this excess dopamine being released so it cuts back on producing it’s own dopamine therefore making one more depressed when not high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ya wanna know what a crime against humanity is? Getting addicted to drugs. Getting so low in life that you rob other people, steal from people you love, sell everything you have to get high one more time. End up homeless and hungry begging for cash. And by that time you’re so addicted instead of using that cash for food it goes to more drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look I get it I used to love all drugs and thought the government was just trying to keep me down man they don’t want us to have free thought they want us to buy their drugs man weed will kill the paper industry man oh man look at all these people being helped by drugs it’s medical man. But then I found more and more and more drugs and soon enough I was addicted to possibly one of the worst and most addictive/ destructive drugs. I saw people turn into monsters. I saw people overdose and die left and right. So where do you draw the line? When do the nagatives outweigh the medical value? Which drugs should be legal and which ones should stay legal when even ones such as ketamine can cause overdoses? The line is too hard to draw. Sure weed go for it I’m even a fan of mushrooms and lsd but there Will always be a push for me. Casual users don’t understand they don’t see the dark side of drugs. The violence, the depravity, the insanity. I firmly believe drugs cause most of the crime committed today. People rob stores usually because they need drug money. Many murders are drug related. I get it drugs are fun but go see the dark side of drugs. Look into an opinion that isn’t the same as yours. Do real research that doesn’t just back up what you believe. I was like this once. Thinking drugs were amazing with no faults. But it’s not the case. I would look up stuff about drugs but Only read it if it aggreed with my beliefs. That’s not the truth though. The truth about drugs is darker than most will ever know

       Its clear that TO YOU drugs were about getting fucked up, you never drew a line between whats a natural and acceptable drug, and whats a chemical that will destroy you, and likely didnt consider moderating your intake to control tolerance either.

       Sounds like you believe addiction is a choice or a moral failing but it’s actually a disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mainly smoked weed/ did halucigens for 5 years. Hallucinogens every few months but weed every day. Sure you can say I chose to do hard drugs but it’s not that simple when you’re an addict. I was put in a situation with people using drugs that I initially said no too but was eventually coerced. It’s not as black and white as you make it out to be. To an addict it’s I’ll just try this once it won’t be a problem. You don’t understand nor will you ever understand what it is like. The point I was making is it’s hard to draw a line. What makes a horse tranquilizer ok? And how can you say people won’t abuse it because they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you should look into some of the research of he long term effects of marijuana. It causes memory problems, increased anxiety, depression, and even schizophrenia. Look I love weed I’m all for it’s legalization but we need to be realistic about it. It’s not a miracle plant it has downsides just like every other drug.  Just like hallucinogens I’m all for them being legal but again we need to be realistic. In some people they cause major mental health problems inducing psychosis and schizophrenia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn’t just start smoking weed like a crazy person. I did it just like you said. On weekends with my friends playing video games and just having fun. I didn’t choose to be an addict. Please learn more about it because the way you are talking about it is demeaning and hurtful

       Look I get it I love weed too but that’s just not true. I. Some people it causes issues. Yes it feels awesome but it’s not always healing. And cbd stands for cannabinoid so I’m not sure you know what you are talking about. You ever smoke with someone that gets really paranoid? Thats not particularly healing for them. I’m not hating on weed but a lot of weed smokers ignore the facts about it. I was one of them defending it endlessly just like you are now. It’s not perfect it’s not a cure all. It is a drug and drugs have positives and negatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m men it can cause weaker sperm, with woman it’s even worse because their eggs are protected by a layer of fat in which the thc gets stored. This can impact the eggs. It also does the same in the fatty tissue in the brain which is why people who smoke a lot tend to think slower and have that typical stoner demeaner portrayed in movies and on tv. This is why stoners forget stuff a lot or why they don’t seem to process what people say sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I was a stoner for s very long time. I still want to smoke weed it feels awesome it seems to open your mind to new ways of thinking it feels creatively freeing I seemed to appreciate everything in the world so much more. Yes I think it is the best drug there is maybe tied with hallucinogens as far as mental health and overall affect it has on someone. But it isn’t perfect and never will be. And there’s the common misconception that for some reason it isn’t harmful to inhale and that’s just plain wrong.  It produces tar and has carcinogens in it. I still love it though. But as an addict I cannot smoke it anymore sadly

       I respect your opinion, but CBD is actually one of the many cannabinoids in the cannabis plant and the abbreviation stands for Cannabidiol, just like there's CBG (Cannabigerol) and CBC (Cannabichromene). They are all different than the common THC cannabinoid.

       Ok I was just always told they were called cbd’s in the videos and articles I read and watched about weed. That’s fine the point is it isn’t perfect and never will be. There are negative aspects of it that stoners like myself choose to ignore or refute

       I am being realistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This attitude towards addiction I think is more harmful overall. If people think they are slaves to a chemical, they might as well be.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they choose to rise above it through will power that path IS possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people dont have the sheer willpower required  to take that path I suppose, but that doesnt mean it isnt the best path, and teaching people they are helpless against addiction without therapy and other "approved" drugs is teaching them to be helpless and not take responsibility for bad decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at it like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take a prized possession down to a pawn shop, you arent being mind controlled you are making a bad decision out of fear of withdrawal and desire for high.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think were both right, I come from afamily of addicts so i am a bit more cynical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its partially what you say, addiction being a beast of its own, but willpower cannot be discounted

       You cannot understand addiction without actually going through it. Willpower is not enough. No part of recovery says you must take meds. Recovery usually consists of working a 12 step program. Drugs highjack the reward system in your brain. It gets straight down into the most ancient parts of our brain that tell us what we need for survival. When we eat that part of our brain tells the other parts to release chemicals such as dopamine to tell us this is good keep doing this we need this to survive. Same with sex and anything that make you feel good that is what is happening. Drugs release these same chemicals however in massive amounts the brain would never normally release. So the rest of the brain makes the connection saying this is pivotal in survival. It puts using drugs at priority number one for survival. Now obviously we can think through this and know they do not equal survival but that is how it feels. Going even a day without drugs to an addict feels indescribably horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of this the brain has a thing called a hedonic set point. That means that there’s a certain level of brain chemicals that need to be released for it to register. Now when the brain is constantly flooded with chemicals from drugs it attempts to restore balance. It does this by raising the hedonic set point so it takes more chemicals to elicit a response. This is what is known as a tolerance. This also means that normal thing such as sex and eating will not register once the set point is high enough. This is why many addicts lose weight and stop doing anything beneficial because they get nothing out of it. There is no drive to do anything anymore besides drugs because they are the only thing that feels good.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn’t just hard drugs either. This all happened to me from daily marijuana use. I pawned my video games, my most prized possessions at the time to buy fucking weed. Not because of withdrawal or lack of willpower but because internally I was in hell. The depression and anxiety and overall feeling of dread I experienced back then was as I said something only an addict can understand. And honesty the part I find weird is that I was more emotionally distraught when all I did was weed than later in my using when I actually  was addicted to hard drugs that induced withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Addiction is a disease. It’s not a choice. Addicts make the same choice to use drugs just like any other person. Supposedly the phenomenon of craving is what separates us. When an addict uses something happens that just makes them want more. No amount of any drug will satisfy the craving. An example is with alcoholics, when normal people have a couple drinks they get tired and don’t like feeling out of control so they stop. When an alcoholic takes the same drinks they feel like they are just getting started. This is why many alcoholics drink until they puke and pass out. Their body gives up before their brain is satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Addiction is so complicated not everything is known about it to this day. However it is accepted as a disease by all medical associations at least in the United States . And I’m passionate about this because obviously I am an addict and also because there is so much misconception and stigma attached to it. People say it’s a choice we just don’t have willpower and they just adds to the shame that we already carry with us.

       I have a feeling either Trump or his opponent will use federal legalization to swing the youth vote their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really their just giving back what should never have been taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like imagine a parent (government) has 2 kids (drugs) and one kid consistently gets As and Bs in school (weedis shown to have little to no negative effects) and the other kid either gets an A or C and sometimes a hard F (Opiates can be perfectly helpful, but can also kill you and have many negative effects)
      </p>
      <p>
       And the parent decides to continually punish the A and B kid and always demand evidence he didnt cheat and say he isnt smart(safe) unless he gets all A+.
      </p>
      <p>
       While at the same time giving the other kid with much more erratic grades love and affection and telling him he will always love him just the way he is no matter what his grades (how many people opiates kill)
      </p>
      <p>
       And after years of this the A and B kid starts petitioning distant relatives to let him move in with them (state legalization) and gets positive responses from almost all the relatives (30+ states have legalized in some way) and the parent starts to huff and puff and backtrack and eventually says fine Ill treat you the way you always deserved to be treated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is basically the drug war, and that parent deserves to be thrown in jail.

       Uh... This is exactly how my parents raised me and my brothers.  I was an A/B student, all three of them dropped out and have been in and out of jail (mostly now inescapable due to the prison industry).  I've always been pushed harder and treated less favorably.  It's weird you drew this analogy.  I had to check where I was at!

       In your situation I would imagine the parents saw the potential for greatness and pushed you with the intention of activating inner genius or whatever while your siblings showed no such potenial.

       Well whatever they may or may not have seen, I walked my path and did the best I could with what I had.  Just a month ago, I finally let go of the anger I've held in and finally told them both I was sick of the family drama and their issues that started years before I was born.  Pretty sure I've been written out of dad's will now, but I feel better.

       it's only illegal if the government doesn't get their cut... don't mistake legalization for progressive movement. hopefully the kids won't mistake it either. it's all about the money and cutting in the real criminals.

       Agree with the general gist, but there are hundreds of beneficial plants you can certainly grow and use freely.

       The problem is ignorance, and thus laws making commercialization prohibitively hard. (because nobody can afford to inform people about these things)

       Thanks for explaining and after reading this I’ve realized I came across the same concept a few weeks ago, I guess I didn’t fully grasp it then. Matter of fact I believe the hidden hand interview goes over something like this in some parts. If you haven’t read it, it’s pretty interesting give it a go. Def weird in some parts but interesting nonetheless.

       Plus one on the Corbett plug, I wouldn't say it's the only reason but it's definitely a keep factor. So many people are ignorant as to why 99 percent of our medicine is based off a snake oil salesman and what he taught to his oil tycoon son.

       Yeah.  Most people get concerned any time you mention lye.  The thing is there are only so many salts because you are using the limited salts from the very plant itself.  I believe (but haven't tested it yet) that by the time all of the oily compounds have saponified the alkalinity is all used up.  It's a beautiful concept.

       There is a definite and immediate reaction when the salts are added back to the tincture.  It darkens and takes on a faint, almost "inky" scent.  Turmeric turns from yellow into the most beautiful spectrum of red to orange to yellow to green.

       One day I did an experiment thus.  Having a tincture of cannabis I took a teaspoon and poured it onto a plate to evaporate.  I then added the salts of the cannabis to the tincture (making the Spagyric) and did the same thing pouring a little onto a plate for evaporation.  After both were dry of alcohol such that there was only a residue left behind, I poured distilled water on top.  The Spagyric residue immediately washed away, while the oily tincture wouldn't budge no matter how long it soaked (because it's oily).

      <p>
       It's obvious what this means for increasing our body's ability to absorb these saponified compounds.  It makes so much sense!  How could we have forgotten this?  I'm pretty sure it's no accident.

       It's my goal to help to re-introduce this knowledge to the world at a time when we need it the most.

       There are actually even more powerful extracts that can be made, however they are made in private and are only administered to those who created them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most powerful plant extract is called a "Plant Stone". It is the same thing as the philosopher's stone, but for the plant kingdom. With a plant stone, you could take any other plant, chop it all, put it in a jar, cover it with water and toss the plant stone into it. Within 15 minutes the plant stone will penetrate the plant and extract the "quintessence" of the plant which will float on top. The stone will be unchanged. The plant stone is literally a KEY to the plant kingdom.

       This is the book I started with.  Alchemy is one hell of a Rabbit hole!  The "Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy"  By Junius.  Translated from Italian (I believe).

       You cannot understand addiction without actually going through it. Willpower is not enough. No part of recovery says you must take meds. Recovery usually consists of working a 12 step program. Drugs highjack the reward system in your brain. It gets straight down into the most ancient parts of our brain that tell us what we need for survival. When we eat that part of our brain tells the other parts to release chemicals such as dopamine to tell us this is good keep doing this we need this to survive. Same with sex and anything that make you feel good that is what is happening. Drugs release these same chemicals however in massive amounts the brain would never normally release. So the rest of the brain makes the connection saying this is pivotal in survival. It puts using drugs at priority number one for survival. Now obviously we can think through this and know they do not equal survival but that is how it feels. Going even a day without drugs to an addict feels indescribably horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of this the brain has a thing called a hedonic set point. That means that there’s a certain level of brain chemicals that need to be released for it to register. Now when the brain is constantly flooded with chemicals from drugs it attempts to restore balance. It does this by raising the hedonic set point so it takes more chemicals to elicit a response. This is what is known as a tolerance. This also means that normal thing such as sex and eating will not register once the set point is high enough. This is why many addicts lose weight and stop doing anything beneficial because they get nothing out of it. There is no drive to do anything anymore besides drugs because they are the only thing that feels good.

       This isn’t just hard drugs either. This all happened to me from daily marijuana use. I pawned my video games, my most prized possessions at the time to buy fucking weed. Not because of withdrawal or lack of willpower but because internally I was in hell. The depression and anxiety and overall feeling of dread I experienced back then was as I said something only an addict can understand. And honesty the part I find weird is that I was more emotionally distraught when all I did was weed than later in my using when I actually  was addicted to hard drugs that induced withdrawal.

       Addiction is a disease. It’s not a choice. Addicts make the same choice to use drugs just like any other person. Supposedly the phenomenon of craving is what separates us. When an addict uses something happens that just makes them want more. No amount of any drug will satisfy the craving. An example is with alcoholics, when normal people have a couple drinks they get tired and don’t like feeling out of control so they stop. When an alcoholic takes the same drinks they feel like they are just getting started. This is why many alcoholics drink until they puke and pass out. Their body gives up before their brain is satisfied.
      </p>

       Addiction is so complicated not everything is known about it to this day. However it is accepted as a disease by all medical associations at least in the United States . And I’m passionate about this because obviously I am an addict and also because there is so much misconception and stigma attached to it. People say it’s a choice we just don’t have willpower and they just adds to the shame that we already carry with us.
