        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Somewhat similar to 1984...but perhaps a window in time of the transition to the dystopian state rather than the end result.</p>

<p>I&#39;m watching it right now on Netflix and felt this eerie sense of familiarity. Like the movie was loudly trying to tell me something. Actually this was an issue when the movie came out as well and they even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show_delusion">named a disorder</a> after it. But I felt like it was really making a statement about the world, not so much myself. </p>

<p>Then it totally struck me that this movie is a perfect allegory for the way everyone lives their lives through social media, and camera phones being EVERYWHERE always watching. Even if you stay away from it, it&#39;s affected every modern culture on the planet. It&#39;s no secret what social media does to the brain, and how it puts you in your own bubble. This creates a double whammy because not only does everyone go around feeling like a Truman, but to everyone else people who feel like Truman present like actors in the show because they aren&#39;t being their true selves. </p>

<p>Being genuine relaxed and letting down your guard is a rare thing these days. What with cameras everywhere ready to catch all your mistakes everyone walks around stiff, with fake smiles. We have become The freaking Truman Show. Creepy.</p>

<p>I originally posted this in <a href="/r/showerthoughts">/r/showerthoughts</a> but I get auto screened there so I dunno if it will even show up.  So I thought, even though I don&#39;t necessarily have a specific conspiracy theory about this, it does give me that special conspiracy feeling.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solipsism and the Hero&#39;s Journey have both been around for centuries, it&#39;s a deeply ingrained archetype in us, a tool of the ego.</p>

<p>Not saying you&#39;re wrong, it is a decent allegory, but our modern solipsism isn&#39;t caused by our technology, our technology is the manifest of it already being inside of us, which is where artful-expressions like Truman come from as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a point in the movie where they actually somewhat cover this.  When things start to go weird and he&#39;s talking with his friend on the bridge, where his friend is like &quot;we all like to imagine we are the center of the universe from time to time..etc&quot; and Truman insists that it&#39;s more than that.  You also have to just look at the premise.  He&#39;s living as someone else&#39;s unwitting prisoner so they can watch him for entertainment.  The premise itself blows way past &quot;is this real...is it a dream&quot; and lets you know first thing, real guy/ fake world.  They didn&#39;t make that a twist at the end or something, they didn&#39;t leave you wondering because &quot;who knows&quot;.  You know right from the beginning.  They also show several moments where the signs that it&#39;s fake are almost overly obvious.  Like how could he possibly not have noticed yet?  Someone else pointed out this line “people accept the reality that they are presented” and I think that is really key.</p>

<p>So I agree and you aren&#39;t wrong but there is another element here that is spookily similar to the way things are right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From 96 to 99 he did The Cable Guy, Liar Liar, The Truman Show and Man on the Moon.  That was like the golden age of his career as far as movies with a little more depth to them.  Dumb and Dumber, The Mask, Ace Ventura.. all great movies but lacking in a certain depth and more just relying on him being hilarious.</p>

<p>Those 5 years are when he was getting some more well rounded parts, not just &quot;Jim Carrey the dancing clown&quot; roles.  Me Myself and Irene is also a good movie but I feel like that was where he kinda jumped the shark.  From that movie on everything he does just feels very commercial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but that was a standout, those other movies were all back to back.  That&#39;s why I consider that his &quot;golden age&quot; but yeah Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was crazy deep.  It was also a very different role for him, it wasn&#39;t a comedy at all.  Definitely a great movie that showed his range but you wouldn&#39;t really bundle it in as a &quot;Jim Carrey movie&quot; if you know what I mean.  You could say the same for Cable Guy I suppose but that was more just a dark comedy and people were used to him being zany.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a good basic point and I’m so happy to see people who admit it and know that WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO <em>OR WHERE</em> WE ARE.</p>

<p>Does anyone else find it interesting that movies about time travel or world in a world ideas always take us to a 1950s “Leave it to Beaver” environment? </p>

<p>Pleasantville, Truman Show, Back to the Future, Planet 51 (literally the alien planet was in the 1950s).</p>

<p>I think this is a literal message not a metaphor (well a metaphor but a blatant one).</p>

<p>NASA lies bc maybe the earth isn’t flat but maybe because it’s so big and this humanity is one of many groups or maybe NASA lies because they don’t want us to see the way we are in a Petri dish.</p>

<p>The likeliness of Zoo Hypothesis grows for me the more I learn about our reality and how the world has been fabricated.</p>

<p>Even the ancient sites are like scenes on a massive SET. The Sphinx and Stonehenge, large mysteries planted on set because “human curiosity needs mystery as well as some confusion to keep the veil over our origins.” Confusion and fear are the necessary ingredients to keep us with Global Stockholm Syndrome. Even the moon- LOOK AT IT- looks like a massive PROP. </p>

<p>In Captain Underpants the Movie there’s a scene where they show a globe and then the letters on the board spell PROP. </p>

<p>Most people live in a mass delusion, including myself until I woke up to it (which was 3 years into my awakening process which is now ongoing and will be until I die) </p>

<p>I watched this as a kid and was so confused until the very end of it.  Actually I&#39;m starting to remember pieces of the beginning but I don&#39;t think 8 year old me put it together.  </p>

<p>This movie has seriously stuck with me through my life though.  Its probably why I have dissociation issues.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the same feeling when watching this and a lot of other things, like Netflix’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events”  there’s little things everywhere in that and it feels like it goes beyond the story and it’s as if the writer is trying to tell people something without coming out and saying it. </p>

<p>For Truman Show, I always thought they were pointing to the fact that there’s so much more we don’t know. Truman could have easily lived where he was the rest of his life and never caught on. But it was his noticing little discrepancies and even chancing sounding crazy to his friends and family. In my 30 years of life I’ve witnessed a few things that just seem so much bigger then random happenings. To me, I hear a “keep searching” message to the whole movie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Given that it was a big budget mainstream movie it&#39;s less likely that it was a warning and more of a priming.

    <div class="md"><p>So, I know this isn&#39;t r/movies, but before this was released there were several articles about it being rated r. This is a pg film, I&#39;ve always been curious as to what the cuts are, and the original version and if it had a more sinister tone. </p>
