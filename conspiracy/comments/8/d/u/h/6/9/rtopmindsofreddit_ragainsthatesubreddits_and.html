        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Posting this from a throwaway account as I&#39;m sure TMOR, AHS and SPLC will try to doxx me. </p>

<p>First of all, lets take a look at what the &quot;Southern Poverty Law Center&quot; is. According to their <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/about-us/our-history">website</a>, SPLC is a organization aimed to &quot;to ensure that the promise of the civil rights movement became a reality for all.&quot;</p>

<p>Sounds noble. But if you browse through their website, it&#39;s quite obvious: They are an organization that targets and attacks anyone and anything that shows remote support/identification to the &quot;Right&quot;. The &quot;Right&quot; being Conservatives, Republicans etc. etc. </p>

<p>SPLC is so powerful, and I bet none of you knew this, they are the ones behind <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2018/02/27/google-youtube-southern-poverty-law-center-censorship/">YouTube and Google&#39;s intense censorship of &#39;extremist content&#39;</a>. SPLC is in charge of policing for YouTube and Google. </p>

<p>But what falls under &#39;extremist content&#39; you may ask? <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-07/southern-poverty-law-center-gets-creative-to-label-hate-groups"><strong>Conservative organizations</strong></a>. Yes. SPLC has labeled Conservative organizations as &quot;hate groups&quot; which is a classification under their &#39;extremist content&#39;. Do you see where this is going?</p>

<p>SPLC polices extremist content. SPLC labels any Conservative organization a &quot;hate group&quot;. SPLC censors any and all Conservative content.</p>

<p>Just the other day, they released a <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/04/19/day-trope-white-nationalist-memes-thrive-reddits-rthedonald">hit piece about The_Donald</a>. It&#39;s quite the pathetic read. It targets and attacks Trump supporters and the like, <em>clearly</em> showing it&#39;s bias. What is interesting though is the SPLC seems to have a keen interest about Reddit.</p>

<p>SPLC has their own subreddit, <a href="/r/SPLCenter">/r/SPLCenter</a>. It&#39;s not a very active subreddit, but their moderator list is quite extensive for a subreddit with 646 users. </p>

<p>Looking further into their moderator list, you can see that some of SLPC&#39;s moderators are also moderators of TMOR and AHS. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>User duckvimes_ is a moderator for <strong>SPLC</strong>, <strong>TopMindsOfReddit</strong> and <strong>AgainstHateSubreddits</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>User WorseThanHipster is a moderator for <strong>SPLC</strong>, <strong>TopMindsOfReddit</strong>, <strong>AgainstHateSubreddits</strong>, FuckTheAltRight and Politics</p></li>
<li><p>User LIATG is a moderator for <strong>SPLC</strong>, <strong>TopMindsOfReddit</strong>, <strong>AgainstHateSubreddits</strong> and various other questionable subreddits. </p></li>
<li><p>User DanglyW is a moderator for <strong>SPLC</strong>, <strong>TopMindsOfReddit</strong>, <strong>AgainstHateSubreddits</strong>, HateSpeechOnTheWeb, EnoughRightSpam and various other subreddits.</p></li>
<li><p>User siouxsie_siouxv2 is a moderator for <strong>SPLC</strong>, <strong>TopMindsOfReddit</strong>, <strong>AgainstHateSubreddits</strong>, BlackPeopleTwitter and about a million other subreddits. </p></li>
<li><p>User Br00ce is a moderator for <strong>SPLC</strong>, <strong>TopMindsOfReddit</strong>, <strong>AgainstHateSubreddits</strong>, Trumpgret and various other subreddits. </p></li>
<li><p>User awkwardtheturtle is a moderator for <strong>SPLC</strong>, <strong>TopMindsOfReddit</strong>, <strong>AgainstHateSubreddits</strong> and various other subreddits which display hatred of the &quot;right&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>User Quietus42 is a moderator for <strong>SPLC</strong>, <strong>TopMindsOfReddit</strong>, <strong>AgainstHateSubreddits</strong>, FuckTheAltRight, OffensiveSpeech, MarchAgainstNazis and other subreddits. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The bolded subreddits are time and time again seen to attack, not only <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, it&#39;s moderators and users, but The_Donald, and numerous other &quot;right leaning&quot; subreddits. </p>

<p>These users, for whatever reason, belong to a subreddit of an organization that classifies &quot;Conservative groups&quot; as hate groups and extremist groups. </p>

<p>It seems highly suspicious to me that these users, users chosen to run a subreddit dedicated to a organization that targets previously mention groups, also run subreddits that always attack, berate and brigade this subreddit and others. </p>

<p>Seems like a conspiracy in and of itself that SPLC is probably controlling these subreddits to &quot;attack offensive speech on reddit&quot;, aka anything coming from someone on the right. </p>

<p>They tried to claim a Trump supporter &quot;double posted,&quot; which means they forgot to sign into a different account and replied to themselves. This is immediately determined to be a &quot;Russian&quot; on <a href="/r/thedonald">/r/thedonald</a>, but this double poster was actually anti-Trump. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t read from that sub very often, so from me almost immediately seeing fake news posted there makes me wonder just how much fakery is there. Probably a lot. </p>

<p>I used to respect S.P.L.C., thinking they were doing great work.  Now I&#39;m not so sure.  Like a lot of groups, they could be compromised by the CIA.  </p>

<p>Take a look at an organization called &quot;The Media Consortium&quot; which contributes money to lots of outstanding left-of-center news magazines.  The CIA is trying to squirm its way into all of them with varying degrees of success and failure.</p>

<p>I think I found &quot;The Media Consortium&#39;s&quot; monetary benefactor list from a Newsbud article:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.themediaconsortium.org/member-directory">https://www.themediaconsortium.org/member-directory</a></p>

<p>The Corbett Report has an excellent video about the S.P.L.C. too:</p>

Her work is simple enough for someone who isn&#39;t entirely &quot;in the know&quot; to understand. She&#39;s written <em>a lot</em> about the MSM and their deceptions and lies. </p>

<p>I&#39;m happy Corbett covered the SPLC but his video took a very simplistic view of them IMO, he could have done a lot better as he has way more resources than most of us do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In another thread, you wrote, &quot;I love reading about music conspiracies, it&#39;s possibly my favorite sub-genre of conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>Then I think you&#39;ll really love John Potash&#39;s book called <strong><em>Drugs As Weapons Against Us: The CIA&#39;s Murderous Targeting of SDS, Panthers, Hendrix, Lennon, Cobain, Tupac, and Other Leftists</em></strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s also a whole lot of information in the book about the CIA&#39;s evil MK-Ultra program, the murder of Frank Olson, the CIA&#39;s deeply criminal involvement in drug trafficking, etc.</p>

<p>This is a really well-done book that is meticulously annotated. Lots and lots of footnotes.  A great, very enjoyable read too.  Potash is an excellent writer -- keeps you highly engaged in the material.  One of my favorite books.</p>

<p>By the way, for those who may not know, the &quot;SDS&quot; in the book&#39;s title is &quot;Students for a Democratic Society,&quot; a group that is very opposed to wars, supports progressive ideals, and works to achieve true democracy / Participatory Democracy in the USA. </p>

<p>The SDS was around in the 1960s, AND is back again since 2006.  Here&#39;s a link to info about the New SDS:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good post, put your premise is wrong. This sub is not fundamentally a &quot;right-leaning&quot; sub - it is politically non-aligned. </p>

<p>Many users bring their own political viewpoints here, but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> exists to expose the corruption of the elites and the permanent state, challenges the mainstream media and questions the propaganda of agenda-driven &quot;historians&quot; and &quot;scientists&quot;.</p>

<p>It just so happens that Hillary Clinton is one of the most corrupt politicians the United States has ever produced, and Donald Trump&#39;s severe personality failings still pale in comparison to hers. This is why she is so despised in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - nothing to do with her &quot;politics&quot;. </p>

<p>Bernie Sanders had as much, if not more support here than Trump did, and the DNC&#39;s corrupt nomination process (which ensured Hillary got the Dem nomination) just made her even more hated. If you&#39;re in any doubt, this is an important factor in why she lost the election to Trump - large numbers of real, hardcore democrats were so disgusted with the treatment of Bernie Sanders that they abstained, or voted for Trump in protest.</p>

<p>I understand why you would feel so, it is a ridiculous requirement to have to provide your body. </p>

<p>It would also be absurd to require a person to have to provide a 20 million dollar mansion for a child. That does not mean a person living in such a place should be allowed to physically remove their child to die on the doorstep because otherwise they are being forced to provide what we agree is a ridiculous requirement.</p>

<p>That is because the requirement isn&#39;t the specific burden, it is about how not broken people don&#39;t kill the not guilty especially not their offspring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but at that point it&#39;s not classified as abortion anymore even by doctors. You can&#39;t even get an abortion after a few months. It has to be done within the first 3 months of pregnancy.</p>

<p>Also, that&#39;s an arbitrary thing you didn&#39;t even mean when you first brought it up. You&#39;re &quot;moving the goalpost&quot; in the most textbook manner here. Not trying to insult you or anything as I get your point, just saying that you can add all sorts of new qualifiers for <em>anything</em>: &quot;I think murder is okay&quot;, &quot;no it&#39;s not!&quot;, &quot;but what if the person being murdered would die 5 minutes later anyway, slipping on a banana peel??&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this is an interesting position to take.  There are certain times that murdering is acceptable in our society.  Self defense, for example.  Little regard is made for the motives or rationale of perp who gets shot.</p>

<p>So you are opposed to murdering fetuses, but you are (probably) not opposed to murdering through same person if they grow up (unwanted, fatherless, poor role models) and become a small-time burglar and get shot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious where you draw that line.</p>

<p>Not if the unborn child is viable, and would survive ex utero in its own right - there are (at least) two humans that have to be considered in this scenario. </p>

<p>At 8/9 months an abortion (essentially chopping the foetus up inside the womb and extracting it in pieces through the vagina) would be no different to delivering the live child by caesarian section, and then chopping it up into pieces in the delivery room. Murder both ways.</p>

<p>I have changed my mind in light of new information.</p>

<p>I believe that if the umbilical cord is cut and the fetus has zero percent chance of survival, then a woman has the choice to terminate it.</p>

<p>I am guessing up to around 8 months, but yeah, not the day before the due date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very far right and I&#39;m going to explain why its a problem for us:</p>

<p>(Note - I&#39;m not trying to get into an argument with you, but I want to explain why we feel the way we do)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but then I believe that a woman should be allowed and be funded by the government if they are poor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ost right wing people have no problem helping someone if they truly are not able. We have a problem with helping people who are able but are lazy. To me, only the blind and the retarded(and maybe a couple of other serious illnesses) are truly unable to do any type of work like taking phone calls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to have an abortion at any time in the pregnancy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with this idea is that it tends to encourage more pre-martial sex which doesn&#39;t agree with Christian/Catholic values and has helped lead to the destruction of the nuclear family, which is the crux of the right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the death penalty should be abolished</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one on the right wants their tax dollars used to help a criminal live. There&#39;s two groups of people that the majority of the population will have very little sympathy for - the rich and the criminals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>same sex marrage is fine by me etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By our definition of marriage, it can never be between men and men or females and females. I also believe even if you are somehow inclined to be attracted to men, you can always choose not to act on it. </p>

<p>I know what you mean, but if we allow poor people to reproduce if they don&#39;t want the child anyway, then they are going to be an even bigger burden on tax payers </p>

<p>This goes against right leaning thinking though, in that we want less government control of our lives.</p>

<p>You are describing a subset of right leaning thinkers who believe in religious dogma.</p>

<ol>
<li>It costst many time more to execute someone than it does to house them for 30 years.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have a specific set of legal thresholds that must be cleared before someone can be executed. California studies found as much as 18 times for instance for execution vs life without parole</p>

<p>Mandatory appeals take a long time. </p>

<p>When the Ultra Progressive Liberals get into power, they are going to have apps/sites/etc where everyone will be reporting anyone who even dares make a joke or irony or anything that triggers anyone, with all sorts of incentives/rewards/points systems.</p>

<p>This is already happening in China. After that, you are not that far away from going to prison for thought crimes (U.K./Germany) and then eventually work camps/death camps</p>

<li><p>I don&#39;t think Trump has had any major policy announcements that matched reality.  The NK stuff is interesting but from what has leaked out it had nothing to do with Trump.  NK lost a ton of resources when their nuclear facility blew up, and Kim Jong Un has decided to temporarily halt production because of it.  They&#39;re playing the long game.  Again, Trump literally had nothing to do with this.</p></li>
<li><p>From the information coming out, it does look very likely Russian government or russian organization are behind some crazy amount of shit in the US, including possibly hacking our elections.  There is also a very strong connection between Russians and our current administration, which is very unusual in our history of presidential administrations(usually Israel tops that list.)</p></li>
<li><p>I haven&#39;t seen a single person in those subs call for war.  I have seen a few people call for intervention to stop Assad from gassing people.  What type of intervention is heavily debated from sanctions to troops on the ground.  The point is that people want to stop other people from suffering.  This is a good thing, even if you disagree with methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Sensible gun control is a mainstream opinion. 93% of NRA members push for expanding background checks and other things.  Very few people want to completely ban all civilian use of firearms.  Some people are ok with banning certain types of firearms, and others are not ok with banning any firearms but moving to licensing like a car which can also be a deadly weapon.</p></li>
<li><p>What is obvious as propaganda to you, isn&#39;t so obvious to others.  Our media does good things and bad things.  We try to celebrate the good and admonish the bad.</p></li>
<li><p>9/11 false flag is a very fringe idea.  The evidence backing it is dubious and downright silly when it rejects physics.  Ultimately even if it was a false flag, they got away with it.  No one has a single document that proves it, and unless you can prove it in a court of law, it cannot effect us.  It&#39;s the equivalent of saying their is a 10th planet in our solar system.  Research it but until it is proven, it doesn&#39;t effect us on a day to day basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Transgender people have been a part of societies for about 5,500+ years.  We have found clear skeleton remains that point to this.  We have written documentation from Egyptian times on up to present day, for many cultures.  We have documented this in small tribes around the world(Papua New Guinea, Amazon, Alaskan.)  We have brain scans and hormonal tests that seem to directly point to it.  We&#39;re still researching the &#39;why&#39; and &#39;how&#39;.  My personal theory is it is an in utero thing, which would explain why it is rare but very normal around the world.  Even if you don&#39;t personally agree with it, you can treat a transgender person with respect and care.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve had more genders for thousands of years.  Binary genders isn&#39;t reality when we have 14 documented sex chromosomal disorders.  The science is clear on this one. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome_disorders">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome_disorders</a></p></li>

<p>I trust my own rational thinking, for instance, the four MSM news agencies I posted, three of them claim Bashar Assad gassed his own people, one (RT) says he didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>So lets&#39;s logically think about this, what sense did it make for him to do this? None is the answer.</p>

<p>What sense does it make that it was an orchestrated false flag attack by his opposition? numerous is the answer.</p>

<p>Is there any actual evidence that Bashar Assad gassed his own people? again, no is the answer.</p>

<p>So why are the three MSM that I mentioned trying to tell us all he did.</p>

<p>The answer is obvious, it&#39;s propaganda.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no such thing as hate speech</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, saying that everyone from a religion is evil (some even call them literally satan soldiers) is in no way a fuel for hate, i guess saying that everyone in this sub is retarded wouldn&#39;t be hateful towards the people in this sub right</p>

<blockquote>
<p>, sorry people say things you don&#39;t agree with buddy </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about agreeing, it isn&#39;t even about being hateful, i actually don&#39;t care if the nazis around here try to be hatrful bastards, i&#39;m just saying that if you like to insult other people don&#39;t start getting triggered and complain about &quot;the anti hate speech folk atracking us&quot; when you are attackin people in the first place, the antisemitic ant Sjw folks should stop being such pussies and stop complaining about being treated the way they treat others</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t try to go around and make everyone believe that how you think they should think and act is the only way to properly do so</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said that i should stop being a &quot;pussy sjw shit&quot; and fuck off of this subreddit because i don&#39;t agree with you, isn&#39;t that also trying to go around and make people act like you want? Isn&#39;t that literally being a censoring pussy who wants to curb dissenting opinions and bring a safe space? Lol</p>

<p>Also, when did SJWs start victim blaming?

<p>What&#39;s funny is you&#39;re actually referencing people that come from TMoR simply to act anti-semetic just to paint this community in that light in order to justify their &quot;anti-hate&quot; brigades.

How about we just let people have their opinions, like my suggestion that you&#39;re peddling pussy SJW shit and this community would be better off without it - Simply a suggestion my man.

<p>Lol, so is all antisemitism in this sub a false flag done by the SJWs? So ehy are you defending the right of being antisemitic and not agreein that these people should be banned?

<p>What kind of opinions? The antisemitic ones? But i tought that there was no real antisemitism and it was only a total farce, why would they do a farce to ban something that don&#39;t actually happens?

<p>Correct, these would be infringements of the right to speech if they were passed.</p>

<p>This also would indeed be a violation of your right to life if it were happening.  By the way, the EPA&#39;s permitting process that allows corporations to pollute largely indiscriminately so long as they have a permit for it is <strong>also</strong> a violation of your right to life, but maybe that&#39;s a different subject.</p>

The fact that I never spend time at TD (banned for talking about 9/11 over a year ago) doesn&#39;t even seem to matter. You&#39;re not here to discuss conspiracies. You&#39;re not even here to engage in any type of constructive dialog imo. You&#39;re here to label and brand people under false pretenses in order to achieve some kind of &quot;persecution &quot; mentality to undermine users on this sub who disagree with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>um no, conspiracy theorists are typically right leaning. So was this sub, before trump.</p>

<p>Why does one become a conspiracy theorist? Because he has too much time on his hands and society has failed him / he feels oppressed. </p>

<p>Though some paranoid leftists with too much time on their hands might have started feeling like their world is crashing and burning since Trumps election, which might explain this sudden influx of leftists in here.</p>

<p>the donald is named &quot;the donald&quot;. It&#39;s a subreddit that&#39;s dedicated to sucking donald trump&#39;s dick, and is named thusly. Of course it downvotes people who criticize trump, and pushes a 100% pro trump narrative. That&#39;s its raison d&#39;être, and they&#39;re very transparent about it</p>

<p>politics is named... politics. You&#39;d think with that name it would be a neutral place. Nope. Pernicious deception. Anything not bashing trump is nuked to oblivion. Countless sites are banned, mainly ones you would consider right wing. If that isn&#39;t censorship I don&#39;t know what is. They give paltry excuses such as &quot;it&#39;s not real news&quot;, despite the fact those sites were previously allowed for years</p>

<p>the difference is TD isn&#39;t masquerading as something isn&#39;t. r/politics is an evil force that potentially brainwashes people who stumble upon it, because they think it&#39;s a reliable unbiased source. They end up seeing a false consensus in an allegedly neutral place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People get called out for Judy Woods&#39; theories as well, are you suddenly both right? If the amount of flak one receives is a measure of truth, then we have 100 competing theories about 9/11 who, by your logic, are all &quot;on to something&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re chasing a dragon, you&#39;re not researching 9/11 by trying to figure out what brought the towers down, you&#39;re looking for self gratification, the high of figuring something out that others don&#39;t know. The fact that you think you we were brigaded and attacked for casually mentioning nukes is a sign that you might be losing the plot and are deluding yourself. No offense.</p>

<p>You&#39;re free to do as you please of course, but in your interest, I&#39;d suggest sticking to disproving the official story, instead of trying to casually inject your own theories.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in fairness I looked into Judy Wood&#39;s stuff too. She has great pictures, and raises a fair point: How <em>did</em> the buildings turn to dust? It got me thinking, anyhow, but nuclear demolition makes a whole lot more sense.</p>

<p>But no, TMOR completely flipped out on me; it was quite a thing to see. I just mentioned something like &quot;Man, I dunno, maybe something bigger like a nuke was involved?&quot;... and They Went Nuts. Immediately, two TMOR posts, followed by a 3rd. Then one more the next day, one the day after. Got my attention real quick!</p>

<p>As for why the demolition mechanism matters: I&#39;m an engineer (by education anyhow), so I want to know how it was done. As with any murder mystery, part of the story is the murder weapon. And there are a slew of very unsettling implications that follow from that, as with 9/11.</p>

<p>This is TMOR&#39;s cover for it&#39;s deceitful and criminal behavior and routine rule breaking.  Under the sacrosanct guise of being an &quot;anti-racism&quot;, &quot;pro-diversity&quot;, &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot;, &quot;The Onion-style&quot;, joke subreddit, they stifle conversation and brigade subs that do not follow the lockstep of mainstream opinion.</p>

<p>In truth, they have very little to do with anti-racism and everything to do with spreading hate and MSM-talking points.</p>

<p>Not if the unborn child is viable, and would survive ex utero in its own right - there are (at least) two humans that have to be considered in this scenario. </p>

<p>At 8/9 months an abortion (essentially chopping the foetus up inside the womb and extracting it in pieces through the vagina) would be no different to delivering the live child by caesarian section, and then chopping it up into pieces in the delivery room. Murder both ways.</p>

<p>I understand why you would feel so, it is a ridiculous requirement to have to provide your body. </p>

<p>It would also be absurd to require a person to have to provide a 20 million dollar mansion for a child. That does not mean a person living in such a place should be allowed to physically remove their child to die on the doorstep because otherwise they are being forced to provide what we agree is a ridiculous requirement.</p>

<p>That is because the requirement isn&#39;t the specific burden, it is about how not broken people don&#39;t kill the not guilty especially not their offspring. </p>
