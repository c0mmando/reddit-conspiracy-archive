Overall there has been better reporting on RT than BBC but over the last two years both have become the biggest propaganda machines. You can easily tell which stories are being pushed as both these sources will have the opposite view point every time. </p>

<p>Nothing wrong with leaning to the left if that&#39;s what he wants..but he is devolving in the sense that he&#39;s too stupid too realize Democrat vs Republican don&#39;t mean anything. Then again he NEVER misses a Stepen Colbert episode. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s where all of this brainwashing from every media outlet &amp; &quot;comedy&quot; talking heads are really convincing people that its a Dem or Die situation. Stephen Colbert has been one of the worst ones, and I use to love his show. He made a drastic change. It&#39;s rather bothersome, it seems very sinister.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read so many articles that are telling people to vote straight ticket no matter what to <em>save</em> the country. It&#39;s dangerous, IMO. </p>

<p>So now look at how many &quot;ex&quot;- MI agents are running under the Dem tickets for the midterms and tell me something isn&#39;t amiss.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The general sentiment of this post is one I wouldn&#39;t disagree with at all.  However, I wouldn&#39;t quite go as far as to say that it&#39;s only stupid and blind people that don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.  The MSM and PTB machine is ubiquitous, powerful, and <em>very</em> deceitful.  It&#39;s unfortunately no real big surprise how it is that they were able to dupe so many people into believing whatever it was they were parroting.  You and I both were definitely duped enough at some point.  Heck, none of us really know <em>everything</em> that&#39;s going on.  There are so many competing streams of information - many of which often directly conflict with one another...and all this is the case if one is inquisitive enough to go <em>outside</em> of the msm to find their information...and this is not easy to do.  The world we live in is a world of lies.  It&#39;s a world that has been formulated to make all of us believe in things that are actually <em>not</em> the case.  This is a prison planet and a huge portion of us humans here are still duped by the wardens of the prison into believing we&#39;re living &quot;free&quot;.  The machine protecting the wardens is extremely powerful though, so it&#39;s not <em>that</em> huge a surprise why so many are still living completely duped.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If one is not stupid(lacking understanding of deception and of crimes) nor blind(physically incapable of seeing the evidence) What is the problem?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that <em>all</em> of us are stupid and blind on at least some level and to at least some extent.  Additionally, it’s one thing to have enough awareness to know that something is wrong, or even know what specifically it is that’s wrong and/or who it is that’s making it wrong.  It’s a completely different thing altogether to be willing to do what needs to be done in order to actually fix the problem.</p>

<p>Additionally, while it takes a great deal of will on its own to find out that something is very wrong with the world, and an even greater amount still to be willing to actually do something about it, the prospect of one person alone begin able to make too significant a change in a world they’ve finally woken up to see is broken doesn’t seem very likely at all really.  It seems one person alone can do very little - almost nothing.  We <em>all</em> have to come together as one united human species and move forward as one against the problems facing us if we are to have any real prospect of actually overcoming any of the issues existing here.</p>

<p>TPTB know this, and they have done a very good job of making sure that all the necessary ingredients are in place to all but guarantee that we <em>don’t</em> come together:  The MSM, propaganda, constant distraction, all kinds of elements designed to bring your thinking down to a lower level, and a system of advertising designed to convince everyone that these elements are in fact <em>good</em> for you, and desirable, and should be envied and sought after and striven for…</p>

<p>Freeing oneself from this quagmire of deep manipulation requires a Herculean effort, one which will likely involve ridicule and persecution every step of the way - often from those we care about and love most deeply.</p>

<p>It’s enough to make the strongest of us succumb and simply town the line of that conditioned normalcy that has clouded the civilization.</p>

<p>It’s <em>very</em> difficult for one to break out of the matrix of limitation we’ve been indoctrinated into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lack of moral compass?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes far deeper than just this - although this is in fact the problem on some occasions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because he who cannot morally stand firm for truth, will not fight for it and therefore cannot hold others accountable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many will fall asunder if persecuted hard enough.</p>

<p>Nothing I’ve said here, by the way, should be looked upon as me excusing any weakness or evil in this world.  No.  Far from it.  I’m merely giving the benefit of the doubt and acknowledging that things are not easy on this planet, and that standing - <em>really</em> standing - for truth is exceedingly difficult on Earth in this current age.</p>

<p>We should always, always keep trying and fighting for it, to be sure.  It&#39;s just a prospect that&#39;s not easy to maintain is all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said.  This civilization has been made such that <em>really</em> standing for truth is actually not a very comfortable place to be for many of us at all.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a very strange thing to be the case, is it not?  You would think that standing for truth, and being better, and doing what needs to be done to be a better person is something that should be promoted and generally striven for by everyone and on the deepest levels possible.  However, when you really look into what&#39;s going on here - when you really look under the hood of the car of this civilization - you discover that the reality is quite the opposite.</p>

<p>We have to keep fighting through this, and it&#39;s very good that you said these things and are aware of them...but the reality of things here shows quite clearly that this is a very fucked up world we were born in to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tucker knows enough to &quot;play ball&quot; and steer clear of things like 9/11 or blatant evidence of assassinations [see: Seth Rich], etc. So he&#39;s essentially a &quot;company man&quot; who knows what Official Lies he has to pimp. But he bumblingly crossed their most sacred line: Criticizing the massive revenues of the Military Industrial Complex whenever they want to gin up a war.</p>

<p>Remember: There <em>is</em> no &quot;mainstream media&quot;. There is only the alternative media and CORPORATE media. CORPORATE media is owned by multi-national conglomerates tied into the defense industry and the banking cartels. The &quot;official networks&quot; are the public relations branches of these organizations. That&#39;s why they&#39;re allowed to operate at a loss. It&#39;s just a tax write-off to these mega-corporations, who are willing to lose money since these &quot;news&quot; organizations are merely advertising for them. </p>

<p>In any <em>actual</em> free market capitalist system, no one would tolerate newspapers that lose money for 20 years in a row [like the New York Times]. No one would fire the highest rated people (like MSNBC did when they gave Donahue a pink-slip for questioning the Iraq War, or when they dismissed Cenk Uygher from his time-slot). </p>

<p>These networks don&#39;t care about profits, because they don&#39;t rely on outside money for their existence. They&#39;re supported by the deep pockets of the Shadow Government/International Conglomerate syndicate. </p>

<p>Tucker tried to walk that fine line between toeing the corporate line (on most of the issues he understood to be &quot;third rail&quot; topics), but he erred in his principled stance against Deep State war-mongering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Brian Kilmeade substituted for Tucker tonight (the 3rd night Tucker&#39;s been gone).  In Minute 59 of tonight&#39;s show, Kilmeade said Tucker would be back on Monday from a vacation, but 8 seconds later, Kilmeade says about himself that, [quote] &quot;I&#39;ll be back on Fox And Friends unless I get <em>suspended</em>&quot; -- seemingly hinting that Tucker&#39;s &quot;vacation&quot; that began mid-week Tuesday night may have actually been a suspension.  It&#39;s all speculation on my part, of course, but at least Tucker&#39;s &quot;vacation&quot; wasn&#39;t a permanent vacation like Bill O&#39;Reilly&#39;s sudden vacation.  They announced O&#39;Reilly was on vacation (at the Vatican, no less -- they showed pics of Bill and family at the Vatican), but a couple days later it was announced O&#39;Reilly was not coming back to Fox News -- turned out to be a permanent vacation.  Of course, Bill O&#39;Reilly deserved to be fired.  Tucker does not.</p>
