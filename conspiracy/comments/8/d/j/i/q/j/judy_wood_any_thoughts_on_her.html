    <div class="md"><p>I’m neutral regarding her.</p>

<p>Pictures and video from the immediate aftermath show that, if a pancaking effect did occur, a significant amount of building mass post-collapse is missing. </p>

<p>You seem to make people think you’re smart so answer me this:</p>

<p>If a building ~1,350 feet tall pancaked all the way to the ground, how tall would the remaining debris be approximately, assuming a perfect, unobstructed collapse? Because anything other than a perfect collapse would result in a higher, large remaining pile. So let’s assume everything pancaked to the ground perfectly.</p>

<p>I know math is hard so I’ll wait even though there’s a high probability you don’t come anywhere close to actually answering my question but instead ask questions of your own or side-track.</p>

<p>All I care from you is, how tall should the remains of a ~1,350 foot tall building be approximately after a perfect pancaking collapse?</p>

<p>Hutchinson is a delightfully weird duck.  He strikes me as the living example of Adam Savage&#39;s <em>&quot;Remember kids, the only difference between Science and screwing around is writing it down&quot;</em> because, although he may have stumbled onto something revolutionary in his tinkering, he wasn&#39;t enough of a scientist to keep track of exactly how he did it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think what people think are nuclear demolitions are actually just regular demolitions but with a hollywood twist to it.</p>

<p>Can you not see going to an investigation with the thermite found in the dust would work out better than going to an investigation with nukes would hinder the process?</p>

<p>Like, it would end with the same results.  A fabricated event to force the country to go to war.  Even if in the end after the investigation resulted in the right people going to jail and being hanged for their crimes, <em>then</em> you could start talking about nukes if there was actually evidence for it.  </p>

<p>Would you not support such a thing?  An investigation with the evidence that is clear as day and visible under a microscope?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also for finding the truth. Thermite played a small role, doesn&#39;t come close to answering all the questions. Any real engineering investigation must explain phenomenon observed that day.</p>

<p>And there are huge implications -- political, military, environmental, medical -- of the nuclear demolition that cannot be ignored. Israel nuked the US. That&#39;s pretty damn important!</p>

<p>If you want to prove that the official story is not what we were told, well...that&#39;s already been done, submitted to a government agency, and taken to court. Why cover that up? Why reinvent the wheel? To distract away from what has been done and start all over again to run out the clock?</p>

<p>But your &quot;test&quot; will not prove the official story is incorrect. At best, you will only demonstrate that you were unable to replicate it. That will not prove anything, but just confuse and muddle things up. That&#39;s what keeps a cover up in place. Perhaps that is your objective.</p>

<p>ANATOMY OF A COVERUP</p>

<p>Dr. James Fetzer never destroys Dr. Steven Jones.</p>

<p>Dr. James Fetzer never destroys Mr. Richard Gage.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Gage never destroys Dr. James Fetzer.</p>

<p>Dr. Steven Jones never destroys Dr. James Fetzer.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Gage never destroys Dr. Steven Jones, but actually covers up for him.</p>

<p>It is widely known that the last time Dr. Judy Wood voluntarily spoke with Dr. James Fetzer or exchanged emails was February 2008. That is, it has been nearly 10 years since Dr. Wood HAS NOT voluntarily spoken with Dr. Fetzer or emailed him. So why is Dr. Fetzer still so obsessed with Dr. Wood???</p>

<p>Dr. Wood has never spoken with Mr. Gage, yet Mr. Gage promotes disinformation about Dr. Wood at nearly every interview he does – if not every interview. Dr. Fetzer also promotes disinformation about Dr. Wood in nearly every interview he does. Yet none of them have ever refuted anything Dr. Wood has presented.</p>

<p>Dr. Wood does not make any claims. Dr. Wood is not an Internet blogger tasked with the job of swaying public opinion like Richard Gage, Dr. James Fetzer, and their government run organization is doing. Dr. Wood is a forensic engineer and scientist. Dr. Wood conducts research and writes reports. That is what Dr. Wood does. Dr. Wood does not have a dog in this fight. If someone has not read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?, they have no standing to dispute it.</p>

<p>THE DIRECTED ENERGY COVER-UP TEAM</p>

<p><a href="https://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50694/images/Richard-DavidG-StevenJ.jpg">https://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50694/images/Richard-DavidG-StevenJ.jpg</a></p>

<p>Other examples of Directed Energy (not necessarily used as a weapon) are radio waves, cell phone signals, TV remote control signals, wireless internet signals...etc.</p>

<p>Those who want to cover up the evidence of what happen often falsely claim that Dr. Wood is talking about a specific weapon and a specific location of it (e.g. laser beam from outer space, or &quot;spacebeams&quot;). This disinformation campaign was initiated by Steven Jones on 11/11/2006 in a presentation he gave at the University of California, Berkeley.[ available here at 1:53:47 <a href="https://archive.org/details/liftingthefog_2006_11_11_session2">https://archive.org/details/liftingthefog_2006_11_11_session2</a> ], telling his audience that &quot;Judy Woods (Dr. Wood) says it&#39;s a laser or maser from space&quot; while showing how difficult it is to hold his hand like a beam from space. Not only does Dr. Wood NOT SAY THAT, she actually RULES THAT OUT. The mechanism of destruction of a laser beam would be from heat and produce a bright and blinding light. But we know the buildings were not cooked to death. The term Directed Energy is used because energy is directed to do something different then it normally does and it is directed to do this within a certain geographic zone. [As a mental example, think of directing the binding energy of matter to repel instead of attract. A solid object would turn to atomic-sized dust. Direct this to happen within the WTC complex and not across the street.]</p>

<p>At the end of Chapter 20 in Dr. Wood&#39;s book, she explains why playing &quot;name the weapon&quot; game is counterproductive. Name dropping trendy terms is not synonymous with understanding. The easiest example is HAARP. The full capabilities are classified. But people often name-drop the trendy term to APPEAR to know something. A tongue-in-cheek definition of HAARP stands for High Amplitude Advancement of Real Propaganda. They are just substituting &quot;HAARP&quot; for &quot;Bin Laden.&quot;</p>

<p>In Dr. Wood&#39;s book, the closest she comes to &quot;naming a weapon&quot; is merely describing what it creates: magnetic-electrogravitic-nuclear reactions (page 365). But as soon as someone starts talking about a name, people will stop looking at the evidence which is another form of a cover up.</p>

<p>Early on, Dr. Steven Jones created a website he called &quot;The Journal of Nine Eleven Studies&quot; or J.O.N.E.S. It is referred to as a &quot;peer-reviewed journal&quot; but the only peer-reviewing was to screen out true scientific work and post what he wanted his followers to believe. For the first two years, it was primarily used to promote disinformation about Dr. Wood&#39;s work. For example, Jones recruited a patent attorney for the oil and gas industry (James Gourley) to write hit pieces on Dr. Wood, refuting &quot;ray beams from outer space.&quot; This convinced his readers that &quot;Judy Woods&quot; must be talking about &quot;ray beams from outer space&quot; and that &quot;such nonsense has been refuted.&quot; Refuting false propaganda about Dr. Wood&#39;s work does not refute Dr. Wood&#39;s work -- yet it creates the belief in the average person that Dr. Wood&#39;s work has been refuted.</p>

<p>Steven Jones and Greg Jenkins also claimed that it would take more than five times the world&#39;s energy to destroy the WTC towers. Does that mean their thermite came from off planet or &quot;outer space&quot;? LOL Steven Jones used to ridicule Dr. Wood during his talks saying that &quot;Judy Woods (Dr. Wood) needs to make calculations to see if it is even possible to turn the buildings to dust&quot;. But any reputable scientist knows that calculations are not a part of observing empirical evidence. What are the calculations for, to prove the buildings are still there or if the buildings are gone? Why not just look? No assumptions needed with empirical evidence.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that no one has refuted anything in Dr. Wood&#39;s book nor can they. They only refute their own false propaganda about her book, not her book. Other detractors claim that &quot;she hasn&#39;t identified the weapon that was used so she&#39;s got nothing.&quot; To the contrary. The evidence is PROOF that there exists a technology that can do what was done. It happened. That is, the fact that the buildings mostly turned to dust in mid-air shows that there exists a weapon that can turn buildings into dust in mid-air. It happened.</p>

<p>The sub-title of the book, &quot;Evidence of Directed Free-Energy Technology on 9/11&quot; indicates that the book contains evidence of what happened on 9/11 and it is indeed evidence that a technology exists that can do what was done. But this technology does not have to be used for evil purposes. It can be used to provide free-energy to the world much to the demise of the oil and gas industry. That is, Dr. Wood is noting that the same technology that was used for evil can also be used for good. It&#39;s a silver lining in the dark cloud... while also trying to stimulate thought about &quot;what are we doing here? learning new ways to kill or to live&quot;?</p>

<p>Could James Gourley (a patent attorney for the petroleum industry) be disbarred because of his lack of integrity for writing a propaganda hit piece on Dr. Judy Wood? All he did was write false information and then debunked the false information. See how easy it is to run a cover-up! The evidence Dr. Wood puts forth actually eliminates space based lasers because that is a form of kinetic energy. Now what interests would want to keep free energy covered up in exchange for endless war and oppression Mr. Gourley???</p>
