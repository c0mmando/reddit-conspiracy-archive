<p>you underestimate human nature. Comey, who was just head of one of the deepstate branches, is literally hanging himself right now with his public speaking engagements, interviews, his memos being released, and those who are deepstate are starting to turn on him.</p>

<p>You had the Mainstream Misledia oversampling the polls and lying that she was going to win no matter what, and no one took Trump serious besides a couple of pollsters who were purists in their statistical sampling.</p>

<p>Put in a few interesting circumstances, Comey admitting the investigation into Hillary, the rise of the Far-right against all the B.S. the progressives are creating on the left (SafeSpaces, calling anyone who disagree hitler, calling for an end to free speech and 2A, virtue signaling, etc)</p>

<p>and a number of other factors. Personally <a href="https://i.redd.it/qn77m87po9r01.jpg">I still think they are going to 187 him</a> before 2020 or once certain stock, market, economic position are in place to handle the crash that would happen from something like this.</p>

<p>On the other end, as long as he picks is battles and plays nice with whoever is the highest up on the pyramid, then he can get the ones lower on the rung to turn on each other.</p>

<p>Is all a complex game of IRL Civ</p>

<p>perhaps you forgot that the last guy was buddy buddy with them as well, and Bush flew some of the out of the U.S. when 9/11 happened. Or you forgot about the US dollar is a Petro Dollar controlled by the Saudis who can single handedly collapse the American economy by dropping USD as mandatory for Oil trade, or that they own a ton of our debt.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you are also unaware that a mini revolution just happened in S.A. and a new Prince took over who is progressive, allowing women to drive, allowing AMC to build movie theaters there, and all of a sudden a shit ton of ISIS financing, firepower, and numbers have all dried up</p>

<p>I&#39;m a libertarian, so I was a &quot;fuck both sides&quot; gut from the get go. The reason I think he is legit now, because he has done plenty of Fuck You&#39;s to the system, called out the Globalists, didn;t sign the Globalist Paris Agreement, renegotiating Tariffs, Steel, the N.K. deal, the Muellers/Clintons/MI5/FBI after him, the media lying about him (while they sucked off Obama for 8 years) and many MANY other reasons. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s infallible logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not. My take is this. Take yourself as an example and imagine you win the Presidency with the promises that you will make 9/11 transparent, you will break up the corporations so there is more top money going to the people, you will back the dollar to gold and get off the FED, and you will do ________ (all the shit that we here in r/conspiracy know needs to be changed).</p>

<p>Everything is all good, you get into the Whitehouse, sit down at your desk for the first day, <a href="https://i.redd.it/qn77m87po9r01.jpg">and everyone of these guys walks in with a gun to your head</a></p>

<p>Also, remember that you also had to give lip service to AIPAC/Israel as a toll to even be allowed to have your campaign funds not frozen, not be sabotaged, and not be assassinated by Mossad.</p>

<p>So there you are with everyone having that proverbial and literal in some cases, gun to your head.</p>

<p>Any move you make has to be within the limits of those who have their guns pointed at you.</p>

<p>For example. You want to get away from, have nothing to do with the Saudis anymore and pull all the troops and all resources, etc from anything Saudi based? Guess what?</p>

<p>You&#39;re fucked:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/petrodollar-us-saudi-policy_b_6245914.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/petrodollar-us-saudi-policy_b_6245914.html</a></p>

<p>Any move you would like to make or told the people you were going to make is limited by the above breakdown, Saudi control over the U.S. via the Petrodollar and the fact that they are your Debt holders:</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/16/investing/saudi-arabia-us-debt-ownership-revealed/index.html">http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/16/investing/saudi-arabia-us-debt-ownership-revealed/index.html</a></p>

<p>You want to End the Fed, fix the banking system and make the dollar gold backed again? Lol, you&#39;re fucked!</p>

<p>The Bankster System via the Rothschilds is deeply embedded in the U.S. and they have a thousand ways til Sunday to collapse your whole economy to make it look like its all your fault, people would die in this new Depression and you would be done by your first term.</p>

<p>That same Rothschild&#39;s Banking system is headquartered in England and runs MI5 Deepstate and U.S. Deepstate. So if you dont play nice, they will make sure their agents create Dossiers that the media they own runs with to smear the shit out of you if you dont play by their rules, and you will be done by your first term.</p>

<p>Entertainment Industry? Deeply embedded with that same Bankster system which bankrolls all funding in Hollywood so all they have to do is have 5 top stars come out to speak out against you to turn the tide across the country, so you are done by your first term.</p>

<p>So really, your only option in that image is to chose your fights wisely. You can fight against the media, hollywood, the Clinton machine, some special interests, U.N., GOP Elites, and all of the smaller groups.</p>

<p>However, the Banksters, the Globalist controllers, The Saudis, Israel, and whoever owns your debt are those you have no options to do anything about because any chess move you make, already has hundred moves that will chekmate your ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure mueller could find evidence to impeach trump for dozens of crimes but thats not the point. </p>

<p>Trump proves all the time hes just a permabebt state stooge. Jurusalem sealed it for me personally but I&#39;d always assumed he was because you dont get selected in a primary if youre not on the team. The elections are staged but our voting is real. It just doesnt matter when your choice is shit or shit. The idea is they will always win. If voting mattered you wouldnt be allowed to do it.</p>

<p>The investigation is a dog and pony show to make people think their voice matters. Mueller and trump are owned by the same masters. The only ones getting indicted are going to be people in his orbit but they&#39;ll magically find nothing to charge him with. </p>

<p>The stormy thing is actually an attack on Cohen. He pissed somebody off somehow. So hes going to be the one to take the fall for everything. Campaign finance violations. Probably intimidation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice write up. However I still lean turns the Deepstate taking out trump JFK style once the Mueller investigation finds nothing. I can certainly see it as a purge of the wrong people that deepstate doesnt want around so he&#39;s more easily controlled, however, if Mueller and Trump were on the same team, it would be really inefficient to have these investigations and bad press.</p>

<p>The Gov has these CIV type statistical modeling analyzers that spit out various scenarios, and the state of the people being divided right now has both net positives and negatives as well, however I dont think it benefits deepstate for us to all be divided and for trump to be prez because him being in his position, I have never in my life seen so many people awaken to Conspiracies and Deepstate as just the last 2 years.</p>

<p>They would be better of having everyone play nice like when Obama was Prez and most were in a slumber and out sub was left alone to us &#39;tin foil nutters&#39;. instead of the left coming here now and taking us seriously and freaking the hell out.</p>

<p>I have weighed your point, however trump is too off the rocker compared to how &#39;they&#39; want him to be, like a flashbang thrown into a old folks home</p>

<p>Maybe I am underestimating what she is capable of, but if you look at how she accomplishes the most shady shit you can imagine is through the use of third parties connected to proxies, so she has multiple levels of plausible deniability. She gets caught over and over and that is how she is able to stay out of trouble.</p>

<p>If she left her ass in the breeze to participate in something so damning first hand, it would go against so many previous examples that I would have a REAL hard time believing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) We&#39;ve been doing this meddling in international elections around the world for the last 7 decades since World War II.  We the world brought this up after the election, our Democrats told them something along the lines that it is our given right to interfere in foreign affairs, but god forbid they interfere with us, that simply isn&#39;t Funny and it&#39;s strictly not allowed!</p>

<p>2) WikiLeaks is essentially the free press run wild.  If we want to prove to the world just how meaning less our bill of rights is, god damn, we&#39;re doing it.</p>

<p>3) WikiLeaks&#39; best sources for stolen hacked emails was from within the DNC itself, showing direct collusion between the DNC and Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders.  Are we mad that about this collusion, or are we just mad that we got caught and then Trump won because the general Independent public held us accountable by simply not turning out to vote?</p>

<p>4) The swamp does need to be drained, and Trump is one of the largest frogs in it.  Do not ever forget, he was a Democrat up until the Whitehouse Correspondents&#39; Dinner that essentially turned into the Roast of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>5) We have got to start taking responsibility for ourselves, and we have to own our mistakes.  We let the DNC turn into the ugly affair, we let the GOP turn into the ugly affair, and no matter how bad it gets, We Keep Voting for them.  At no point do we let education get in the way of picking the best candidate, nor do we let reason help us weight and measure our news sources.  No, we are gossips, bullies, and we believe in snitches getting stiches instead of upholding the whistleblower as the voice of integrity that it is.  In other words, we deserve this - but we&#39;re still blaming everybody but ourselves for what has happened.</p>

<p>6) Part of that responsibility is to get ourselves educated on facts instead of dreams.  Face it, we are a country in a global community where the freedom of speech knows now boundaries except in China where they have a pretty effective cyber wall around their internet keeping us out and their citizens in.  Face it, Money is colorless manna that can be turned into any power at will, and power is what wins elections as long as voters refuse to critically evaluate their candidates.  We will never remove money from the election process so long as speech and power influences elections - and money buys speech quicker than any other power.</p>

<p>7) Instead of reading any proposition as &quot;this will fund things Like education and roads&quot; we have to get it through to our head to read every proposition in the WORST light possible.  If it says &quot;Like,&quot; then it means they will use the money to fund whatever they want to fund, they don&#39;t care.  It also means they will stop funding whatever by replacing the funds that are already spent on those expenditures with this new money and then using the old money for projects elsewhere.  This issue goes from the smallest city council all the way up to the federal candidates themselves.</p>

<p>8) I have little hope any of this will ever happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russian collusion investigation has turned up nothing substantial in years, mostly business deals forgotten to be disclosed and other procedural gaffs. The investigation backfired, finding criminal actions by the FBI, exposed the purposeful botching of the Hillary investigation, the rigged DNC primaries, a hugely questionable raiding of a lawyer, and otherwise exposed the corruption of the whole matter. All of this stemming from a British intelligence operation with Steele to load a US president with criminal investigations so he cannot lead effectively. When this is said and done, we&#39;ll be reminded why presidents are supposed to be absolved of such petty and baseless persecutions. The whole thing has degraded into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop">Gish Gallop</a> of sissy slapping fight out of desperation as the opposition tries to pretend there is still some essence of pressure against the Trump administration, while that ship has long sailed and swung back the other way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is classic &quot;Clintonian Triangulation&quot;. Accuse others of what you&#39;re guilty of.</p>

<p>DNC wasn&#39;t hacked, it was a leak. Guccifer 2 was created to cover up that leak. Their &#39;hacked&#39; servers weren&#39;t turned over to the FBI, but instead given to their friends at a private corporation, CrowdStrike. Anyone paying close attention knows the Dem Primary was a complete sham, with registrations being hacked, voter suppression, election fraud, exit polls being changed to match the &#39;results&#39;, copious amounts of absentee ballots showing up at certain caucuses ( all supporting HRC ). The Russian scapegoat was concocted after the leak. They continued to double down on the scapegoat during the election, paying for Steele Dossier. And of course, that&#39;s all we&#39;ve heard from them since the election. </p>

<p>Now they are suing Russia, before any actual evidence of collusion has been found. What are they suing for? A handful of Bots and 100k worth of FB ads? Bots who retweeted Joy Ann Reid, (essentially) a Hillary surrogate? ( speaking of bots &amp; trolls, Hillary spent quite a bit of money on Correct The Record trolls.</p>

<p>This is just them trying to quadruple down on the big Russia is to blame lie. I think they think if they shout this big, simple lie enough, then their base will believe it. I hope this all crashes down hard on them, and soon. I also hope this drives even more people away from their corrupt shell of a party. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you go to the actual article that salon is talking about, they have since added a editors note</p>

<p>&quot;...Nation editors themselves raised questions about the editorial process that preceded the publication of the article. The article was indeed fact-checked to ensure that Patrick Lawrence, a regular Nation contributor, accurately reported the VIPS analysis and conclusions, which he did. As part of the editing process, however, we should have made certain that several of the article’s conclusions were presented as possibilities, not as certainties. And given the technical complexity of the material, we would have benefited from bringing on an independent expert to conduct a rigorous review of the VIPS technical claims....
We have obtained such a review in the last week from Nathan Freitas of the Guardian Project. He has evaluated both the VIPS memo and Lawrence’s article. Freitas lays out several scenarios in which the DNC could have been hacked from the outside, although he does not rule out a leak.
...
We have also learned since publication, from longtime VIPS member Thomas Drake, that there is a dispute among VIPS members themselves about the July 24 memo. This is not the first time a VIPS report has been internally disputed, but it is the first time one has been released over the substantive objections of several VIPS members.

Its been as low as 200FT altitude GOING FAST, circle after circle. I was tripping out and telling my coworker, blood sacrifice, but he didn&#39;t get it. The plane had no windows at all... Looked really strange. Perhaps a false flag coming? Our office is literally less than a quarter mile from one of the largest refineries in California.

    <div class="md"><p>Its probably because he didnt bomb syria enough. He only did the missile strikes to make some of the deep state happy.</p>

<p>Sure i dont trust Trump, but i think he was being pushed into bombing Syria because a week prior he said we would be pulling troops OUT of Syria.</p>

<p>So &quot;powers that be&quot; wanted the war to continue probably just to make money off of missiles and defence companies. So a chemical attack was faked to try to force public opinion and put pressure on Trump to continue war.</p>

<p>Trump did the missile strike to appease the warmongers and they are not happy with his half ass missile strike and future strategic plans...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Democrats are insane to try and sue on the claim that the &quot;Russians hacked their server&quot;. Because then they have to PROVE their server was hacked at all.</p>

<p>Comey was more than willing to look the other way when the DNC refused to allow the FBI to check their system.</p>

<p>In a court case, they&#39;re going to have to 1) prove that their server was even hacked [something they&#39;ve been hitherto reluctant to do] and 2) Prove that it wasn&#39;t an inside job by Seth Rich. Which NSA and CIA analysts have ALREADY proven was the case, with the download times on the documents which indicate that the information was downloaded onto a flash drive, not moved over the internet. </p>

<p>Good luck, DNC! And by the way, Imran Awan says, &quot;Hi&quot;. He looks forward to being deposed and telling the grand jury about how you used a Pakistani Intelligence operate to spy on Congressmen and Senators, to funnel their private correspond and Top Secret communications to foreign intelligence agencies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice write up. However I still lean turns the Deepstate taking out trump JFK style once the Mueller investigation finds nothing. I can certainly see it as a purge of the wrong people that deepstate doesnt want around so he&#39;s more easily controlled, however, if Mueller and Trump were on the same team, it would be really inefficient to have these investigations and bad press.</p>

<p>The Gov has these CIV type statistical modeling analyzers that spit out various scenarios, and the state of the people being divided right now has both net positives and negatives as well, however I dont think it benefits deepstate for us to all be divided and for trump to be prez because him being in his position, I have never in my life seen so many people awaken to Conspiracies and Deepstate as just the last 2 years.</p>

<p>They would be better of having everyone play nice like when Obama was Prez and most were in a slumber and out sub was left alone to us &#39;tin foil nutters&#39;. instead of the left coming here now and taking us seriously and freaking the hell out.</p>

<p>I have weighed your point, however trump is too off the rocker compared to how &#39;they&#39; want him to be, like a flashbang thrown into a old folks home</p>
