      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The first evidence that the hacker crew responsible for the breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) snuck false information into their leaks has been uncovered by a group of researchers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The hackers, a group called Fancy Bear that U.S. intelligence and law enforcement claim to be sponsored by Russia's intelligence unit, the GRU, planted the information inside a leak of emails belonging to a journalist and critic of the Putin regime, according to a report from Citizen Lab, a University of Toronto-based organization. That formed part of a massive hacking campaign attempting to steal Google passwords from 218 targets across 39 countries, including former American defense officials.
       </p>
       <p>
        Though Citizen Lab couldn't definitively tie Fancy Bear to those "tainted leaks," Forbes separately obtained evidence that indicated the group was responsible.
       </p>
       <p>
        It marks a worrying moment in the early history of mega-leaks: the doctoring of data and the subsequent promulgation of that legitimate-looking information to prop up propaganda. "Tainted leaks are the next frontier of disinformation: an attempt to really tamper with the integrity of large sets of information that people will believe to be genuine," said John Scott-Railton, researcher at Citizen Lab.

       That's absolutely true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sensationalism over the fact that they WERE leaked sort of overwhelmed the fact that there wasn't much in them, at all. It was a "THESE ARE SECRET LEAKS, SO THEY
       <em>
        MUST

       OK.
      </p>
      <p>
       The department of Homeland Security is not the FBI. This one quote does not state who contacted who regarding the DNC leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who has jurisdiction over "cyber crime"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC never surrendered their servers, therefore all we have as evidence for this alleged hack is
       <em>
        thier word
       </em>
       , based off a report from crowdstrike. (this is the same organization that pointed fingers at north korea during that "the interview" garbage a few years ago)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why has the DOJ not filed charges against these "russian hackers" like they did with "Putter Panda"?

       You have a few holes in your understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the crowdstrike report, the DNC created a server image and gave that to the FBI(per Comey).
      </p>
      <p>
       Charges are a public matter. It's quite possible they would not be brought if doing so would expose national intelligence practices and be possibly fruitless. If you look more into the PLA charges, it was specifically coined as trade war violation and only 5 out of hundreds were indicted. This served a concrete purpose to declare stances on stealing IP stances. Furthermore, it might be pollitically not in the best interests of the current DoJ.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it dosen't state who contacted who, you can infer using other media. For instance Dona Brazzile's book with how the FBI informed the DNC coupled with the quoted communucation months before the release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore a Dutch unit intercepted Russian hacking of the servers by accident. Also nots George Papadopolous telling the Australian diplomat Russia has hacked emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is simply public knowlege information not even infringing on the classified intelligence we have.

       I'm on mobile right now and it's making it a pain to search the testimony PDF and give you a direct copy. Two sources, Comey testimony to Senate Intel Committee, and DNC spokesman. The Comey one you should find easy in the testimony, however I can't get a direct DNC source, only 3rd party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some 3rd party sources easier for me to copy

       Everywhere? It was first reported by NYT:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network, he was transferred, naturally, to the help desk.
       </p>
       <p>
        His message was brief, if alarming. At least one computer system belonging to the D.N.C. had been compromised by hackers federal investigators had named “the Dukes,” a cyberespionage team linked to the Russian government.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The name of the agent who made the call and the person the agent reached at the DNC is public knowledge and everything.

       Let's not forget the Dutch intelligence agents who literally watched the GRU via cctv hacking the DNC
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's the summer of 2014. A hacker from the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD has penetrated the computer network of a university building next to the Red Square in Moscow, oblivious to the implications. One year later, from the AIVD headquarters in Zoetermeer, he and his colleagues witness Russian hackers launching an attack on the Democratic Party in the United States. The AIVD hackers had not infiltrated just any building; they were in the computer network of the infamous Russian hacker group Cozy Bear. And unbeknownst to the Russians, they could see everything.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's how the AIVD becomes witness to the Russian hackers harassing and penetrating the leaders of the Democratic Party, transferring thousands of emails and documents. It won't be the last time they alert their American counterparts. And yet, it will be months before the United States realize what this warning means: that with these hacks the Russians have interfered with the American elections. And the AIVD hackers have seen it happening before their very eyes.

       Are you talking about the CIA's recently exposed cyber hacking technology that allows them to commit false flag cyber attacks and hacks using faked digital "finger prints" of any other country that best serves their agenda, including Russia?

Committing a crime changed the outcome of what is thought of as a legal event. It calls the legitimacy of the election into question.

       Ha, no.  It just means that they think they have something to gain.  The DNC is world-class in terms of shooting themselves in the foot and being incompetent.  We are talking about the party that managed to lose to Donald fucking Trump, after all.

       I'm also supplementing it with logic. Because we don't have all the facts, we must rely on speculation. But logic and common sense can be applied to what we do know, and through that, we can come up with some fairly reasonable (and likely) speculations.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The lawsuit echoes a similar legal tactic that the Democratic Party used during the Watergate scandal. In 1972, the DNC filed suit against former president Richard Nixon’s reelection committee seeking $1 million in damages for the break-in at Democratic headquarters in the Watergate building.
       </p>
       <p>
        The suit was denounced at the time by Nixon’s Attorney General, John Mitchell, who called it a case of “sheer demagoguery” by the DNC. But the civil action brought by former DNC chair Lawrence F. O’Brien was ultimately successful, yielding a $750,000 settlement from the Nixon campaign that was reached on the day in 1974 that Nixon left office.

       I believe as OP has stated they'll have to turn that over in the discovery phase. So we should get to find out. I also find it hard to believe the DNC knowing they'll have to do this would do it if it would come back at them. I guess we'll see how it plays out.

       Keep in mind this was all before any emails got released, before anyone accused a foreign country of attacking, before anyone would accuse the President of having cheated to win the election.  At the time it was a simple hacking of a private group.  Given these incredible high stakes, and the fact that a copy of a server can easily be manipulated or altered, it's hard to accept anything less than the FBI itself examining the servers

       I'll clarify that at the time it wasn't considered the level of attack that would result in leveling sanctions, more garden variety.  The Dutch thing is just silly and hasn't been confirmed by the Dutch government or any official on the record.  I don't take that story seriously.  The FBI "warnings" also sound like part of a cover story after the fact to me.  The bottom line is, even today you'll still see major news outlets refer to "alleged Russian hacking", although they waiver back and forth.  Nothing's been proven.  All of the IC statements have included tons of caveats and weasle words

       To perform a proper digital forensic investigation you DO need physical access. You need to create a bit stream copy of the memory and storage on which you perform the investigation. You then need to pull all logs from all network devices starting at the firewall all the way down stream through every network device. That process can be done remotely if remote access has been setup.
      </p>
      <p>
       They knew it was an inside job. That’s why they called in CrowdStrike to perform the “investigation” and not the FBI. CrowdStrike gets funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in Government and other business contracts by the DNC. They confirmed what was expected and wrote a report with a conclusion that the DNC wanted. The FBI was provided with the report but told to fuck off when they wanted access to perform their own investigation. Why wouldn’t you want the FBI to investigate it unless there wasn’t a shitload of information they didn’t want them to know about? Especially when they are claiming a foreign government is trying to hack their systems and influence the presidential election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and here’s the kicker: Dmitri Alperovitch, the founder and co owner of CrowdStrike, is Russian!

       What people don't realize is that  the most damning evidence were the recordings that came from the system Nixon himself had installed in the Whitehouse.  He fought tooth and nail against having those recordings released. Even when the courts ordered him to turn the tapes over he attempted to subvert this order. He offered compromise to the courts, the tapes would be transcribed by a reputable person of their choosing and the transcripts would be turned over as evidence. They realized he was trying to pull a fast one when the person they chose to transcribe the tapes was John Stennis who was practically deaf. They told him to pound sand and produce the tapes, which had Nixon discussing the payoff to keep the watergate burglars quiet.

       LARP means "live-action role-playing" like when you pretend to exist in some alternate dimension. When he's writing it, he's referrering to people who live in an alternate world where Donald Trump is actually a secret genius Christian warrior who is secretly taking down the Democrats they all hate. According to them, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have already been charged, or are on the run, or are secretly at Guantanamo Bay, or are being executed this weekend ... just a series of totally fake claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do this whole dance because it's easier for them to see Trump as some mythical figure taking down the people they hate than admitting that he's a con man who conned them and everyone else who believed the stuff he was spewing.

       Trees don't all need sunlight. Some are born albino and have a parasitic relationship using mycorrhizae attaching their roots with their mother tree. This Mycor network exists to share nutrients with other trees is a recent discovery and was breaking science when Avatar was written. That is when it was breaking in journals before the public even knew about it. That part of Avatar is based on hard established science.

       Sure, but CrowdStrike wasn’t created in response. Google acquired part of CrowdStrike because they were politically connected and Schmidt was in the Oval Office every other day during Obama’s Presidency. What better way to circumvent oversight than having Google and their new security toy covering your tracks.
