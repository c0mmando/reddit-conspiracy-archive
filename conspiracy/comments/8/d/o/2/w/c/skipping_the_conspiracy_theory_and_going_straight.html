        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just wanted to warn all couples, or all people who co-own property with someone because I had to survive this myself.</p>

<p>Your partner will have an ability to take over possession of your house if they are on the deed.</p>

<p>There is very little you can do once you&#39;ve put them on the deed about</p>

<ul>
<li>Them inviting friends over that are unkind or hostile to you</li>
<li>Them pawning your belongings</li>
<li>Them moving in other people including new partners and new partner&#39;s kids</li>
<li><p>Them and their friends colluding to use involuntary psychiatric commitment against you (if it gets them the upper hand on owning your property).</p></li>
<li><p>Abuse by proxy is a real thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Your partner can not only pawn your belongings but ask for their friends to do the same.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that divorce lawyers are enough, we hope that we could never be evicted from land we own...but it is entirely possible to be muscled out by your partner and their friends.</p>

<p>So long as they haven&#39;t done anything illegal it will continue to remain a civil court matter.&#39;</p>

<p>So let me tell you what happened to me (at least part of it).</p>

<p>I bought a house.   I fell in love.  I added my love interest on to the title.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years to how reality looks for me now....</p>

<p>I am currently not going near my house because my ex moved in his girlfriend and her two kids.</p>

<p>They are paying all of the expenses, but threatened to have me framed as a stalker if I go on my own property.  They and their friends threatened to frame me for stalking her children (who are on the property without my permission).</p>

<p>They threatened to have m framed for stalking her kids...who she moved on to my land.</p>

<p>The police can do nothing.  I can only sue my ex to get them off of the property.</p>

<p>The police and our realtor know about it and can&#39;t do anything.</p>

<p>This was the person I was in love with more than this world at one time.</p>

<p>I have to sue them in civil court and I&#39;m too scared of them to go back for my stuff.  I haven&#39; t done anything wrong so far and I&quot;m want to keep it that way.</p>

<p>Just thought I&#39;d share this in the hopes it may benefit someone else.</p>

<p>The two of them have access to my birth certificate, social security card, mortgage paperwork and so on.</p>

<p>This is how I lost control of my land and of my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not a conspiracy. Maybe if the new couple had already known one another, which she already said she doesn&#39;t know that, and they <em>actually conspired</em> this plan. That&#39;s not what this is, she fucked up and is now claiming some evil plot was there to get her out when in reality she simply gave him as much right to the property and then <strong>she left the residence</strong> yet another fatal flaw which caused the situation. This is just a series of poorly thought out choices on ops end which have given the jackass of an ex the upper hand. Definitely not a conspiracy.</p>

You made a slew of unintelligent choices that allowed him to be where he is and you to be where you are, if it&#39;s even happening. Is he taking advantage of those stupid choices, hell yeah, but how long did you say y&#39;all were together....<em>years</em>....youd think someone who had thought up this idea to get your house would&#39;ve done it right after you put him on the deed and not waste all the extra time.

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a recipe of purchase and they pawned something that you did not allow, that is theft. I had a junkie friend pawn something of mine. You go down to the pawn shop call the cops, and file for stolen items. Pawning your things without permission is something law enforcement can pursue. Also your name is on the deed and it’s your house, GO TO THE HOUSE. If they try to kick you out, it’s yours, if they call the cops your name is on the deed. Are you making mortgage payments on a house your not living in?</p>

<p>You could be living in that house right beside ex and and new Partner and kids, but you were kicked out probably due to domestic violence.</p>

You don&#39;t need to consider their arguments--heck, you don&#39;t need to say anything, since this supersedes whatever they may attempt to say.</p>

<p>Depending on the state, you are allowed to secretly record conversations (look up &quot;two-party consent states&quot;). Your refusal to leave may lead them to do something illegal, and you&#39;ll need evidence. You cannot be barred entry, so if they change the locks, look up how to push against illegal eviction.

You file a civil suit for rights to the house, either for him to buy you out of it or for it to be liquidated and split between you. You have a mortgage still, is he on that?

<p>The only thing I can do at this point is a civil suit and I don&#39;t doubt my credit is in the crapper.</p>

<p>And yes people who have been through something like this will sound paranoid.</p>

<p>How can you experience other people legit wanting to take your stuff and make you miserable at a minimum...and not sound paranoid when trying to describe it.</p>

<p>Even paranoid people have enemies?  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think that person was excessively snarky and rude for a reason?  Do you think their presence is arbitrary?</p>

<p>It could be. </p>

<p>Also saying that you think this is BS just makes you another discrediting campaign troll advocate...and my question remains.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>How is it hurting you for me to tell my story about my life.</p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t affect you at all, so why would you need to discredit me?</p>

<p>If you want to know a restraining order seemed more extreme than just leaving the house and suing to sell the house later.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read restraining orders tend to just make people even more mad.</p>

<p>And how many do I have to take out, one for each of his friends and another for his girlfriend?  That&#39;s a lot of restraining orders...if it came down to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need mental help. For real.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t give a shit about you telling your story but as I said THIS is not the right sub for that. I don&#39;t need to discredit you I&#39;m pointing out how that rude person brings up valid points and you go off the paranoia deep end thinking she must be the new gf. That&#39;s psychotic. If you get a restraining order against the ex and he sends other people after you, that&#39;s a violation of HIS order. You don&#39;t need to get one out on every single person. All this just proves you haven&#39;t looked into any of it. It simply seems like the entire situation is made up because you don&#39;t know anything about the avenues you would take in this situation were it actually happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unbelievable.  Rather than admitting you are wrong you are playing the psychiatry card.</p>

<p>Psychiatry has been proven time and again to be total bull shit.</p>

<p>&quot;Psychosis&quot; is another psychiatric lie...I&#39;m surprised anybody who is smart enough to read r/conspiracy would believe psychiatric lies and eat them  up the way that you do.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to prove a connection between A and B as far as restraning orders go.  </p>

<p>You are unfamiliar with abuse by proxy.</p>

<p>And why are you trying to discredit me.  I leave a warning trying to do some good with what took away all my hopes and dreams in life.</p>

<p>I expose all my pain for reddit and you delight in digging into my wounds for your own sick pleasure.</p>
