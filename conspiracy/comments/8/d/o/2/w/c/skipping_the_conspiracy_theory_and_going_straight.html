       I just wanted to warn all couples, or all people who co-own property with someone because I had to survive this myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your partner will have an ability to take over possession of your house if they are on the deed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is very little you can do once you've put them on the deed about
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Them inviting friends over that are unkind or hostile to you
       </li>
       <li>
        Them pawning your belongings
       </li>
       <li>
        Them moving in other people including new partners and new partner's kids
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Them and their friends colluding to use involuntary psychiatric commitment against you (if it gets them the upper hand on owning your property).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Abuse by proxy is a real thing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your partner can not only pawn your belongings but ask for their friends to do the same.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We hope that divorce lawyers are enough, we hope that we could never be evicted from land we own...but it is entirely possible to be muscled out by your partner and their friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as they haven't done anything illegal it will continue to remain a civil court matter.'
      </p>
      <p>
       So let me tell you what happened to me (at least part of it).
      </p>
      <p>
       I bought a house.   I fell in love.  I added my love interest on to the title.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward a few years to how reality looks for me now....
      </p>
      <p>
       I am currently not going near my house because my ex moved in his girlfriend and her two kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are paying all of the expenses, but threatened to have me framed as a stalker if I go on my own property.  They and their friends threatened to frame me for stalking her children (who are on the property without my permission).
      </p>
      <p>
       They threatened to have m framed for stalking her kids...who she moved on to my land.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police can do nothing.  I can only sue my ex to get them off of the property.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police and our realtor know about it and can't do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the person I was in love with more than this world at one time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to sue them in civil court and I'm too scared of them to go back for my stuff.  I haven' t done anything wrong so far and I"m want to keep it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought I'd share this in the hopes it may benefit someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two of them have access to my birth certificate, social security card, mortgage paperwork and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how I lost control of my land and of my life.

       Know the game. Judges aren’t in the habit of throwing voters out of homes. Document it all, remain level headed, and stick with 1 attorney that will fight for you. It’s going to take a long time but again, judges aren’t going to kick voters out to let you back in. It’s fucked but that’s the game.

       Thanks for the warning, I'll just have to take it as it come.s  It isn't fair and that's why maybe the only good that can come of it is to show somebody else my wounds..however embarrassing or painful they are.

       That's not what the sub is about. And also it wouldn't have happened if you hadn't made the horrible decision to add someone to your deed who didn't work for it. There's zero benefit to that and literally all this at risk. Regardless, not the right sub at all.

       Don't back down this is the right sub. You are the victim of a conspiracy, we are just used to exotic ones. But they all start at this level and if we want truth and justice we need to take everything back at the grassroots level. Or so everyone says. I can only offer these words of encouragement, life isn't over till it's over.

       This is not a conspiracy. Maybe if the new couple had already known one another, which she already said she doesn't know that, and they
       <em>
        actually conspired
       </em>
       this plan. That's not what this is, she fucked up and is now claiming some evil plot was there to get her out when in reality she simply gave him as much right to the property and then
       <strong>
        she left the residence
       </strong>
       yet another fatal flaw which caused the situation. This is just a series of poorly thought out choices on ops end which have given the jackass of an ex the upper hand. Definitely not a conspiracy.

       Why can't you accept the fact they didn't conspire shit. This whole situation is your fault. You made a slew of unintelligent choices that allowed him to be where he is and you to be where you are, if it's even happening. Is he taking advantage of those stupid choices, hell yeah, but how long did you say y'all were together....
       <em>
        years

       ....youd think someone who had thought up this idea to get your house would've done it right after you put him on the deed and not waste all the extra time. It's a bad breakup with a shitty person, not a conspiracy.

       Damn that's a shitty situation. In a way at least you're on the deed, otherwise you'd be SoL. At least this way you can potentially recoup some losses by either getting bought out of the house or selling it and splitting that.

       If you have a recipe of purchase and they pawned something that you did not allow, that is theft. I had a junkie friend pawn something of mine. You go down to the pawn shop call the cops, and file for stolen items. Pawning your things without permission is something law enforcement can pursue. Also your name is on the deed and it’s your house, GO TO THE HOUSE. If they try to kick you out, it’s yours, if they call the cops your name is on the deed. Are you making mortgage payments on a house your not living in?

       There's no way to prove what things are "mine" vs what things are "ours".   I made mortagage payments for months after I was kicked out of the house, which probably in retrostpect was a stupid thing to do.

       He doesn't want to sell, the only way to sell is to take him to civil court and sue for the right to sell the house.

       Best advice if you can’t afford a lawyer, look up your local law school and see if a professor or student will take up your case probono. I’m sure this whole situation has affected relationships with other people as well. Sounds super shitty.

       No, because we are co-owners.  I made my ex an equal owner, then he found someone else.

       If it were just me owning the house then it would be trespassing.

       Also there are ways to prove it’s yours, if you have a picture of yourself with said item, receipts and stuff. Also if you know who has been pawning stuff and you go to the pawnshop and let them know it’s your stuff they are pawning, the shop won’t take it. They don’t want to be in possession of stolen goods.

       They cannot kick you out of a home where your name is on the deed

       You could be living in that house right beside ex and and new Partner and kids, but you were kicked out probably due to domestic violence.

       It's not a conspiracy, it is the law.  We're not stupid here, and pretending that
You could buy a home, add a person to the deed, and then be
       <em>
        wrongfully
       </em>
       removed from the house is total bullshit.

       Why on holy planet Earth would you agree to Deed Co-ownership and not be legally married?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most couples who enter in a Deed together are also bound by the legalities of marriage.  Meaning, you have leverage in a divorce case to claim property and property severance.

       I'm not a lawyer but I believe I live in a community property state. I believe we were in a common law marriage.  The tort of adultery may or may not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agreed to it because the reality of my situation when I put him on the deed, was a completely different life circumstance than what my life looked like when I moved out.
      </p>
      <p>
       He changed a lot in that time.  Unfortunately so did I.  A lot happened to us both.

       It's not a bad idea, you still have access to the property right ... One day when they are not around just dump a ton a trash inside and out of the property. Better for the city to sue you and they getting out of the deed ... Hehehe

       He said he wouldn't move in with me if only I was on the deed.  We shared an apartment for over ten years before that.  I had no reason not to trust him.  We were engaged.   I don't know how or when the new girl came about.

       Next time you go over there, remember that you are legally allowed on the property there. That is the only response you need to their complaints. You don't need to consider their arguments--heck, you don't need to say anything, since this supersedes whatever they may attempt to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on the state, you are allowed to secretly record conversations (look up "two-party consent states"). Your refusal to leave may lead them to do something illegal, and you'll need evidence. You cannot be barred entry, so if they change the locks, look up how to push against illegal eviction. If you wait too long, I don't think you can claim eviction.

       That may be, but I think it's not evidence that a judge will accept. They'll look at things one at a time... at least, the defending lawyer will. In this particular situation, I think the troll would have to say some personal detail about you that only those in the house would know, in order for it to be considered connected to the lawsuit.

      </p>
      <p>
       They said I was paranoid and imagining that my bff hated me, that my ex was cheating, that people were harassing me.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that was listed as "imaginary" .....until it surfaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually  my ex's *who was allegedly imaginary...showed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually my afair partner showed up...though I was at least honest aobut that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually the issues with my BFF and our neighbors showed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually the issues with my brother showed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually the damned DEW will show up too..probably.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just waiting for a big "I told you so" party I guess.  I might be dead or homeless from it all but by GOD the truth will be out there.

       You might be shocked by the number of people that are trolled on Reddit. Someone who doesn't believe that someone else was trolled is an idiot. I think you mean they didn't believe you were being trolled by your ex. And they'll believe you less once the defense's lawyers knock it out in court.

       Dude.....you are sounding very paranoid. I don't know you, your ex, or even what state you're from but I can tell you that other person's comment, while excessively snarky/rude, brings up some totally valid points. You can't be forced to leave your home by police, literally you could take your deed with your name on it wait outside for police, and have them (except the ex since you put him on it too) REMOVED from the home. You file a civil suit for rights to the house, either for him to buy you out of it or for it to be liquidated and split between you. You have a mortgage still, is he on that? How do you know if he's even paying it. He could not pay it and YOUR credit is going to shit. Saying there's nothing you can do IS bull and that's what that commentor is saying who ALSO probably has nothing to do with you and this situation. You're sounding beyond paranoid.

       I can't "legally" be forced to leave it, no.

      <p>
       But if your ex is friends with scary people you tend to leave voluntarily and become paranoid.

       The only thing I can do at this point is a civil suit and I don't doubt my credit is in the crapper.

       And yes people who have been through something like this will sound paranoid.

       How can you experience other people legit wanting to take your stuff and make you miserable at a minimum...and not sound paranoid when trying to describe it.

       Even paranoid people have enemies?

       Yeah and this just goes back to my very first comment. This isn't a conspiracy. It's a series of extremely irresponsible choices made by you, which it sounds like started with picking a dude who you imply would kill you and hide your body. You could've gotten a restraining order rather than leaving the house. It sounds like you need to get one anyways. The reason the person is excessively rude is some people are just rude and the excessive part is that the whole thing smells of bs. A plethora of things you could do/coulda been done. The fact that this paranoia seems unfounded it just seems like you need to get help. You're thinking that the new gf was watching Reddit for the story just to come harrass you. A therapist will probably have resources or knowledge to help you get back into your home too.

       Why?

      <p>
       How is it hurting you for me to tell my story about my life.

      <p>
       It shouldn't affect you at all, so why would you need to discredit me?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know a restraining order seemed more extreme than just leaving the house and suing to sell the house later.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've read restraining orders tend to just make people even more mad.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how many do I have to take out, one for each of his friends and another for his girlfriend?  That's a lot of restraining orders...if it came down to it.

       You need mental help. For real.
       <br/>
       I couldn't give a shit about you telling your story but as I said THIS is not the right sub for that. I don't need to discredit you I'm pointing out how that rude person brings up valid points and you go off the paranoia deep end thinking she must be the new gf. That's psychotic. If you get a restraining order against the ex and he sends other people after you, that's a violation of HIS order. You don't need to get one out on every single person. All this just proves you haven't looked into any of it. It simply seems like the entire situation is made up because you don't know anything about the avenues you would take in this situation were it actually happening.

       Unbelievable.  Rather than admitting you are wrong you are playing the psychiatry card.

       Psychiatry has been proven time and again to be total bull shit.

       "Psychosis" is another psychiatric lie...I'm surprised anybody who is smart enough to read r/conspiracy would believe psychiatric lies and eat them  up the way that you do.

       You are unfamiliar with abuse by proxy.

       And why are you trying to discredit me.  I leave a warning trying to do some good with what took away all my hopes and dreams in life.

       Why on holy planet Earth would you agree to Deed Co-ownership and not be legally married?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most couples who enter in a Deed together are also bound by the legalities of marriage.  Meaning, you have leverage in a divorce case to claim property and property severance.

       Wow, you are a little monster.  You must be a friend of my ex.  If not you are first of all wrong, and second of all taking this way too personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there might be a conspiracy into why YOU responded the way you did?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is someone paying YOU to be an asshole here?  Are you profiting off of that house?

       I need it for evidence though when I go to court for my house.  My ex is the reason why I was gang stalked.

       Yeah and this just goes back to my very first comment. This isn't a conspiracy. It's a series of extremely irresponsible choices made by you, which it sounds like started with picking a dude who you imply would kill you and hide your body. You could've gotten a restraining order rather than leaving the house. It sounds like you need to get one anyways. The reason the person is excessively rude is some people are just rude and the excessive part is that the whole thing smells of bs. A plethora of things you could do/coulda been done. The fact that this paranoia seems unfounded it just seems like you need to get help. You're thinking that the new gf was watching Reddit for the story just to come harrass you. A therapist will probably have resources or knowledge to help you get back into your home too.
