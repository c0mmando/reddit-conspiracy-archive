       Does anyone else feel that we are being pressured into giving up eating meat? Past few weeks I've been getting the feeling it's becoming a huge social pressure.
It's on the radio, it's on TV, magazines everywhere. Vegan this and vegan that. Super veg that has nearly the same texture of meat. Celebrity chiefs give up on eating meat etc. 
Just recently heard aswell, some head boffin wants to introduce a meat tax (at 20%) to tackle obesity. That's not just on processed meat. That's red meat too. 
I have a dreading feeling that meat will again become a luxury item, priced out of reach.

       If you eat real food you do t get fat. Literally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm eating junk and processed shit but sticking to my calories and I stay around 270lbs. I can eat the same calories in really food (fresh meat, green veggies and dairy and it drops off me without effort.) Sadly sugar is a highly addictive substance same with corn, wheat and starchy vegetables as the body metobalises it into sugar (glycogen)
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, meat is not making people fat. Cheaply made nothing foods full of empty calories is what's making people fat because the body doesn't get what it needs nutritionally and you're basically fall and still starving.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to find better alternatives for farming meat. They can have a rotation of land, let the cows live there plant shit in it when they're done using all the cow shit as fertiliser. Here in the north of England that's a common process. Literally by my aunt's house near the moors there are four fields that have trees in them that get rotated.  In the first year one field will have cows in another will be left open, two have trees. They chop the trees put them on the old cow field for mulch to replensh the land and plant new ones in the first open field. Move cows to freshly chopped field. Repeat. That way the amount of trees is the same. The land has useful turnover and the birds have new trees to live in when they migrate back. If more places had a simmilar turnover for the land we wouldn't be fucking up so much new land.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see people advocating for eating less meat and pushing veganism but that's just as destructive as you need open space to grow crops. I know there's plans to make multistory greenhouses but realistically how is that any better than battery hens. Same thing to me only there isn't a conscious animal involved.

       A 20% tax isn't a price increase due to supply and demand tho. It's a tax. It goes to Government. A cow will still cost what a cow costs, but potentially with another 20%tax levied on it.

       Try and replace 'eating meat' with 'watching MSM' and then read your statement again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eating meat is a major contributor to the fuckedupness of this planet. I say that as a meat eater myself but I have begun to cut down on it a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meat tax is probably a good idea, earmark it for saving rain forests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it will, and should, become a luxury eating. With 7 billion of us there is no way we can all eat meat every day. Most people on this planet are basically vegetarians.

       Most people on this planet are
       <em>
        basically
       </em>
       vegetarians. This is what I said. Most people can not afford meat, or only afford a little bit like 1 chicken per month or 1 small fish per week etc. It has nothing to do with naturally being omnivores.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can use the tax to buy rainforest and then leave it alone, f.ex. instead of letting McDonalds purchase meat from Brazilian producers that cut down rainforest to put cattle on that land.
      </p>

       Your comment reeks of being out of touch with reality. 7 billion people can not eat like Americans do, we'd need multiple Earths to support that.

       Soybeans are why rain forest is being destroyed. Cattle come after because the soil is bad in rainforests and morning can grow after.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should stop using soy except non GMO naturally fermented and in moderation.  And end CAFO and feed animals on grass/pasture with supplemented small amounts of non GMO and non soy feed rations.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will save rainforest.

       Sure. 
I think the key is to treat the meat as a side dish instead of the main course.
      </p>
      <p>
       F.ex. in China or Africa most people will eat a little bit of meat and a lot of e.g. rice. Whereas in the west people will eat a lot of meat and a little rice/potatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could probably easily stretch f.ex. 1 rabbit to a whole week or longer by doing it the Chinese way.

       This is a misconception.  Visit markets in Asia. Meat is everywhere.  And the Masai eat meat and milk and trade for veggies etc.  They are very healthy.  The Inuit survive almoat exclusively on animal.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been lied to by grain industry, AMA, govt agencies etc.  They villify the cheap and easy to obtain traditional foods for laboratory created processed foods "balanced" by so-called experts with limited understanding of our nutritional needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly recommend you read a book written a long time ago by a dentist who was curious why "modern" people had so many tooth decay and crowding issues while not westernized populations with traditional diets did not.
      </p>
      <p>
       He traveled the world and made astonishing discoveries.  And none of them were beneficial to big industry and government control so they've been suppressed.

       Supression happens when it isn't taught in schools. When MSM ignores information to push the grain industry food pyramid instead.

       Suppression of many facets of our favorite conspiracy theories happens every day.  Like WTC Building 7 and 6.

       Well, it's not necessarily 'suppression'. Many things are not taught in school! Do you want every crackpot idea to be taught in school? 
Basically you normally need a quite large consensus of scientists/scholars before something is taught in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC7 demolition theory does not have consensus among a large (enough) group of credible scientists.

       Stop supporting cattle factories! Most of that meat is infested with cancer and they do sell it anyways. If you want to eat meat go hunting, or buy locally sourced. Cattle farming has destroyed the environment more than literally anything else... BUT MUH 26OZ STEAK... Fuck Corporate America

       Admittedly I don't understand the process of growing lab meat, but on the surface it seems like a better alternative than the current system. Whereby animals kept in captivity know nothing but suffering for their entire miserable lives just to be bred and slaughtered.

       Lab meat should never be trusted.  Visit sime local farms that pasture raise and respect their animals.  Buy from them.  The difference in quality and nutrition and taste is quite noticeable.

       I would say yes processed meat is way worse. If you're going to eat meat, grass-fed, free-range is better -- ideally, hunted not factory -- but it's still not great for you. You really should pair that diet with some form of fasting to give the body time to recover -- this would be normal in a hunter-gatherer scenario.

       I don't do heavy carbs. When I'm tucking into steak etc, it's usually with a shit ton of spinach and vegetables. The body doesn't do well breaking down red meat if it is eaten with starchy carbs. It overloads the digestive tract. If you eat it with greens its digestion is helped along.

       The cancers come from what they spray on our crops, which is what the cows eat, so I guess you’re in a way correct. Why do you think they crisscross the sky every day now? Population control is the name of the game

       absolutely not. However, it would be a good idea. Cows are one of the worst parts of global warming and a significant amount of the agriculture we need to grow, is simply to feed the meat that we produce to eat.

       This is patently false.  Pastured animals help lock CO2 back into soil.  We had millions and millions of Bison running the plains doing just that before they were nearly eradicated to starve the Indians out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soybeans and the like pollute and that is the product they slash and burn rain forest over.  Soils are bad in rain forest though so they move after a harvest or two and slabs and burn more. The cattle get moved on after and actually help build up soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Croplands devestate local wildlife far more than pastured livestock.  And it takes a lot more land to feed people with too.

       It's a spiritual and intellectual awakening. It's a moral issue for the folks who've seen the fucked up videos. The internet helps it spread faster. Intellectually, we're learning that some of the greatest athletes in the world today (free of drug enhancements) are shifting off of meat. When you think about the negative vibrational emotional energy that goes into the meat we eat today as opposed to the meat we ate 100 years ago, it's understandable that people are raising eyebrows and saying "Hold up, I've been status quo with society, but do I really want to contribute to the suffering of other animals when I can get my nutrients and energy from vitamins and plants?"

       No idea. But I don't think its the governments place to decide, by way of pricing out a social class, what you should eat. They have already upped tax on tabacco, introduced a minimum pricing on alcohol, brought in a sugar tax on candy and soda and now a meat tax. It's another step tward.....I dunno but I'll be fucked if this can still be called a democracy.

       For sure not a democracy in my eyes, as well. If only taxes weren't flat at the sales tax level, but were variable per adjusted annual income. I get the idea of using taxes as a financial incentive to adjust a people's behavior for the "greater good," but a flat tax that treats all income brackets the same for sales tax rubs me wrong. You make a strong point.

       I mean money is just a representation of energy, right? It values certain energy. However, the value of said energy is based on a people's collective values and morals. Wait, or is it...If a small minority with warped morals and values control the valuation of energy (labor/time) traded for money, then we wind up where we are. Idk. If lies were impossible, we'd have all this solved. If we could all tap into each others consciousness to detect lies, we wouldn't have so many issues. Buh. Fucking verbal communication is bullshit.

       It isn't an erosion of free will as you can still act to buy meat, and barely of choice as the prices would only hypothetically rise 20% if you're buying so much meat that a rise like that would make it hard to consume the same amount afterwards then you're who the tax is for lol.

You act like cheap meat is a right, when for most of history it has been scarce and expensive. It must return to prices that reflect the actual cost of our animal agriculture system. Enough is enough, it’s destroying our planet.

       Our UK prices are substantially higher than USA's already. Especially if you want UK reared meat. I do agree that ethics is an issue though.

       Yes, I try to encourage all of my meat eating friends to eat grass fed, organic, preferably from a local farm meat, but often the complaint is “it’s too expensive.” You get what you pay for, though, and commercially produced meat is a real killer.

       I leaned that way for a while until recently. It's a law of one, spiritual reason for me. The propagation of life has taken a new importance for me. Gardening took new importance. I used to go out of my way as a kid to step on ants for some reason (I was (am?) a selfish asshole). These days I liken avoiding eating meat to avoiding stepping on ants if that makes sense.

       Where to begin? The use of pesticides, particularly cancer-causing Round-Up, has wreaked havoc on our systems. Agricultural runoff, especially from pig farms (see North Carolina), is causing dead zones and horrible health problems for nearby neighbors. Farming practices have led to nutrient deficiencies in food, up to 70% (we don’t even know what food should taste like anymore.) The sugar industry took all their notes from the tobacco companies. Processed meats are known carcinogens and yet the American Heart Association continues to include recipes on their website including bacon.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my faves is this guy Howard Lyman, ie The Mad Cowboy. His book is super short and worth the read. Basically he was a fourth generation cattle farmer who almost died of his heavy meat diet and destroyed the soil of his family’s farm, then had a remarkable change of heart after a life-saving surgery. He went on to become a vegan, lobbying against Big Meat in Washington. At one point he went on Oprah, and Big Meat came after both him AND Oprah, claiming violation of Ag Gag laws. Yup, in many states it’s actually illegal to say anything disparaging against the meat industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I loved reading the China Study, one of the things that actually opened me up to conspiracy. T Colin Campbell was a doctor, not a Vegan, who went to the Philippines to investigate a spate of children getting cancer. It turned out to be the rich kids who ate dairy, and it was casein activating a particular cancer causing gene at the root of it. His rat and mice experiments are INSANE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tons of great documentaries out there. Food Inc, Cowspiracy, What the Health, Earthlings, etc. William Engdahls Seeds of Destruction about Monsanto is a thrilling read. DEEP conspiracy happening over there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, human bodies are designed to eat mostly plants, especially fruits and veg we can pluck off the vine. I’m not going to say everyone should be Vegan, because that would cause a fight, but at the very least we should be eating far less meat than currently. Excess protein turns into fat. Milk from other animals isn’t meant for us, it’s meant for their babies. Even michael pollen, of The Omnivores Dilemma and a MSM staple, admits we should be eating maybe a couple ounces a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this is enough to get you started. I didn’t include links but it’s all easily google-able and it’s a rabbit hole I’ve been going down for a few years now. Just remember— we are what we eat. So if we are consuming hormone pumped, antibiotic fed, tortured animals, well, just look at the state of America.

       No it's not.  Native peoples thrived over millennia on eating ruminants.  From Native Americans that relied heavily on the American Bison to the Huns and their milk, blood and meat of horses, Nordic peoples and domesticated Reindeer, to Masai and the Celts and Norse. List goes on and on.  Most every culture hunted red meat animals if they were available in their environment.

       Yes but it has no relation to ecology, it is about profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The profits will be huge for insect proteins compared to beef, chicken and pork and there is a disaster in the loss of the food from the oceans.
      </p>
      <p>
       What remains, will be reserved for the top 1% only. The rest of us get larvae and insect protein.

       Sure. 
I think the key is to treat the meat as a side dish instead of the main course.
      </p>
      <p>
       F.ex. in China or Africa most people will eat a little bit of meat and a lot of e.g. rice. Whereas in the west people will eat a lot of meat and a little rice/potatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could probably easily stretch f.ex. 1 rabbit to a whole week or longer by doing it the Chinese way.
