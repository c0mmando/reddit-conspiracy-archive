<p><a href="https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/killers-inc/">Killers Inc</a></p>

<p>A fascinating look into targeted assassinations by Russian oligarchs</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A notorious money launderer, Gherman Gorbuntsov counted some of the wealthiest institutions and business leaders of Russia as his clients. Known as &quot;The Black Banker&quot;, he also made a lot of powerful enemies while conducting his nefarious financing schemes. Following a falling out with his partners, he moved onto Moldova, where he continued to engage in criminal activities, before he eventually sought refuge in London.</p>

<p>Little did he know, the ire of his fellow bankers and abandoned clientele would soon follow him in the form of a hired assassin. In 2012, a bloody but ultimately unsuccessful attempt was made on his life. An intense investigation followed that would implicate the highest levels of business and government. Killers Inc. is a chronicle of that investigation, which has been spearheaded by journalists from the Organized Crime and Corruption Project.</p>

Secrets in Plane Sight is a 2010 documentary about numerology &amp; geometry in architecture &amp; urban design throughout Washington DC, London, Stonehenge, Jerusalem, and other historically and politically significant cities. The filmmaker digs into the city planning and architectural design of monuments in relation to one another. Examples include: theories about Egyptian obelisks and monuments throughout the world, proportions of monuments aligning with numbers sacred to the Freemasons, the layout of Washington DC created to be a pyramid with the Freemason lodge as the eye at its top, and pointing toward other monuments in other cities. It’s fascinating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Tl;dr at bottom)</p>

<p>Back in college (this was in 2010), my buddy found a list of the 100 most fucked up movies, ever made. I don&#39;t know if this will mean much to anyone, but let me try to put some of the rankings (based off the ones I&#39;ve seen) in perspective, in terms of content:</p>

<p>&quot;Antichrist&quot; (69/100) - indie film (starting Willem Dafoe) with lots of intensely disturbing (emotionally/graphically/psychologically) scenes. Lots of violence (specifically genital mutilation)</p>

<p>&quot;The Butcher&quot; (27/100) - South Korean horror film. Bunch of people kidnapped and tortured/killed, but the movie is from the vantage point of their helmet cams, so mostly first person. First person rape/torture (chainsaw to hand) by a man in wearing a pig&#39;s head.</p>

<p>&quot;Faces of Death&quot; (10/100) - Pretty sure this constitutes smut in virtually all forms and is comprised of tons if volumes. In total, I&#39;ve seen maybe 5-10 minutes (closer to five) of one video, at random parts. Mid 2000s, study hall; we found it on Google Video (pre-youtube purchase). One 3 hr video with link to others, maybe. It&#39;s all real shit. It&#39;s all just footage of horrible things. Based off the little I saw, it ranged from animal death to human death by animal (saw a bear eating a man while his wife screamed from inside the car), to police footage of swat entry, to botched military executions. That number TEN.</p>

<p>Now, how does ANY of this relate to Unit 731? Well, out of the top 3/100 films on that list, the top 2/100 were about this unit (and apparently contained actual footage of &quot;experiments&quot;).</p>

<p>Full disclosure, I never watched either of then/anything about this unit, period. I only watched Antichrist (saw that with another college friend; shit was fucked up as hell, obviously), The Butcher (friend kinda did that one as a joke, to fuck with us), and I didn&#39;t know what Faces of Death was, until that morning. </p>

<p>Idk, I&#39;m sure plenty of people have seen plenty of things, but I don&#39;t recommend seeing any of those. I don&#39;t want to go into crazy specifics; shit was just awful.</p>

<hr/>

<p>(Tl;dr - In a list of the 100 most fucked up movies, that my friend found online, the top 2/100 were about this. The highest rated one I&#39;d ever seen was about 5 mins of &quot;Faces of Death&quot;, which ranked 10/100. &quot;Antichrist&quot; was fucked up as hell, but ranked 69/100. You can&#39;t unsee things.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Conspiracy to populate local elected offices with &quot;ex&quot; CIA and State Department  candidates. How healthy can it be when spooks run states and municipalities. What orders are they following, who gave them leave to campaign, were they told to do so. Are black budget monies being used to pay for TV adds. Are taxpayers footing the bill for these <em>Manchurian candidates?</em>  What does it say about our hopes for a representative democracy when government goons are taking over elected offices. International intriguers in our own local politics is <strong>just wrong</strong> insidious, creepy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Project Cybersyn was a Chilean project from 1971--1973 (during the government of President Salvador Allende) aimed at constructing a distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy.</p>

<p>Project Cybersyn was based on Viable system model theory and a neural network approach to organizational design, and featured innovative technology for its time: it included a network of telex machines (Cybernet) in state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in Santiago. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (Cyberstride) that would monitor production indicators (such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism) in real time, and alert the workers in the first case, and in unnormal situations also the central government, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges.</p>

<p>In July 1971, Stafford Beer was contacted by Fernando Flores, then a high-level employee of the Chilean Production Development Corporation (CORFO), for advice on incorporating Beer&#39;s theories of cybernetics into the management of the newly nationalized sector of Chile&#39;s economy. Beer saw this as a unique opportunity to implement his ideas of cybernetic management on a national scale, and also sympathized with the stated ideals of Chilean socialism, which aimed to maintain Chile&#39;s democratic system and the autonomy of workers instead of imposing a Soviet-style system of top-down command and control. More than just offering advice, Beer stepped aside from most of his other consulting business and devoted a great deal of time to what became Project Cybersyn, [...] However, after the military coup on September 11, 1973, Cybersyn was abandoned and the operations room was destroyed.</p>

<p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution, or the Internet of Things. </p>

<p>This is an exellent expose on the &quot;Fourth Industrial Revolution&quot; or &quot;The Internet of Things&quot;. The vast majority of us are being led like lambs to the slaughter, and have no idea that if our current course isn&#39;t corrected, humanity as we know it will become extinct. Not by war, not by some cataclysm, but through our own devices and selfish desire for convenience, as we are corralled in this direction by the global elite.</p>

<p>How dependent are you, as a biological organism, on technology? Are we strong enough to break free from this dependency? Are we honest enough with ourselves to admit that it exists? These are questions we all must confront, before time runs out.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted this in this forum already, but I desperately feel that it needs to be brought to the attention of humanity at large. We are headed in a scary direction. </p>

It’s all the same horse shit but it portrays itself so that you feel compelled to pick a side and that by picking the side you were doing something ethical or moral. But what you’re really doing is just drinking the Kool-Aid Have a narrow meaning less fabricated dialogue that goes nowhere and changes swiftly simply to have more sponsors and more viewers. A good documentary that really looks at the 23 and 24-year-old mines that make this propaganda for people who are in their 60s and 70s. This is what should be look that closely</p>
