<p>Google:
&quot;how much money is there in the world&quot;</p>

<p>Top answer:
&quot;That figure is around $60 trillion. And the last figure, the $75 trillion M3, is much more abstract and not often cited in official figures.&quot;</p>

<p>TPTB are just hedging their bets.  They gotta <em>make sure</em> they keep us enslaved.</p>

<p>That said, the fact that we actually keep listening to their stupid &quot;you have to pay your taxes and continue going with this money as debt&quot; bullshit just shows how underdeveloped and primitive we are still as a species.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we just wake the fuck up - all of us?  Just come together as one and realize this whole money as debt thing is utter enslaving bullshit?</p>

<p>So long as we keep listening to TPTB, they&#39;ll keep taking advantage of us.</p>

The problem is that armed thugs insist on debt enforcement, so whatever you may think about debt, whatever you do to avoid paying, or even if the debt is valid at all, is irrelevant.

<p>The particulars may be a little more complicated - for example, the middle class and the petty capitalist class have a stake in the present order for the sake of their status in society, and the existence of money and debt gives an adequate cover for believers in eugenics-fascism to pursue their aims, so they will willingly defend this regime without prompting from the armed thugs.</p>

<p>No.  It is absolutely not “irrelevant”.  TPTB thugs aren’t the only ones who are armed.  There’s a reason why the second amendment exists - and it’s not to let the state keep taking advantage of the citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can fight, maybe to the point where your personal debts aren&#39;t going to be collected, but if too many people aren&#39;t paying into the system, there is going to be a major problem and probably a general genocide.</p>

<p>The problem as I see it is that the majority of those under arms in the US are supporters of debt-slavery, either because they are part of that middle class, or because they are dupes.  What good is a gun if you&#39;re too blind to aim it, if you&#39;re incapable of making any plan greater than &quot;get off mah lawn&quot;?  But, let&#39;s say you put your arms to use resisting debt-slavery.  You&#39;d have to live as an outlaw, and thanks to enclosures you would have fewer and fewer means of living outside of the legitimate system.  The armed thugs seize the land and means of production, as the property rights of the rich and powerful.  It would not necessarily even be a matter of the regime having bigger guns than you - it would simply be the government and large corporations exercising their freedom to own property and not do business with you.  It just so happens that they own everything, so your only option is to comply with them, starve, or steal from them.  It wouldn&#39;t necessarily take the form of armed goons coming to your house to take your land (although they can do that, and if you&#39;re attached to your land it&#39;s far easier to take you out), it would be through monopolization of the means of production and property.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how propertarian laws and supposed &quot;rights&quot; come into play here.  You either have the means to fight, or you don&#39;t.  I&#39;m pretty sure if a debt collector comes, you don&#39;t have a legal right to kill or maim the debt collector, and if your gun is registered with some government list it is effectively neutralized.  The only way you could use a weapon in self-defense, in this context, is if it were an illegal one, used illegally - which is great, I&#39;m all for fighting, but I wouldn&#39;t base that on what some rich motherfuckers wrote.  (The rights they were thinking about were not for YOU, silly, unless you were someone of means.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many people have the stomach to do what is necessary to overcome this system completely, or even win freedom over a considerable territory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I responded at length to this, and there&#39;s a great deal that can be said to literally every sentence you typed.  However, the ultimate and final point here is the same as above:</p>

<p>So long as we keep listening to TPTB, they&#39;ll keep taking advantage of us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, too many on this planet are okay with being sheep.</p>

<p>We shall remain enslaved so long as this continues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And my response is the same; you&#39;re dealing with material conditions that practically force people to abide by TPTB, even if they know it&#39;s bullshit.  It doesn&#39;t help that enough people willfully support a system of debt-slavery, and that even if the current property owners were overthrown, many people would just institute another system of property or power over others along the same lines.</p>

<p>The notion that you can undo the system of debt-slavery by appealing to muh constitution would amuse me, if it didn&#39;t carry so much currency with the people.  The founders of the United States (most of them anyway, Paine was pretty cool but guess what happened to him) WANTED you to be sheep, to stay in your place and shut up.  So long as a system of private property and money exist, systems of debt-slavery and usury are inevitable.</p>

<p>And that gets back to my final point - there are a lot of people who will defend this system to the death, either because they&#39;re loyalists to the regime or because they want to institute a similar regime with themselves at the top and fuck everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh don&#39;t get me wrong, I would be happy to fight this system, and I don&#39;t believe muh gubermand is too stronk or any such nonsense the liberals put out.  I still think there isn&#39;t anywhere near the level of commitment necessary to carry out a resistance, and too many people - even rebels - who support the ruling ideology of eugenics.  Any resistance would necessarily mean confronting those who are ideologically committed to the system - for example, rank and file fascists which are depressingly common in the US and Europe.  There just isn&#39;t the stomach to say or do what is necessary to fascists, or even consider the attitude of such.  Many who talk about how they&#39;re going to resist are themselves sheepish and terrorized, and don&#39;t even recognize it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did bitcoin become a physical commodity?  A sustained power outage across the globe or targeted EMP and will it survive?  Once we live in some VR place sure where it has the same mortality as it’s users. For now it’s a load of 1s and 0s which is vulnerable (albeit unlikely) to the entire chain being “deleted” removed.  </p>

<p>It’s not post apocalyptic proof but does make itself more resistant to fraud.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Gold and silver are also retarded in a post collapse situation. What are you? that dude from book of Eli. Are you gonna trade  2 chickens for 5 silver coins? Seriously? No. What will happen is that you&#39;ll get shot and the guy will keep his chikens and now has a bag of silver and your wife. Today&#39;s humans are not able to live with each other in a lawless world. I don&#39;t wanna live in mad max land. I&#39;m talking having bitcoin for a 2008 financial collapse situation.
