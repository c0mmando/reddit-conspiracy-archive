    <div class="md"><p>Conclusions? Like what? That HRC destroyed down-ballot chances by funneling money from State Parties into the HVF? That she cheated Bernie completely out of the Primaries by having complete control of the DNC bureaucracy and its finances? That she was a goddamn Neoliberal &quot;traignulating&quot; &quot;third way&quot; Centrist, just like Bill, who abandoned her own base in exchange for elusive &quot;moderate Republicans&quot; who never voted for her anyways? That she failed to campaign in Wisconsin or Michigan more than 4 times after the Convention, in her own stupid hubris, again abandoning key Dem constituencies that voted Blue for 30 goddamn years? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The DNC is a private institution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same old bullshit. A private institution that has a key role in determining the goddamn president, and who admitted to having tipped the scales and reserving the right to pick candidate in a smoke filled room, <em>in court</em>, nonetheless. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get you are anti Hillary </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Damn right I am. I was with Bernie from the very beginning, and still am. HRC let Trump win via her own hubris and by cheating a genuine man of the People out of the Primary. I will <em>never</em> forgive her for that, and I will always seek reform of the DNC until it is a body of the People, and the Party is restored to its New Deal roots. Bobby Kennedy would be <em>ashamed</em> at seeing what his Party has become. A centrist pig pen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No political candidate should be meeting with an enemy of the State to disrupt the election</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russian collusion is a BS excuse to ignore the Progressive base of the Party and its demands for change, to smear Stein and Bernie, and to allow a Centrist fool like Kamala Harris, Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, or Joe Kennedy III to gain power in 2020. I won&#39;t fall for it. Bernie or Tulsi 2020 is what this fucking country needs. </p>

<p>No. More. Corporatists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s only the first step. We need to purge the Party from the ground up. This is accomplished via grassroots actisism. How, you might ask? I&#39;ll explain.</p>

<p>The smallest organizational unit of the Dem Party is the Precinct. Any registered Dem can show up to their local meeting and vote for the Precinct Chairs. Precinct Chairs vote for Country Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. This is how we strip the Party from the cold dead hands of the Corporatists. This is how we force change to trickle <em>up</em>. Citizens United isn&#39;t enough- we must wage a war against the malignancy of Corporatists within the Party itself. </p>

<p>Yes shes pro women rights but that&#39;s not really enough to call yourself a leftist. Your econonic ideas are what should be focused on and hers were not left. She parroted so much of bernies platform but most of us knew she was just trying to grab those on the fence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad she lost. I had hoped it would bring slme much needed change and swing tge party left. It did. For like a week. Then they were up to their same tricks again </p>
