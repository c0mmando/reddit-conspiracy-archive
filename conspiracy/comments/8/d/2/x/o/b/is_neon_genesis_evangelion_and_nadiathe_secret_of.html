        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My lifetime hobby was analyzing films from multiple perspectives within my knowledge. (Physics, existentialism, ontological philosophy, history, cinematography, freudian psychology, genetics, political ideology, etc) I was recommended the two shows by Hideakki Anno by my conspiracy theorist friend who said I had to watch them, and .. well. Simply put, I immediately watched both of them twice, and wrote more than 20,000 words of analysis and cultural/historical/ideological references carefully placed in nearly every scene and creative design of both works. I realized that the two shows, somewhat like Disney&#39;s two &quot;Atlantis&quot; films, were very unorthodox and almost blatantly conspiracy material .. from direct references to actual conspiracies such as the ancient proto-human civilization, humans were genetically engineered, inner earth, global elitist oligarchy, etc.. as well as Sumerian mythology, freudian psychology, imperialism and post-imperialism, mass-extinction and global cataclysm, etc.. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just blown by the details and the complimentary structures of the two shows, and fail to understand how they were even creatively proposed into production. Wikipedia only tells me that some elements of the show (Like Freudian gender stereotypes, surrogate relationships, view of puberty, experiments) were implemented by Anno and his team due to his clinical depression, which was response to &quot;little creative control&quot; and tight production schedules by NHK. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m really curious about is .. how has nobody noticed the oddity of these two shows and their blatant, absolutely direct reference to so many conspiracies and alternate proposals to humanity&#39;s origin and future? I could ask the same about Disney&#39;s Atlantis films and why they were suddenly thrown into production with themes and cinematic techniques that are way beyond what is normally intended for a young audience. I am aware that edgy creative concepts and low-key conspiracy/controversial history references are nothing new, as SDF macross or even the recent Devilman remake somewhat attempts similar things, but boy, nothing comes close to NGE and Nadia:TSOBW... </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t hesitate to criticize, question, and contribute in the comment section as I have 20,000 words of analysis to share with you regarding specific details. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t fathom how these rather popular and even mainstream anime can shove in blatant Sumerian mythology and very obvious implications about global conspiracies and an eventual rapture-like end game for mankind, like some revisionist/reverse genesis of the enuma elis (same thing, really) - I mean, the show is indeed called Neon Genesis Evangelion, very reminiscent of the New World Order phenomenon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ikr? Im just shocked that.. a subtle celebration of sumerian mythology and reverse creation story was more wide spread and unknowingly enjoyed by so many people.. yet Sumeria itself is yet to this day the elephant in the room of historical academia. So few people study it.. Its as if NGE makes fun of us plebs or something as a secret in common sight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The enneagram is part of the hidden occult knowledge about humans they use to manipulate us, there are 9 behavior characteristics that separate people, think about it this way: the zodiac will have people put in behavior characteristics, and say things like &quot;leos are this way&quot; and &quot; &quot;picis like things this way&quot;, the people who follow the zodiac have recognized that people is not completely different. people repeat, and there is a limited number of patterns. the eneagram divides the behavior patters in 9 main characteristics and elevates this into a science, combined with the Jungian version the &quot;MBTI&quot; you can predict the actions of people and groups down to the words they will say, every big screen writer uses this brach of knowledge to make the characters relatable to real people, and police use it to catch criminals, know thyself </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the zodiac got wrong is that the pattern you get has nothing to do with your date of birth, at least not in a noticeable way,  One of the best things is to analyze movies with these knowledge, and see how they try to make you relate to the characters to tell you what to do in that situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nadia:TSOBW is so unorthodox and intended for such a specific audience if you look hard enough, gender ratios are direct references to Freud, almost every cast down to the freaking baby lion - King - are in a web of surrogate relationships, the leading characters are always at the eve of puberty and are built around the traditional Greek Tragic Hero, what&#39;s more - all the characters form a Russian Doll narrative, wherein a narrative is part of a greater narrative, and that an even greater one, and so on. Even symbolism matches up - from the Island, which was symbolically fertilized by a seed-shaped arc, then to the earth as a whole.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its actually very boring.. and has aged terribly. I only managed to barely enjoy it because I was busy jotting down the significance and symbolisms/intentional structures of each passing scene. Id say you shiuld watch NGE with its epilogue film The End of Evangelion first, grasp a general understanding of its Freudian, genetic, and sumerian undertones first, and then give Nadia:TSOBW a try. The complimentary connections will blow your mind. These are some of the most obvious similarities. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Creeping tragedy and delving into darkness before reaching a bittersweet revelation/confrontation/resolution/rebirth. </p></li>
<li><p>The russian doll narrative - The EVA (like pacific rim robots) are actually living artificial humans - with a soul, implied to be dna. The pilot is thus the symbol of the EVA&#39;s consciousness, and in turn the EVA is a symbol of the pilot&#39;s projections. In Nadia:TSOBW, not to spoil anything, vehicles are structured like a human being, with people inside it - representing its complex identity. It has windows for eyes, ladders for spinal cords, and the bridge and captain for a brain - the captain of which wears a cap with an eye on it - the eye of horus, otherwise known as the pineal gland. </p></li>
<li><p>Surrogate spouse, child, or parent. </p></li>
<li><p>German existentialism. Several examples exist. The questioning of whether we are free and in control of our awareness or if its just our synapses that make us believe in its illusive notion. Twins or even clones exist, wherein characters will sometimes seem expendable or identical .. as if they are machines or not entirely unique - having no soul like Rei  Ayanami. Shinji is also seen in some episodes (not to spoil) floating in a vacuum - a state of idealized physical  freedom and liberation from any kind of interaction or influence at all - just you and your pure identity. </p></li>
<li><p>Secret society/conspiracy. No explanation needed. Directly stated and not even eluded or implied. They even provide background info and financial contexts as well as historical origin.</p></li>
<li><p>The theme of mass extinction, biblical cataclysm - Just as shown in SDF:macross, this is more so a common thing due to Japan&#39;s post-modern culture after the nuclear bombs.. as sad and tragic that was - it tied into both animes as an important theme of cyclical history. </p></li>
<li><p>Gender and sex. Extremely important theme for both. There are duos, or couples everywhere, and all of them as a collective sometimes represent humanity as a whole - again, russian doll narrative. </p></li>
<li><p>Aliens</p></li>
<li><p>Greek Tragedy and other historical references. Things like emotional extremity, the duality of madness and greatness, stubborn heros whose distinguishing quality both sets them apart for greatness and downfall, the inclusion of a speechless crew/background cast like a Greek Chorus, all these things are related to Greek plays, and just like the Neo-Spartans in Disney&#39;s Atlantis, Neo-Atlantis in Nadia:TSOBW are essentially political/ethnic elitists and foreign occupiers of the natives - just like the Spartans. (Spartans were not native dardanians, and were descendents of the Dorians who invaded Greece at around 1200 bc and began the Greek dark ages.)</p></li>
<li><p>Eyes, perspective, identity - all three are almost synonymous themes used to question the reality of what we perceive and comprehend, as well as show who are pretentious and hiding their eye-dentity by wearing glasses or masks of some kind - even makeup counts. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah.. theres a lot. You gotta watch them forst with a very keen and careful eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the impression you are new to our little backwater, haha. Welcome man. We need more fresh blood like you. That can think, snd pursue questions. And then write them out in such a coherent way. </p>

<p>This always happens. Look at any art form. Literature was my thing. But they kill any art that is a vehicle for real ideas. Why do you think the Great American Novel is so hard to produce now? I ptomise they are being written, but they are difficult to find. Maybe that isn&#39;t the best example, but if it aint on Oprah&#39;s bookshelf, or similar, it might get some pop acceptance, but if she didn&#39;t read it, who would? Stuff like that.</p>

<p>But I want your read on Gargantia :)</p>

It seems that only old anime, before 2000 carry these edgy symbolisms and blatant reference to what has evolved into modern day conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The enneagram is part of the hidden occult knowledge about humans they use to manipulate us, there are 9 behavior characteristics that separate people, think about it this way: the zodiac will have people put in behavior characteristics, and say things like &quot;leos are this way&quot; and &quot; &quot;picis like things this way&quot;, the people who follow the zodiac have recognized that people is not completely different. people repeat, and there is a limited number of patterns. the eneagram divides the behavior patters in 9 main characteristics and elevates this into a science, combined with the Jungian version the &quot;MBTI&quot; you can predict the actions of people and groups down to the words they will say, every big screen writer uses this brach of knowledge to make the characters relatable to real people, and police use it to catch criminals, know thyself </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the zodiac got wrong is that the pattern you get has nothing to do with your date of birth, at least not in a noticeable way,  One of the best things is to analyze movies with these knowledge, and see how they try to make you relate to the characters to tell you what to do in that situation.</p>
