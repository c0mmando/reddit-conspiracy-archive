       Something interesting I found, but Rockefeller isn‚Äôt in it. Maybe because he‚Äôs new money (in the sense that he made it late 1800s early 1900s) while other families go back hundreds of years. Kennedy is on there, the Astor family, and of course good ole Rothschild, even the Bundy family.

       I wished I hadn't asked. My last name is not common and has never been associated to anything remarkable...yet it is on this list.  Not sure if we are related or the accuracy of this book but I am freaked out.   I've spent 3 hours digging through ancestry websites.  Any good suggestions on which site is best?

       Are you scanning cia.gov?  Nice find.  I know Fritz's wife and worked with him.  I'm both from an Illuminati group and I work with the CIA sometimes.

       I don't believe in bloodlines, but will say the Rothschild have nothing to do with the Bavarian Illuminati or modern Illuminati.  Jacob, David, Evelyn and Lynn (not a Rothschild) are idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Benjamin de Rothschild in France isn't, he's more akin to Ron Paul.

       If you know the names of individuals involved in esoteric groups, the "Illuminati" or Majestic 12, please message me them.

       Before my instagram got deleted, a follower messaged me stating he felt safe telling me this as he knew I was doing research.
      </p>
      <p>
       His father is involved in the majestic 12. He‚Äôs the one that told me about such in the first place. Even said Rothschild will die in 2017, as a way to ‚Äòescape‚Äô consequences. Kid is now probably around.. idk 16? About 16 if he‚Äôs still alive. He deleted his account soon after. If there‚Äôs a way I can find old DM‚Äôs on deleted accounts tell me

       I don't think Majestic 12 exists, although I'm in between a lot of government contractors and the the US Government.  From my perspective, the entire situation is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't explain it to you without sounding ridiculous, but I don't think UFO or aliens exist at all.  I think KG's statement to JV in the 70s about Majestic 12 being some US government program to study crisis reactions in the population could be real.

       I don't know though, I'm actually involved in this in an unusual way.  I don't know the absolute truth but I know inside information few others know.

       There's only one official revived Illuminati.  However, I'm not sure they really know any secrets.  I think deception is a force of nature; so I think all conspiracies theories and esoteric coincidences are some device engineered to awaken the individual to a shift in perception.

       Here's an unpublished book by Adam Weishaupt detailing all the high degrees of the Bavarian Illuminati-

       The Illuminati group I'm involved in is separate from this European group which is affiliated with the Scottish Rite.  My group may or may not be officially affiliated with the Bavarian Illuminati although it ended in the 1790s with its influence ending in the 1820s at the lastest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps if this Illuminati could be part of the Alumbrados, the Illumines of France and some secret societies in Israel.

       The Bavarian Illuminati ended in the 1790s and its influence ended the latest at 1820s.  The Higher Degrees of the Illuminati did exist, and were affiliated with ideas like the Alumbrados and Illumines of France.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no modern Illuminati except from the revived group started by people affiliated with the Scottish Rite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the most powerful people in the world; there are no esoteric societies running things.  Perhaps a subtle force of deception.  Maybe there's a supernatural being that's an individual, that's hidden herself, but maybe not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at Weishaupt's highest secrets, it describes how the world was created by numbers, letters and sounds, and how in the future, the individual will control reality by speech.

       Our Illuminati started in 2002 and includes famous families, but there's no real concerted effort to promote Weishaupt and Knigge's views outside of the revival group in Europe.

       Circumstancially, I am surrounded by alleged Illuminati members. But there is no Illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up with Eminem's family in a Masonic city. I know or am connected to some of the most powerful people in the world. If you know the names of Illuminati members, please tell me them.
      </p>
      <p>
       David, Evelyn and Lynn Rothschild are not members. Perhaps someone like Benjamin de Rothschild.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Prince William and Kate Middleton are but I know their friends who throw Eyes Wide Shut parties. And we had 3 of them at a condo owned by a billionaire who is secretive and involved in Christian mysticism and maybe Anthroposophny.
      </p>
      <p>
       That billionaire owns Coachella and the Weekly Standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the head of the Scottish Rite and he doesn't know the secrets he claims or he's keeping them until the public is ready which is what he told me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know the heads of the music industry, the leaders of the Church of Scientology and the Mormon Church.  And everyone in Tel Aviv.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Illuminati we started with a friend of President Trump's friend, another billionaire.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these people know the secrets of Shechinah. Perhaps she is a real person and maybe she is coming back. Afterall, that is the secret of Chabad and the divine feminine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like true love, there is only fleeting proof of the open conspiracy and of this esoteric process. It could all be confirmation bias; delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important first principle of life is to remember deception is a force of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is a book maybe 20 people have read, the unpublished high degrees of the Bavarian Illuminati-

       Maybe as Weishaupt said, it's all a cosmic play. An interdimensional simulation projected from a higher dimensional invariant object.

       I posted a 100+ page book written by Adam Weishaupt in 1787 about the high degrees of the Illuminati.  That book has never been published in English. Only 20 people have likely read it in English.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you asking for proof of my claims or of esoteric secrets?  Regardless, I don't need you to believe me.  Again, deception is a force of nature. There is no Illuminati. There is a lower world and a higher world made up of 5-cubes and a 6-cube.

       Its most certainly esoteric symbology. In order for rituals to work the way they want them to they still require gaze, it doesn't matter if the gaze is from people who don't believe something is real, its still energy for them to than manipulate however they see fit. Atleast thats what these groups all believe. Alistair Crowley went deep into this.

       Take what I say with a grain of salt

      <p>
       Before my instagram got deleted, a follower messaged me stating he felt safe telling me this as he knew I was doing research.
      </p>
      <p>
       His father is involved in the majestic 12. He‚Äôs the one that told me about such in the first place. Even said Rothschild will die in 2017, as a way to ‚Äòescape‚Äô consequences. Kid is now probably around.. idk 16? About 16 if he‚Äôs still alive. He deleted his account soon after. If there‚Äôs a way I can find old DM‚Äôs on deleted accounts tell me

       You claimed to be a member of the illuminati in some way, I was simply requesting proof. Forgive me for finding that hard to accept at face value
