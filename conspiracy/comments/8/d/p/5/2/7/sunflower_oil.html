    <div class="md"><p>Rapeseed/Canola is very bad. Besides being GMO and full of carcinogenic Glyphisaye it binds up natural vitamin E uptake among other things.</p>

<p>Article: 
<a href="https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/know-your-fats/the-great-con-ola/">https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/know-your-fats/the-great-con-ola/</a></p>

<p>&quot;These studies all point in the same direction–that canola oil is definitely not healthy for the cardiovascular system. Like rapeseed oil, its predecessor, canola oil is associated with fibrotic lesions of the heart. It also causes vitamin E deficiency, undesirable changes in the blood platelets and shortened life-span in stroke-prone rats when it was the only oil in the animals’ diet. Furthermore, it seems to retard growth, which is why the FDA does not allow the use of canola oil in infant formula.&quot;</p>

<p>Sunflower oil is ok if it&#39;s fresh.  Better to steer towards coconut and avacado oils for chips etc.  Real olive oil is good but has a low smoke point so not good for frying or sautee or chips.  Italian olive oil imported has been adulterated with soybean oil for over a decade now. Among other things. So buy from US producers or trusted sources.  They don&#39;t list it on the label either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many reasons but here are a few quick ones. 1) it causes a much higher use of glyphosate which is polluting everything and is a known carcinogen among other things 2) GMOs have not been properly studied.  We are already seeing them alter and destroy healthy gut flora which isn&#39;t that surprising when you realize they are inserting DNA from bacteria into the DNA of plants. 3) It&#39;s killing the bees probably a combination is the heavier use of herbicides and pesticides but also the DNA sequences they use against pests also effect the beneficial pollinators </p>

<p>Has omega 6 essential fatty acids which are associated with inflammation (heart disease) <em>if</em> you don’t balance it 1:1 with omega 3’s.  At least not gmo like canola, corn &amp; soy.</p>

<p>“As you can see, this golden oil is very high in omega-6 PUFAs clocking in at about 60%. This amount is not as high as other popular oils at the healthfood store such as:
Grapeseed oil (70-76%)
Hemp seed oil (72-81%)
Pumpkin seed oil (64%)
Nonetheless, it is still high enough to be a concern. Note that rice bran oil, used by Chipotle for cooking, is significantly lower in PUFAs at 38%. The peanut oil used by Chick-fil-A and Five Guys Burgers has a PUFA content of 32%. However, Chipotle uses sunflower oil to fry its chips and Chick-fil-A/Five Guys use peanut oil to make french fries. So, you’re still getting plenty of vegetable oils if you eat at either of these restaurants. What’s more, the sunflower seed oil and peanut oil used in these chains is highly refined, so you’re consuming rancid vegetable oils too.</p>

<p>Another concern is that sunflower oil contains no beneficial, inflammation reducing omega-3 fats like those found in <em>walnut oil or flax seed oil.</em> This is a problem <em>if</em> someone consumes sunflower oil regularly, as it will unbalance the crucial ratio of omega-6 / omega-3 fats in the diet. If we were exposed to only miniscule amounts of this oil, it wouldn’t be a concern.”</p>
