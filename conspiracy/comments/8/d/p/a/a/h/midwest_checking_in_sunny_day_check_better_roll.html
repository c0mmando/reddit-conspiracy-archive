        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m in the midwest and here&#39;s how it usually goes:</p>

<p>Wake up early, see the sky is clear as can be. See regular passenger jets flying with no trails, can even make out some of their brands (Lot, United, Southwest, etc)</p>

<p>It usually stays clear and nice until about 10:30 A.M. Central. That&#39;s when you see them, they are hire up altitude, with binoculars you can&#39;t make out any brand name on non-labeled silver airliners.</p>

<p>They run Parallel trails and also criss cross each other. </p>

<p>By 3pm, the sky is foggy/smoggy haze like.</p>

<p>If its cloudy or partly cloudy, they&#39;re not out. But if its clear, just wait and you will see this exact pattern I described above. </p>

<p>Fuck these guys for real. At 10:30 A.M. I stepped out for a work break, and counted 8 to the north running parallels, 4 to the Souths, and a few doing the criss crossing east and west</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main areas of geoengineering being researched are Stratospheric Aerosol Injection, Cirrus Stripping, and Maritime Cloud Brightening.
SAI takes place in the Stratosphere from about 80,000 feet up to 100 miles. It will require either special tanker aircraft or rockets or balloons to get the aerosols up there. And yes, the substances being considered include aluminium, barium, and sulphides. Personally I think this is insanity. They won&#39;t know if it works without doing it, and if it goes wrong there&#39;s no going back.
Maritime Cloud Brightening uses ships with massive water pumps to blast seawater into the lower atmosphere to make clouds which reflect the sun&#39;s rays.
And Cirrus Stripping DOES take place at airliner altitude. The idea is to remove both the natural cirrus clouds AND the haze from the persistent contrails as it traps heat and increases global warming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so if I&#39;m understanding this correctly, the contrails that spread out and cover the sky in a gray haze are bad because they trap heat and increase global warming. But wouldn&#39;t they also reflect light as well? That would be a good thing, according to the goals of SRM, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are climate scientists arguing both ways. The cirrus layer cuts down on direct sunlight reaching the ground during the day, but then traps the infra red heat that would normally be radiated out into space at night. So the effect is dimmer days and warmer nights. Whether that leads to a net increase or decrease in global temperatures remains to be seen. Here is Rosalind Peterson of California Skywatch addressing a UN debate on this problem. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVD9IUO9Ftk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVD9IUO9Ftk</a></p>

<p>Yes they are. I took <a href="https://imgur.com/SxTjs1E">this</a> photo in England last year and every new contrail showed up on flightradar. Of course, most of the contrails had been up there for hours so the planes were long gone.</p>

<p>yeah okay. All my Original posts have factual sources, so you already lost</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t give a shit what you want to debate about, you aren&#39;t genuine.</p>

<p>Then go away, leave</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you a teacher? Are you a welder? No. You&#39;re a liar. Lol.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t seriously be this dumb, is this even real right now?</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t disprove that you&#39;re a liar.</p>

<p>Luckily I dont care what you think.</p>

<p>Notify them about what? That I hurt your feelings every time I point out that you aren&#39;t a real user? Go ahead.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a stalker following me around and being a douche before, so I reported it and they got banned. Follow the rules or face the consequences</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a response. You didn&#39;t address anything I said about your account being gamed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Come to Chicago and meet me in person over some coffee and a chess game then</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just replied with some bullshit. No teacher, welder, or welding teacher has time to post at the rate that you do. Gamed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sigh.....feel free to go back through my user history. Perhaps you missed the part where I had a work accident and injuries from a work accident that put me in the Hospital and left be with some horrendous injuries. Teaching welding is easy and there&#39;s a lot of free time, and the guy who is still injured/maimed gets moved to supervisor/overseer. Basically I sit at my PC all day and deal with people off/on, order supplies, makes sure all the machines are calibrated, e-mails, phone calls, etc. </p>

<p>If you check my post history, there are large gaps of time I&#39;m not posting.</p>

<p>But again. i dont care. Come meet me IRL for coffee and we can debate there</p>
