       Two black men arrested after loitering in local ritzy Starbucks, management asked the men to leave multiple times they refused, management contacted police, police asked men to leave multiple times, they refused, they were arrested. BLM gets involved, boycott under way, starbucks announces it is closing 8000 stores to conduct racial sensitivity training. All of it, linked to a local Dunkin’ Donuts.

       Racial sensitivity training bc two black dudes were loitering.  Wow. Gotta love 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly if I worked at a starbucks and had to go to that training, I would quit.  Way to treat 8000 workers like complete morons.

       Except that everyone loiters in Starbucks. That's the whole point of going to a cafe. The only reason why they were singled out from all of the other loiters in that starbucks during the same time, is because they were black.

       What happened was that they came in and asked to use the bathroom. The owner said that the bathrooms is for customers only and asked for them to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manager lied and said it was company policy that they had to leave if they were not customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people who were there when it happened, openly said that they weren't doing anything wrong and there was plenty of other people in the store, including themselves who were "loitering" and didn't buy drinks or anything. The only thing that was different was the color of their skin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will also say that I'm white, and have never had problems with loitering in starbucks or using their bathrooms without being a customer.

       Did they also demand access to the restroom and then refuse to leave when told the restrooms were for use only by customers?  That's an important detail that you seem eager to overlook.

      <p>
       Actually, answer my first question before that one.

      <p>
       How long were they in the store before they were asked to leave?

       You can read the store manager's mind across the internet psychically across spacetime, but don't appear to know even the most basic fact about the situation.

       I will say that I'm also white and have been asked to leave a Starbucks for hanging out.   It was a crowded one in a downtown setting.  I didn't even demand access to the bathroom.

       What's more likely,  two black guys walk into a Starbucks and everyone inside drops their conversations to witness their entire encounter inside the store, or a number of snotty libshits saw an opportunity to virtue signal from the comfort of their natural environment (a warm, cozy Starbucks Coffee) and just couldn't help themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know how it looks from here. Folks like yourself don't help the matter much.

       Yes. I am. I'm at school right now, studying, and procrastinating by replying to you. The videos exist, that's why it became a news story in the first place. There are two videos of the incident and they both went viral. You can either look it up or not. It's your choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also notice, that you are the only one throwing around insults, and what I said about annecdotal experiences applies to me as well. I know my story is true, that's all I can say, but I know it's easily dissmassable as well.

       Neither video I've seen shows them asking to use the restroom nor the manager's initial request to leave.

       I've already seen them.   That's how I know that you're being dishonest in your characterization of the events that took place,  as well as about the content of the videos.

       You're not replying to me; you're replying at me and spinning like a top.

      <p>
       You won't find video proving your narrative (because you know it doesn't exist), you won't answer one very simple question.  Again,  you're not replying
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       me.  You're replying
       <em>
        at
       </em>
       me.  And apparently you've got plenty of time to do that... but hitting that home button and pulling up the youtube app.  My god, the effort
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       would take!

       Have a good day man. Feel free to say or think you've won the conversation. It's obvious that you want this to be a battle or an argument instead of a conversation by throwing around insults and acting rude while pretending you are not.

       You would have an easier time finding that nonexistent video than quoting where I insulted you.

       I just want to know why you said shalom to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had other users assume I was Jewish for some reason and a few have even tried to claim I was JDIF.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took it as an insinuation from your part based from my past experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that's the case, no I'm not Jewish, I'm anti-Zeonist, and believe that Israel is one of the biggest contributors to human rights violations in the world and a large source of corruption and conspiracies involving the states and the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was just an idle reply to my cheers with no insinuation or implying of anything, then my apologies.

       Idk what yous two are arguing about but being black is not a good excuse to refuse to leave a place when asked by management and by the police. I don’t know when that sort of thinking happened, but seriously, I can’t use but I’m white so I don’t have to leave when asked, so why would anybody else be able to say that? People arguing that it’s because the pink haired uber feminist sjw manager is a racist are just ignoring the fact that she asked them to leave. You got a problem? File a law suit, but you still leave. When the cops come and ask you to leave, you leave. When you arent welcome, regardless of why, you leave. This is a Starbucks in downtown philadelphia, which is a minority majority city, two out of every three customers are people of color, foh with this racist nonsense. This was a set up. Starbucks stock is down, everybody in philly went to Dunkin this morning to virtue signal. Lol it’s brilliant.
