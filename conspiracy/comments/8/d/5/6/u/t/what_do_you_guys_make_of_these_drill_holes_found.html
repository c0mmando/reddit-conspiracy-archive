       No I'm not saying it's aliens, so let me get that out of the way. But considering we are told that these civilizations only had access to copper and bronze tools, I don't understand how they were able to pull these off in granite none the less. You can clearly see the groves around the bore hole indicating some type of drilling and even an indention at the end where they didn't complete the hole. Another thing to point out is that the spaces between the grooves indicate that their "drills" were 14 times quicker/more efficient than we can even accomplish today with modern technology. I guess my main question is, why is this so obvious anomaly not debated in MS academics more? Tough question huh lmao!

       Divergent civilization that collapsed, leaving evidence of this that just isnt shared with the public due to its nature, or their technology was great enough to leave. Maybe ET's took them somewhere else. They sure talk about things that could have been ET's

       I think we've been lied to about how advanced prior civilizations were. For instance: There's all these megaliths with precision-like carvings in them. Just seems too hard to be accomplished by using only primitive tools.

       After Magicians of the Gods, check out his book "Underworld" as well. It focuses specifically on those parts of civilizations that have been lost to rising sea levels; ties right in with the other books.

       Bullshit ropes and pulleys lifted 1 Ton plus rocks. That only chisels were used to cut the rock. That stone age civilizations could fit together rocks so perfectly that a piece of paper can't slip between them. They show obvious signs of being precut as they go around corners. There are metal interlocks between stones far before smelting was thought to exist. These people didn't just write random shit down or make these marvels for the hell of it. Look at the written accounts as historical record and we may learn that we are finally catching up to our ancestors. Maybe we lost this knowledge in the destruction of the library of Alexandria

       TPTB have likely been destroying any knowledge that would empower the masses for a long time. Remember when that ancient "battery" was found in Iraq a few years ago? Since 2001, Iraq and Syria have had countless ancient artifacts stolen or destroyed by TPTB. We can only guess what they might have been.

       Certainly not at Gobekli Tepe or any of the other megalithic sites around the world IF they were actually constructed when we were told they were. Then let's not even take into consideration the enormous amount of effort that would need to be dedicated to accomplish such tasks. These people were supposed hunter gathers(Gobekli Tepe) who were still chasing around game for sustenance at the time. Then let's not get into the actual knowledge that is carved onto the stones themselves. Let's then look at all kinds of mathematical info that can be derived from the Great Pyramid. Yeah...no, the people that academia tells us built them most likely didn't.

       I definitely don’t know enough about Goebekli Tepe to really argue about where the people were as a civilization.

      <p>
       I just tend to find it more reasonable the there were skilled people in our past to make very detailed art/buildings and where skill wasn’t needed, labor and bodies thrown at the tasks to get things done.

       Move 100 ton obelisks.  Carve granite at 90 angles.  Carve a box out of a single granite block with the lid and bottom hermetically sealed.  Carve the inside of that box with perfect 90 angles.  Fit blocks together with zero room between them.  Cut rocks/blocks at irregular angles to perfectly fit other irregular blocks.  Put a long, thin tunnel thru granite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do all this with virtually no signs of machining (quarry sites have machining signs, but the finished pieces do not) AND have all these megaliths still standing 10,000 years later (minimum).

       You presented lots of points and I wish I knew the answers/rebuttals to everyone of them.

      <p>
       I’m not a stone mason or an expert on any of this but I do know that granite can be cut with primitive tools. That is absolutely proven. I believe that granite can be polished as well with primitive tools but I’m at work right now so I’m not about to really research that to be positive. Given that, how would it be impossible to not have the time/skill do do those things?

       I editing my earlier comment so you may not have seen the other question I asked: If this wasn’t done with skilled craftsman using primitive tools and slave labor how do you think it was done?

       Why do you consider something to the mainstream explanation conspiratorial? If you actually look into these things in any depth with an open unbiased mind it's pretty plain to see...imo. Actually it could be argued that by keeping the existing thought of the ancients is "conspiracy".

       Anyways I still stand by what is said in that I believe that the granite can (and was) cut/carved into shapes/designs with primitive tools because that makes the most sense to me out of any theory I’ve heard so far and that just happens to go along with the mainstream theory. One thing we both know is that these stones were cut and I’ve asked others (I may have asked you too) in this thread but I haven’t got an answer on how these stones were actually cut if it wasn’t with primitive tools.

       I gotcha on the "alternative"...agreed. As to building them, I really don't know. I'm not married to one theory over another. The one thing I will say is that it doesn't make logical sense for megalithic structures to be built to that size and scale unless there was some type of technological know how that made the quarrying and transport easy. Would we build 40 story buildings nowadays without the use of tools and large moving equipment to ease the process? Like I had mentioned before as well....what about the sophisticated astrological knowledge that seems to be built into these as well. They are there so there is no disputing that they were done somehow. I have my ideas but they are just that....ideas.

       Man I just struggle with the idea that it’s easier for a person to believe that “acoustic vibration” is how stones were cut thousands of years ago because ancient people “seemed to have way more knowledge” as opposed to seeing a video of somebody replicating a theory of how something was done on video with (primitive) technology that was known for that era.

       Because we are not talking about any one thing specifically, you can safely say we have replicated the skills.  I can also say we haven't.  Both are true.  There are some things we can replicate, there are some things we've found that we cannot replicate.

       I think we shouldn't discount the ideas. I'm a stonemason myself and it boggles the mind to think about the pyramids or the giant temples in india that were carved in situ. I takes not only a skilled craftsman but a craftsman with true love for his work to create something of that caliber, and even today, literal years of labor. If you stay away from the whole extraterrial stuff, it's still clear to me in my somewhat expert opinion that there is much more lost technology then we'd like to think.

       Why would you want to rebutt them?  Why not just learn about them?  Megaliths are a popular subject on YT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea I prolly should not have been specific.  I was typing a short-hand answer whilst working.  Granite was a catchall term for Very Hard Stone.  Depending on the site (Serapeum at Saarqa, Goebleki, the quarry in Kosovo, anything in Peru, on and on), the specific stone used is different.  I'm not trying to remember and then rote name all types of stone used in all types of megaliths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, we carve a headstone.  If one is familiar with the curiosities at the megaliths, carving a granite headstone isn't really germane to the topic (tho my fault for bringing it up).

       At saarqa the stone used is basalt, which as a stone mason i can tell you is hard as fuck. We do have the tools to do what they did, but only since the 1900's. and crudely at that. There is a love in the lasting ancient works that is no longer included in buildings.

       Successfully putting stuff into orbit requires finesse. Moving a rocket that weighs an order of magnitude more than the weight you claim we can't move onto a precise point on a launchpad takes finesse.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're extremely, extremely wrong with your claim that we can't move objects that large or can't do so with precision. I have no idea why you believe that we can't do the things you say we can't do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not sure why you think we can't cut granite at precise angles. Google "granite box" or "granite cube" and experience the wonders of modern technology! We can cut a granite headstone laser engraved with a photo of your pet for crying out loud. Seriously, google "granite headstone" and see all the things you apparently think are impossible.

       I get the feeling you're not all that familiar with the objects being discussed here, and keep moving the topic to semantics (I submit, you win, please stop).

       The Serapeum at Saqqra (spelling?) has some curious stone objects, I'd start there.  But any video on megalithic structures will have curious stone objects.

       Semantics means the meaning of the things you're saying. The things you're saying are wrong, and you can't even describe to me how my counterexamples don't prove you wrong except yelling "semantics". We can move things 30 times as massive as the stuff you're talking about. We can do it with precision.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Serapeum at Saqqra you point out is large, but technically far less impressive (though also considerably less tacky) than any headstone you can buy for under $1000 today. Seriously, the carvings on it aren't impressive by today's standards. There's not even any shading in the pictures.

       Sure, we launch a rocket.  With finesse.  How does this relate to moving 100 ton stone obelisks?

       If any other readers are interested in the curious stone anomolies of megalithic sites, I encourage you to check out the Serapeum, just about anything in Peru/Andes, Goeblecki Tepe, and likely any video on any megalith.  The stone work on these sites are out of our grasp today, even tho we can launch very heavy rockets.

       I have already conceded on all semantical points.  You've pulled one small portion of my reply and blown it outta proportion and context.  For this you win the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait, which video?  You mean you haven't actually watched anything on Saqqra?  Pick one that appeals to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some info about stone megaliths from Peru/Andes, note the first sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The processes and technologies involved in the creation of these temples are still not fully understood by modern scholars. Our current ideas of the Tiwanaku culture hold that they had no writing system and also that the invention of the wheel was most likely unknown to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The architectural achievements seen at Pumapunku are striking in light of the presumed level of technological capability available during its construction. Due to the monumental proportions of the stones, the method by which they were transported to Pumapunku has been a topic of interest since the temple's discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stones are argued to have been transported up a steep incline from a quarry near Lake Titicaca roughly 20 miles away. Some of the blocks are said to weigh in the range of 100Đ130 tons.
      </p>
      <p>
       One notable block has been measured at 36 feet long, 16 feet wide and 6 feet thick. Archaeologists argue that this was accomplished by the large labor force of ancient Tiwanaku. Several theories have been proposed as to how this labor force transported the stones although these theories remain speculative. Two of the more common proposals involve the use of llama skin ropes and the use of ramps and inclined planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In assembling the walls of Pumapunku, each stone was finely cut to interlock with the surrounding stones and the blocks fit together like a puzzle, forming load-bearing joints without the use of mortar. One common engineering technique involves cutting the top of the lower stone at a certain angle, and placing another stone on top of it which was cut at the same angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The precision with which these angles have been utilized to create flush joints is indicative of a highly sophisticated knowledge of stone-cutting and a thorough understanding of descriptive geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the joints are so precise that not even a razor blade will fit between the stones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of the masonry is characterized by accurately cut rectilinear blocks of such uniformity that they could be interchanged for one another while maintaining a level surface and even joints.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blocks were so precisely cut as to suggest the possibility of prefabrication and mass production, technologies far in advance of the TiwanakuŐs Incan successors hundreds of years later."

       I'm not all that well read about these, but it seems completely reasonable to me that we're not precision cutting tonnes of stone blocks nowadays because we have no desire to. These are temples and tombs that great rulers could throw slaves at for their own religious purposes, and there were probably thousands of people being whipped to death for not cutting stones exactly right.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like saying shipbuilders nowadays lack the finesse to handcraft a wooden ship-of-the-line, simply because no one's bothered to. We've lost that ability (generally, as a race) but that's because we found better and easier ways to do it.

       I understand your point about semantics but that's about it. Sure, we could replicate those stones today but that's not the point. What the experts are telling you is that with the level of technology at the time it is an impossibility. From reading your comments you seem to be missing this point entirely....and THAT is the main point of contention here. Go ahead, go to any done mason, give home the tools of the day and tell him to replicate it. Lemme know how that works out for you. BTW...tell him he needs to assemble and move it as well inside those areas where they are located. You need to look at the totality of the construction.

       Saying that we couldn't do this today is embellishment meant to make these structures and monuments seem all the more incredible and mysterious and suggest that these ancient civilizations must have had some incredible technology to achieve it. It's completely wrong, though, and no such incredible, unthinkable technology is required.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then it just comes down to guessing at what they were capable of and saying how unbelievable it is that ancient civilizations were able to work stone to specific measurements or move heavy things. Is it, though? Is it really so unbelievable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the idea that this is advanced and beyond what can be done today, that really is the crux of the argument: "I can't believe they were capable of this", and I think that's pretty weak. Obviously other people think so, too, or there wouldn't be a need to embellish it like we saw earlier.

       250 includes the base, but the obelisk itself is obviously very heavy and over 100 tons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is how they moved it, p/wikipedia:
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the technical limitations of the day, transporting it was no easy feat: The French government ordered a purpose-built seagoing lighter built by the Toulon naval yard; this 49 metres long, flat bottomed, three masted ship named the Louqsor was sailed up the Nile to Luxor where 300 workmen dug a canal to allow the ship to come close to the obelisk. The French seamen then lowered the obelisk with an array of blocks and tackles, yardarms and capstans. The re-erection of the obelisk on the Place de la Concorde during a ceremony carefully planned by King Louis-Philippe I was no mean engineering feat either.

       Read book 10, it explains it. Applying modern math to the methodology described there works out. (Most people doing "ancient approaches" neglected the construction engines described here.) And much of the stuff in there is actually passed down from previous or other cultures. Most of the citation would point towards the Greeks, but I'd think some of the practices are even older than that.

       I think the stone work is suspiciously advanced, but like you I’m no mason so I can’t really say. I DO think that the knowledge of astronomy held by the Egyptians, Mayans, whoever built gobleki Tepe is clearly evidence of an advanced society though. I mean, Mayans had an understanding of the cosmos that modern science has only VERY recently surpassed

       Randall Carlson is the person you should look up. He has compiled decades of surveying data (he has traveled the world and meticulously documented everything) as well as peer-reviewed studies published in reputable journals. He has done extremely compelling presentations on the Joe Rogan Podcast.

       I believe I’ve actually listened to that podcast. I seem to remember him saying that he believes that the Sphinx is much older than we believe it is due to water erosion on it. I think that’s a cool theory and I hate that he gets so much trouble for his ideas.

       Okay I thought so but it has been a couple of years. I think the idea of there being even older civilizations that made these structures is fascinating and I think it would be amazing/super cool if this was proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       However that doesn’t change my mind that these could and were made with primitive tools no matter if it was 10,000 years ago or 100,000 years ago. Logic just points to that for me.

       I respectfully disagree there. If you look at the sheer scale of these structures, it is impossible for hunter gatherers to have made them. Structures like the ones found in Gobleki Tepi require an existing wealth of knowledge in engineering, arts, architecture, etc., which a hunter gatherer society simply would not have.

       Check out the podcast again to refresh your memory; the studies Carlson cites along with his own data is extremely solid imo.

       It is within the interests of a conquering civilization to destroy traces of the previous one, especially science and religion.  It allows the new rulers to control the future of the conquered by controlling their past.  I believe this has been done a lot more than we think.

       Yeah, you know, I'm probably underestimating their understanding of mathematics and how adept they were with their tools. I forget the name of this Egyptian statue, but it is perfectly symmetrical on both sides of the face. Very impressive given the tools they had or maybe there is more to it. I would love for you or anyone to share some insight on it since I'm at work at the moment and can't do the necessary research for it.

       I definitely don’t want to imply that I’m any kind of expert or have even put a lot of time into researching this.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I’ve seen, when people start calling the mainstream Egypt (or other primitive civilizations) theories out they seem to always circle back to two different theories: that there was even older civilizations that actually made the monoliths and then died off or that it was by the help of ancient aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got kind of sucked into the ancient aliens thing and found the shows/books interesting. I thought “yeah how the hell could these primitive people pull this off???” Then I found an awesome documentary that basically went step by step and broke down how the ancient alien theory is an absolute joke. I’m on mobile now so I don’t want to link the video but it is very very easy to find, just google “Ancient Aliens Debunked” it’s a three hour long documentary and very detailed. It made the show that I used to find thoughtful and informative into something that is just something grasping for straws and even hilarious/frustrating to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the theory about an older civilization being there before and dying off, I find that more reasonable than the alien theory by I haven’t really given it the time that it would really need for me to give an opinion on its validity.

       I used to be a fan of that show, too and did the same thing. I saw a documentary that ripped apart the ancient alien theory. Entertaining, but really they're just grasping at straws for ratings. That said, the actual history -inbetween the theories- that was presented was fascinating.

       I did the same thing with the idea that all religions are telling the same story, and that the Jesus story was the same as all these other stories... went down the rabbit hole, found a good documentary debunking it, and I'm saved... (Not in the Jesus way).

       Ya know I was gonna say good find, but there is no grooves on the cut he makes. So yes this proves its possible, but I think the technique would maybe differ slightly, considering it was so long ago.

       Maybe just a different frequency? Different tool? 
Ancient knowledge we're only beginning to get a grasp of.
Monks and high priests were always regarded with powers of voice. 
You even see the echoes of that in modern day,  ie; the Thum in Skyrim

       Hiding the truth as always. My questions are why the different ages of metal? The library of Alexandria had no back up or secondary library(they did in Timbuktu). If you were intelligent enough to mine copper, you didn't happen to find any other metals along the way? The math alone not to mention logistics geographically placement of the ruins in Egypt, question it all. Not buying any of the current falsehoods being sold by Egyptologist, dates, people and technology all seems off. Use the ground penetrating radar and let us all see what's really below not just Egypt the entire northern Africa.

       From what the experts keep saying the precise cuts in the stone, the angles and positions of the pyramids. It all requires higher levels of architecture(sure the math is in there somewhere) and engineering skills. The perception was they didn't have the academic or technical skills to pull it off, but they did.

       Granite can be cut and drilled using tools that are not tipped with diamonds. It takes much longer and is much more laborious but that’s what ancient people had, time and slave labor.

       It was probably made in the 1930's, that style hole was evidently common in Scandinavia.

       Making stone holes isnt easy but it wasnt beyond the scope of early civilizations.

        Another thing to point out is that the spaces between the grooves indicate that their "drills" were 14 times quicker/more efficient than we can even accomplish today with modern technology.

       Metal poles? Ya. They've been around. Not only that but artworks in the video depicts the same exact drill set up. Not only that, but it's not even the metal that is doing the cutting, it's the rock itself. You do know what you can sharpen hardened steel with clay?

       Well we have knowledge that they made metal object. A cylinder is about as simple as it gets. I can't find any, but it doesn't matter, because we have found much more complex objects than cylindrical shaped metal. Tools probably got used until melted down to be reused, while jewelry and more advanced metal objects of that nature were buried in tombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also have evidence of these tubes, because of the holes that were made that artwork of the times depicted their creation using said tubes.

       I can make a cylinder out of anything and I'm not an artisan of any sort.

       I think the truth lies very close to this.  They could, essentially, do alchemy.  Either with acids, bases, etc, or with acoustics.

      <p>
       The Ring of David is said to have cut stone "with a worm."  I'm quoting from memory but something like that.  Thoughts are the worm was a laser (alien tech) or the worm was liquid+ a process (alchemy).

       If it took a long time, a great deal of tool wear would occur and this would be visible with a discontinuous surface finish, caused by repeatedly refreshing the tool head,over the course of the cut, which we don't see.

       My point is that the surface finish remains. The surface hasn't been polished. The core cuts show a pattern indicative of a high feed rate without interruption making it appear to be one continuous cut. We just don't have a good explanation yet.

       Mention aliens and serious academics run for the hills. There needs to be a paradigm shift in academia that finally acknowledges high technology in the past without mentioning aliens. This makes the theory more accessible to mainstream researchers since it could be verified with existing evidence. I'm not denying that aliens might have had a role in nurturing human technology, but as it stands now there is no evidence of aliens that could be examined by the public

       this meta-narrative is so revealing ... how for some people, it is fear itself that manifests the subjective presence of aliens. Where do the aliens disappear to when the fear is gone?  Do they go into the 4th dimension of our holographic mind or is it the other way around?

       yes, fear and their careers prevent many from making outstanding claims. But by shifting the paradigm slowly, for example by accepting spikes in human technology in the past, scientists may one day take alien research seriously

       Why does it need to be aliens? Modern man has existed in his present form for at least 20,000 years. We are just as intelligent as human beings were at least that long ago.

       Traces of civilization don't last long. Ruins we consider to be "ancient" already were themselves often built on top of even more ancient remains.

       Truth be told there really isn't any way to know what people were up to 15K years ago. But it would be silly to think that we are the first generation to figure out how to plan an architect shit, or use some kind of machinery to perform tasks.

       I'd argue that our evolution is being altered in a negative way, and that we had better genes back then than we do now. Everyone forgets to mention that dominance hierarchies play the biggest role in evolution, and that if an area doesn't have enough food, the leader goes somewhere else, and everyone follows him. We did not evolve starving. We get hungry pretty quickly. The fact that our brains use up calories doesn't constitute an evolutionary factor. The leader eats first when there is not enough food as well. In fact, to distribute food fairly when there is not enough of it, it would benefit females to get pregnant in order to demand access to food before others, because it's harder to deny somebody food when they're pregnant. How many creatures on earth are constantly fucking starving? Not that many, and we're not one of them. How they can stress factors that don't have to do with dominance when teaching evolution, I do not know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before greater apes evolved, the lesser primates were not in africa yet. Their social structures to this day consists of a leader with unlimited power and a bunch of others who aren't currently possessing unlimited power but switch off with each other to be leader. Nobody directly attacks the leader. They are like marionettes, controlled by the leader. When two of them slap one another, it is because the leader made a certain facial expression instead of another one which would have been optimal. In this way the leader chooses subconsciously for himself to step down, as another replaces him. In modern day china there are snub-nosed monkeys with no nose bridge sticking out. They migrate around according to the will of their unlimited power-wielding leaders who are sometimes leaders and sometimes not. Over generations the lesser primates of China ended up in Africa that many millions of years ago, along with lesser primates from all around the world at that point in time (continents looked different and were more connected). They were all 'lead by their silverbacks' to the same place. Then greater apes emerged: chimps and orangutans and gorillas and us. Then our Homo genus, still guided by unlimited power, went back to exactly from where they came from. There is a harmony in the world, arching over what is possibly comprehensible, that they have broken. When our power was fragmented by democracy we lost the most biologically vital state of our species' existence we had. It is a distracting manipulation imposed on us by racists who demand we do automatable jobs all day so that they can enjoy their ultracarnivorous lives atop the mass of our effort and flesh.

       I am of the opinion that there was a relatively advanced civilization, possibly globe-spanning, that was essentially wiped out around 12,000 years ago during the Younger Dryas impacts and subsequent "global flood" (sea level are believed to have risen 300-400 ft around this period...today approximately 50-80% of humanity lives within 100 km of an oceanic coast... No reason to think that was different then. The reason we "have no evidence" is because it's hard as fuck to do anything underwater, let alone explore submerged ancient ruins. ) Survivors of this cataclysm would go on to  found the accepted historical civilizations, in the Fertile Crescent, Indus Valley, Olmec area, etc. If you haven't, look into Goebekli Tepe, and the works of Graham Hancock, Randall Carlson, and John Anthony West (RIP)

       For the sake of understanding - the amount of land lost to the flood was approximately the same area as China and Russia combined. As you said - all coastal land, the best land - and the reason why there are so many sunken cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even as a fucking 6 year old I could tell no one builds cities underwater - so who built them and when did they sink. Science is so dogmatic it's no different from religion anymore.

       Science itself is not dogmatic, true, but most of what is accepted currently as "science" is not actual science; it's a mess of garbage and lies that gets paraded around as if it were real science.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis was provably correct, but those who supported it were ridiculed for years by the "scientific" community because said community was more interested in having people believe them to be right than they were in knowing the truth.

       You can also just google "underwater ruins" and pay no attention to the "scientists" arguing against these hypothesis as they have a monetary and career-long interest in covering up anything that does not agree with their career's worth of research papers. These people can't just take a look at a historical sea-level chart and see that most everything from the ancient world is buried under 400 feet+ of water at this point.

       Yeah, Egypt has had that going on for a while now.  I guess I was just hoping you might know of some reports or specific groups that tried studying the underelwater ruins and we're blocked and wrote about it. I'll do some digging and see if I can't find some concrete examples though, thanks for the weekend distraction!

       I think one of the reasons governments patrol ruins is to prevent people from looting the sites.  A lot of ancient ruins were destroyed by overzealous explorers and looters throughout the centuries.

       Now if they were keeping out respected archaeologists and allowing zero permits, that would be a huge red flag.

       Their standards and oversight are all a part of their looting. It's simply unfair for these relics to be so disrespected. They are the only souvenir of a time when certain ethnicities owned their own land. Now that peoples have been fractured across country borders, subjugated into paying rent, and obliged to adopt religious practices hailing the glory of Abraham's genealogical line, to manipulate a few 'professionals' into extinguishing a spiritual heritage is as easy as giving them a five-figure income and buying them two plane tickets. Racism stands propped up on pure evil. Many of these sites contain idols of deities from polytheistic religions. In polytheistic religions, each ethnicity is represented by a deity. Even people traded with have a deity. The racists came and took all. That's why there is pain and suffering in the world. They systematically deharmonize us.

       Before greater apes evolved, the lesser primates were not in africa yet. Their social structures to this day consists of a leader with unlimited power and a bunch of others who aren't currently possessing unlimited power but switch off with each other to be leader. Nobody directly attacks the leader. They are like marionettes, controlled by the leader. When two of them slap one another, it is because the leader made a certain facial expression instead of another one which would have been optimal. In this way the leader chooses subconsciously for himself to step down, as another replaces him. In modern day china there are snub-nosed monkeys with no nose bridge sticking out. They migrate around according to the will of their unlimited power-wielding leaders who are sometimes leaders and sometimes not. Over generations the lesser primates of China ended up in Africa that many millions of years ago, along with lesser primates from all around the world at that point in time (continents looked different and were more connected). They were all 'lead by their silverbacks' to the same place. Then greater apes emerged: chimps and orangutans and gorillas and us. Then our Homo genus, still guided by unlimited power, went back to exactly from where they came from. There is a harmony in the world, arching over what is possibly comprehensible, that they have broken. When our power was fragmented by democracy we lost the most biologically vital state of our species' existence we had. It is a distracting manipulation imposed on us by racists who demand we do automatable jobs all day so that they can enjoy their ultracarnivorous lives atop the mass of our effort and flesh.

       Before greater apes evolved, the lesser primates were not in africa yet. Their social structures to this day consists of a leader with unlimited power and a bunch of others who aren't currently possessing unlimited power but switch off with each other to be leader. Nobody directly attacks the leader. They are like marionettes, controlled by the leader. When two of them slap one another, it is because the leader made a certain facial expression instead of another one which would have been optimal. In this way the leader chooses subconsciously for himself to step down, as another replaces him. In modern day china there are snub-nosed monkeys with no nose bridge sticking out. They migrate around according to the will of their unlimited power-wielding leaders who are sometimes leaders and sometimes not. Over generations the lesser primates of China ended up in Africa that many millions of years ago, along with lesser primates from all around the world at that point in time (continents looked different and were more connected). They were all 'lead by their silverbacks' to the same place. Then greater apes emerged: chimps and orangutans and gorillas and us. Then our Homo genus, still guided by unlimited power, went back to exactly from where they came from. There is a harmony in the world, arching over what is possibly comprehensible, that they have broken. When our power was fragmented by democracy we lost the most biologically vital state of our species' existence we had. It is a distracting manipulation imposed on us by racists who demand we do automatable jobs all day so that they can enjoy their ultracarnivorous lives atop the mass of our effort and flesh.

       I like the theory that the Sphinx and Pyramids are Significantly older. Like the Sphinx is about 360,000 years old. It has to be at least 16,000 years older than previously thought because there is evidence of water erosion, the last even being 16,000 years prior. I like the theory that that was built by a previous civilization and then what we know as the Egyptians found the structures and adopted their art style thinking it was made by the gods. I can say its a joke to say it took only rope, pulleys and manpower to move those stones. The Great Pyramid matches almost perfectly with constellations, that math is near computer accurate. They left freaking pictures of them using lightbulbs. There is no soot in the pyramids so they didn't use torches and its too far for the mirror trick. The sphinx has a manmade square compartment underneath its right paw. Ancient Civilizations had advanced technology. Mainstream Archaeology puts its fingers in its ears to avoid looking into these inconsistencies. Our record is wrong. Our historical timeline needs to be rewritten.

       I think the thought originated somewhere around the life-long firm belief that the Pi ratio (3.1415....) is a finite, terminating number.  In Base 10, it seems to be infinite, but in other Bases, it's not.

       Just finished watching a few videos with potential theories relating to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first theory was that the Egyptians (and Incas) used a highly polished gold disks to create a lazer beam like cutting tool.

      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The second theory involved using the harmonic resonance from large tuning forks for cutting and drilling.

       &amp;nbsp;

       Unfortunately, neither video provided any actual demonstrations of the theorized techniques. Still an interesting watch and something to think about.

       I’m all for exploring other ideas when there is no obvious answer to a question but it seems so obvious that a craftsman with primitive tools could cut intricate designs and that a huge labor force could cut and move massive amounts of stone used in these types of projects.

       I don't know... maybe. Until I see someone produce a full scale replica using and proving their chosen methods I'm not convinced of anything and open to any ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think the argument raised about longevity and durability of those hand tools carving into granite and diorite is a valid one.
Maybe their metallurgists discovered the secretes to making stronger versions of copper and/or steel tools. I'm not a geologist, metallurgist, or engineer so I couldn't say one way or another with any certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way the shear size of these structures and precision of the joinery is an absolute art.

       I want to make it clear that I’m not an expert on any of this or the other topics you listed either as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I think that the primitive tools being
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       basic also helped the Egyptians. That sounds crazy to even type but I don’t think I find the correct way to explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The great thing about a copper or bronze stone saw is that it’s so damn simple. It’s literally just a flat bar. If one wears to the point that it is no longer usable you just get a new flat bar. Also the old tool can be melted down and remade into a new tool as well. Just add sand start sawing on some granite using the slave labor and soon you have two rocks and some sore backs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is super common to look back on ancient civilizations and think that they must have been not as smart as modern man and I am guilty of this from time to time.

       Would it be possible to do this by hand? I'm not talking about doing it by hand and having it done in 15 minutes. I'm talking dedicating one human to this job for a year, while they rotate a hand-drill (mandrill?) over and over again.

       Not actually joking. Their precision-cut, mortarless, polygonal stonework is about the only type of construction I can think of that would last thousands of years, through floods and earthquakes -- and I think earthquakes are about to get MUCH more common.

       like OP, the assumption is always they did it with ease, with the wave of a hand. how do we know how easy or hard it was? these things can be done with a lot of time and a lot of manpower. these humans were as smart as us, had more free time than us, and werent distracted by TV or smartphones.

       I believe the societies we refer to as ancient are relatively new, those societies flourished because they had tools and materials they should not have and the ancient people used the leftovers of this progenitor civilization.

       These "large symmetrical blocks" will be around far longer than smartphones and fighter jets of today. Also, many of these "large symmetrical blocks" weigh more than what the strongest cranes in the modern world can lift but the ancient people somehow lifted all of them and aligned them perfectly. You might want to do more research.

       It is not just those drill holes. They cut granite  to perfectly flat surfaces which can be done now with diamond bits. Check those black stones inside of the great pyramid. Weighing several tons piece and they all are smooth as a mirror.

       It's not difficult to polish granite with simple tools. It just takes time. The reason we use amchines today is not that we could not do these tasks without them but because it saves time.

       Depends on the shape and the tool. But we're talking copper hand tools, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       cutting- impractical nearing the point of impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       shaping- more practical but you'd need a new tool every dozen swings.
      </p>
      <p>
       polishing- not sure how this would go. i imagine it'd be like sanding a piece of wood with sawdust. so impractical.

      <p>
       "ok so why does time matter when they had billions of slaves?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, because slaves wouldn't have given a damn. You can't force people to paint a mona lisa. The pyramids are at every level a mastercraft, beyond the scope of detail possible with simple idiots forced to work with even simpler copper tools. And remember, the internal structure of the pyramids is rose granite. limestone is pretty workable, even with copper tools. Granite is fucking hard. But there's no difference between the workmanship. The granite is cut and shaped just as perfectly as the softer limestone.

       Check out Alterwelt’s posts on GLP. If they’re a LARP, they’re a damn good one. They talk about two past high civilizations, one ending maybe 150k years ago and one ending around 30,000 BC. They allegedly use something analogous to remote viewing to learn about the past. Fun read true or not.

       There is a lot of evidence that there were indeed advanced civilizations predating modern estimates. Lots of things have been found that throw a wrench on the current story. It's a fun rabbit hole to go into :)

       The Smithsonian actively works to keep this hidden from the masses. It is quite obvious there was a very advanced civilization spanning the globe. The now

       were part of this civilization.

       Exactly the same as a modern core drill hole. I've also seen pictures of ancient saw cuts that could have only been made by a large rotary cutter. To the people saying it's done by hand I would say, that making cuts like that would be incredibly time consuming. Some of these pics depict OVERcuts, where the tool has cut further into the stock than required. I can assure you this would not occur using hand tools, but very commonly occurs using power tools. Try it yourself by cutting halfway through a slab of hardwood with both a hand saw and a circular saw. See if you feel like cutting further than required even just doing that.

       Is it more believable that people cut further than they needed to in a piece of granite or is it more common that they had ancient power tools?

       Just a totally made up example but let’s say you are building a log cabin in 1900 and you have to cut down trees for the building supplies. If you cut down 50 trees with an ax and hand saw, but it turns out that you only needed 45 after it’s all said done people wouldn’t assume that it was impossible for you to have done that with a hand saw.

       Cutting down trees commonly used in log cabins takes minutes, even with an axe. For your analogy to be even remotely close, the builder would have to cut down hundreds of trees extra to compare to some of the over cutting I've seen in those pictures. It just doesn't make sense in any way, so yes, I find it easier to believe that power tools were used, and that we are told massive lies by historians.

       Relatively early bronze age technology is sufficient to utilize steam power. (Many of these civs were past stone age, and had plenty of examples of metal work.) I think a lot of people miss that fact. No, it's not going to be the kind of highly efficient high-pressure engine we associate with steam power because of the risk of it exploding. However the steam used is still sufficient to spin a flywheel via a reaction jet, or vibrate a resonant pipe, and either of those combined with an abrasive material will be plenty sufficient to cut a hole in a reasonable timeframe.

       I’m all for exploring other ideas when there is no obvious answer to a question but it seems so obvious that a craftsman with primitive tools could cut intricate designs and that a huge labor force could cut and move massive amounts of stone used in these types of projects.

       Semantics means the meaning of the things you're saying. The things you're saying are wrong, and you can't even describe to me how my counterexamples don't prove you wrong except yelling "semantics". We can move things 30 times as massive as the stuff you're talking about. We can do it with precision.

       The Serapeum at Saqqra you point out is large, but technically far less impressive (though also considerably less tacky) than any headstone you can buy for under $1000 today. Seriously, the carvings on it aren't impressive by today's standards. There's not even any shading in the pictures.
