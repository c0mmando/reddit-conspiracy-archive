       So a while back I asked you guys to provide some documentaries, podcasts or audiobooks pertaining to the Occult, which you all done a wonderful job of. (I just wish I could do as good a job when it comes to watching them all)
      </p>
      <p>
       Something I've noticed (maybe noticed isn't the right word, because what I've "noticed" mightn't actually be) is that the history and opinions of the Occult seem to be many and conflicting. In lieu of this I've found it very difficult to come across sources that I can feel as reliable or trustworthy. I no longer know what the fuck I'm looking for, so I just want to ask a few questions I hope you guys can help me with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclosure: I'm not explicitly religious. I don't even know if the questions I ask make sense.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         What are some primary sources pertaining to the Occult or esoterisicsm?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Where can I find an honest history of esoteric practices? Even, where can I find an honest history of the Occult? (Worldwide, not just Western)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Does Hermeticism pertain to Satanism or Christianity? Does it transcend them?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Does yoga pertain to magick or the Occult? Where should I start if I want to practice yoga to expand my consciousness? Can that be done?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is sacred geometry important or relevant to all of this? Should I brush up on my maths skills?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Does anyone have a guide that one can read regarding achieving a higher state of consciousness? Not a shit one please. Something human and generous, but straight and honest.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I implore you to provide sources for you claims and comments. If those sources could be primary sources that would be wonderful too

       Well, this subject is notoriously difficult to get a grasp on.After all the occult refers to
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult">
        hidden knowledge.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I understand, occultism can be both good (right hand path) and evil (left hand path). It’s not
       <em>
        inherently
       </em>
       bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I can understand, focused human will, intent, and energy can change reality. That’s why the elite do massive rituals at at
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">
        Bohemian Grove...
       </a>
       they rituals are more effective in large groups. The more clever, elaborate and multilayered rituals seem to be preferred. I’d suggest reading Michael Hoffman’s “secret societies and psychological warfare.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Although often mocked, yes numerology/gematria seems important. It may have originated in the Kabbalah.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe occultists are somehow manipulating natural law, the law of attraction, karma, etc but the road to understanding is difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been listening to a lot of
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=odw6q4fcORE">
        Mark Passio
       </a>
       lectures lately... I feel he’s clued in.

       The grove rituals are just like a beginning to boy scout camp fire and skit night.  It is a ritual to begin the celebration.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the grove, it is called the 'cremation of care', which only means they are burning away their worldly worries so they can party in the woods for a few days.

       You're absolutely right about it referring to hidden knowledge and I suppose that's the crux. Nonetheless I feel as though it can be attained.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as you understand Occultism isn't linked with either God or Satan, good or bad, left or right etc. but that's it's 'moral direction' is in the hands of he/she who wills it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll definitely look up a bit about numerology, gematria and the Kabbalah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear though, I'm less inretested in how the elite section of society is using occult teachings (unless it reveals something fundamental about the Occult) and I'm more interested in what those teachings are. I'm becoming more and more convinced that adhering to a strict ritualistic practice isn't hugely important, but rather the schemas of the ritual is what helps to determine it's effectiveness. I also believe the publicity of the ritual, or the publicity of an effective act, helps... something. But I haven't a clue what it helps.

       If you REALLY want to read about Qaballah, there is a book called
       <em>
        The Chicken Qaballah
       </em>
       written by Lon Milo DuQuette where he presents Qaballah in a somewhat dry comedy that will help you to better grasp the difficult fundamentals.  Be prepared though, it is by no means an easy study.

       Crowley has a lot of comedy out there. He wrote under several pseudonyms. I am not sure about others aside from DuQuette. Most esoteric scholars take themselves too seriously, as their ego usually overshadows their ability to merely give you lighthearted parable.

      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of, yeah... but I also feel you’re playing with powerful forces and must be honest with  yourself about it. It’s funny, I never believed in any of this stuff 2 years ago. I started researching it because it seemed clear to me the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_secret_societies_in_North_America">
        elite
       </a>
       took it seriously. Why would stiff, shrewd, educated politicians dance around burning effigies, masturbate in coffins, kiss skulls, etc? There’s a number of witty retorts I’m setting myself up for there, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now on to complexity of rituals... purely hypothetical now, just theorizing... but if
       <em>
        focus, will, and intent
       </em>
       are important to the working, wouldn’t it be proper if:
      </p>
      <p>
       Your ritual was timed according to a
       <a href="http://www.globaltruth.net/list-of-satanic-sacrificial-dayswhich-is-accurate/">
        relevant date?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And a corresponding celestial event, like an eclipse
      </p>
      <p>
       Or a set time reflecting gematria
      </p>
      <p>
       Etc etc- it seems the more interesting rituals are planned down to the nth degree, likely to focus intent... or something. Many may mock this statement, but a lot of the numbers/symbology associated with 9/11 refer to Aleister Crowley’s work, also freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe you must find your own path, and many are quite acceptable- The aforementioned Aleister C. advocated joining as many occult orders as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This mindset is reflected in the occult cult film
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holy_Mountain_(1973_film">
        The Holy Mountain
       </a>
       ), which really opened my eyes to some of these concepts. Watch it.

       So did your belief come from the fact that there were so many occult references in the wider world pertaining to the elite, that there must be some truth to it? That would be a part of the reason for my interest in it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I had the wit in me to retort as you expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of rituals with focus, will and intent, have you ever heard of Clif High? He has a black-box algorithm based off of predictive linguistics. He basically mines words across the internet and tries to interpret the data sets to give predictions about the future. He publishes his interpretations too. It's relatively complex and artificial (seeing as he uses a bot to mine the data), but could that be considered a sort of ritual (creating algorithm; implementing it though bot; running bot; interpreting results/data sets; publishing them)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe you have to find your own path. I think asking the advice of others is part of mine. I've never been shy to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thank you very fucking much. I've been meaning to watch it. I seen El Topo when I was incredibly high. Think I need to rewatch that too.

       Yes, exactly. They must be attuned to something, IMO.

       I have not heard of Clif Hugh but any links you may share would be appreciated. Yes I think technology and the occult intertwine. Gnostic Media has a fascinating series on Burning man on YT.

       BM is a highly occult event, based on ancient pagan rituals. Remember the Wicker Man movies? There were also dark events happening on British islands that echoed those films.

       The 1930’s movie Metroplois predicted this left hand path/tech angle- notice the robot rises in front ont of an inverted pentagram. Here’s a good article on it:

       Do you have a Telegram account? It's a messaging app. If you get that and then add me I can send you on a bunch of Clif High reports. I'll see if I can send them through my computer to here when I get home though for everyone to read them. If anyone else wants them through Telegram then just add me: @overttherainbow
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen the Wicker Man. I tried to watch Metropolis, but I was really high and it was more of a commitment than I realised. I'm sure when I brush up on my symbology all of these films will bear greater fruit to me. Maybe it's more apt to say that I'll be able to reach them, having grown to a new height in my personal development.

         Look at the bibliography for The Secret Teachings of All Ages.  That will keep you busy for a while.
Much of the occult was mouth to ear for hundreds of years after the dark ages.  Occult writing is actually a very new thing, relative to the total time it's been around.  There is no one 'the occult'.  Occultism is a word that is used to describe an incredibly broad range of topics.  For instance, art is occult.  Music is magick because we can use it to change emotion and attempt to control outcomes by utilizing it as a tool.  Perhaps you should check out Thr Greater and Lesser Keys of Solomon.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Again, from digging.  There are so many orders, so many brotherhoods, so many covens, etc. that all have their own practices and sects.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hermeticism is not exclusive to any one set of ideals.  This is a hard question for many to answer because their religious subjectivity prohibits them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. Anyone from Buddhists to Crowley can supply you with information, but the best way is to find an instructor.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No need to brush up on math.  Mathematics and geometry used to be reserved for the priesthood, as was reading and writing.  Multi-layered wisdom and knowledge can be engrained within geometry.  All is number.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no 'straight and honest' way to achieve a higher form of consciousness.  The easiest way to go about that [there is no real easy way] would be to live as the Christ lived [not preaching religion].  Keep yourself good hearted and pure, loving, forgiving, honest, critical, truthful, kind, introspective, etc. 
This is not easily attained, as we men are imperfect.  It is important that we be humble

         I'll definitely go over the bibliography of Secret Teachings of All Ages and The Lesser Keys of Solomon. I should have expected that a lot of it was passed down through oral tradition. Nonetheless, there must be something, some one thing (I feel), that every occult tradition touches on. That's what I want to study. I don't want to use a loaded term like consciousness, but...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yeah, I kinda knew this before I asked, but was hoping there might be some form of guidance. I suppose in the nature of realising Will, it's better that I go through the ritual of learning with focus and intent.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I really don't know what I meant by this question. I suppose I was more directly trying to ask who am I most likely to offend by adopting the teachings found in the Occult. Is Hermeticism a "master key" (as it's often touted) to achieving a higher consciousness? Do the teachings espoused suggest a life of higher consciousness?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How would I find an instructor? Would any yoga instructor be okay? Is any form of yoga okay? Would the whole point just be focusing your mental energy? I think I need a guide to what a suggested mindset for the budding yogi should be.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I definitely need to look more into this.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That was thoughtful and inspiring.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Anything else you can turn me to in my quest for peace and harmony would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

       What is it, specifically, that you are interested in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to dictate to you, but you need to pick one thing in which to invest your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for that is, occultism is such a mixed bag that, as you dive in, you will go on tangent after tangent after tangent, retaining very little.  Your focus on one point at a time is extremely imperative if you choose to go down that rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is one direction in which I can specifically point you, please let me know and I would be happy to help you out.  But I would be doing you a disservice by simply listing several sources, as you'd never possibly retain it all at once.

       Knowledge, light and expansion of my mine would aptly describe the direction I want to go in. I'd like to be able to empathise better. I'd like to have a sharper imagination. I'd like to be able to maintain an inner peace when things go awry around me.

       I'd like to have an OBE.

       Knowing what I want to know should be an easier question to answer than I'm making it.

       I don't think I'm any sort of prophet or messiah, but as you said you can't go wrong trying to live a good life as they did. That's something I shall try to aspire to.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm ever able to articulate better what it is I'm after then I'll be sure to return and share it with you. I think I'm going to start with yoga. Even that's broad as beans.

       Go even more specific. 'Knowledge' and 'light' are far too broad. I might as well refer you to Tony Robbins for that.  Think narrow.  Targeted.  Pick one specific thing so I can help guide you.  What speaks to you?

       So for knowledge: I'd like knowledge of what journey we go on after life as we know it. I think I'd also like to be able to astral project, but is that a real thing? Can you speak from experience if it can be done?

       Astral projection is a very advanced form of meditation.  I have never tried, nor have I read anyone credible who has.

       Let me give you some topics relating to the occult, maybe that would be helpful.

       Astrology, tarot, qaballah, tantra, yoga, magick, witchcraft...
      </p>

       These are all topics that intertwine themselves.  Your requests seem to be seeking a deeper meaning witnin yourself, correct?

       The Holy Bible is also high on my list - not for a religious reason, but because much of what you'll find in the occult references the bible in different ways and it will both help you as a research tool and an outlet for spiritual comfort if you feel distressed.  Tread lightly with occultism, this is the only time I will give you this fair warning.

       If your heart truly desires wisdom, I advise you to start paying attention to your perception, the situations that correspond to recent thoughts and begin analysing yourself. 
Judge ones own character unbiasedly and strive towards service to others.

       Oddly enough, my touchstone for parsing occult is JRR Tolkien.
      </p>
      <p>
       He clearly differentiated between the forces of good and the forces for evil. The determining factor for good was always a concern for the "little people" of the world, and self-sacrifice to defend them from those who would use them as slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil powers, on the other hand, operate always on their own behalf. They make alliances selfishly, and practice deceit. They trust no-one because they know themselves to be untrustworthy.

       Power for good or power for your own ends. You must choose.

       Right, that group deserves more study. Tolkien was a philosopher and a theologian as much as he was a writer. He believed the true essence of religion is mythic. I think in many ways he sought to found some solid neo-mystical religion by re-connecting two lost worlds: the Druidic celtic and the Christian medieval.

       Study some Rudolf Steiner (read his 5 main books) and it will clear up all of your questions...all of them!
       <a href="https://www.rsarchive.org/Books/">
        https://www.rsarchive.org/Books/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone else listed here are mainly researchers who are focused on spiritual materialism and old outdated traditions like Kabbalah or Yoga (important for historical background of magick but not effective for understanding current black magick or helping you achieve a higher consciousness).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have done a lot of research and Steiner is legit. That is why no one knows about him! That is why Crowley gets front page time and is a household name and Steiner is unknown, because Crowley is not legit and the anti-anthroposophy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also read Robert Mason's Advent of Ahriman. (

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is talking about Ahriman yet we are in his clutches at this moment. Reddit is Ahirmanic because it relies on words and the confusion of words to spread disinfo and hate. Lucifer plays an important role but Ahriman is the devil of our time.

       I think these are extremely important to know if you are studying the so called "occult".

       Why is yoga and the Kabbalah old and outdated? I would have intuited that these systems (or whatever the nomenclature might be: please enlighten me if you know it) never go out of date.

       I am always keen to help people out with understanding the "occult" or hidden spiritual knowledge. I am glad you are interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yoga is really old and designed for when our consciousness and bodies were different. There are new and better types of yoga (himalayan yoga for example) that have tried to adapt to the new times and probably have succeeded to a large extent, but the fact of the matter is that we have changed (body, spirit, soul) and so our engagement with the "gods" need to change as well. Steiner addresses this and acknowledges that the world religions play an important role in different times of human development...so Kabbalism, which was  old and corrupt at the time Christ was crucified, was the "occult" knowledge of the time but has grown old and more irrelevant. Kabbalism has played a great role in European magick but we must update to reflect the new consciousness and the times we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steiner talks about this at great length.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a fan of Alan Moore (Promethea, Watchmen) I have been fully immersed in kabbalism but when I tried to find Steiner mentioning this subject at all in his lifetime I was hard pressed to find anything...so why would someone like Steiner avoid this topic? Because it wasn't relevant compared with the new shit he was offering his community.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is white magick and black magick it what it is depends on how it is used and for what purposes. The white magick mantra is two steps forward in moral/ethical development for each one step forward in occult/mystery knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for myself I believe that I need to raise my consciousness so that I can build a bridge to the spirit world, to the world of the so called dead, to the world of the nature spirits, and in doing so I have to ask myself, does the knowledge/study/reflection on the Mystery of Golgotha do anything to help me achieve that goal? The answer is yes, it does, and Steiner elucidates this in his lectures. What alot of anthropsophists call themselves are new Gnostics or Christologists but there really isn't a label religiously speaking that I would attach myself to, especially in today's times where christians are being openly derided and mocked, and yet Judaism, which is extremely outdated, is forbidden from criticism.

       All the occult is, is pre scientific magical thinking , trying to manipulate nature and chemistry like boiling urine down to its potassium and finding evidence of a soul in its  magical flammable chemical properties and colors.
 The real magic is the SUCSESS of  non magical  science that built real flying machines and real cell phones....the stuff that the best occultist could only dream of.

       I suppose I'm not look g for empirical evidence of the laws that currently govern our universe. Not to mention I've become a little disenchanted with the business of science and the biases that riddle the intent and execution of many publications.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not disputing that much of the knowledge we've accrued through the method of science can't be applied or isn't useful, but the method we have is just the best we can come up with. To think it's the ultimate model or method for accruing knowledge might be a bit of a jump. In fact, science necessarily assumes that it doesn't know everything, perhaps even that it can't know everything.
      </p>

       I would be interested to know if there have been studies on the physical or neurochemical effects of taking part in certain rituals, going through bouts of meditation or competently performing yoga.

       "Soft" sciences like sociology or psychology, anthropology  and humanities etc are subject to bias because we cannot quantify values like the hard sciences can, so its important to realize the cultural difference and animosity between the two groups. Science is always an approximation waiting for more accurate measurements on something like the speed of light, but that does not  mean it falsifies the known speed of light, it means we are building more accurate measuring tools.
       <br/>
       Its the  outrageous  success of science, its Predictive Powers that gives us certainty that its a far better method of  aquiring knowledge than medieval rituals trying to manipulate and influence the motions of things when those motions were later discovered to be predictable and mechanical.  No Im not a researcher, Im a contrarian anti metaphysical non dualistic empirical Buddhist. Yes brain scans show difference in brain functions by meditating, but also the same can be said  for anyone who exercises the mind. Even just a college degree or musician will show the same change in brain function.

       ???  Science methods are a valid and reliable system of understanding Reality  because it  simply WORKS , is a million times more productive than occult spells, and has undeniable proven Predictive Powers that no Aristotelian  occultist has ever had, period.

       Sikhism might interest you. Basically, hell is right here on Earth and we are trapped in a cycle of birth and re-birth until we 'shatter the veil of falsehood', and reunite with God (ending the reincarnation cycle). God is trying to break us out of prison, but we are continuously distracted by the 5 thieves kaam (lust), krodh (rage), lobh (greed), moh (attachment) and ahankar (conceit). It is the primary aim of the practicing Sikh to subdue these five inner vices and render them inactive. The actions of one's mind should be above, beyond and without interference from these five inner evils.
      </p>

       It's an interesting subject, as the historical text even mentions alternate universes among universes at a time where the idea wasn't entertained...

       Also, the Tibetan Book of the Dead is a good read.

       Your advice and direction has been invaluable so far. I will most definitely contact you after any serious developments. No need to feel as though you have to reply to me. As I said, your generous words are more than enough.
