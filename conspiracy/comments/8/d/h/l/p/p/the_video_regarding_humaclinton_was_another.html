        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It was actually all over Voat Pizzagate starting a few weeks back. That whole sub-voat has been taken over by shills, and they reinforce the Pro-Trump cheerleading and worship of &quot;Q&quot; and the relevance of &quot;The Storm&quot; and all that other goofy hopium shit. The people who created these psyops <em>really</em> enforce them online on the discussion forums where conspiracy culture congregates.  </p>

<p>Whats the angle here? Obviously I think we know they use Q to distract and inject false hope into people, to string them along, but there is also this &quot;alt-right&quot; angle to it, promoting support of the POTUS and his policies. </p>

<p>I feel like they are using Q to subvert the Pizzagate.Pedogate investigation, by leading on the researchers and sending down a myriad of false rabbit hole, and inundating them with false predictions that never come true, to demoralize them. </p>

<p>The community needs to divorce itself entirely from these psyops and get back to exposing the crimes of TPTB together on our own, not relying on some unverifiable anonymous user, who is likely a project of intelligence agencies. </p>

Whenever we need to lean on someone else (Qanon, FBIanon, Guccifer, Dotcom) to inform us about the next conspiracy tidbit or rabbit hole...we&#39;re doing it wrong. We&#39;re doing it way wrong. They found a way to extract your energy. You should be using your energy for what suits you best.

<p>I always assume others have like me, experienced 30 years of right wing smears on the Clintons and watched nothing come from any of it ever beyond the blowjob.

    <div class="md"><p>I responded to the right comment.  You mentioned smears against the Clintons and how none of them were proven or whatever.  I just pointing out that I lost respect for the Clintons long before any recent years.  I think it is inexcusable to have people like Robert Byrd and William J Fulbright as friends and mentors.  Fulbright should not have a college of science named after him in Arkansas or any scholarship fund either.  Beautiful eulogies should not have been delivered by the Clintons or any other democrat.  They should never have been part of the Democratic party and they certainly should not have been collecting tax payer money as federal or state employees.  Like I said, some things should not be forgiven and they certainly should not be forgotten.  The repercussions of the actions of people like those two are still being felt today.  Our leaders should not be calling them mentors.  In it really inexcusable and I am justified in thinking so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I form my opinions of people based on a comparison of their words to their actions. Go figure, I&#39;m not all too fond of many in Washington, regardless of where they hang their hat. I do however try my best to base those opinions on the verifiable. I dislike Hilary for her hypocritical views on equality for women and for her war mongering most of all. She spoke of Libya and Syria as if they were inevitable scenarios. I do however have a strange respect for her openness regarding her opinions on the middle east; she didn&#39;t hide behind rhetoric in this instance like many other have. </p>

<p>The shifting &quot;collectively understood&quot; definitions of left, right, democrat, republican, liberal and conservative have left me in a position of having no idea which party best fits my personal system of ideals. All in all, I think we could stand to benefit from dismissing the vast majority of the familiar faces on capitol hill. </p>

<p>And now we&#39;re far from the point of the original comment, which was that these statements regarding this alleged video are nothing new. As a victim of abuse, I&#39;ve got something of a stake in wanting abusers to be brought to justice. There were over 100 victims in the case in which I testified.  It&#39;s more common than most believe, and often times it&#39;s a crime that turns the abused into an abuser themselves. It&#39;s truly despicable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been rumors of a compromising video featuring Hillary ever since the fall of 2016 when it was said to be part of an &quot;insurance&quot; discovered on Anthony Weiner&#39;s computer. That rumor did not come from Q anon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The great thing about VOAT and the Chans is that it is completely decentralised and there is no single uniting figure that is then subverted and/or replaced as a controlled opposition or false figurehead.  The Qanon thing is potentially an attempt to get round this.</p>

<p>We should be very, very skeptical of the source that claims to be Q, and all his/her information should be regarded as potentially compromised disinformation.  The same as any other source.  AS OP says, lets go back to methodically and comprehensively building a picture of the elites.  We have rattled them and they have awoken to our threat (just in time too); and hence the shilling, D&amp;C and attempts to leverage fracture points on the &quot;alt-right&quot; in general have been intensified to almost incredible levels.  This is a psychological, memetic, and spiritual war we are waging and we are winning; but we have to remain vigilant.</p>
