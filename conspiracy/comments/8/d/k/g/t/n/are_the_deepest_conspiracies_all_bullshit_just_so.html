    <div class="md"><p>What you said is like conspiracy theory 101. Most of us know these things, we just dive deeper and try to find out who is actually behind it.

<p>Those aren&#39;t even that big of conspiracies, and are mainly dis/misinfo, if you ask me.  I think you may be confusing and conflating much here. I mean, what if I told you that Reptillian is actually a metaphor? </p>

<p>How so? You&#39;re being pretty condescending and assuming the general conspiracy community actually believes in what you are stating. </p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s debatable. I&#39;ve been at this for a long time. Maybe the n00bs do, but many of us are way past that.</p>

<p>I mean, that&#39;s not where it started for me. I started in the mundane, and fell deeper down the rabbit hole. And while I may not believe the Earth is flat, or in Reptilians, or that all Jews are evil, I <em>do</em> believe shit that many people look at me like I&#39;m insane for, if I choose to tell them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, but let me pose a question:</p>

<p>Big or small, what are you/we going to do about it? &quot;Inform the masses&quot; you may say, but ultimately, that just equates to jumping on reddit and shouting into the echo chamber. What if the most effective conspiracy is that all of this shit is mentally toxic, distracting, and serves as a way to keep people that pay attention from actually doing anything as we sit and wait for another morsel of outrage?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair points.  There&#39;s definitely boatloads of psyops out there. I think the tricky part is figuring out where the hell to draw the line.  It&#39;s a big, fuzzy, squirrely line that you have to update constantly with your own best judgment.   And that is TOUGH.</p>

<p>A good example for me is the secret space program / UFO&#39;s /  &quot;NASA lies.&quot;  Do I believe some sort of secret space program/s exist? Yeah, I would be more surprised if they don&#39;t, but I don&#39;t know the level of their capabilities, and I long ago ran out of patience with he likes of Steven M. Greer and the &quot;breakaway civilization!!&quot; lady (what&#39;s her name?) let alone the Goode/Wilcock types.  But how much are they limited hangouts versus fanciful bullshit versus simple hucksters trying to make a living?  And if they&#39;re not giving it to us straight what are the ACTUAL capabilities of such an SSP?  Alien tech, Paperclip Nazi tech, ancient human tech, mole people tech, or just the result of the deep state brain-draining away all the best scientists for generations on end?  The click bait bullshit hurricane does not contain the reality.</p>
