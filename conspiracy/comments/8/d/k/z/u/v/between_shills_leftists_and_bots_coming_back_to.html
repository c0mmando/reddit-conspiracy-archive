       ROFL too much to count considering over a million posts, thousands of notables, and over a thousand Q posts, but to shut you up, here's the biggest one (imo): Q dropped peace with NK months before the news came out.

       This happens every two years with NK whenever they test their nukes. It's very easy to predict that which runs like clockwork, and if that's the best thing you've got from Q after all of this time, then you've actually just pushed me off of the Q fence.

       This whole post also stinks of trying to split this community (again). Why can't we have discussions here as well as on your Q based sub?

       A thousand posts, and a million discussing them, and that's the biggest -- a vague question that's completely open to interpretation, and doesn't even state what you claim it does?

       Let's be real, this sub is largely disinfo filled joke conspiracies and frankly stupid people. Not trying to be rude but it's pretty apparent whenever I get curious and come back to this sub.

       Just look at
       <a href="/r/greatawakening">
        /r/greatawakening

       - made like 2 months ago and has WAY better user participation than this sub's had in probably its entire existence. Just checked and 1,700 USERS, that's actually insane. No coincidences, real truth seekers will inevitably find the place with the best intel and it's for damn sure ain't here.

       You're right, there is valuable and accurate info here. It's like a normie's introduction to conspiracy theories, and only a small, skewed view into the bigger picture.

       and the Q-research board (this is the main one to use) don't have the full picture either (yet) but give the best view available for the public. On top of that, it's a lot quicker than reddit, is an actual forum, threads are easy to follow, and general consensuses can be gleamed.

       r/conspiracy is

       That seems like a gathering of the last of the dreamers waiting for Trump to become something he never claimed to be while he fills the swamp with the worst kinds of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compelling stealth battle between "good and evil" constantly alluded to by "Q" can't be the only good thing about Trump's presidency because it is just as likely to be a psychological operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is surrounding himself with scum.
Wishful thinking can become delusional after a time.

       Always makes me laugh when people claim Trump's surrounding himself with "the swamp," what an extremely poor argument. It's like when people claim his cabinet's filled with "evil bankers" as if bankers, or anyone for that matter, is implicitly evil - just the most naive POV you could have in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know people's true intentions, whether they're actually "good" or "bad" or if Trump is keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. How many people has POTUS brought on? And fired?
      </p>
      <p>
       One example: McMaster. On the surface, he's doing his job, seems okay with Trump. In the end, he got the boot, and now his father's dead under investigation of a "suspicious death."
      </p>
      <p>
       The RESULTS speak for themselves, just like election night where WE were right and YOU were wrong. The only delusional thinking is thinking there aren't good people in this world and that good people can't AFFECT the world.

       Then what is the swamp? I have a feeling if Hillary had won and started bringing in bankers you'd sing a different tune.

Very cool, this isn't bullying at all, calling people loner idiots. Very cool, very noble, you didn't completely discredit yourself at all. It's truly hilarious getting insulted by people like you, it's like a billionaire president getting insulted by a soyboy basement dweller, why the fuck would I care?

       Look, I know you're not very bright, your life is in shambles and you have to bring down other people to feel better about yourself, but please, I'm worried about you. Please seek a psychiatrist, maybe take some meds, you seem a bit bi-polar and out of sorts with your thoughts, perhaps schizophrenic and a bit mentally retarded. Don't kill yourself, I know that thought runs through your head daily, but you are too valuable to...someone to end your life. I KNOW you haven't showered today or perhaps in the last week so please do that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know you're the type that reminds me why I don't come here anymore. Literally nothing positive comes from you people, nothing gained, only time lost talking to a literal mongoloid. Wouldn't surprise me if you're a full-time 10-hour Shareblue employee honestly.

       Does one keep repeating the phrases "Trust the plan." "Trust Q." "It's working." "Trust in our POTUS, he was put in place by God" etc as doing so? That's quite literally what is repeated in some of the comment sections on YT, and elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then people say they "feel better" the moment they hear something that supports the idea, and some suddenly "owes" the POTUS an apology for being in doubt and critical earlier (being critical should be encouraged at all times, but hey.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are people that will just bebrate their fellow countrymen and call them "unpatriotic", for not blindly believing in this narrative that is pushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does a person's IQ increase significantly once you delve into this further and decide to blindly believe it?

       Now that's funny. It's funny 'cause it's true! The single digit IQ part I mean.
Well, go ahead pee wee, knock yourself out&gt; Do you really imagine (even in your extremely disassociated with reality state), that anyone care at all in any way in the least?
Why you would want to frame yourself as an imbecile teen who has already lost it and believe the dumbest damn stuff there is, is beyond me!
