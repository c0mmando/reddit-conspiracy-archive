Just checked and 1,700 USERS, that&#39;s actually insane. No coincidences, real truth seekers will inevitably find the place with the best intel and it&#39;s for damn sure ain&#39;t here.</p>

Then again, maybe I don&#39;t understand the AI that darpa has plauged this internet with.....</p>

<p>Either way, I have learn lots here in my 2 years from this sub, and I am thankful for that, there is definitely usefull information here.....</p>

<p><a href="/r/greatawakening">/r/greatawakening</a> and the Q-research board (this is the main one to use) don&#39;t have the full picture either (yet) but give the best view available for the public. On top of that, it&#39;s a lot quicker than reddit, is an actual forum, threads are easy to follow, and general consensuses can be gleamed.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy is <em>okay</em> but in terms of current events, it doesn&#39;t come close to the Q-boards. </p>

<p>That seems like a gathering of the last of the dreamers waiting for Trump to become something he never claimed to be while he fills the swamp with the worst kinds of shit. </p>

<p>The compelling stealth battle between &quot;good and evil&quot; constantly alluded to by &quot;Q&quot; can&#39;t be the only good thing about Trump&#39;s presidency because it is just as likely to be a psychological operation. </p>

<p>Trump is surrounding himself with scum.

    <div class="md"><p>Always makes me laugh when people claim Trump&#39;s surrounding himself with &quot;the swamp,&quot; what an extremely poor argument.

<p>You don&#39;t know people&#39;s true intentions, whether they&#39;re actually &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; or if Trump is keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. How many people has POTUS brought on? And fired?</p>

<p>One example: McMaster. On the surface, he&#39;s doing his job, seems okay with Trump. In the end, he got the boot, and now his father&#39;s dead under investigation of a &quot;suspicious death.&quot; </p>

<p>The RESULTS speak for themselves, just like election night where WE were right and YOU were wrong. The only delusional thinking is thinking there aren&#39;t good people in this world and that good people can&#39;t AFFECT the world. </p>

<p>Then what is the swamp? I have a feeling if Hillary had won and started bringing in bankers you&#39;d sing a different tune.</p>

How can you actually be this stupid? People participate in the Q-boards because the info&#39;s been proven legit by THE most skeptical community on the internet.</p>

<p>You sound like you&#39;re in a seriously troubling spot right now. Get your life together. Please.
Your incredibly neurotic approach tells me you&#39;re projecting extremely hard so I&#39;ll diagnose you on the spot, free of charge. </p>

<p>Look, I know you&#39;re not very bright, your life is in shambles and you have to bring down other people to feel better about yourself, but please, I&#39;m worried about you. Please seek a psychiatrist, maybe take some meds, you seem a bit bi-polar and out of sorts with your thoughts, perhaps schizophrenic and a bit mentally retarded. Don&#39;t kill yourself, I know that thought runs through your head daily, but you are too valuable to...someone to end your life. I KNOW you haven&#39;t showered today or perhaps in the last week so please do that as well.</p>

<p>You know you&#39;re the type that reminds me why I don&#39;t come here anymore. Literally nothing positive comes from you people, nothing gained, only time lost talking to a literal mongoloid. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if you&#39;re a full-time 10-hour Shareblue employee honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does one keep repeating the phrases &quot;Trust the plan.&quot; &quot;Trust Q.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s working.&quot; &quot;Trust in our POTUS, he was put in place by God&quot; etc as doing so? That&#39;s quite literally what is repeated in some of the comment sections on YT, and elsewhere. </p>

<p>Then people say they &quot;feel better&quot; the moment they hear something that supports the idea, and some suddenly &quot;owes&quot; the POTUS an apology for being in doubt and critical earlier (being critical should be encouraged at all times, but hey.)</p>

<p>Then there are people that will just bebrate their fellow countrymen and call them &quot;unpatriotic&quot;, for not blindly believing in this narrative that is pushed.</p>

<p>Does a person&#39;s IQ increase significantly once you delve into this further and decide to blindly believe it?</p>

Well, go ahead pee wee, knock yourself out&gt; Do you really imagine (even in your extremely disassociated with reality state), that anyone care at all in any way in the least?
Why you would want to frame yourself as an imbecile teen who has already lost it and believe the dumbest damn stuff there is, is beyond me!
Good luck on your career as a nut!</p>
