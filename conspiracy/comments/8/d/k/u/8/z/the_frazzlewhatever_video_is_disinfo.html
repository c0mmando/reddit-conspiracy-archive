If you can somehow find a video, if it even exists which is one hell of a stretch, it will be from a source that either put it there to fuck you, or is already known about and monitored by said source. The whole thing is sensationlistic as fuck, and validates/stimulates a lot of people&#39;s confirmation biases, and should be so easy to see through. There have been posts all day here trying to have it validated, but do you really think someone here is going to post a link or something? Come on people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the way, I&#39;m so glad you in particular responded. I&#39;ll be honest, I respect the hell out of your intellect. Think about this though, you&#39;re incredibly well read, smart as all fuck, and everyone who knows you here can attest to that... but what are you really doing with it? Yeah you have a cabin in Alaska or something like that, and while that sounds awesome, if you care as much as you let on, why wouldn&#39;t you Snowden-up and apply any of that towards making anything better on the whole? Not trying to be an asshole, but for someone so &quot;in the know&quot;, why spend so much time here and not making tangible differences in the world as you see it? Again, I mean no disrespect, but I feel as vocal as you are, it kinda begs the question, no?</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m seeking to find an island and create my own country ;). After all the rabbit holes, and what I&#39;ve learned (and know), that is the only viable option/solution, imo.  Takes time and lots of self educating, though (try self teaching International Law - holy shit). In the mean time, I&#39;m here to learn and discuss with others. </p>

<p>I believe my Soul Being chose to be here for a purpose, and I believe I&#39;m honoring it, by engaging  with others (and inspiring), even it&#39;s just one other Soul Being. Totally worth it, imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My compliments(ish) were sincere, I truly admire your depth of knowledge and passion for uncovering information about things that most people don&#39;t even think about. I do question your certainty about many thing also though, as you tend to present information as gospel often, and I feel that can be just as harmful as propaganda to people who want to know more, but have their curiosity coopted by those who say they have answers. For what it&#39;s worth, I think you give people great things to think about, however it seems like you have your mind made up about some things that are fantastically unknowable. I also think starting your own nation is unrealistic as it is naive. Is self-teaching international law going to keep you from being obliterated by any forces (not necessarily US) that have no respect for such a thing? I like you man, I really do. Feel free to PM me if you can help me understand where you&#39;re coming from.</p>
