       OK so there is rumored to be a video on the dark web that shows Hillary Clinton and her buddy Huma Carving the face off a little girl and wearing it to scare the girl before she is bleed out in a sacrafice. It seems no one can find this or has seen it! If it is real can someone put in a onion link to where it is or confirm if it is real. Otherwise we need to be questioning the people that are saying it is out and released. ( This was rumored to be on Anthony Wieners laptop that was seized by NYPD)

       If the video existed you would be reading headlines about it.

      <p>
       It's a hoax started based off a fake Hillary sex video the Russians made during the election now it is being propagated here and elsewhere to generate "legitimate interest" which is enough to hook some gullable fish.

       It's not that the Clintons aren't held accountable. The thing with them is they make it impossible for themselves to be prosecuted because they're so good at being criminals
       <em>
        legally
       </em>
       . They were investigated for years but are so good at covering their ass nothing ever comes of it. Those are the most dangerous criminals.

       oh i agree with that last part wholeheartedly, i was on mIRC back in the nineties.. faces of death level shit. 
 to your question, i havent actually fully researched this, the video only "leaked" a few days ago, and i have been working. i am contemplating dipping beneath the surface again, yet how to bring it to light, without penalty, if i do?

      <p>
       This is not true. I think a video like this probably does exist somewhere in the world, but if it leaked, it wouldn't be covered correctly by the corporate media. Look at how they handled the Wikileaks release of DNC emails, that's what their reporting on this would look like. Russia would be blamed for hacking it, and the headlines would be screaming for retaliation at Russia while ignoring the content they're alleged to have hacked. Headlines would be something like "Russia releases fake snuff video, Trump must bomb Moscow."

       Half of the DNC resigned because of Wikileaks.

       The MSM covered the email controversy extensively.

       If a video like this existed (which it doesn't) it would be headline news for weeks but it won't be because this is a hoax.

       not really. this is all connected. how someone thinks about the russian narrative directly factors into the amount of credence I PERSONALLY give to that person's opinion. About your not being a dip shit, that we also disagree on.

       watch fatherhood... compare with john podesta's voice... if you doubt the possibility of his affiliates in participating in similar behavior, go on tor. look at ALL of the fappening pictures, then come back and tell me the elite, and their celebrity puppets don't like kids... also, if you still doubt worldwide trafficking, i would look into the huma emails concerning american pools, inc.

       The thing is though bullshit spread around as truth like this stupid Clinton "snuffleupagus film" doesn't help in the battle against pedophilia.

       Are powerful people into little kids sexually? You bet your ass they are. And you know what's a good way to get the population to believe that those allegations aren't legit? Spreading around easily debunked bullshit and muddying the waters.

       It really is though, yournewswire or the chans aren't going to be the ones that bring down a network of powerful evil that goes back thousands of years. All of that stuff is "leaked" onto the net for a reason. Ask half the people out there what they think of Pizzagate. It's a joke because of all the easily debunked shit posting that goes on. Aspects of it were true at first but then they add all the bullshit to muddy the waters. Pizzagate stemmed from truth for a reason.

       yes, that govts around the world use children to get blackmail to maintain their agenda. idc what we call it. these familial ties have occult origins, skull n bones, the daughters of demeter... some of them hold tight to the kabbalah, a book whose entities are not all may poles and orgies... sacrifice, debauchery, and terrible acts are commendable in the eyes of some of these beings. it is not too far out for me to believe that someone who understands jokes about sacrificing chickens to moloch, maintains close ties with someone who posts this,

       That's a collusion of generic with Pizzagate allegations to hide the fact that of the voluminous claims suggested in Pizzagate, few if any every panned out to anything real. PIzzagate is the exploitation of the mind by deceptive propaganda sensationalism and fear.

       The Podesta fish thing is an environmental initiative about protected areas in the ocean. This was debunked over a year ago.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I actually saw a simple believable explanation of this a few days ago, wish I had written down the source and meaning. It had something to do with a resolution 14 of some marine environmental org thing being passed. Very boring and non-satanic. I'll do my best to find the reference and post as an edit.
       </p>
       <p>
        EDIT: My bad it wasn't a resolution passed it was this:

       <p>
        There are 14 National Marine Sanctuaries and Podesta has had some role in the NOAA that governs all this stuff. That's all I can be bothered researching, but anyone else should be able to take it from there.

I was wondering if anyone else had seen it since i could not find it on the darkweb and I know others that could not find it either.

       Ok.  Well, do you have anything that isn't a rumour or based on rumours?  I'm going off of the hard evidence that is avaliable, as small as it is.  But the one I listed is the one that everyone is going off of.  Some say it's a preview,  other say it is the whole thing, others say it's only got a few clips of the originol in it.  But everyone says that's huma wearing a girls face as a mask, and I have proven that it definitely is not.  So my "debunk" had far more credibility than any rumour you want to believe because you want it to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thibk about that.  You're refusing to believe evidence when it's laid out for you because you want it to be true.  You want huma and hilary to have tortured a pre pubescent girl.  The fuck is wrong with you?!

       I honestly and seriously don't care about Hilary Clinton in any shape or form, I'm not even American. I just pointed out that it's not debunked. I personally don't think it even exists and I admire your interest and the time you put into it but unless the 'original' ever surfaces the whole rumour can certainly not be squashed. The 'original' has been described in graphic detail and people's reaction to it has been detailed. If we as a community on reddit want to debunk it it needs to be released. Until then it's just speculation and can't be debunked. Please God let it be bullshit, as you have also replied I am concerned that people are hoping it is true, for if it is some little girl was murdered and who the fuck wants that to be real.
