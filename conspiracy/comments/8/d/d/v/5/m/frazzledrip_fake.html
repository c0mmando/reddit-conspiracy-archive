It seems no one can find this or has seen it! If it is real can someone put in a onion link to where it is or confirm if it is real. Otherwise we need to be questioning the people that are saying it is out and released. ( This was rumored to be on Anthony Wieners laptop that was seized by NYPD)</p>

<p>This is not true. I think a video like this probably does exist somewhere in the world, but if it leaked, it wouldn&#39;t be covered correctly by the corporate media. Look at how they handled the Wikileaks release of DNC emails, that&#39;s what their reporting on this would look like. Russia would be blamed for hacking it, and the headlines would be screaming for retaliation at Russia while ignoring the content they&#39;re alleged to have hacked. Headlines would be something like &quot;Russia releases fake snuff video, Trump must bomb Moscow.&quot;</p>

<p>I actually saw a simple believable explanation of this a few days ago, wish I had written down the source and meaning. It had something to do with a resolution 14 of some marine environmental org thing being passed. Very boring and non-satanic. I&#39;ll do my best to find the reference and post as an edit.</p>

<p>EDIT: My bad it wasn&#39;t a resolution passed it was this: <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/john-podesta-announces-national-marine-sanctuary-nomination-process-is-reopened-262541591.html">http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/john-podesta-announces-national-marine-sanctuary-nomination-process-is-reopened-262541591.html</a></p>

<p>There are 14 National Marine Sanctuaries and Podesta has had some role in the NOAA that governs all this stuff. That&#39;s all I can be bothered researching, but anyone else should be able to take it from there.</p>

I personally don&#39;t think it even exists and I admire your interest and the time you put into it but unless the &#39;original&#39; ever surfaces the whole rumour can certainly not be squashed. The &#39;original&#39; has been described in graphic detail and people&#39;s reaction to it has been detailed. If we as a community on reddit want to debunk it it needs to be released. Until then it&#39;s just speculation and can&#39;t be debunked. Please God let it be bullshit, as you have also replied I am concerned that people are hoping it is true, for if it is some little girl was murdered and who the fuck wants that to be real.</p>
