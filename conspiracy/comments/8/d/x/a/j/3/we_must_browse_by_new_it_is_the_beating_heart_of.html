       It is no secret that Reddit is dying, driven in large part by a massive influx of bad actors, shills, and disinfo agents across the entire site. Those of you banned from one sub or another are well aware of this- that certain subs have invisible walls, which when run up against result in an immediate rebuff. We’ve even seen subs themselves change. Personally, I saw r/politics morph over the course of the Dem Convention from pro-Bernie, anti-HRC, anti-DNC, anti-Corporatists to the exact opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly, discussion that could be had one week could not be had the next. Later, I saw r/wikileaks become co-opted when Assange went dark in October of ’16, and the sub r/whereisassange was founded to handle the now banned discussions from that sub concerning his whereabouts. Many of us also saw the banning of r/pizzagate later in November.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this, r/conspiracy has become a true battleground- of ideas and philosophies, but also of shills, disinfo agents, and those of varying agendas. The best, and in my opinion the only, good way to fight this, and to accept the reality of the current condition of r/conspiracy, with an aim towards fighting back and improving it, is to browse by /new.
      </p>
      <p>
       /new is the beating heart of the sub- it is ground zero in the fight against the shills. It allows real, generic users to set the tone of discussion, to have their say via voting, and to help influence the sub. Don’t feel forced to contribute- but hop in where you think you have something to add! At the very least, a single Real One posting first in a thread makes the shills and bad actors
       <em>
        react
       </em>
       to them and their statements, rather than place their own, and gives the generic comments more of an opportunity to be seen and upvoted out of the darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how we fight- this is how we keep the sub in the hands of the community. This is how we ensure r/conspiracy remains as one of the last places for discussions and exchange of ideas on Reddit. We
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       browse by /new.

       This is how we take the sub back, couldn't agree more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing I would say, is if you are a lurker here, make an account or start leaving comments. I think some people are too "shy" or embarrassed to voice their opinions, but their opinions are needed here. We need a wide variety of voices here, to overpower the shills and paid infiltrators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, the flow of posts has been slowed enough on this sub (partly due to the 60 day rule and the SS's, ironically) to where a shill group can easily maintain control over the content, and what reaches the front page.

       This exactly. It takes months usually for someone to get comfortable enough to start speaking up, but even if just a few do, then it will help the sub out exponentially. Every additional Real One we get browsing /new is another ally in the fight.

       It was a trade off, really. The 60 day rule and SS's stop the immediate ability to forum slide- and give those already established here some breathing room. But it also allows a small group of already established shills to just keep camping. I personally think the 60 day rule and SS's are more beneficial than harmful, however.

       Over at least a year here,  I imagine I've left less than ten comments. What I consider a reasonable opinion is far too mainstream here,  so when/if I do speak up,  I'm just yelled at for parroting back MSM crap. 
The thing is,  I try to use reliable,  science-based sources and I'm still shot down.  Either no one genuinely wants to engage and listen to another voice,  or anything that isn't a fringe media site is automatically poopoo'ed. So tell me,  why should I even bother?

       That really depends on what you are actually saying/claiming to believe. People who want war in the ME or choose to listen to everything the Corporate Propaganda Media has to say usually don't get along too well round these parts, but that's because after looking into things long enough you realize that the MSM
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       propaganda, and so while they can't be completely ignored, they absolutely should not be trusted.

      <p>
       Keep using those sources- many people here use reliable, science based sources to back their conspiracy theories- even ones that go against everything the MSM is saying. Again, this would be very specific on a case by case basis.

      <p>
       People will read MSM posts here, but they will also pick them apart and expose their biases, just like people do for "fringe media sites". Just because it's the NYT or WaPo or Fox doesn't mean they're reliable- the news is utterly broken in this country, and the Free Press is mostly dead.

       Ya know, I hold political opinions that differ with many here- yet we all get along just fine. I respect that people have different views than me and am still fine engaging them in a friendly way, in an attempt to exchange information. Who cares about downvotes? Just keep being you and engaging with the community- this is the internet- where the karma is made up and the points don't matter.

       Thanks for replying, even if to express skepticism at the truth. I suppose that's the heartbeat of this sub, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I'm just weighing in on a topic that specifically addressed lurkers. That's me. Snoopsnoo then just confirmed exactly what I said - that I rarely post in here. The last thread that I commented on was completely deleted (as happens occasionally around here), as were all the replies to my post. This was the case that I am thinking of. So excuse me if this doesn't pan out in your eyes, but you can take your "lying and false narrative" and put that right back in your pipe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to haunt around and I occasionally read links that are posted for another opinion on a topic. I enjoy looking at things from another angle, and to consider the things that not everyone may recognize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being told I am pushing anything is ridiculous. If you are going to go around straight up call out folks for shit that ain't happening, that might be why people are so into lurking and not participating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry about me, I'll go back to the shadows.

       Hmm.. 2 upvotes on an hour old comment... in a thread that's a day old. Makes sense.

       I wouldn't say this sub is losing much with you. Besides, if those immediate upvotes on a day old post are any indication, we'll be seeing you around here in one form or another.

       It's not. Like you yourself admitted, you don't have many comments here. With never ending Reddit and ctrl-f you can do in 20 seconds.

       That's funny on 3 levels, cause earlier you tried to make it sound like the alleged attack happened within the last year, snoopsnoo already showed you have no posts here prior to 3 months ago,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       you can easily list your entire history and ctrl-f it to see this is again, a lie.

       I already did, and provided the methods by which anyone else could have, as well. If these attacks on your comments existed, you would have already linked an example.

       It’s important to have all voices heard. Otherwise the place just becomes the home of edgelords and basement warriors. However you have to know scientific research is hard to trust these days as well, scientists are like anyone else they need to make a living, if a government came to you and said, “ I’m having a fight with the coal minors, can you research into the negative effects coal has”. The scientists then go away and find out that burning fossil fuels ‘could’ effect the environment and ‘may’ effect weather patterns and will ‘probably’ warm the earth etc. They get a big fat check and Maggy Thantcher has more ammunition against the minors she is fighting.   Yes that’s how burning fossil fuels became so evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet we take it as scientific fact that burning fossil fuels effects the environment. Yes it makes things sooty and the air shit. But does if effect the weather ? No one actually knows, but the pointers are that no it doesn’t.  So just be open minded about the scientific studies that are fed to us, they themselves are often the conspiracy.

       To add on this “too shy” thought, many will shy away because they do not want to be attacked. We see it all too often here and it needs to stop. I think effective enforcement of Rule 10 can put a stop to this. Attacking of the users, sub, &amp; source is a way to stifle dialogue.

       I also think the 60 day wait and Rule 13 are working.

       EXACTLY. Being called "stupid" or just put down and told "where'd you get your info from? YOU-TUBE?? LOL brainwashed idiot" can be very deterring and even though you've done the research and have for years you question yourself and would just rather keep the information to yourself. There's a difference between having and educated argument and just being rude/mean. We are already dismissed (sometimes) as crazy.

       I understand this is and am trying to work on it. It's been difficult for me since I feel everything so strongly. It causes me to get upset easily and especially with those who don't agree with my opinion and do so in a condescending way. It  makes me reply immaturely at times which gives them more fuel to throw into my "conspiracy theorist" flames.

       It's hard to encourage new users to participate given the current climate of the sub. The disruptors have done an excellent job at making us fight with them instead of helping burgeoning new users find more information. It is also difficult with the MSM's constant ridiculing of anything conspiracy. It's pathological at this point.

        Right now, the flow of posts/activity has been slowed enough on this sub (partly due to the 60 day rule and the SS's, ironically) to where a shill group can easily maintain control over the content, and what reaches the front page.

       SS makes the user to at least think about even a slight reason they are posting...before, the treated conspiracy a channel for advertising and it was hard for some to continue posting 10 or more articles or youtube fictional articles in a row. In their acivity history that is all they did, no discussion in their posts, no point or topic to guide or converse about.

       Sure, people for that now but at a much lesser impact,  imho if we get rid of SS it will return.

       While I agree that spammers can be a burden and sometimes do inhibit good posts from getting higher, this seems to be an overstated problem imo. Couldn't these spammers be dealt with on an individual basis. From my experience there are only ever a few spammers on the sub at once. The dedicated users are always on the watch to call it out (as I have been called out for it before).
      </p>
      <p>
       The SS statement presents too many barriers compared to the alleged benefits: Users that wish to remain anonymous now must personalize the information presented, the post may now contain the bias of the user, neurotic people have a hard enough time posting ffs, it might discourage those who see no reason why they should go the extra step for this community compared to the rest of the site, it destroys spontaneity, it gives users yet another reason to concern troll, it gives mods yet another rule which can be unjustly enforced, etc.

       They don't break any other rules. Before Rule 13 I reported and asked a Mod about a user who posted hundreds a day and when active at a rate of 2.8 posts per minute. Conspiracy was one of thecsubs they used. The Mod response I got was only when over 20% of his content is his own stuff. There is no spam rule here.

       That type of account should certainly be dealt with in a swift manner. The desire to censor and the desire for freedom tug greatly both ways right now. Thor would just drop the hammer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the problem may be the varying types of posts we see here. Not only is this a news hub, it is a personal one as well. Allowing for freedom in editorializing the headline means there is no one post that can be accepted as the only one to stand. This means the same article can be spammed over and over again, as we see with many subjects.

       They could be dealt with on an individual basis but they are not. The root of the problem runs deeper than individual accounts. Keep open the possibility that they are encouraged to be here. Reddit is not for me and you. So what we have to do is be disruptive. Call accounts out. Don’t downvote, reply with sincerity and let your truth be known. Real users will eventually recognize the patterns and see what is going down on this site.

       Different people take different things from here. I personally think, at the deepest level, the "grand conspiracy" is the conspiracy of the suppression of consciousness, and that every other conspiracy is simply an off-shoot of that, filtered down through different respective societal lenses and such. I used to come here for the politics, then moved onto the more "out there" stuff (aliens, alternative history, paranormal etc), and now I mostly come here just to keep generally updated on the place and to comment.
       <br/>
       What I personally use this place for now and what I take from it is purely for self improvement on a soul level. I believe we humans need to work on discovering our true potentials as conscious entities, our true origins, the mechanics of consciousness, and love. I believe everything is the same universal consciousness at the core, just split into infinite things to experience being from an infinite number of relative perspectives. I believe that once we, as humans, come to realise that (or at least once enough of us do - a lá "hundredth monkey effect"/reaching critical mass point) then tyrannical power structures will simply dissolve as a natural result of that collective self realisation. And that's the reality I'm currently manifesting.
       <br/>
       It certainly has the potential for some good to use forums and sites like this to organise some kind of activism to take down the current power structures. That's a role that needs to be filled, and what better people to fill it than those most aware? My advice: keep sharing information of course, and just act on what you feel you need to. Obviously everyone doesn't have to take part in everything. We're people. We're different. We specialise in different things. So don't lose yourself by trying to fill all the roles - just the ones that you can and that you think you need to. You do you, I do me, and remember we're all the same consciousness just living in different bodies. One love ✌

       I haven't been very active in this sub for precisely that reason, as I don't want to be banned or placed on any radar, if that makes sense.  Mostly I post about gaming, but I've lurked here for a very long time.  I think it's time to make concerted efforts at returning this sub to the hands of those that use it well rather than for brigade efforts etc.

       It's significantly closer to 98-99%. The ratio of times they have been "On to something" actually REAL compared to wacko bullshit is astounding. Then, when one out of 500 stick, it's all, "look, see! We knew it all along!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Infowars and the like have been doing this a long time. They are held to zero accountability for their "reporting" standards. Just toss bullshit until something sticks. No one remembers the hundreds of insane r/conspiritard stories, they just flock to the one that stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the stories were posted in a way that warrants further discussion, and research, great. But the MO of this sub is to find an insane conclusion, and then dig as hard as possible to try to prove that conclusion, ignoring anything that disagrees.

       I browse /new because it's the place to find the spiciest crazy. Reddit's traffic is massive and stuff does get leaked here sometimes, but it's not and will never be 4chan.  It's more like a direct line for stuff that would have made it to stuff like the local nightly news.

       The sub needs a new name. Or it needs to break from conspiracy and become something else. Have one sub for that UFO, Illuminati type thing and another for more political facts/activism.

       I think fracturing would be a bad idea. r/conspiracy is an institution at this point- and while this comes with its problems it also comes with power. And I think we benefit from having all of these conspiracies under one major umbrealla sub.

       Or just retake the language. A historian I like, Michael Parenti, has a good bit where he counters the accusation of being a conspiracy theorist by asking whether the other person is a coincidence theorist, that is, do they think the oligarchs just happen to take actions that just so happen to line up and coordinate with other oligarchs for the mutual benefit?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem isn't the name "conspiracy theorist," for what it is it's accurate enough. The problem is the connotations and associations in the mind of the public, but that can be changed.

       I would say I identify more with truth seeker as well. I guess my point is not that we need to identify with it, but that we should not cede the
       <strong>
        linguistic battleground
       </strong>
       . Because of the beliefs we have (and that varies quite a bit here), we are seen as conspiracy theorists by others, and many people judge us, and more importantly our
       <em>
        ideas
       </em>
       , by what their perception of a "conspiracy theorist" is.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Whoever defines the term "conspiracy theorist" in the popular understanding will determine what people think of actual conspiracy theories
       </strong>
       . One side of the game knows this, and that's why they tar and smear dissident "communities" like conspiracy theorists. This is why they highlight certain conspiracy theorists (AJ has been in the mainstream news lately), to associate any conspiracy
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       with their chosen caricature of a conspiracy
       <em>
        theorist
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if the MSM played a James Corbett video, any one of them, and tried to criticize him. People would look him up, and see that he was actually reasonable, calm, rational, and extremely well-researched in the content he produced. Many people would probably listen to and agree with a lot of what he said. This is why Alex Jones is the face of conspiracy theorists in the corporate media.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do the same with AntiFa by the way. AntiFa are a bunch of assholes themselves, but that is why they are presented as the face of all anti-fascism. It's a claiming and therefore a defining of linguistic territory. Many people, especially on the right, are conflating AntiFa the assholes with the idea of being against fascism. We should very much be against fascism, even if the people called AntiFa are assholes. Just like we very much should research and educate people about conspiracy theories, even if people called "conspiracy theorists" are defamed and considered crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's somewhat how African Americans reclaimed the word "nigger" as "nigga." "Nigger" is what ignorant, white racists called them, and how that outside group defined them. "Nigga" is what they called themselves, and to each other, and it became how they could define themselves. If we let others put labels on us, and let them define those labels, then we will always be misunderstood because people will have made up their mind before they even listen to what we have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR:
       </strong>
       We should identify as whatever we feel aligned with, but we should not cede the linguistic battleground for the term "conspiracy theorist" by letting it be defined for us by people other than us.

We are at a disadvantage though, we are individuals with our own opinions and our own voices. Where as shills are not working to their own opinion or their own voice, they are working to directives.
      </p>

       Just think of what each of us could do given a team of say ten people each with at least three accounts to push a theory or agenda. ?  They just need to talk across a desk on how to disrupt a post or push an agenda. We on the other hand are just speaking our minds
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right we need to fight back. And more people need to speak their minds. Though when they see some posts get attacked I doubt it’s an incentive for others to posts.

       It truly is asymmetric information warfare. They don't need to hide information, or manipulate it, as long as there is enough contradictory and superfluous information. "We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false" is a much easier task than actually discovering and spreading truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The antidote to bad information is not just more information, but a way telling the truth from the lies and rumors. These are the skills of critical thinking, journalistic practice, and becoming cognizant of one's own biases. If we, individually and collectively, are failing to learn and teach these skills, any information we spread is essentially useless to most who would come across it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are sharing anything on this sub on broader reddit, it should be the skill of critical thinking and the willingness to apply it to
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       our knowledge about the world.

       I agree with that. And certainly not suggesting it’s an impossible task by any means. But understanding what we are up against is important. I’m just relaying what I have personally experienced on the mandella effect forum. Just take a look at how that has been marginalised and you’ll see how other things can be as well. I’ve experienced the mandella effect for real. It’s quite crazy. But it’s covered up on an industrial scale. Why ? I don’t know yet

       Great freaking post u/bradok. If nothing else it's nice to know there are core authentic people out there. It has become obvious when a post gets shilled or brigaded. The fact that this post remains untouched indicates to me that whatever tools they use for watching are looking for keyword and they aren't just browsing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brigading sucks but that's still real users that have widely differing opinions and a bully mentality. We can handle that. It's govt and corporate shills that make me sick - they are willfully subverting our constitutional rights (or human rights if your country doesn't allow free speech). This is happening everywhere, not just Reddit and in a way we're lucky because we're ahead of the curve on recognizing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, this may be a bad idea but I wonder if we could take some of the recent hot button topics and try giving them a modified title - using special characters instead of the real letters and see what the response is. The main topic they're killing on lately is seereeyuh. It's clearer than ever that posts are being monitored and attacked. Reasonable opinions just crushed through the floor with votes. Sliding everywhere. Attacking messengers. And always promoting the narrative. I'm curious if we could get some authentic discussion by changing the title alone or if they also monitor internal discussion. I'm sure they follow certain "trouble" users.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is maybe if we can understand how they target better, we may be able to take countermeasures. Again, really appreciate the thoughtful discussion here - it warms my cold, dead heart :)

       It's possible, and I've known some people to do this from time to time. The problem is that it also makes it harder for the post to naturally rise. It's not just that certain accounts are responding to keyword filters, but that they're dominating the posts on those topics that ultimately hit /hot.

       I really appreciate the stickies from the past month or so to generate broader awareness about war propaganda and to combat other BS. I know we regulars frequently bemoan the amount of political posts, but I think with issues of war, etc. those informative stickies are a way to actually make a difference - as much as we can from a computer anyway.

       I took you up on this. Reading new submissions this fine Sunday morning, I can only draw one conclusion:
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is the "beating heart", this sub needs a fucking quadruple bypass, and a blood transfusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much unfounded anti-Isreal propaganda. Real propaganda, like Brietbart or Infowars on r/politics bad. Then, people not reading shit about the actual story,  and just dropping into the comments section to "Yeah! So corrupt!"
      </p>
      <p>
       We get it. The world is insanely nuisanced. Bad actors take advantage. We could use this sub, like I sometimes do see, to help expose it. These constant propaganda/hate pieces will continue to erode the credibility of this sub, however.

       What if I told you- that the MSM is nothing but Corporate Propaganda itself? That the Free Press is basically already dead in this country? The division between what "is" and "isn't" propaganda has been blurred.

       Part of browsing /new is to help contribute to discussion- arguing against those points you feel aren't correct, giving support to those you do, etc; You aren't really "browsing by new" if you do it once and never again. I seldom look at /hot anymore. As soon as I come to this sub, I head to /new and chill there reading posts and hitting refresh every few minutes- it's a Reddit lifestyle.

       to add to what he said, we need you commenting on new. IDC what you believe, YOU are the reason the bots, tmor goons, ctr, and many other groups are being paid to set the narrative in every post... so that by the time YOU see it, it's EXACTLY how they want you to see it. if that doesn't happen, the post or even individual comments are kept below threshold by vote manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit, I scroll past comment threads, more often than I should, anyone else? in those tangents, THAT'S where the knowledge is evolving. THAT'S where we can all help one another.

       There is a difference between not agreeing with Israel, and antisemitism, yet if you just read just the hatebots, or the paidshills, or the top/best answers, you will find a very defined rhetoric that detracts from the opinions and links provided by others. they will say, "don't even bother, internet aids." or "that's just what, a pede,libtard,commie,islamic,nazi,shill,ctr,snowflake,sjw,christian,hindu,queer,terrorist would say, isn't it?"

       Reddit has overtaken other social media simply going by Alexa scoring.  More eyes means more money and a massive decline in the quality of discussion and content to the lowest common denominator.  It also means the company is more handcuffed to perverse interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The front page formula is most likely what is driving the push towards "safe space" and bot driven site gaming practices.  Rarely will any post about any controversial topic make it to the front page from a subreddit that allows two sided discussion.  Consequently, you can restate the accepted opinion, or you can be banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could be corrected by penalizing moderation in the scoring system.  However, I really don't think the admin are aware of their own biases.  They state that they follow a set of content rules, but they only enforce them against certain parts of the userbase, even for doxxing or threats of violence.  They don't seem to realize that if you don't enforce a policy uniformly, you don't really have a policy at all.

       I always browse by /new. It seems when I browse by hot or controversial it’s nothing but political posts. While there are a very large amount of conspiracies that are political in nature I’d much rather read about anything else. If I wanted the latest scandal I’d read USA Today or something. Seems there is a great deal of filtering and steering the conversation going on in this sub and on reddit in general lately

       Of course, over time most Bernie supporters moved to supporting Hillary over Trump but that doesn’t mean they supported Hillary over Bernie. Same thing as day Ted Cruz supporters who then voted for Trump. That’s how elections work and that’s what will happen next election too.

       Oh it changed friend- you can stop with the whole "nothing really changed go back to sleep" lie. Since we're calling out liars. The sub shut down discussion of anything anti-HRC, any discussion of her cheating of the Primaries, and her corruption, which those paying attention knew would spell her doom to a fucking reality TV star.

       You do understand the fact you can’t actually prove your statement doesn’t exactly look good right? You’re making a claim, thus it’s on you to actually back it up.

       Asking for someone to support their claim isn’t bait.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually when someone claims something is true they have the ability to actually prove it.  And when someone deliberately lies, they deflect and refuse to provide evidence knowing it doesn’t exist.

       What shows the sad state of this sub is the top discussion with the mod right below this 16 upvotes post. A mod talking about a "fact", saying he "can prove it", but that he "feels no need to do so for you."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the EXACT opposite of what this sub should be. If you can prove that whatever you're saying is true, then fucking DO IT, expose stuff FFS. Change the minds of people who can't see that truth.

      <p>
       That discussion is clearly showing how much of an echo chamber this sub is becoming, we only talk to ourselves, we don't even try to engage conversation with someone who might see things differently.

       r/politics was never so venomously anti-Clinton before the primaries. The Clintons were treated neutrally or somewhat positively for the most part. Then the primary hits and its nothing but straight vitriol for Clinton, with blatant propaganda from foreign countries making it to the front page, and the "far left" posting obvious rightwing propaganda. Then, suddenly, it stopped and the sub was back to neutral to pro-Clinton when the primaries ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's hilarious with the claims about CTR, is the "flip" in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       directly coincided with Bernie exiting the race, and ceasing payments to Revolution Messaging (a company directly funded by the Bernie campaign, with more than 3x the budget of Correct The Record, whose mission statement specifically included growing Bernie-supporting communities on reddit).
      </p>
      <p>
       We know Russia had trolls on reddit supporting Trump and Bernie, and disparaging Hillary. We know Bernie hired Revolution Messaging with a budget over $20 million. Yet it is the smaller group with... what was it? $1-2 million budget? that got all the heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gee, I wonder what the origin was of the outrageously huge number of comments so hyper-focused and targeted at a group that was specifically meant to push back against disinformation about Hillary Clinton? Couldn't be the much more highly funded organization being paid directly by her opponent?  And why was any criticism of Revolution Messaging completely drowned out, to the point that few even know of it? Any even slight mention of it in places like r/politics was instantly downvoted to oblivion.

       at the time (on a previous account). I was originally on the fence between Hillary and Bernie, but got really tired of being called a shill and "CTR" whenever I called someone out for a flat-out lie about Hillary (sound familiar?). It was
       <em>
        toxic
       </em>
       if you didn't toe the "Hillary is evil" line. Eventually I stopped going to that sub, and only returned to it once Hillary got the nomination. It wasn't immediate, but we started getting a lot fewer concern trolls and die-hard Bernie supporters... and the sub became a good bit friendlier to Hillary supporters. What the OP sees as the sub flipping was, in fact, primarily due to the concern trolls and faux Bernie supporters giving up on the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hell, OP won't even accept your explanation... which kinda says all you need to know about his/her motive with this thread, I think.

       Personally,I often like the comments more that the post, which there are not enough on 'new'. You can tell a lot by reading the comments if you have an unbiased mind.
I look at both, new and hot.

       I tend to prefer comments as well. One thing you can do is go to new and skip ahead a few hours. That way you'll see more posts that already have comments, but often the commenters are still online as well, so you can still be part of the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a 12 hour post on /hot with a couple hundred comments, the form has pretty much already been decided by past comments and votes. But at 2 hours, the post is still fresh and able to be influenced.

       Look at all the anti-Trump posts in this sub, a lot of them are posted by the same 2-3 users, and they always reach the front page and any viewpoint that does not agree with the post is heavily downvoted. Its not a coincidence.

       Its way more anti-Trump than pro-Trump, that's for sure. Anything "pro-Trump", even if its correcting inaccurate information, is mass downvoted in this sub. Just an example, I corrected someone who falsely claimed that Republicans funded the Steele dossier before the DNC/Clinton. I even linked proof that this was false yet I was still downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go look at any anti-Trump post and you see the same pattern. Anti-Trump = upvotes. Pro-Trump = downvotes.

       Well, we disagree. I see a lot of posts on Trump get little to no questioning, and there's literally a post in the front page right now about how the Russian collusion scandal (which has all the ingredients for a perfect conspiracy... If only Hillary was at the top of it) is just media created BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did a quick sweep and couldn't see any more recent posts directly referencing Trump, but besides him directly, you can see the sub is largely conservative and right-leaning. "Liberal" is an insult, the DNC probably gets more hate on this sub than big pharma does. And the disinfo campaign that's taking place doesn't help anyone at all.

       I've always liked this one because similar to unpopularopinion it has ideas across the spectrum. Unlike unpopularopinion it has people who follow the news and know what they're talking about.  I stumbled on CMV and broke the damn sub. It's geared to younger folks and explicitly barrages a poster with arguments until they're forced to claim they've changed. I would check over the course of the day and have 50+ replies at various times. That is where the engineering happens in its most basic form.

       I was writing this post specifically for this sub. But I do think that browsing /new is the best way to view Reddit. Problem is, unless you are a dedicated member of that particular sub, then browsing /new just doesn't seem natural to you. This post was made as a message to the r/conspiracy regulars who don't think/bother to browse by /new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think browsing by /new is just plain good redditing.

      </p>
      <p>
       Over at least a year here,  I imagine I've left less than ten comments. What I consider a reasonable opinion is far too mainstream here,  so when/if I do speak up,  I'm just yelled at for parroting back MSM crap. 
The thing is,  I try to use reliable,  science-based sources and I'm still shot down.  Either no one genuinely wants to engage and listen to another voice,  or anything that isn't a fringe media site is automatically poopoo'ed. So tell me,  why should I even bother?

       To add on this “too shy” thought, many will shy away because they do not want to be attacked. We see it all too often here and it needs to stop. I think effective enforcement of Rule 10 can put a stop to this. Attacking of the users, sub, &amp; source is a way to stifle dialogue.

       I also think the 60 day wait and Rule 13 are working.

       Asking for someone to support their claim isn’t bait.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually when someone claims something is true they have the ability to actually prove it.  And when someone deliberately lies, they deflect and refuse to provide evidence knowing it doesn’t exist.

       Not your best effort today.

       I tend to prefer comments as well. One thing you can do is go to new and skip ahead a few hours. That way you'll see more posts that already have comments, but often the commenters are still online as well, so you can still be part of the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a 12 hour post on /hot with a couple hundred comments, the form has pretty much already been decided by past comments and votes. But at 2 hours, the post is still fresh and able to be influenced.
