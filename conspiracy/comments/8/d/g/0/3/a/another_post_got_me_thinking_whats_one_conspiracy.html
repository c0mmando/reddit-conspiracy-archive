<p>This  has been going on since the stolen 2000 election every election more are eliminated.  Every Republican state in the nation has removed voters, that along with the Voter ID laws, with very strict rules on what can be used. and of course shortening voting times, closing polling places and of course gerrymandering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The propublica article names, 7 million for 2014 and another 15 million in 2015.  That adds up to 22 million </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission reported that <strong>15 million</strong> names were scrubbed from the lists nationally in 2014.</p>

<p>News21 analyzed lists of nearly 50 million registered voters from a dozen states, and <strong>7 million</strong> more who were removed over the last year. By comparing voter registration and purge lists against U.S. Census data, News21 found no national or statewide pattern of discrimination against voters based on race, ethnicity, poverty, age or surname.</p>

<p>But the data did show that purges disproportionately affected minority or low-income voters in certain communities, and white voters in others. In Cincinnati, poverty rates and voter removals appeared interrelated, while race appeared to affect the removal of voters in rural Hancock County, Georgia. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article not included because of the source mentions 22 million for 2016 alone. </p>

<p>The reason for wars are dictators need external enemies to control their own people from revolting against them.  People are willing to starve (North Korea) if they fear an external enemy is going to attack.  Plus, dictators make flawed moves that a democratic government doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Yes people profit off wars, since forever, but there are only a few tyrants remaining.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Princess Diana&#39;s death was so wretched and devastating for dozens of reasons and the amount of evidence that she was assasinated is so substantial I really can&#39;t believe people in England didn&#39;t freak the hell out at the royal family and I am shocked it isn&#39;t still a HUGE thing. Americans know JFK was taken out, but there isn&#39;t much we can do today. I really want to see some people over there have a revolution just for the sake of Princess Diana. </p>

These little pieces of paper and imaginary numbers, backed by nothing, that people would literally kill others for. We&#39;re just born and told these pieces of paper have value, but their value is only due to a folie de plus...a shared illusion where we all AGREE it has value, even though it doesn&#39;t. And the pursuit of this paper CONTROLS SO MUCH OF OUR LIVES. It&#39;s fucking retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Lyme disease is being used as a biological weapon as we speak. I&#39;m suffering from symptoms of Lyme disease, and finding a doctor willing to test isn&#39;t as easy as you would think. I was tested for lymphoma before Lyme. I found out that doctors don&#39;t like to test because alot of them are aware of the government&#39;s role in it&#39;s sudden increase in cases, which started in the new york area, the same place that plum island is located . Plum island is where the government studies disease that affects animals and it is said that birds may have carried it over to the mainland, because the steps taken to prevent that were never taken, and a lot of people claim it was no accident</p>

My wife has been diagnosed with MS, and has taken mutliple ELISA lyme tests and the thing I found most interesting is that the number of antibodies she had in her system got higher with every test, but it was still below the &quot;Diagnosable&quot; number, so according to the ELISA test she doesn&#39;t have lyme.  She has symptoms that are similar to Mandy Hughes who was featured in the documentary on lyme called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1202579/">Under our skin</a></p>

Seeing the ignorance of the arguments and knowing where they originate from makes the conspiracy even more real with each passing day.</p>
