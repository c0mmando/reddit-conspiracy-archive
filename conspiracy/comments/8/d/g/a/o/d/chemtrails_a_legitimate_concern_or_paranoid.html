       We are now calling it geo-engineering, so the term Chemtrails has been dropped except as a historical marker - you know, like Global Warming -&gt; Climate Change, but with less PR.

       The only meaningful level of its legitimacy is the extent to which you are able to ignore the overwhelming evidence or accept the default answer provided by your government and its media outlets.

       They have essentially admitted this. Plenty of government docs going back to the 70s discussing geoengineering. Check out Dane Wigington’s site, he has tons of info there: geoengineeringwatch.org.

       Kaku says a tier one civilization will be able to control its weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google stratospheric aerosol injection, solar radiation management and cloud seeding. All are forms of chemical spraying.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are white papers online and geoengineer interviews on youtube and other places.

       The delusion is that it isnt happening. People say "how could they keep all the pilots hush hush" and "who would actually due that as an airline pilot?" But these are assumptions. They assume someone has to physically be in the plane pulling a lever. Nonsense. We have the drone tech and any plane can be flown remotely nowadays. And if you think that certain people dont want to play God, then that is another delusion. It's just a matter of time till the soft disclosure reaches the point where most people think its a good idea then it will be hard to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only decades from now when the soil isnt viable and our health has declined that we will consider the consequences. Meanwhile Monsanto makes alkaline resistant seeds amd drought resistant seeds etc. Because theyre in on it too. Control the weather, control food production, control medicine and health (Bayer merged with Monsanto).

       Littering the atmosphere on purpose is no conspiracy, you can read about the military’s goals right on their own website:

       This is from 1996 and we’re just a few years shy of their theoretical completion date of 2025. People are free to believe this was all theoretical and the military has never pursued these technologies, but I would disagree.

       I don't think your stated reasons are correct. It's geo-engineering madness; a valiant but oh-so stupid attempt to regulate our planet's albedo in order to stabilize a shifting climate. It's sign #1 that the whole CO2 debate is completely contrived, making it obvious that an increase in the sun's output is the primary driver of current Earth changes, which they're trying to counteract by making the atmosphere more reflective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that flora, fauna, and people are all getting more and more neurotoxins into their system because of this intervention seems to be viewed as a necessary price to pay for "saving the planet". This whole conundrum seems to be the perfect illustration of the old adage "The road to hell is paved with good intentions".

       It looks and behaves like water. Water vapor is a byproduct of the engine. There's no indication that it's something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the fact that there's no way to personally confirm what it is because it's up so high, there's no reason to suspect that it's anything more than water.

       You know what else just stays in the sky for hours without dissipating? Clouds.

       What are clouds made of? Water vapor.

       The “grid patterns that fill the sky” you refer to could simply be just being able to see the common flight paths that all planes in the US fly in. If you saw them from the sky they are likely thousands of feet apart vertically.

       Man has been trying to influence the weather since the dawn of mankind. Technology has only further enabled that desire. There are hundreds of patents available for public review that detail methods for weather manipulation, there are likely many others that are kept secret. There is a documented history of government sponsored weather control programs,  radio signal propagation methods and also biowarfare experiments using aerosols from aircraft going back over 70 years. Since there was no official date that all of these activities were halted, one can only assume they continue to this day. People who believe otherwise are simply fooling themselves to ease their minds. The governments around the world have the means, motive and opportunity to do these things, so they will do just that until the public outcry is too strong for them to ignore - we are not at that point yet but we're close.

       It is a paranoid delusion, It is a misconception that one you control anything other than the local amount of rain. Just to give you information, how much atom bombs would be necessary to stop a tornado? Given that any moder nuke is 3,000 times more potent than "Little Boy" or "Fat Man?
       <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C5c.html">
        This is the answer
       </a>
       The amout of energy to control weather would be insanely ridiculous, they would have to spray whatever they spray all around the wolrd and would be not enough. Of course one day we will controll it, but right now? Take out that tin foil hat...

       Everything immediately jumps to the "evil chemtrail" narrative without even thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure everyone here can agree that the Earth is experiencing a changing climate as a result of human activity - while the final result isn't totally clear right now it does seem like temperatures are rising globally.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what is causing the warming? Heat from the sun trapped in our atmosphere by the greenhouse effect. Heat is absorbed better by dark materials (black body physics), and 70% of our planet  is covered in dark blue water and a good deal of the rest is dark as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if dark materials absorb heat...light ones reflect it. Light things like clouds, which are both brilliantly reflective and white, and relatively easy to generate. Plus you can have the added benefit of targeted rainfall generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I'm saying I think "chemtrails" are just clouds to increase the albedo of Earth as an easy geoengineering tactic to combat climate change.
