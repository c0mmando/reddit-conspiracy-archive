    <div class="md"><p>Kaku says a tier one civilization will be able to control its weather.</p>

<p>Google stratospheric aerosol injection, solar radiation management and cloud seeding. All are forms of chemical spraying. </p>

<p>There are white papers online and geoengineer interviews on youtube and other places.</p>

<p>The delusion is that it isnt happening. People say &quot;how could they keep all the pilots hush hush&quot; and &quot;who would actually due that as an airline pilot?&quot; But these are assumptions. They assume someone has to physically be in the plane pulling a lever. Nonsense. We have the drone tech and any plane can be flown remotely nowadays. And if you think that certain people dont want to play God, then that is another delusion. It&#39;s just a matter of time till the soft disclosure reaches the point where most people think its a good idea then it will be hard to stop. </p>

<p>Only decades from now when the soil isnt viable and our health has declined that we will consider the consequences. Meanwhile Monsanto makes alkaline resistant seeds amd drought resistant seeds etc. Because theyre in on it too. Control the weather, control food production, control medicine and health (Bayer merged with Monsanto). </p>

<p>How deep you wanna go down the rabbit hole is your choice. Sit back and relax or make yourself informed and depressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think your stated reasons are correct. It&#39;s geo-engineering madness; a valiant but oh-so stupid attempt to regulate our planet&#39;s albedo in order to stabilize a shifting climate. It&#39;s sign #1 that the whole CO2 debate is completely contrived, making it obvious that an increase in the sun&#39;s output is the primary driver of current Earth changes, which they&#39;re trying to counteract by making the atmosphere more reflective.</p>

<p>The fact that flora, fauna, and people are all getting more and more neurotoxins into their system because of this intervention seems to be viewed as a necessary price to pay for &quot;saving the planet&quot;. This whole conundrum seems to be the perfect illustration of the old adage &quot;The road to hell is paved with good intentions&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man has been trying to influence the weather since the dawn of mankind. Technology has only further enabled that desire. There are hundreds of patents available for public review that detail methods for weather manipulation, there are likely many others that are kept secret. There is a documented history of government sponsored weather control programs,  radio signal propagation methods and also biowarfare experiments using aerosols from aircraft going back over 70 years. Since there was no official date that all of these activities were halted, one can only assume they continue to this day. People who believe otherwise are simply fooling themselves to ease their minds. The governments around the world have the means, motive and opportunity to do these things, so they will do just that until the public outcry is too strong for them to ignore - we are not at that point yet but we&#39;re close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything immediately jumps to the &quot;evil chemtrail&quot; narrative without even thinking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure everyone here can agree that the Earth is experiencing a changing climate as a result of human activity - while the final result isn&#39;t totally clear right now it does seem like temperatures are rising globally.</p>

<p>So, what is causing the warming? Heat from the sun trapped in our atmosphere by the greenhouse effect. Heat is absorbed better by dark materials (black body physics), and 70% of our planet  is covered in dark blue water and a good deal of the rest is dark as well.</p>

<p>So, if dark materials absorb heat...light ones reflect it. Light things like clouds, which are both brilliantly reflective and white, and relatively easy to generate. Plus you can have the added benefit of targeted rainfall generation.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m saying I think &quot;chemtrails&quot; are just clouds to increase the albedo of Earth as an easy geoengineering tactic to combat climate change.</p>
