    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think what the DNC did was ethical but it wasn’t illegal and the public only getting to see one side’s dirty laundry had a huge effect on the election.</p>

<p>what proof do you have that Seth Rich has anything to do with the DNC leaks? Are you aware that Rod Wheeler is suing Ed Butowski? Did the Kim DotCom thing ever turn out to be anything? Did Seymour Hersh not say Butowski “took two and two and made forty five of it?”</p>

<p>Besides, why did you change the topic from coordination between WL/Russia/Trump to DNC stuff/Seth Rich when pressed a tiny bit? Doesn’t exactly seem like you can back up your assertions mate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what I&#39;m alluding to is the entire Trump-Russia babble is a smokescreen. Bernie Sanders was our only hope for making any change, and for whatever reason you&#39;d like to believe he was stripped of that opportunity. TPTB like things just the way they are and they prefer their usual &quot;pretend the make change but &#39;whoops we couldn&#39;t&#39;&quot; methods.</p>

<p>and this is all coming from someone who&#39;s never even delved into politics due to seeing it for the big circle jerk it is, until someone named Bernie Sanders came along and <em>said real things, with real plans of action</em>. with the technology and resources we have at our disposal these days, to say every person on Earth can be fed, clothed and sheltered is a joke. the reason I say this is because I believe this is what the majority of people want, to live a comfortable life with their loved ones until they, too, inevitably die. greed and ego don&#39;t allow this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>absolutely not. the only reason Trump one was because of the DNC&#39;s collusion to kick Bernie out. if Bernie faced Trump, there&#39;s no question he would&#39;ve won. instead, they put him up against a warmongering, lying bag of meat with a scumbag husband who fucked this country up already. </p>

<p>and what the hell do you want me to say about Seth Rich? that I was standing there in DC and watched him get killed and I&#39;ve been saving the cell phone video all along? do a little research on your own (god forbid), and you&#39;ll see exactly what I&#39;m talking about. and please refrain from misinformation sites like snopes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay, so you can believe what you believe, and also believe that Trump coordinated with Russia. But regardless, I think you’ve got your flag planted so I’m not going to push that.</p>

<p>with all due respect, I answered all your questions. I have done my research, and I’ve come to the conclusion that it was a red herring based on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Assange (who again, not impartial) pushing the theory and hinting strongly at the fact that he was the leaker but never outright saying it to maintain plausible deniability. If he had proof, he could make it clear and could’ve a year ago.</p></li>
<li><p>Kim DotCom’s announcements being nothing</p></li>
<li><p>the Rod Wheeler article which pushed the theory into the MSM (via Fox, specifically Hannity and Carlson), being retracted a day after it was published (but staying up on the main FOX site for a week despite Fox5DC retracting it much earlier)</p></li>
<li><p>the “download speeds” talking point being untrue</p></li>
<li><p>the “pandas4bernie” thing leading to nothing</p></li>
<li><p>Wheeler suing Butowski regarding his role in pushing the theory</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Again I ask, what’s your evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good piece of evidence imo is the fact John Podesta and Alefantis haven&#39;t sued despite having their names dragged through the mud.  John Podesta can&#39;t even use twitter without being called a pedophile.  Surely that would be reason to sue ANY of the youtube rightwing/far left personalities, right?

    <div class="md"><p>I did awhile ago.  Initially I thought more of the Clinton political machine was going to get exposed, and some of it did.  But as it turned out the tinfoil hats imaginations went a little off the rails.  I was not surprised, yet I was still disappointed.  The Clintons and their pals are much more competent in their corrupt behavior.  There is a realization you have to do actual good for the country so as to hide the more shady shit.  Instead we got an asshat president whose worse than her.  The mainstream media has latche&#39;d onto the Russian Collusion conspiracy, which is good.  Russian interference with our democracy is a threat to the country and world security.  </p>

<p>As for your sources, well...   I browsed the website itself and was unimpressed, then looked at what their reputation might be...<br/>

<p>It&#39;s important to check ones self and make sure personal biases aren&#39;t clouding your judgement too much.  The dunning-kruger effect is real, and if you don&#39;t know it you should read up on it.  It&#39;s not always a general effect; a person can have particular blind spots where they are affected, but overall be competent and knowledgeable, or at least aware where they are not smart.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>There was a proxy war in Syria for years thanks to Hillary and Obama.  It de-escalated under Trump mostly up until last week, but he still can&#39;t pull out it seems.</p>

<p>Well, of course Russia hates the woman who is going to lead the hostile charge against the country.  So they may have done things to help Trump win the election.  Were the things they did significant?  Last evidence I saw was internet shills, much like Soros&#39; organizations.  It sucks, something that could potentially have a lawsuit filed over, but not in today&#39;s political climate.  All the outraged neo-left tptb and democrats, you know this lawsuit is going to be exaggerated political stunt and not an actual lawsuit to keep other nations out of our elections.</p>

<p>Wiki leaks on the other hand, should not be a part of this lawsuit.  Whistleblowers need an outlet,it should be the other way around that lawsuit should prosecute the ones persecuting whistleblower organizations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia is not subject to personal jurisdiction in the US, and almost surely protected by soveriegn immunity anyway. They can&#39;t get jurisdiction over Assange because he is on international soil of a non-extraditing country, i.e. they cannot serve him. I guess they can haul a random Wiki person in but this all seems like failure to state a cause. It&#39;s a civil suit. There is no civil suit for &quot;collusion.&quot; It must be for some tort, but tort only lies if the opposing party owed you a duty. Russia and Wikileaks and Assange had no duty to the DNC. Or maybe they are going down the defamation road? Aslo, they cannot sue on behalf of the nation, they do not have standing.</p>

<p>The mid-term internal polling must look grim. And is about to look grimmer. This likely just lost them any momentum they had. The only people who did not groan when they learned this are the rabid maddow/MSNBC/bill marher dems that were already going to vote for them.</p>

<p>No one but looney toon partisan nut jobs on either side still care about the 2016 election. My neighbor is a nonpartisan candidate trying to get on the ballot to represent our district in the State House. The first question is always, &quot;what party?,&quot; followed by a &quot;thank god,&quot; when they learn she is no party.</p>

<p>2016 is over. done. finito. in the can. move on. If you really care, we actually have an election in 7 months, focus on that. </p>

<p>Yes the Seth rich thing is circomstantial but Assange bringing him up unprovoked as the leader is weird. In any case it&#39;s more than mueller has found with his indictments and no one in jail yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I with you.</p>

<p>I also want to say this act by DNC reminds me of borderline personality disorder which makes me laugh (better than crying - it&#39;s pretty awful growing up with a BPD mom).</p>

<p>They project their own flaws and wrong doing and evil feelings onto others.</p>

<p>They are never responsible for anything bad that happens.</p>

<p>They paint everyone as white or black.  Either you are 100% with them or you are evil.  Democrats who 99% follow the narrative are just as bad as their &quot;enemy&quot; Republicans, Libertarians etc.</p>

<p>They blame anyone and everyone when they get cornered or their initial scape goat isn&#39;t sticking.  Like hoe they pivoted to Jill Stein being in bed with Putin because she attended some dinner and sat at the same table.</p>

<p>They alternate between the waif (victimized needing special protections) to the witch and queen etc.  Hillary Clinton will do this in the space of one speech dozens of times.</p>

<p>Lots of narcissism at play too but I rjink the Republican establishment types ie RINO or Neocon fit the NPD (narcisstic personality disorder) better.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about power and manipulation.</p>
