<p>I think jones&#39; claim is accurate. I think the court should throw out the suit due to evidence destruction in building demolition.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s true nobody died, then who&#39;s initiating the suit, and why? Is it the people behind the false flag?</p>

<p>also, they say jones is controlled opposition. If so, they are plaintiff and defendant the same party, behind the scenes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about dna of one of the teachers being found on ammo in one of the clips?</p>

<p>How about 2 teachers not being found hiding in the principal&#39;s office for 4 hours even tho the school had supposedly been swept and cleared by officers with canines?</p>

<p>How about the warrants claiming only one spent casing (and 3 live rounds found in the gun) being found at the Lanza home even tho Nancy Lanza was supposedly shot 4 times?</p>

<p>How about the condition of the school? It was a fn disaster. A metal railing on a wheel chair ramp that had been broken leaving a sharp, jagged metal pipe at head level of a young child? Broken tiles in the school making for a slipping/tripping hazard…and the list goes on and on in regards to the condition of the school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones is frequently used by the Elites as &quot;bait&quot;, to sabotage certain conspiracies. </p>

<p>I think they realize lots of people woke up after the most recent shooting, and are starting to go back and ask questions about previous events, like Sandy Hook, which seems to be the &quot;weakest&quot; and least convincing, as well as having the most shade surrounding the event. </p>

<p>I think Jones has agreed to this recent sabotaging of his image, I believe he&#39;s a gatekeeper and a disinformation agent that does what the establishment tells him to do.</p>

<p>This will hit the media, spread through social media, and will make all of the masses roll their eyes at the idea of Sandy Hook being a &quot;hoax&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;What a monster that Alex Jones is! Brushing off the deaths of those children and their poor parents! I hate conspiracy theorists now!!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the reaction they are provoking with this media stunt. Jones is <em>IN</em> on this, he has agreed to let the MSM sabotage his image, because he was a fake alternative media stooge all along from the get-go. </p>

You FAKES pretend you are all concerned about your fictional &quot;pedo&quot; crap, but when REAL PEOPLE are killed, you act like it&#39;s just some stupid game. People like you have no brains OR morals. I hope Jones gets screwed again.He&#39;s an idiot and a liar, thing you have firsthand experience at.</p>

<p>Theres also the time where he went on CNN with Piers Morgan and purposefully acted like a raging lunatic to smear pro-2nd amendment supporters.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget about the video of his former employees who called him out as a shill as well. </p>

<p>I understand this, trust me. It took me awhile to arrive to the conclusion that he was playing the &quot;long con&quot;.</p>

<p>But that is how this crime syndicate operates, they think long term ALWAYS. The idea of planting a fake &quot;good guy&quot; in advance, and then using him to steer the opposition in whatever direction they want, is not a new idea. </p>

<p>The elites and social engineers knew an &quot;awakening&quot; and a patriot movement was inevitable. So, they &quot;planted&quot; their own leader of this movement in advance, to ensure they could control it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah AJ controlled opposition.</p>

<p>He&#39;s simply out here to make conspiracy theorists look bad.  The very existence of this lawsuit has already made conspiracy theorists look bad, had it been somebody other than AJ on the line then the truthers may have had a chance.  It&#39;s gonna end with AJ looking like the fool so that all truth seeker folk also look like fools.</p>

<p>The only thing AJ does well is get legit truth seekers into his show for interviews.</p>
