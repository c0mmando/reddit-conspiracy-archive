       Well I'm here because I got in a heated debate with someone about the possibility of time travel, how it would be used, how it could be covered up and if we would ever know if things had been altered. 
Do you guys have any theories? Do you believe it has been done, if so what convinced you? If you dont believe it has been done tell me why too! 
Lets make some good points on both sides please ðŸ˜‚

       I mean, how could it even be possible? Let's speak logically for a reason. Time isn't constant, it's human-made, correct? Everything is happening all at once. The past/present/future. Are events that have happened stored somewhere? Is life, as it's progressing, being saved somewhere? If not, then how can you go back to something that doesn't exist? The past doesn't exist, it's gone. Because time isn't real. It's just a measurement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that there might be other dimensions or other 'Earth's but I think they are in sync with this Earth, if that makes any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what actual time travel is? If I board on a plane from the UK at 2pm and I land in L.A and it's 6am. Isn't that time travel? I just went from 2pm to 6am.

       Time is not constant, but not human made either. It's part of the fabric of space-time, hence the name. We created units of measurement for it in order to measure entropy, similar to C/F on a thermometer. Temperature wasn't created by humans though, was it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Our current theories of quantum physics in relation to space-time don't discount the possibility that the past, future and present could all happening at the same moment, now (the only moment that 100% exists). If that were the case, the past/future would take place in the same physical location as the present, but in a different location on the 4th dimensional plane, and it would just be a question of being able to access it.  Not saying that I think it's plausible or that it's been done, just saying it's not completely impossible  given what we know at this point.

       now is the only moment you perceive to exist. only you can know what you experience, and you can never truly explain it to anyone else. somehow, we can all relate to eachother and we assume we are all playing the same game.

       My suggestion is to think about dimensionality instead of space-time, the ability to look at our past, present, and future is available as a tool to all who can flex their â€˜intuitionâ€™ muscle.

       Sounds weird, as the space shuttle gets us all filled with wonder in thinking outwardly, exploration can take on many forms...including inward exploration.

       I agree with this. The past isn't some concrete, physical thing. It's memories, it's pictures, it's videos e.t.c So how can you travel to something that doesn't exist?

       Just because I travel from Dallas to Las Vegas, does that mean that Dallas no longer exists?  Sure, to my perception and surroundings, it's "gone", but it obviously still exists.  Its just separated by some spatial dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time is/could be similar.  Just because I've moved away from the "past" doesn't mean the past doesn't exist; it just means I'm no longer there observing it.  If I could move back the direction I came (the 'time' dimension in space-time), then I could observe it.

       Dallas is a physical place. Time is not. That's why I said in my other post that I don't think time-travel is possible, but I do believe there might be other dimensions.

       Yes but if you believe in the afterlife, and near-death experiences? And you may not so perhaps all this is moot, but, people who have had cardiac arrest, gone beyond the "white light" and come back all describe a place in which time has absolutely no meaning. One quote I believe was something to the effect of "you could say it was 10,000 years, or five minutes, and it wouldn't make any difference". So time is a construct here, on this plane. Perhaps it isn't that concrete.

       I still subscribe to the theory that if time were changed, we would not notice the difference.

       The other concept of time travel is why?  Just to do it?  Is there an event that needs to be corrected?

       Pretty sure the issues with time travel is you can only travel forward and back
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       to the point when the time machine began working, and no further back than that, based on the laws of physics, and you need near black hole levels of energy to fuel this. When you travel extremely fast, like near the speed of light levels, you actually age slower than people that are traveling slower than you. The reasoning is complex as you can imagine, but it's been studied in astronauts that spend long periods of time in the ISS that have a twin sibling, where their telomeres (end caps of your DNA that shorten with age) were longer on the sibling that was in the ISS as it travels at a high rate of speed around earth. If you've ever watched Interstellar then you'll see this science actually used as a plot piece in the movie.

       You can just see a scientist adding the final piece of the machine, then the moment they power it on, someone steps out the door of the time machine. Before the inventor even has a chance to blink. Then people just continuously arrive every second.
      </p>

       If that were a limit to how far you'd go back in time, pretty sure alot of people would choose to go back to that time. It would be the best clown-car magic trick ever.

       There was an issue of the comic Planetary that dealt with that, though the main conflict they had was whether or not they wanted to turn the machine on.  They were concerned that creating a working time machine would lock time into a deterministic path instead of an undetermined one with many possibilities.

       No, anytime time you're moving you're aging slower. If you are driving your car, you'll be aging slower than someone who's walking/standing (of course it's like 0.000000000000001 or something like that).

       I'm not entirely sure if the ISS example is really applicable though.  On Earth your already traveling very fast, so it seems doubtful that the the speed experienced by astronauts in the ISS would be different enough to cause any notable differences in aging, especially since both speeds are basically the same when comparing them to the speed of light.  If there is slower aging of astronauts, it seems more likely that it would be caused from being in a reduced gravity environment.

       Is this because current models don't factor in alternate timelines/parallel universes? As timetravel basically implies alternate timelines, unless you're dealing with a set universe in which all events are predetermined. In which case timetravel would be obsolete.

       What if you don't need to go "back" in time.
      </p>

       There's a theory that the universe somehow created itself, along with the suggestion that space is curved, time may also be curved. If you were to picture the universe as existing on the surface of a sphere; when travelling in a straight line, you will eventually end up where you left off (just like walking across a planet).
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the "arrow of time" works in a similar way. If you travel far enough into the future, you eventually end up at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       With time being relative, where blackholes slow down time the nearer you get to them. What if you could create an anti-blackhole to accelerate time from your perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw an interesting video about this the other day, but forget what the title of it was. Simply put, the classic example of drawing two points on a sheet of paper, folding it, to illustrate wormhole travel. It had a similar concept, except if you draw an arrow across the sheet of paper, then roll it into a cylinder... it shows how a curved spacetime might actually have no end nor beginning and time is effectively an infinite loop.

       The main theory that makes "Go back and kill your grandfather" time travel impossible is where traveling would send you back in an alternate universe where anything you do is incorporated into their secondary #2 timeline, while the original #1 timeline goes on without you. Your grandfather dies, so you are never born... but you were never supposed to in timeline #2.  No paradoxes allowed.

       What if an extinct alien civilization invented the same type of machine as you millions of years ago?  Would you be able to go back as far as that?  There's an interesting sci-fi plot lurking somewhere in there.

       You'd only be able to go back if there was a clear way sans a wormhole. The only thing capable of making that kind of energy would be the sun or multiple suns. Some research on the matter has theorized that far more advanced civilizations are able to warp drive through the center of Suns and be teleported to a different system faster because the displaced energy collapse after you pass the sun would propel you faster and farther.

       Stephan hawking Made a news paper listing, to promote a party for any timetraveller. Listing the notice in the newspaper a day late intentionally. No one showed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I want to make is If The "Media" becomes abolished by the mass majority would that time traveler know to look in a news paper, something which didn't exist from their time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the time traveler themselves have no interest in science or exposing themselves. It's selfish to think Steven Hawking would be a beacon to a person where Time Travel could be common place for tourist,military or other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you need to make finding time travelers more common and more widespread. Where would you get funding to run a world wide campaign to attract Time Travelers, A on-going permanent Beacon that appeals to all time-lines and languages. Who's to say any country will still exist in 2460( Random year by example).

       It could also be that a catastrophe of sorts happens on Earth (think; knowledge lost in the library of Alexandria), where any reference to Hawkins time traveller invitation had never survived, so any humans who did manage to invent such as machine wouldn't have known about the invitation, or maybe not even known of Hawkin himself. The world could be almost lost due to a future war or asteroid impact, but humanity rebuilds from the rubble and could rediscover what was previously known -- except everything from quantum/relativity physics is not recognized as a rediscovery.

       It's cool.  My thought is just that any technology gets out to others.  So eventually, even if time travel was heavily restricted, someone would get the tech and go back in time.

       We are all traveling through time... it is our journey. I have no reason to think we will ever be able to go back to point in time that has past. I don't think time is some recorded thing where we can rewind it somehow. Maybe more forward in time... maybe

       Well, isn't that the point of funding a research project? To see if something has a viable use. If people claim to be psychic, that's something you'd want to use for military/intel power, and it makes sense to research it properly -- even if it's most likely there is nothing to it.

       I don't think it's possible due to the rotation of the solar system and galaxy at high speeds relative to us. If you were to go back in time you would be in a much different place than the Earth is and would die unless your time machine doubled as a spaceship.

       Here is a fun fact. The Earth rotates at about 1000 miles per hour. There is a place where they shoot a laser at a reflector on the Moon, to measure it's distance. In the time it takes the lasers light to reach the Moon and return, about 2 seconds, the Earth has moved over 450 feet away from it's starting point.

       That ~1000 mph rotation is only at the equator. The closer you are to the poles, the less you move. When you stand on top of the poles, all you do is turn around very, very slowly.

       I don't think you understood what I wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumference of the Earth is 24,901 Miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth rotates once in 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore it's rotating at 24,901/24 or 1037 miles per hour at the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       1037/60 minutes. In one minute the Earth will rotate 17.28 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       17.28/60 seconds. In one second the Earth has rotated .2880 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I said was in the two seconds that it takes the laser to hit the Moon and return, the Earth would have rotated a few hundred feet away from the reflected returning laser light.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mirrors on the Moon reflect the laser back to the exact same spot, but the Earth has rotated from that spot a few hundred feet away already.

       It's not hard to understand.

       Apparently it

        is hard

       .

      <p>
       The Earth rotates once every 24 hours
       <em>
        respective to the sun
       </em>
       . 
We're not concerned with the sun here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Moon orbits the earth aprx. every 28
       <em>
        days
       </em>
       .
So in your calculation you basically have to divide that distance it moved by 28.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the laser beam itself is 3 miles wide by the time it reaches the Moon!
      </p>
      <p>
       Only a few photons make it back to Earth every second, to catch them they basically have to aim really carefully.
      </p>

       You might want to read up on stuff first and have a little humility that maybe,
       <em>

       We do not yet have a publicly acknowledged theory that fully equates our "time-sense" to some "fourth dimension" which we can access.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we have a huge amount of science that skirts very close to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many problems that have to do with the "access" problem. In a standard Sci-Fi film we would just throw in a "Time Portal". But as far as you and I know, that's a fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's drive past the problem of not having a Time Portal and concentrate on what we would need in order to use a Time Portal safely and effectively, and what such a device would actually do.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the movies there would be a big display with a Year and a Location. That would show you where the Time Portal is going to send you. The Date and Time serve as an index. They themselves are essentially artificially imposed abstractions. To see that, just consider why all creatures and most humans throughout history have never needed either a map or a clock to live full lives - it's just a convenience we have invented in the last few millennium. And I am quite sure God or the Universe does not need to keep a Calendar on His/Its desk.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in order to use the Time Portal, we need to apply this arbitrary index that tells us where/when we want to go, or else we could go who knows where and when. I will call that a Time-Space Index (TSI).
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's where things get interesting. Note we are not talking about the method to get a human to travel (or just view) a different place and time, but rather the TSI which could plausibly point to any given destination. Days, Years, Lats and Longs are UNKNOWN to atomic quanta.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we could crack the problem of creating a valid TSI, then the technology of the Time Portal or the Time Viewer would probably be in reach, assuming we understand black holes and can create a technology that includes a "managed black hole". At this point, we would start talking about neutrinos and similar phenomena, which appear to be able to "fold space-time".
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the TSI. Formulating a TSI would be the equivalent of triangulation in land surveying. If you know some points in a given field, you can find the rest. So this is where understanding a whole range of time-based sciences, from Geology and Paleontology to Ecology and Astronomy, and throw in a healthy dose of History and Genealogy and Archaeology (assuming you want to visit the past of the human species). Using such scientific "databases" we could possibly calculate the necessary TSIs to program the Portal to travel there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's a catch. The Multiverse. If we accept that we live in a universe which includes an infinite number of sub-universes, all overlapping each other (which is a subject treated by other posters to this discussion) then the TSI has to also define which of many possible universes to pick for a given "historical" or "future" TSI.

       Time is just change. Change in appearance. I don't think Time exists. Because we always live in the now. Never tomorrow. Because tomorrow it will be now as well. YEsterday doesn't exist. It was now... Does that make sense? Therefor I think time doesn't exist. And you can't undo the change. So traveling to a different state of change is impossible.

       <em>
        consciousness-driven simulation.
        <br/>
        Computers are things we humans have created to mimick things in nature that are already designed for information processing, like brains. To say the simulation is computer-driven would just be human arrogance.
        <br/>
        It's annoying that saying "simulation" often comes with the assumption of being computer-driven, but that's a bit disingenuous, because we don't *know
       </em>
       that. It's just an extrapolation based on minimal data points. What we can at least say, though, is that this universe
       <em>
        effectively acts
       </em>
       as a simulation, because this isn't the only possible version of things. There's an infinite number of versions of the universe, so therefore this one isn't absolute. It's just one expression. A "simulation" of this set of possibilities, if you will. But attributing it to a computer, simply because we humans have created something that is capable of simulating things (a computer) ignores all the other things that are also just as capable of simulating things.
       <br/>
       I think it's consciousness-driven because I believe matter itself, at a fundamental level,
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       consciousness. It's just energy acting with itself within a self-referential universal feedback-loop system. Consciousness therefore creates a fractal system which, from within, it can experience every possible perspective - from every atom, molecule, and rock, to every plant, animal, or person - across all of time and space available within that universe. At the same time it's also simulating every other possible version of the universe, but on a different base frequency, so as not to allow them significantly "interfere" with one another.

       I wouldn't call it proof because diseases evolve and change so it definitely happens on it's own.  However, time periods/locations such as Central Asia in the mid-late 1330s at the start of the plague could be a place to start investigating.

       ... But what if you just travel some years (past or future), or even  days, or hours? But wait, how would that make it impossible? Is like if you were 100% sure that if you travel to another country, a guy would kill you. How that makes it impossible for you to travel to that country? I mean, sure, you wouldn't want to go to that country knowing that a guy will kill you, but nothing would stop you from going there

       if you go forward in time, they probably have science to overcome whatever lack of immunity you might have. going backward wipes the server. like if we brought a cave man, he might live because we have antibiotics, but, he might expose us to something only he has immunity to. killing us all!

       Native Americans died due to European plagues because they regularly bathed and were generally cleaner.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a time traveller did exist, diseases would be minor compared to altering the space time continuum.  Vaccines, cleanliness, antibiotics, and yet unthunk cures...

       Germ theory is bs.  There is recent evidence of non contacted tribes that whore themselves out to black market tourism.  It's on LiveLeak and YouTube.  None of these tribes are dying out from contact.   Reasons.  Old plague comes from dirty ass Europeans that threw their shit out of a window and drank from rivers they shit in.  Also historians needed a scape goat reason why natives are wiped out.  Sounds more humane that It was sickness, rather than the truth that ancient white Americans murdered huge populations of people.  See Andrew Jackson raiding parties.

       literal travel, probably not. I like the idea of remembering glimpses of the past maybe through DNA somehow, or dreaming moments you might experience in the future. the only way i could see people benefiting from those abilities would be to decipher the past to understand current events but thats just assassins creed

       We are in touch with the future, as we are with the past, they are two mirrors, betwixt them us, all is a mirror in effect. But that mirror, which is both our mind and the mindlessness can destroy us, and eventually will. Or least convince us that we are destroyed until we are once again awakened.

       It's a good question but it isn't the right question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question should be, is prophecy/divination/augury real?  This has been a globally ubiquitous feature of human culture and religious institutions for millennia.  If people can be entangled across space they can also be entangled across time.  It's only a minor variation of the same principle.  So obviously it exists yet nobody openly acknowledges or discusses it and what the implications of that are, for example the business implications, the implications for warfare.

       Follow the money. If you were able to time travel youbwould definetly make use of it. As in making money via sports bets etc.. look into indoviduals who have won large amounts of money via betting on highly unlikely outcomes. Also inflation must be considered. So to successfully transfer money to the future and maintain value a large investment would need to be made immediately. An investment thats stands the test of time such as treasury bills or bonds.. follow the money.. unlessnof course money is not a valid means of sustinance in the future.

       I wouldn't call it proof because diseases evolve and change so it definitely happens on it's own.  However, time periods/locations such as Central Asia in the mid-late 1330s at the start of the plague could be a place to start investigating.
