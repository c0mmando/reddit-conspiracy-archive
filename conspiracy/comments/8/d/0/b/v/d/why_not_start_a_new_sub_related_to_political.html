    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m kind of curious about &quot;old school&quot; conspiracies.</p>

<p>If you were a die-hard conspiracy buff in 1980, what were your leading conspiracy theories?  JFK assassination?  Faked moon landing?  MK Ultra?  What else?  Were there conspiracy theories that have been abandoned or forgotten?</p>

<p>What about 1970?  Were the moon landings being faked a conspiracy in then, even though we were still going to the moon (or still faking it)?  I suppose there were some then-relevant Vietnam conspiracies that lost relevance once the US pulled out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure other conspiracies of longer standing don&#39;t go away -- the various Jewish-centric conspiracies, Catholic church, the Freemasons/Illuminati, etc.</p>

<p>A &quot;history of conspiracies&quot; would be kind of interesting, especially if you had a way to track at what point a supposed event became seen as false or a conspiracy-related event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mods could create a new sub, sticky a post detailing the change at the top of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Allow for a trial period where they warn posters of the change, before resorting to bans. This would go a long way in separating the incessant political posts from legitimate conspiracy topics. Not saying that political posts are a less legitimate type of conspiracy, just that the overall volume tends to drown out important traditional topics, necessitating a separate conspiracy sub for politico minded conspiracy posts.  </p>

<p>Create a sub with no politics (and more importantly, no criticizing Xews, Xionists or Xrael!)</p>

<p><a href="http://redditmetrics.com/r/conspiracyII">Check out the metrics.</a></p>

<p>They tried like hell to promote it, with help from their pals in Subreddit of The Day, and using other schemes (notice the &quot;bumps&quot; on the growth chart, like oversized dildos poking through a filthy sheet?), but it flopped and plopped, and now it just floats there, a stinking, steaming little turd.</p>

<p>some people choose not to for other reasons i think.   and there doesn&#39;t have to be a hardline about it,and there could be crossovers i&#39;m sure. but it would highlight the dumb fucks who still don&#39;t realize that politics is theater for the masses. and we could gently push them to the other sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics is used as a distraction. This sub is a limited hangout. It’s meant to get users to think that politicians play a part other than the puppets that they are. 2 years ago no one in this sub discussed the sham that is politics. Luckily most all accounts that spam politics are not organic. Just keep spreading the truth and new authentic users will be able to recognize the patterns. But yeah, turn off your tv and don’t pay these false idols no mind. Politics is a farce. No different than WWF wrestling </p>

<p>I disagree. I feel like it&#39;s widely accepted among the core membership that very few people and families run the world and the politicians are just tools they use to accomplish their insane goals. People will be angry at politicians for being the face of the action, but it would be much more interesting to know definitively who is pushing them to these ends.</p>
