       The mods should could probably have a throwback Thursday type of thing where only conspiracies from 2001 and older can be posted. Or just wait til this whole Trump thing is over with and we can all have a good laugh and get back to 'normal'... Hopefully

       This is normal now. Outside forces are using the most gullible among us to spread false information about their opponents. They're never going to stop, there is never not going to be an "enemy" that someone is trying to target with disinformation and bring down.

       I'm kind of curious about "old school" conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were a die-hard conspiracy buff in 1980, what were your leading conspiracy theories?  JFK assassination?  Faked moon landing?  MK Ultra?  What else?  Were there conspiracy theories that have been abandoned or forgotten?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about 1970?  Were the moon landings being faked a conspiracy in then, even though we were still going to the moon (or still faking it)?  I suppose there were some then-relevant Vietnam conspiracies that lost relevance once the US pulled out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure other conspiracies of longer standing don't go away -- the various Jewish-centric conspiracies, Catholic church, the Freemasons/Illuminati, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "history of conspiracies" would be kind of interesting, especially if you had a way to track at what point a supposed event became seen as false or a conspiracy-related event.

       just take a break from posting and wade through a decades worth of reddit's archives. lot of good (and bad) info in there. some of it came to light and hit mainstream. some was forgotten. some was blatantly wrong. but the archived posts are there to look into. check em out~

       Mods could create a new sub, sticky a post detailing the change at the top of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Allow for a trial period where they warn posters of the change, before resorting to bans. This would go a long way in separating the incessant political posts from legitimate conspiracy topics. Not saying that political posts are a less legitimate type of conspiracy, just that the overall volume tends to drown out important traditional topics, necessitating a separate conspiracy sub for politico minded conspiracy posts.

       What conspiracies do you feel people are missing out on, that aren't politics related?  Because that would remove any JFK, New World Order, Trump, Clinton, Deep State, CIA, Bilderberg, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I enjoy fun big foot, alien, water engine, etc style stuff too.  But they aren't normally developing conspiracies and once you read about things, it's basically done.

       I just feel that each type of conspiracy (traditional and political) are unique in that they each deserve their own individual platform, as to not muddy each others waters, giving each the unique focus and attention they deserve.

       What do you mean by "traditional"? Political conspiracy is as old as time. It's as traditional as it gets. If by "traditional" you mean stuff like bigfoot or paranormal activity, who do you think would be engaged in hiding that information, besides TPTB, which are the same people responsible for political conspiracy?

       So you just want the main sub to be a bunch of bullshit entertainment with Big Foot etc? There's already a popular sub and topic for that called Cryptozoology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real conspiracies are ALL political, plus almost all of the famous and cookier ones are related/interconnected. Things like child trafficking relate directly to a grand conspiracy about lizard people. Yet you only see the lame modern political angle because YOU WERE primed to and hypnotized by the media with key phrases (faek neews!!1 altriiight sjwwww).

       Unfortunately, some of our favorite and most provable conspiracies have a Political bent to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples: MK-Ultra, Lusitania, Gulf of Tonkin
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, after the political season we had that included various voter fraud, Yellow Journalism, Fake news, and other Conspiracies, we may be tired of the political claptrap and want to get back to finding  more conspiracies involving Business, psionics, alien death rays, technological jihad, the Yeti, Elon Musk's slow takeover of the world, Extra-dimensional travel and other fun things.

      <p>
       Once upon a time, some of the mods at TopMinds0hFrettit dressed up in drag as "disgusted r/Conspiracy users", and tried to do just that:
      </p>
      <p>
       Create a sub with no politics (and more importantly, no criticizing Xews, Xionists or Xrael!)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://redditmetrics.com/r/conspiracyII">
        Check out the metrics.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They tried like hell to promote it, with help from their pals in Subreddit of The Day, and using other schemes (notice the "bumps" on the growth chart, like oversized dildos poking through a filthy sheet?), but it flopped and plopped, and now it just floats there, a stinking, steaming little turd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, it looks like its creator has even abandoned ship.

       Nobody is stopping you from making your own sub. Try doing something about it instead of just bitching. Most conspiracies involve politics. So you'd be better off making a separate non-politic conspiracy subreddit. The problem is those already exist and never get very popular because it's mostly dealing with fantasy nonsense.

       There is also the difficulty that arises when we're dealing with an unresolved "criminal conspiracy" that negatively impacts all kinds of people or bilks the taxpayers out of billions where there is a political cover-up that isn't actually "politically" motivated but rather a criminal abuse of power for strictly private gains.

       some people choose not to for other reasons i think.   and there doesn't have to be a hardline about it,and there could be crossovers i'm sure. but it would highlight the dumb fucks who still don't realize that politics is theater for the masses. and we could gently push them to the other sub.

       Politics is used as a distraction. This sub is a limited hangout. It’s meant to get users to think that politicians play a part other than the puppets that they are. 2 years ago no one in this sub discussed the sham that is politics. Luckily most all accounts that spam politics are not organic. Just keep spreading the truth and new authentic users will be able to recognize the patterns. But yeah, turn off your tv and don’t pay these false idols no mind. Politics is a farce. No different than WWF wrestling

       I disagree. I feel like it's widely accepted among the core membership that very few people and families run the world and the politicians are just tools they use to accomplish their insane goals. People will be angry at politicians for being the face of the action, but it would be much more interesting to know definitively who is pushing them to these ends.

       I understand your resentment at feeling taken over. But you're never gonna get rid of the political conspiracy people, there are too many and they seem pretty enthusiastic. One of you could start a new subreddit, call it nonpolitical conspiracy, post the announcement on conspiracy, and then maybe you can have some semblance of your old conspiracy subreddit back. Or...you all could keep whining about the takeover of your beloved conspiracy subreddit. That'll work too...whichever you prefer.

       IMO it is all by design. There used to be a few hours of good reading on here on a daily basis. Now it is full of shitposts, an I personally think it is the Internets version of paid provocateurs. Go in there, pretend you belong and shit all over everything so much that people lose faith and leave. I do not think a new sub will help.

       Politics is fertile ground for conspiracies.  Talking about politics is fine.  What's wrong is that there is obvious astroturfing and idiots who are more interested in pushing ideology/reaffirming ideology, and creating echo chambers, than talking about actual conspiracies.

       The events of the 2016 clown car were fascinating to watch in real time, and showed that American democracy is now completely bankrupt.  Trump I believe was a trial balloon to see just how much bullshit Americans would swallow... the intended insult of a Jeb/Hillary race wasn't going to fly, but somehow the ruling class made something even more pathetic.
