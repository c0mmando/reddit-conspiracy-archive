I believe it was stated A navy ship (Philadelphia) somehow went invisible and when it reappeared crew members were basically imbued into the ship itself. Most of what I keep finding is just saying the Navy officials say it didn’t happen, but is there any proof to validate or discredit this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t looked into it in a while either. But I do remember reading a lot about it a few years ago. It really is very interesting. I think they were testing a sort of cloaking device to make the Navy Ship invisible. I remember reading accounts of the ship disappearing from Pennsylvania, and appearing for a few second/minutes in Norfolk, VA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember a movie about it. Some sailors ended up going into the future. </p>

<p>The idea I believe was to vibrate the ship at a frequency so that it could not be seen.  An invisible predator. </p>

<p>What happened was the vibrations causes slippage between the atoms of the people and the ship so that they melded with the ship to horrific and deadly results. </p>

<p>Invisibility Tech has been tested by the Armed forces as has variations on Every wave we can think of, Radio, X-ray, Gamma Ray, etc.  As well as light, and we are working on various Laser/Phaser/Plasma light weapons. (I am generalizing here)</p>

<p>Yes, it holds some weight.  That weight being, if R&amp;D thought that something was or is or could be possible to give them a tactical advantage in the theater of war, most likely they have experimented with it or are planning on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ridiculous.
Funny it, like a ton of modern &quot;conspiracies&quot; wasn&#39;t even MENTIONED until some 30 years after the fact. Like Roswell.The ONLY source for this silliness was a supposed letter by a Carlos Allende, to Morris K Jessup. It is sci fi kids&gt; All it was was degaussing, demagnetizing.
Isn&#39;t it strange the USS Eldridge survived the war, was sold to Greece where she served until 1992 (!!) and was scrapped vin 1999.
NO INSTANCES OF ANYTHING WEIRD were observed in all that time.
It&#39;s bullshit, simple Googling will reveal the true story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow if it did happen, I wonder if the sailors even knew...it blows my mind the technology we have and have had for so long.

    <div class="md"><p>Tangentially related but the mechanisms described for how the mishap occurred reminded me of the same in the supposed “time viewer,” the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronovisor">Chronovisor</a> - </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to its inventor, it worked by receiving, decoding and reproducing the electromagnetic radiation left behind from past events. It could also pick up the audio component or sound waves emitted by these same events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, more of this concurrent vibrational overlap business. More glimpses of the miscellany of our atomic all-soup I suppose, if anything holds weight here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weather the Philadelphia Experiment happened or not is one thing, but there is no mistake on how it changed the lives of so many over nearly 75 years now. There is real stories of real people that were affected by this possible event in so many ways, and this is where a lot of the interest truly is. Beyond Carl Allen and a few others there is little. The whole Montauk Project and people involved craziness, is simply that. Weather a ship disappeared in 1943 or not, it sure did impact our popular culture and the future of many good people. My site (<a href="http://www.de173.com">www.de173.com</a>) gives all the facts as depressing as they may be at times as well as some interesting stores. As Mulder would say “I want to believe” but the facts of documented historical events, and quality of witnesses makes this hard at times. With that being said I still continue on researching the subject, one of the few still do original research.</p>
