<p>People also do great things for profit. Capitalism is merely a tool, and it&#39;s the best economic system that we have (bar none). It&#39;s liberated people and lead to human innovation. It&#39;s evident that there is a conspiracy to make people think Capitalism is the problem, when in all actuality, it&#39;s government that is the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is enslaving, not liberating people. What kind of liberty can you have when you are shackled in debt, one crisis away from being homeless?! Can you say anything to your boss? Can you afford to just leave your job?</p>

<p>According to statistics from 2015, among industrialized nations, America was notable for having the highest poverty rate, the lowest score on the UN index of ‘material well-being of children,’ the highest health care expenditures, the highest infant mortality rate, the highest prevalence of mental health problems, the highest obesity rate, the highest consumption of antidepressants per capita, the highest homicide rate, and the largest prison population per capita. By international standards, the rural counties of southern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky qualified as developing countries, as did large sections of American cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, Gary, and many others. So how exactly is Capitalism doing well? Who moved factories overseas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US does not have Free Market Capitalism, if anything, the US is a mixture of Socialism and Fascism. There is absolutely nothing Capitalistic about the US. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve had Central Economic Planning via the Federal Reserve since 1913. We have a plethora of Government subsidizes Social Programs. That&#39;s not Capitalism, and not a Free Market. </p>

<p>Your anger is directed at the wrong culprits. The real culprits to your enslavement is the government. The government has a monopoly, which then allows an environment/setting for Corporations to bribe it into existence.</p>

<p>All Capitalism is, is you have something I want, and I have something you want. We voluntarily trade, and go on our merry ways, having capitalized on the transaction. <em>That&#39;s all it truly is, and the word profit is purely subjective.</em></p>

<p>You then will say: &quot;What about your boss and company profiting off your work&quot;. Well, it&#39;s voluntary. You are willing to trade your time and skill for an agreed amount of compensation. </p>

<p>Hell, if I wanted to work for food instead of Federal Reserve Notes, the only thing really stopping that, <strong>is the government</strong> (ie. labor laws, regulations, etc etc). Even though I value food more than money, I cannot be paid in food. The government forces my boss to pay me in Federal Reserve Notes, then takes a bit off the top (by design).</p>

<p>So tell me again, how the problem is Capitalism, and not the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a bit vague, and you&#39;re going to have to clarify what you mean by the &quot;wage system&quot;, because wages benefit employees just as much as it does for employers.

    <div class="md"><p>It benefits small and big companies. Employees are the biggest loosers in the whole thing, because they work full time, yet they have to be on food stamps. Most of them work multiple jobs just to be able to survive. Some of them live in their cars because they can&#39;t afford to pay the rent. I thought Capitalism rewards hard work, but clearly that&#39;s a lie. Just ask Walmart or McDonald&#39;s employee. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A legit government democratically functioning, would not have the same rules for small/medium business as big corporations.
We need a fair market.
Money has to be removed from politics for this to happen, and secret societies purged.</p>

<p>Friend, socialism often gets the blame for crony type capitalism.
Socialism isn&#39;t even &quot;stuff the government does&quot;, that&#39;s a very common misconception. </p>

<p>The FED is cronyist, profiting disproportionately from our taxes. 
Socialism for the super rich = crony capitalism.</p>

<p>Actual socialism (for the people) is a spectrum of political ideologies as well as an economic component (which also varies dramatically like the economic component capitalism).</p>

<p>Leninism and similar ideologies I don&#39;t like, are part of authoritarian &quot;socialism&quot; like fascism is part of authoritarian capitalism.
But the libertarian socialism range of ideologies is completely different, it&#39;s de-centralized.
This includes center left democratic socialism (Bernie was almost centrist/social democracy FDR type economics)
as well as anarchism, anarcho syndicalism, etc. so it varies a lot.</p>

<p>Socialism isn&#39;t one ideology but many, it tends to have a higher socialism-capitalism ratio compared to the more right wing region of the spectrum. Some types replace capitalism entirely with market socialism or other alternatives.</p>

<p>Anyway, we can have a balanced approach, being considerate of workers, small/medium business and breaking up big corporations.
No one has to suffer.
But removing ALL regulations is a massive trap because we need the good ones.
We need some balance between personal freedom (left wing) and economic freedom (right wing).
Extreme economic freedom benefits the elites as they have too much power (they already have lots of resources, and play dirty).</p>

<p>Obviously the other way the elites can screw us is by extreme authoritarianism like Stalinism, Leninism, fascism, Hitler type dictatorship, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct. The irony is the government is mostly controlled by corporations (that are influenced by power sociopath SEOs, elite central banksters and secret societies).
So removing the lawful middleman, means mafia corporations screw us all
with no rules/laws/regulations/enforcement to stop them.
That would be a corporatocracy or corporate fascism. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg</a></p>

<p>Get money out of politics and we can either have ethical forms of capitalism (less flawed than extreme capitalism) or market socialism, a hybrid (if that&#39;s possible) or other alternatives.</p>

<p>Cut the strings above the puppet.
Government is like a police officer,
he&#39;s on your side....unless corporations/secret societies bribe him (systemic problem).
Removing citizens united would be one of the first steps.</p>

<p>&quot;Free market&quot; used by reasonable people means perfectly competitive market.
While brainwashed people/far right shills (Repub/Tea party/far right libertarian candidates)
use a strawman: they pretend it means &quot;no regulations&quot;.</p>

<p>Bad regulations like cronyist ones should be removed but removing ALL
regulations is retarded, it&#39;s an establishment trap (either full retard dictatorship centralized economics or full retard corporate dictatorship).
Corporations would rule with an iron fist like the laissez faire/victorian era I believe.
Also like Hong Kong (low regulations). This is NEOliberalism.....EXTREME DEregulation of markets(corporations being the most dangerous) and banks (central banks probably the most dangerous).</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, I don&#39;t say &quot;free market&quot; like the shills,
I mean what I say so I describe perfectly competitive market as nearly impossible theoretical nonsense
but the closest would be a fair market (democrtic LAW stopping corporate scum damaging society).
Fair market = only the good regulations, throw out the cronyist garbage that prevent small startups in certain fields, crony capitalist obamacare contracts (corrupt favoritism) that sort of thing.</p>

<p>But good regulations are things like worker rights, environment protection, safety and quality of products, ethics, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even know what capitalism is?  Capitalism does not preclude the existence of a welfare state, or that the state isn&#39;t involved in business.  The modern technocratic state was actually necessary for capitalism to survive, so that the state could subsidize the labor force for capital and guarantee money circulation back to the capitalists, and because the government was able to pump or print money to keep the system going.  Had the US, or Nazi Germany, or Fascist Italy, not started printing money, there would have been no possible recovery from the Great Depression, and the massive die-off would have happened in the 1930s rather than the 2030s as it probably will (or, there would have been a socialist revolution at a really bad time for the ruling class).  The government had to print reams of money again in 2009 to prevent hyperinflation, just to keep the financial system ticking - of course, the people who lost their homes or who were shunted into precarious work, don&#39;t experience any of the so-called recovery.  Far from being antagonistic, government and the business class collaborate to rule together.  What welfare exists is just a concession to the poor, one that is always under the threat of repeal; and the welfare that exists is structured in such a way that groups of the poor are pitted against each other, that the middle class are trained to extreme hatred of the lower class, and that the poor must live on the razor&#39;s edge of poverty thanks to asinine means-testing and reporting requirements.</p>

<p>Capitalism is utterly reliant on government. The system couldn&#39;t function without a state mopping up the mess it creates. A dystopia where market forces dictate the reproduction of society would leave entire dimensions of life unserved; if we&#39;re to have anything like the semblance of a decent life then we need democratic control to direct resource to what society values. </p>

<p>I do agree that one of the problems is government. The natural functioning of capitalism tends towards the concentration of wealth among a small elite, and thus to a government dominated by those that serve this elite. Government in capitalist society usually consolidates and protects elites. </p>

<p>Your error is to misidentify cause and effect, believing that only if unregulated capital can take over greater swathes of society we&#39;ll become more free despite the market leaving very little untouched in recent decades, it&#39;s apparently still not enough! (This is identical to the overly-simplistic argument that some socialists sometimes come out with, that socialism would be a great system only if it were implemented in a pure way.)</p>

<p>The Marxist analysis of capitalism is extremely illuminating, which is why it&#39;s used by political economists the world over, even those who want to create the conditions for capitalism (Marx himself praised capitalism throughout much of his work, whilst at the same time being acutely aware of its contradictions). </p>

<p>Social systems, like ecosystems, are never &quot;pretty straightforward&quot;. It isn&#39;t obvious that the economy, like systems operating across the rest of society, are ultimately sets of social relations between different social groups (capitalists-workers; government-governed; producer-consumers; and so on (much simplification here)). Understanding this helps uncover the way capitalism divides economic and the political: there are many different ways society can make decisions on what and how things are produces and distributed e.g. custom, community decision etc but under capitalism this is privatized i.e. achieved through &#39;free&#39; exchange between workers and capitalists, producers and consumers. This is the economy, and in this way it is <em>de</em>politicized - all power is turned into economic power. These acts might come to have regulations attached to them, which for ideological purists like you leads to accusations of socialism, but this is absurd because the economy continues to rest on contractual exchange. </p>

<p>Which brings us back to the OP&#39;s point - the problems which flow from this are ones borne out of capitalism. There&#39;s no conspiracy here.</p>

<p>Capitalism has it&#39;s faults, but &quot;destroying the world&quot;?  Really?  Capitalism has brought about a drastic increase in quality of life all around the world.  Socialism isn&#39;t destroying the world, only the countries that think it works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aside from few still remaining socialist countries, vast majority are capitalist countries. So why is the world in such miserable place? Why is there so much poverty and hunger in the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t even understand this.  Do you think that the world was less miserable, and that there was less poverty and hunger 200 years ago?  Or 500 years ago?  or 1000?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there so much hunger in United States?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn&#39;t.  The government categorizes hunger in terms of &quot;food security&quot;.  Only one category, very low food security, signifies actual lack of food.  In this category, normal eating patterns of one or more household members were disrupted and food intake was reduced at times during the year because they had insufficient money or other resources for food.  In 2016 this was 4.9% of US households.  Obviously it would be better if it were 0%, but that statistic itself is too broadly defined, and basically useless for anything other than propaganda.  If one family member misses one meal in a year, that household is considered a very low food security household.  Actual fatal malnutrition or starvation is very rare in the US, or any first world country for that matter.  And yet a person who is actually starving to death is counted in the same category as someone who missed one meal last year.  </p>

<p>And if you think hunger is bad in the US, how do you feel about communist countries where 100 million people starved to death in the 20th century?  Of course, that isn&#39;t &quot;true socialism&quot; so it doesn&#39;t count, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of things that people in the west take for granted are socialized or resulted from struggle inspired by socialist thought. Surely you don&#39;t want firefighters responding according to people&#39;s credit score?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Come on now.  You know that firefighters are not an example of &quot;socialism&quot;.  Socialism is collective ownership of the means of production.  And there were fire brigades long before there were socialists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If west didn&#39;t sabotage economically and militarily every socialist country, we would have many more socialist countries.</p>

<p>And they would turn into authoritarian dictatorships, or collapse.  Probably both.</p>

Why don&#39;t we ask them how great capitalism is? Your debt-supported standard of living is made possible by exploiting people and their resources. Not to mention pollution and killing of the planet for sake of profit.</p>

<p>Let me mention some other things socialism-inspired labour movement was able to win for you to enjoy:</p>

<p>End child labor</p>

<p>Establish the legal right of workers to form unions and collectively bargain for wages, benefits and working conditions</p>

<p>Establish the 8 hour work day and paid overtime</p>

<p>Win workers&#39; comp benefits for workers injured on the job</p>

<p>Secure unemployment insurance for workers who lose their jobs</p>

<p>Secure a guaranteed minimum wage</p>

<p>Improve workplace safety and reduce on the job fatalities</p>

<p>Win pensions for workers</p>

<p>Win health care insurance for workers</p>

<p>Win paid sick leave, vacations, and holidays as standard benefits for most workers</p>

<p>Win the right for public sector workers to collectively bargain</p>

<p>Win passage of the Civil Right Acts and Title VII which outlaws job discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin</p>

<p>Win passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act</p>

<p>Win passage of the Family Medical Leave Act</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about hunger using numbers instead of vague %. </p>

<p>More than 48 million Americans lived in households 
that struggled to put food on the table in 2014. 1 In 5  or 16.2 million is the number of children in the United States who don’t know when their next meal will be.</p>

<p>100 million number is a joke, just like the &quot;Black Book of Communism&quot; it was taken from. Author of that book was pulling the numbers out of his a**. </p>

<p>How many people capitalism killed and is killing every year? Every year 20.000,000 million people die from easily preventable causes. So every 5 years capitalism kills 100 million, not because of lack of resources but because it&#39;s not profitable. That&#39;s not counting all the imperial wars. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure imperialism —a highest form of capitalism—has dramatically improved lives of people living in Africa, Asia, and South America. Why don&#39;t we ask them how great capitalism is? Your debt-supported standard of living is made possible by exploiting people and their resources. Not to mention pollution and killing of the planet for sake of profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Soviet Union was pretty fucking imperialist.  After the communist revolution, Russia took over every country on it&#39;s borders and supported uprisings and overthrow of governments all over the world.  And pollution has nothing to do with capitalism.  That&#39;s just a ridiculous assertion.  Producing energy and goods causes pollution, no matter what economic system a country operates under.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me mention some other things socialism-inspired labour movement was able to win for you to enjoy:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of this is socialism.  Socialism is the collectivization of the means of production.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s talk about hunger using numbers instead of vague %.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Percentage is a number.  It&#39;s not vague at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than 48 million Americans lived in households that struggled to put food on the table in 2014. 1 In 5 or 16.2 million is the number of children in the United States who don’t know when their next meal will be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I stated in my previous comment, 4.9% of US households were categorized as &quot;very low food security&quot; households.  This is the only category where anyone actually went hungry.  You criticized me for using &quot;vague&quot; percentages, then you post &quot;struggled to put food on the table&quot;.  That&#39;s pretty fucking vague, my friend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>100 million number is a joke, just like the &quot;Black Book of Communism&quot; it was taken from. Author of that book was pulling the numbers out of his a**.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even the most communist friendly estimates put the number at 30+ million.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every year 20.000,000 million people die from easily preventable causes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I looked that up, and none of this shit is because of capitalism.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventable_causes_of_death#Worldwide">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventable_causes_of_death#Worldwide</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing, Soviet Union and imperialism in the same sentence. Was Soviet Union a Socialist or Communist country? </p>

<p>The Soviet Union was certainly not a communist society, even by their own admission. Communism, by definition, precludes the existence of a state.</p>

<p>Socialism requires that the means of production be held by the workers. 
There was never Democratic control of the means of production in Soviet Union, so it wasn&#39;t socialist either.</p>

<p>I said labour struggle was inspired by Socialism and it&#39;s principles, which led to better wages and working condition everyone enjoys. Workers had to fight Capitalist class for the most basic rights.</p>

<p>Are you seriously going to quote Wikipedia as source of reference? It&#39;s a known fact that conservative think tanks are rewriting Wikipedia to fit Capitalist narrative. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s breakdown the 20,000,000 figure:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>9 million people die of hunger and hunger-related diseases every year. (<a href="https://www.mercycorps.org/articles/quick-facts-what-you-need-know-about-global-hunger">https://www.mercycorps.org/articles/quick-facts-what-you-need-know-about-global-hunger</a>) </p></li>
<li><p>1 million people die from malaria each year. (<a href="https://www.unicef.org/search/search.php?querystring_en=Malaria+statistics&amp;amp;hits=&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;navigation=&amp;amp;Go.x=0&amp;amp;Go.y=0">https://www.unicef.org/search/search.php?querystring_en=Malaria+statistics&amp;amp;hits=&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;navigation=&amp;amp;Go.x=0&amp;amp;Go.y=0</a>) </p></li>
<li><p>9 million people die every year from hunger and malnutrition (<a href="https://www.enoughmovement.com">https://www.enoughmovement.com</a>) </p></li>
<li><p>3 million people die from curable disease (<a href="http://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/global-immunization/diseases-and-vaccines-world-view">http://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/global-immunization/diseases-and-vaccines-world-view</a>) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So when you add the numbers, it&#39;s actually more than 20. I have to post separate reply just for imperialism death count. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marx&#39;s point wasn&#39;t that capitalists were mean and evil people and that if capitalists were nice the system would work.  Marx was exposing the contradictions of capitalism, in the framework of the classical political economy models of Smith, Ricardo, etc.  The solution of the ruling class was to develop an ideological version of economics, and essentially start worshipping the market as a deity rather than as something connected to reality.</p>

<p>That capitalism is a fucked system does not rule out, however, that the ruling class wouldn&#39;t do bad things for their own reasons, or that capitalists would collude in an unfree market.  Marx was specifically looking at capitalism in its supposed ideal state, and the contradictions he exposed were inherent to that system such that an &quot;ideal&quot; capitalism was a logical impossibility.  It is far more likely - and indeed it was true even in Marx&#39;s time - that capitalism would give way to monopolies and state capitalism, in which case looking at a free market is not particularly relevant, and we&#39;re back to lords ruling over wage-serfs and keeping an essentially enslaved population (or worse, actual slaves).  Although capitalism guarantees that participants must look to profit and thus capitalism needs to be abolished for freedom, the people who do rule over us would do so under form of political economy and do so for reasons that transcend the logic of capital.  That&#39;s my take from experience, anyway; I&#39;m not the best expert in Marxism, but I did read through Capital unlike a lot of people (and I think everyone should read Capital, as it is particularly relevant in 21st century capitalism, and it surprised me just how well Marx saw things coming from his vantage point).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is fucking stupid. Nearly all conspiracies come from government agencies looking to secure their power. Capitalism is the absence of government for private ownership of the means of production. Therefore the more the government gets involved the less capitalistic the economy is, or the less free market it is. The problem is the government (the one institution that has monopoly on force and can do anything to you against your will), not capitalism. What was the last time Walmart tried to steal your guns, or invade a country to get it&#39;s oil? Now of course, corrupt corporations DO exist. But ask yourself why. The answer is always because they are in bed with the government, giving them an advantage over the competition, destroying the nature of capitalism. If capitalism is simply people being able to privately own things, and privately sell them, then anything else than that would require more government power to intrude on the market, and if you are a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regular and still think trusting the government to fuck over ordinary people is a smart thing to do, than you are a fool. The solution is not forcing a huge tyrannical communist government akin to the USSR, at that point there is pretty much no conspiracy because the government is already living in their own small version of 1984.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even know what capitalism is?  Capitalism does not preclude the existence of a welfare state, or that the state isn&#39;t involved in business.  The modern technocratic state was actually necessary for capitalism to survive, so that the state could subsidize the labor force for capital and guarantee money circulation back to the capitalists, and because the government was able to pump or print money to keep the system going.  Had the US, or Nazi Germany, or Fascist Italy, not started printing money, there would have been no possible recovery from the Great Depression, and the massive die-off would have happened in the 1930s rather than the 2030s as it probably will (or, there would have been a socialist revolution at a really bad time for the ruling class).  The government had to print reams of money again in 2009 to prevent hyperinflation, just to keep the financial system ticking - of course, the people who lost their homes or who were shunted into precarious work, don&#39;t experience any of the so-called recovery.  Far from being antagonistic, government and the business class collaborate to rule together.  What welfare exists is just a concession to the poor, one that is always under the threat of repeal; and the welfare that exists is structured in such a way that groups of the poor are pitted against each other, that the middle class are trained to extreme hatred of the lower class, and that the poor must live on the razor&#39;s edge of poverty thanks to asinine means-testing and reporting requirements.</p>
