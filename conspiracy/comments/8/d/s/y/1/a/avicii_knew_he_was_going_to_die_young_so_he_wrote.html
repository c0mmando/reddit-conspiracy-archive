       First of all, rip Avicii, your music was one of the bests of all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Avicii has been sick for a long time, he was having problems that no 25 years is ready for. Very scary problems. He could embed on his music some hidden messages for us. He was very smart, probably into these kind of thing as an artist.
      </p>
      <p>
       On "The Days" he tell us how broken he is and how he "will never get old". "Promises he couldn't keep." There are others hidden messages. Pay attention.

        https://youtu.be/JDglMK9sgIQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       On "The Nights" he tell us exactly how he wishes to be remembered (watch on YouTube) and a lot of messages as how they was the best time of his life and he wishes they people remember that awesome life. Observe the personal real footage.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, "The Days" +" The Nights" = "The Whole Life"

       RIP. The news was a shock still, even though he's been sick. To be fair, he partied really hard, and with his money and access to drugs in the scene I'm sure his body took a beating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this is in conspiracy though -- he was one of the biggest EDM artists, crushed Vegas, and recently announced he was going to stop touring.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “To me it was something I had to do for my health,” he says of his decision to quit touring. “The scene was not for me. It was not the shows and not the music. It was always the other stuff surrounding it that never came naturally to me. All the other parts of being an artist. I’m more of an introverted person in general. It was always very hard for me. I took on board too much negative energy, I think.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Could his death be tied to this and him not bringing money in anymore for the higher powers? In Vegas or elsewhere?

       Wouldn't the want him back performing so they continue making money off him?

       Cant do that if he's dead.

       I suppose now their could be greatest hits albums and the like, but that would dry up a lot quicker than his return to producing and performing would.

       Yea, logically it doesn't make sense -- but if he was refusing to perform or produce for them, they wouldn't make money off him (not sure about what his deals were like, so it's pure speculation).

       I meant it kind of like the mob or cartels -- once you are in -- you're in, and the only way out is through death.

       Sorry you're getting downvoted. I don't know why as I agree. This post is cheapening someone's tragic death, cashing in on the fact artists express themselves in their art as though it's some hidden thing. Stupid disrespectful post.

       None of that was said. He said Avicii knew he was dying so he left his fans a little goodbye message. How the FUCK is that disrespectful? It's like you were expecting to read some theory about him being murdered or some other conspiracy just because it was in this subreddit, and when it didn't you still took it that way because you came into the thread with that expectation and couldn't turn your preconceived offended-mode off.

       I see in a way that if this theory is right, we are honoring him by understanding his hidden messages. In case that i am wrong, we are still discussing his art.
However, I don't know that conspiracy was the right place to post it

       Exactly. At least wait for a few days, gather some info and be sensible about it. Someone died, for fuck's sake, don't try to milk this for karma.

       Yeah, that's what happens when you take enough drugs to kill an elephant every day. Also this is kind of a self fulfilling prophecy, you think you'll die young so you "enjoy life", take a bunch of drugs ans die young

       Hello Dog's'ass,
We can only assume that he took a lot of drugs. However, many DJs and people take a lot of drugs and don't die that young.

       And many do. Some get lucky but some don't, that's life. That's like saying that a car accident wasn't real because "many people drive cars and don't die in car accidents"

       What are you even talking about? Many do, and many don't - exactly. The guy you replied to never said it "wasn't real". Also, did any of the people who died in car accidents write a song about it before it happened?

       Numbers do not lie, but people do and people also have a habit of forming patterns about everything as it's a form of survival. Recognizing patterns helped us avoid predators, by learning their habits and recognizing when something was a green bush and when something was a lion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only 10 numbers but an endless amount of configurations AND when every number corresponds to some arbitrary and vague meaning, you're bound to find a connection every single fucking time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy on the video said every single celebrity death ever in existence was 100% caused by "the federal government", despite the fact that Avicii is swedish and not american, and apparently he thinks celebrities are immortal and don't die without being murdered so he's more indoctrinated with the celebrity brainwash than he realizes.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's applying superhuman traits to celebrities as if they are some immortal deities or icons just for his amusement on a screen, or robots that just perform and entertain until they are deemed expired and promptly murdered by "the federal government" on specific dates and times by the second.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Okay Avicii is getting old and boring, let's wait until the clock strikes exactly this or that then turn him off, wow it sure is fun here at the federal government, murdering immortal swedes"

       and not many people cared about. I really just wanted do discuss it, since that in my head it makes a lot of sense and is a big thing. But right now I am not sure if conspiracy was the right place anymore =)
