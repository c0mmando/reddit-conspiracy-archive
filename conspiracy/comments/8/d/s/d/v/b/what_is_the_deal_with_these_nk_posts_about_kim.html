    <div class="md"><p>Yes, according to Q anon, Trump met with Kim Jung Un last November during Trump&#39;s visit to Asia.  Apparently, they met in the Secret City in China.  NK was being controlled by certain bad actors, such as the CIA, and was being used to threaten war and destabilize Asia.  NK was also being used for other evil reasons, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and organ trafficking, among other things.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His testing facility was more or less destroyed. By saying this he appears to have finished his program and his people will ‘love him’ more  while giving himself an excuse to abandon the facility. And let’s be honest all he wants is the sanctions to be lifted so this provides the path to get that during the talks. The reunification or open borders is just a ruse to get halfway. He is no dummy at all and will probably get exactly what he wants. No sanctions and crazed followers. The only concession will likely be allowing nuclear inspectors on site to monitor his stockpile. </p>
