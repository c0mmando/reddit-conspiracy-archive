       Grammatically incorrect rant feeling, but it is the exact feeling I'm having right now.   Just think where the human experience would be if we were allowed to build upon things positively and not covet the hidden secretive crap  that only serves to slow down our progress.

       Not that i'm entitled to knowledge that others discovered but the potential cover-up things an entire previous society knew would be inexcusable.

       Hahaha!  A lot of us feel this way.  It would be nice to have our lives back.

      <p>
       You are totally right, though.  We have to deal with this shit and put a stop to it for the benefit of future generations.  I have relatives that fought in WW1 and WW2, and probably the other wars, so I am not complaining about dealing with this.  I know that you are not complaining either.  We all just became aware of something that we cannot ignore.

       What would your ideal life involve? Day to day, I mean. How do you imagine a better world?
      </p>
      <p>
       After a few years of conspiracy 'research', I one day realised that I don't even know what the 'ideal' world would look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess things changed for me when I realised just how utterly moronic the average normie really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just give them daily tasks, some money to buy drugs and alcohol and shiny things, and they will be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then when you throw in the
       <a href="http://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">
        unspoken myths
       </a>
       , it all becomes a tangled mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am getting at is, are things really so bad? Or is that our own minds making us feel like victims?

       I get your point and in some regard I wish I could just go back and be a sheep.  But in the end there's some congenital, internal itch that I need to scratch.  It's not about obtaining any type of ideal life, it's simply about learning the truth.  Day to day I'm a pretty happy dude but in my free time I'm often driven to dig deep into topics most people who know me would be shocked that I even countenance.

       we are like animals born in a large zoo.... we know we are not free and want to be.  many think they are free because the chains are invisible and were there before we were born. we need to get rid of the chains of debt and tax so we can have free time to evolve. but we can't with the lifesuckers/parasites on us.

       Ideal world is one where rather than struggling and working tirelessly to afford food and clothing and bills and shelter, humans would be given those things at an EXCEPTIONALLY cheap price, due to robots and automation, giving humanity as a whole more FREE time to enjoy life and pursue the things that make them happy, notably artistic ventures such as painting, making music, wood working, etc. When you're not worried about how to get food on your plate, or how to pay rent, then the stress of that search is obliterated and the spirit is freed up to do what serves itself best, which is the fulfillment of dreams.

       I'm torn between agreeing with you and disagreeing. 
When humans have to work together for resources or to achieve a greater common goal they are happier and better adjusted emotionally. When faced with having too much time on their schedule they seek stimulation through petty conflicts and seek drama to replace the experience of being out in the wild. If left to their own devices people who aren't driven to achieve a goal will not work towards something positive. In short, most people can't handle the truth.

       Yeah, the real ideal world would be one where we just embraced our animal side and try to live more naturally. No marriage controlled by some government or church - just be together if you want to with anyone and everyone (as in open relationships/multiple partners - no reason to pretend that all humans are all about monogamy), no one is forced to wear clothes, a small governing body and everyone living in small communities etc.

       Modern life is super toxic and depressing. Everyone pretends to be something they're not, down to the smallest of things when we all just want to relax and be real. We should still punish bad people and "crimes", but it should be less about lawyers and lawsuits and more about the actual truth. People should be free to trust their gut instinct.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to say is that modern western culture is plastic and fake from the inside out. Everything is made into a product to make money and that money is used to keep everyone dependent on those same products. Money isn't money, it's a control mechanism. Capital, literally. To keep people in a hamster wheel that eats our spirit (as in happiness, not the mystical kind).
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone just wants to feel like they're not being stalked by their phones and billboards with hidden cameras that record our reactions and expressions into a database for advertising to make more money to create more phones that record us and billboards that have hidden cameras that spy on us to make more money so that we can have more advanced phones that spy our every move even more effectively so that they can make more money to make better billboards and then also use that money to bribe people or make them sell out their friends who might be harming the making of money and phones that spy on us--

       The wheels of time will unwind,
the return to the origin, divine. 
This world has been a proving ground of sorts for 6000 years, we are soon entering the 7000th year of rest where everything including death will be reversed for 1000 years.

       Paradoxical as it may sound, part of what it means to have the human experience here on Earth is to experience being as utterly limited as we presently are.

       Yeah.  Bit chilly indeed.  Gotta learn to be chilly though - to live and function and succeed through and in spite of the chilliness.  That's part of how we learn and grow and become and even greater and more evolved and advanced human in the first place.  You don't just jump from kindergarten to college, do you?  No.  You have to evolve slowly - go through all the classes...and a lot of those grades
       <em>
        suck
       </em>
       .  A lot of school
       <em>
        sucks
       </em>
       .  However, one would be well advised to not drop out and to experience as much of this "human school" as possible.  Part of having the "full school/human experience" involves often having extremely shitty classes and extremely shitty teachers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gotta keep fighting and come out of it on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not being robbed.  Part of your learning - all of our learning - involves experiencing the bullshit we're presently going through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely shitty, to be sure - these classes definitely suck as far as I'm concerned - but the sooner we get through them and get them done and over with and learn from them, the sooner we can move on to the next, more evolved set of learning and classes.

       But you didn’t link the rest of what I said, which was the most important part.  Part of our learning is
       <em>
        what?
       </em>
       Part of our learning is EVOLVING THROUGH the difficulties we face.
      </p>
      <p>
       In none of that is there any mention of “taking it like a compliant slave.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of evolving through the difficulties might involve fighting off negative individuals and figures.  Part of it involves zen and rising above figures that attempt harm, yes, but sometimes other parts of it involve fighting and possibly killing those figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       But never ever - whether one is zen or actively, physically fighting - is doing nothing at all ever recommended.

       There's this meme I see floated from time to time, usually in conversations such as this one, that goes something like "this reality is like a school to train our consciousness in preparation for higher levels of reality, and the reason we face so many easily remedied hardships created by the elite control class is their desire to kick-start our evolution so that we can "get there" faster".
      </p>
      <p>
       I dig that what I quoted out above isn't nessesarily the same thing you are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean by "propagated by the black lodge" is that I think this meme was pushed by that same "elite control class" to get people to focus on themselves, their journey, and largely ignore the fact that we are all in this together. We aren't getting out of this energy farm unless we do it together.

       But you can’t ignore that we are all in this together if you understand that the only way to overcome what the elite are going on this planet is to all come together and fight together through the problems they created and that we ignorantly allow.

       That's a bit tricky since there's no direct concept of "shopping cart" in Latin, but I'll give it a shot lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Retribui cartallus"
      </p>
      <p>
       Cartallus is the word for "basket" which would be the closest idea to a shopping cart, and Retribuo is the idea of giving back or recompense, as opposed to the verb Redeo, which means to personally return somewhere. So, using the perfect form of Retribuo, which is Retribui, the phrase I just made says: "I returned the basket".

       I don't have an issue with someone profiting from their discovery,  but it an entire culture had shared knowledge that was later hidden (libraries burned, etc) just so that information could become secret and private then fuck that.

       My friend’s dad was a “conspiracy nut”. No such thing as the internet; he had to scrabble his alternative news from all over, and built a huge CB antennae to be able to chat with like-minded folks. He even got a visit from the FBI for checking out too many books about Tesla from the library.

       Compared to him, only one generation back, we have so much more available to us - particularly community. As cliche as it is, it’s the sentiment in “The Matrix” - that you can’t put your finger on it, but something is not right, and nobody around you seems to see it.

       Even though I get sent down the rathole about Atlantis or whatever from reading this stuff, it’s nice to know I’m not alone, and not crazy, in thinking some things just don’t add up. Cuz I watched “

       It happened a few years before I knew the family, during the late ‘80s, so it’s hearsay, but I believe him. Apparently the feds took interest in people checking out Tesla books as seriously as the Poor Man’s James Bond or the Anarchist Cookbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two men is suits with badges came in, sat on their couch and politely asked him why he was so interested in Tesla’s inventions, and about his political leanings. He had this massive, barely legal CB antenna too (which he powered illegally from time to time), so he fit a certain profile. They asked him this question a number of different ways, and recited which books he had checked out and when. He asked how they got that information, and they refused to say. He asked if he should have a lawyer present, and they said “You can, but that won’t help your case.” Eventually they left and he never heard from them again, but it scared the shit out of his wife.

       It was definitely the “government is bigger than you and don’t give a damn about you” story of my youth. I’ll grant it’s got no proof behind it, but I never questioned its authenticity.

       I know how you feel. But, by the same token, so much information is out there. Just being on the internet gives you so much knowledge- there are vasts amounts of knowledge and skills that you can learn for the price of an internet connection and a few hours of your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time is very important, and I've re-structured my life around quite a bit around how I spend my time- how much do I watch tv? Play video games? Go out with friends? Ready? Learn a new skill? Work? Travel to work? Visit family? Sleep? Am I really doing the things that will help me advance my own "human experience"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've worked jobs with friends that taught themselves programming, started their own businesses, and are now living financially independent lives while I am driving to and from my 9-6 every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know people who sold all their stuff, and moved across the country to set up a new life in a totally different city. Some of them hit it big, some sold all their stuff and moved back with a bunch of experiences.
      </p>

       Math, science, art, music, physical experiences... the ability to do them happens almost every day. You need to DO them. Spiritually there are still teachers out there teaching meditation and methods of self help and self improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there are some people who don't have the health, the wealth, the time, to take advantage of all of this. They might be disabled, they might be in debt, they might have family responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time, when I started cutting things out of my life- not watching any tv during the week, for instance, I realized how many hours I spent doing nothing. When I stopped buying drinks when I "went out" with my friends, I realized how much money I was frittering away.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's still a lot of room to enjoy the human experience on this planet. Don't get me wrong, I think we're becoming a prison planet more and more every day. But we aren't there yet.

       I wish people can experience some of the peaks you unlock from Kriya Yoga, Meditation, and freeing your consciousness to be able to go outside of your body.....holy fucking shit was I not ready to go through all of that and witness all those things at the time when I did, but I do not regret them one bet and can never return to my previous ignorance prior to that time
      </p>

       I know for certain, we will reach a Utopia and our peak Evolution is to reach the Enlightened post everything state. But its going to take at least another 500-2000 years for us to get there, and probably colonized on a different planet

       I disagree. Say we started a small country somewhere. The people who have accessed Enlightenment on a permanent basis are so few and fair between, and those that have often times care less for starting a society (because of transcendence) outside of teaching others in a smaller (Monastery) community how to access enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lets just say you convince enough Yogis/Masters/Christs to do something like this. Its still going to take a shitload of time to put forth the rules, regulations, infrastructure, trade, Gov, education, etc to run the thing, and if you start thriving and growing, then the Globalist Psycho controllers will soon invade you when they see you are not connected to the World Fed Bank system. This is why Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and Now Syria all got invaded was because these places had their own gold and own independent banking/economies not plugged into the Beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are soooooooo many factors involved in this, its not as simple as "Have everybody practice X to reach enlightenment and then we will have Utopia." Certain souls are too immature, too underdeveloped to even be able to understand disconnecting from ego, one pointed concentration, love, humbleness, selflessness, etc. Many or most souls need bread crumbs and to just learn to read and be civilized before even entering into the higher things

       As a fellow gnostic ( gnostic hermeticist here) I think the solution is as simple as people believing this kind of thing (eg that humans can live together peacefully and work towards a common goal, namely: Growth) is possible.

       thing is, gangs still want to kill each other, drug addicts still want their fix, pushers still want their money, big pharma still wants its power, ad infinitum. We're going to need to reach some post industrial era where all of the above is minimized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing is that you can find some interesting socialist experiments in some of Scandinavian countries (and China's Silicone valley called

       ) where people reach a state of being able to start Universal Basic Income trials, relatively peaceful, prosperous, etc.....but guess what? There is a level of homogeneity via race, and all of that get disrupted when this one element changes (See Sweden rape and crime epidemic after bringing in millions of 3rd world economic migrants who came to take advantage and 90% remain always on Gov handouts)
      </p>

       There are so many issues, imbalance, complexities, geopolitics, etc that wont allow us to to get to where we know we should be living life: Utopia, abundance, peace, Enlightenment, balance

       As a person of faith, I think about this a lot but in a somewhat different way. I believe in a heaven, an afterlife, and aside from it being happier and perfect and all that great stuff? One of the best things would be to finally know TRUTH after living in a world of lies and bull! To finally know the answers to mysterious things, definitively. It's popular nowadays to use the phrase "your truth", "my truth". Won't it be heaven itself to just finally know the muthaf***in TRUTH? It is to me...

       You aren’t entitled to anything, just judging by the tone of your post you sure as hell don’t sound like you have done anything to deserve access to the universal stream of consciousness or are even in the ballpark of knowing how to start to unlock 46.

       Technically none of it is actually hidden. It is “occulted”, i.e. removed from view, but you’ll readily find it if you look for it. Don’t expect it to be spelled out on TV though.

       its funny that so many feel this way nowadays. i also love to dig into potential ancient knowledge and stuff. but really the truth is in your own experience. we just have been conditioned to look outside to find answers. you are the universe being aware (which might be the truth most unknowingly are looking for). its just really not that easy to realize cuz this being a person experience is really sticky

       I really wish I could upvote this more!!!! I've come to realize that this is the ultimate realization of the truth. It's the closest that we are to be given in this plane of existence. Once this is actually realized by a person a vast expanse of knowledge and experience opens up to them.

       Boohoo, I lived before youtube and internet. Now I can spend all day watching hi-def films of the  micro world or the macro world or the deep sea or some other planet, with a few key strokes I can access free university classes, lectures,libraries on every conceivable topic. I have acsess to hi-def photos of all the planets and billion dollar telescopes. Want to watch the life cycle of some obscure ocean parasite with a few keystokes? Want to see a walking protein motor? Ever curious what a real  atom looks like? How about a 3 hour lecture on Black Holes or Yam economics of indigenous New Guinea?

       <em>

       They dont have secret knowldge, and thats their real secret. Theyre just bullshitting you and if you fall for it, they can use you and manipulate you.

       It's hard to argue against your point, as it is a valid one. But there's not a lot one can do to change it. I think it's important to remember the incredibly amazing time we're living in right now! I'd rather be loser me living in this time of electricity than be just about ANY famous historical figure you care to name prior to its implementation! That to me is cause for celebration, big time! So, don't worry, be happy!

       Too much of what we see, is about conservative push for the win for us and not for "them". It's childish but dominates much of politics and establishment think atm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The win-win is not the same as a draw. The thought that we must "win" first and that others should not, is very limiting. There are many real world situations in which a win-win is the only out.. but we can't let the others win, so m.a.d.ness prevails.

       Putting the other down I wonder stems in part from insecurity, which perhaps accounts for a lot of America's problems and behaviour.

       What would your ideal life involve? Day to day, I mean. How do you imagine a better world?
      </p>
      <p>
       After a few years of conspiracy 'research', I one day realised that I don't even know what the 'ideal' world would look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess things changed for me when I realised just how utterly moronic the average normie really is.

      <p>
       Just give them daily tasks, some money to buy drugs and alcohol and shiny things, and they will be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then when you throw in the
       <a href="http://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">
        unspoken myths
       </a>
       , it all becomes a tangled mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am getting at is, are things really so bad? Or is that our own minds making us feel like victims?
