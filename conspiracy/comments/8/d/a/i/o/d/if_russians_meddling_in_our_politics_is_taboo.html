<p>We already knew foreign governments didn&#39;t like Trump before we elected him.  Obviously Canada has something to lose here if Trump scraps NAFTA (please do!) So stay the fuck out of our business.</p>

<p>Well the Canadians for one seem to think they get a special vote in our policies because &quot;it effects their country what we do here&quot; as if that&#39;s not the case for Russia also.</p>

<p>More on that, this particular user even participates in the /russialago sub and is clearly obsessed with US politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America is a free country, which means anyone, including foreigners, can come here to lobby the government or give their opinions on US politics. </p>

<p>What they <em>can&#39;t</em> do is give money or value to campaigns, illegally hack into the private computer systems of political candidates and release their communications, or hack into into state election databases -- which Russia is accused of doing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also an additional concern when commentary isn&#39;t just foreign people giving opinions, but an intelligence operation by a foreign government using fraudulent accounts to try and drive US public opinion and by extension leadership and policy decisions.  I&#39;m not sure how the law shakes out on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump isn&#39;t going to do shitall because Trump is literally brain-dead.  Anyone who knows anything about the American system could tell you it doesn&#39;t matter who is President, because all of the power has been delegated to unelected bodies of various sorts.  It is well known that congresspeople don&#39;t even read the laws they are passing.</p>

<p>OP is a fascist troll and we all should know what needs to be done with fascists, but still - it doesn&#39;t matter if the dumbass puppet wins or loses.  Trump, Le Pen, Farage, and their ilk are painfully predictable, and put up intentionally because the rulers want people to believe the choice is between our incompetent wannabe-technocratic elite and the most retarded form of fascism ever known to man.  Since the fascists and technocrats don&#39;t have a real substantive difference in their stance towards everyone else, it&#39;s win-win for both groups, and the ruling class loves having legions of dumbfuck rightwingers who can be manipulated into doing anything, into killing anyone.</p>

And after we put down the actual fascist, the dumb fucks keep trying to rewrite history and pretend like the fascism grew out of anything other than a collectivist utopian promise.</p>

<p>Just like Hitler, just like Stalin, just like Venezuela.</p>

<p>Meanwhile capitalism has actually reduced global poverty and provided real opportunity for billions of people instead of purging them because it&#39;s too difficult.</p>
