<p>The mods of r/the_donald ban users to censor their political speech. They do this secretly, it is not official policy that is posted about anywhere even if people like you and me know that this happens. </p>

<p>When a group of people secretly get together and decide to do something harmful (like attempting to deceive millions of redditors with propaganda), that is ABSOLUTELY a conspiracy. The mods conspire to deceive, they are a conspiracy. I&#39;d agree generally that we don&#39;t need a thread about every single person banned like this, but even so, op is still absolutely describing a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he did drain the swamp into his cabinet, so technically he wasn’t lying :) </p>

<p>Joke aside, what many fail to realize is that in order to have an über-warmongering spokesperson (i.e. “president”), the central planners <em>need</em> someone with the identity of a pacifist. Similarly an über-globalist spokesperson <em>needs</em> to have the identity of a nationalist. This is propaganda and identity bias 101, I’m surprised so few get it.</p>

<p>Obama could go wage so many atrocious wars precisely <em>because</em> he had the <em>identity</em> of a pacifist; heck, he is a Nobel peace laureate, how could he be anything other than a saint? Bush 2 could never have afforded to <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ArlKPSEHGLg">joke about predator drones</a> for example (especially not in the middle of a sanguinary drone war).</p>

<p>I think similarly Trump will end-up being the most <em>globalist</em> president since Wilson - precisely because he has the opposite manufactured identity. My bet is he&#39;ll sign the US into a new global monetary framework, a sort of Bretton Woods 2.0. </p>

<p>Alex Jones is to Trump what Michael Moore is to Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask yourself, is that the actions of a group of people that is against the deep state illuminati? Or is that a group protecting the establishment?</p>

<p>I think they are going into phase 2. Trump played the part that he was going to stop the foreign interventionism and drain the swamp.  But now a little of the curtain is getting pulled back from the illusion.  He appoints some deep state scum and follows a deep state false flag from the deep state war script, even announcing he is going after the next on the deep state&#39;s list Iran.</p>

<p>I can see it in the alternative media I watch that is pro-Trump. They just shrug off these things and ramp up cult like talk. &quot;Q says trust in the plan. have faith in the plan&quot;  blah blah. If you don&#39;t then you are a liberal and part of the swamp.... So wait, even though I supported Trump all this time until he starts clearly doing the deep state&#39;s bidding, I am not allowed to question his actions... Fuck that. The deep state played their Trump card and played it well. They divided and polarized the country and played both side to a T. Their next step will either be WW3 or a civil war, and all to cover up the financial collapse of the central banker&#39;s ponzie scheme to allow them to restart a new one. </p>

<p>Charges will come out on many of the Obama administration making Trump&#39;s fans cheer, and while distracted, Trump will carry out the deep state&#39;s war agenda that has been in place since at least 2001.... Mark my words.    </p>

<p>I guess you couldn&#39;t just list them due to it not being accurate? </p>

<p>Haven’t hear much about Lebanon or Somalia? But your theory is Trump will do the bidding of the deep state. Though, I won’t be marking your words on that. </p>

<p>No doubt Iran having nukes makes the deep state’s desire align with the American people so I’m good with it. We set the table for the Mullahs and I hope we reset it for the people. </p>

<p>Seems like Iraq is doing ok now that Trump decimated ISIS? Not quite a deep state move now is it?    </p>

<p>As far as Syria I guess your theory is Trump will do the old switch-a-roo. I won’t marking your words on that either.  </p>

<p>It takes a lot of blind belief to believe your predictions. </p>

<p>Libya was a deep state move by Obama and Crooked Clinton. I do agree with that one. Those stooges are gone now </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe North Korea acquired nukes to fend off being regime changed. A lot of the talk about Iran is just Israeli propaganda. The US installed a government in Iran in the 70s I think and then gave them a nuclear power reactor system... Then played games with them over the fuel needed to use the nuclear power reactors, that the US supplied. So Iran said fuck you we will make our own fuel, and on top of that we will make extra to sell so you can&#39;t blackmail other countries with you nuclear fuel monopoly.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was banned from r/the_donald for saying I agreed with Trump when he said we needed universal healthcare. You shouldn&#39;t be surprised that the mods there would ban people unfairly to censor. Almost all large subreddits do this, especially if they&#39;re dedicated to politics. I&#39;ve been banned from over a dozen different political subs despite always being cautious to avoid breaking rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was banned from there many months ago.  Trump is basically a massive gatekeeper.  Once you move past him in your pursuit of truth you will realize the mods on that sub are just shills controlling their lost sheep.  Politics in general is just a giant clown show distracting the masses as PEPE&#39;s water starts to boil.</p>
