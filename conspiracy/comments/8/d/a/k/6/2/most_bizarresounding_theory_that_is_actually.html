<p>I also recommend you listen to economists to understand macroeconomics. </p>

<p>You’ll learn that creating paper money is akin to producing wealth, that debt is exactly the same thing as savings, that the morbidly obese couch potato consumer is the central pillar of any developped economy (rather than the petty producer), that war (and destruction in general) fosters innovation and prosperity, that inflation is beneficial to everyone, etc.</p>

<p>The best such luminary I’d recommend is Paul Krugman. He won the 2008 Nobel prize in economics, so by definition it means you can fully delegate your mind, senses and conscience to him. Plus he’s a columnist for the New York Times, so his wisdom is indisputable.</p>

<p>You found an even worse way of ridiculing yourself. My &quot;claim&quot; has been a well-known fact for a long time. All the info and references were in the Wikipedia article I linked. This fact is an utter and complete mystery, one among many when it comes to the great pyramid. It certainly falsifies the idea it was built by a primitive people just coming out of the stone age.</p>

<p>Your little logorrhea on the scientific method may impress your girlfriends, not so much seasoned academics.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly my point. You are unsure. It is good that you admit it. That&#39;s how it should be; this uncertainty should apply to all mysteries, the great pyramid being among the biggest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your are falling for identity biases. I don&#39;t know which pasture you&#39;ve been grazing at, or what cliché you have on r/conspiracy subscribers, but most people here are <em>not</em> the narrow-minded, naïve bible thumpers CNN tells you about. </p>

<p>Your mention of &quot;aliens&quot; outs you. If one would have to formulate a hypothesis, a (yet-undiscovered) prehistorical global Earth civilization would be more likely.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/are-we-earths-only-civilization/557180/">&quot;Was There a Civilization on Earth Before %5bmodern%5d humans?&quot;</a></p>

<p>But as you may (or may not know), one doesn&#39;t need to propose an alternate explanation in order to falsify a hypothesis. One contradictory and reproducible result is enough; the great pyramid is that result when it comes to accepted historical chronology.</p>

<p>I guess the litmus test would have to be: &quot;do you believe in the government-peddled conspiracy theory of beared acrobatic pilots who, on 911, threw their passports outside of a cockpit window right before pulverizing 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum airplanes?&quot;.</p>

<p>Do you wish to take the test? Spoiler alert, if your answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, it is best to return to your pasture, this place might be too wild for you. If you&#39;ll swallow that you&#39;ll swallow anything, including the idea of primitive egyptians building the great pyramid without metal and without the wheel. </p>

<p>It may seem risky at first to disagree with the herd, but believe me it is liberating, especially for such self-evident issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, quickly google search, and a copy paste from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The most difficult challenge to the theory is through observations in ancient astronomy, especially those of solar eclipses cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology). Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to disprove the hypothesis with a high degree of certainty. One is reported by Pliny the Elder in 59 AD[9] and one by Photius in 418 AD.[10] Both of these dates and times have confirmed eclipses. In addition, observations during the Tang dynasty in China, and Halley&#39;s Comet, for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no &quot;phantom time&quot; added.[11][12]</p>

<p>Archaeological remains and dating methods such as dendrochronology refute, rather than support, &quot;phantom time&quot;.[13]</p>

<p>The Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325, the time of the Council of Nicaea, which had established a method for determining the date of Easter Sunday by fixing the vernal equinox on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig&#39;s &quot;three missing centuries&quot; thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.[14]</p>

<p>If Charlemagne and the Carolingian dynasty were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe, including Anglo-Saxon England, the Papacy, and the Byzantine Empire. The &quot;phantom time&quot; period also encompasses the life of Muhammad and the Islamic expansion into the areas of the former Roman Empire, including the conquest of Visigothic Iberia. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the Tang dynasty of China and its contact with Islam, such as at the Battle of Talas.[12][15]</p>

<p>TL:DR - Julius would have to have fabricated the entire emerging timeline of islam, among other massive cultural changes.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I have with it is they&#39;re completely ignoring the older civilizations (India, China, Japan) who have contiguous written histories that go even further back than the Judeo-Christian ones. Wouldn&#39;t adding hundreds of years of history cause a ton of alignment errors with the histories in those older civilizations? Why hasn&#39;t that ever happened (not to mention carbon dating and all that).</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it easier to say &quot;Scaliger messed up his calculations&quot; than we added hundreds of years of fake history? If Scaliger was wrong, this entire theory falls apart and that&#39;s a pretty weak pillar to stand on, for me personally.</p>

<p>The collective consciousness may be the closest thing to it in this dimension.

<p>Your comment above reminds me of how I came to find out all of this: pondering our creation. Yes, I believe, some of us actually had the ability to direct physicality to the point of organization of systems that could house Spirit, became what is known as Life, &amp; became trapped. I am truly sorry if I indeed had any part in it. Or, maybe we came later, to rescue. This is why the Gnostic Christ&#39;s dialogs on &quot;the flesh&quot;, &amp; the actual meaning thereof, is key. More broadly, J.S. Chiappalone [which I don&#39;t 100% adhere to bc some of his stuff can get quite loopy] <a href="http://www.rense.com/ufo/terminalmd.htm">nailed it pretty well 20 years ago</a>, the effects, not so apparent then, are much more apparent today.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with this &amp; haven&#39;t been able to find it, but I did come by a couple articles by <a href="https://jhaines6.wordpress.com/tag/cameron-day/">Cameron Day</a> in those searches that touch upon some of the same things we&#39;ve been discussing that I&#39;d read previously &amp; found to be very good [pretty sure you are familiar, as with most of the stuff I post, but, in case not, here ya go]:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2013/08/23/why-i-am-no-longer-a-light-worker/">http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2013/08/23/why-i-am-no-longer-a-light-worker/</a></p>

<p>The thing about Chiappalone that I have trouble digesting is his statements on being in contact with extraterrestrial entities that are on large ships that will one day rescue the viables - it reminds me of 1950&#39;s &#39;space brother&#39; stuff. Otherwise, his writings largely resonate with truth for me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure [don&#39;t remember now, been a few years] if he conflates archons with the annunaki, but I have seen that with quite a few others, and that just doesn&#39;t jibe with me. From my own experiences and studies, my impressions are that the archons are transdimensional &amp; noncorporeal, though the ability to manifest physically isn&#39;t outside the realm of possibility. I just haven&#39;t experience with that. </p>

<p>I also came by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz81Gwq-rM4">this guy</a>. No experience with his stuff that I can recollect, but will check him out. Thought you might enjoy it, too. :)</p>

<p>Take Care!</p>

<p>Honestly this scares the shit out of me. I think if this has any truth to it, then its just another trap. Imagine if things got bad enough here on Earth and these ships come down to &quot;save&quot; people, but in reality they&#39;re luring people and cart them all off to some other slave planet that is the literal definition of hell. Fuck that. But I could see a lot of people buying it.</p>

<li><p>There were very few. The idea that there were thousands of eyewitnesses on 9/11 is the biggest myth of 9/11. I spoke with a guy who watched the buildings burning from across Long Island Sound in Connecticut and he didn&#39;t even mention seeing any planes. There were other witnesses who reported seeing no planes, and claiming it was bombs going off. Most everyone was running to safety and watching on television; even if people had lingered around, which they did not, the skyline is very obstructed. </p></li>
<li><p>This was before the days of everyone&#39;s phone having a camera. Any video showing an explosion with no plane would have been suppressed and/or edited. </p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t think they were mistakes. I think they were doing the best they could with what they had. The power of suggestion is so underrated and strong. I believe it was Nixon who said &quot;Americans won&#39;t believe anything until they see it on television.&quot;</p></li>

<p>I first clicked on your link out of curiosity, and immediately clicked out and thought “nope!”</p>

<p>I actually came back to comment originally to say something along the lines of “I’m not wasting 40 minutes on this quack!”</p>

<p>But before I commented, something g told me to give it a chance.</p>

<p>So I watched. </p>

<p>I watched the whole damn thing.</p>

<p>And I have to say That in all honesty, as someone who approached the video as bullshit, this dude made some SERIOUS points and had actual data and facts.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The problem with that idea is that the stories attributed to Jesus <em>do not</em> fit Jewish prophecy. In fact early Christians spent a great deal of time reinterpreting Jewish prophetic traditions and messianic expectations to deal with the fact that by typical Jewish expectations of the messiah Jesus was an abject failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>mostly rooted in how Paul talks about Jesus in the earliest Christian texts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with these ideas as espoused by Richard Carrier, Robert Price et al. They stretch interpretations quite a bit to fit their thesis while flat ignoring elements of the same texts that are incongruent with their ideas.</p>

<p>That&#39;s untrue. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no physical or archaeological evidence for Jesus. All sources are documentary, mainly Christian writings, such as the gospels and the purported letters of the apostles. The authenticity and reliability of these sources has been questioned by many scholars, and few events mentioned in the gospels are universally accepted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you look at Roman sources, there are only two even mentioning Jesus and both were writing, crucially, at a time when the gospel would already be available and thus could perfectly be solely based on accounts of Christians. A similar reasoning holds for non-roman sources as well.</p>

<p>The second paragraph of your own source contradicted your claim on the consensus among scholars. When pointed out you shifted the goal by saying essentially &quot;well it doesn&#39;t matter&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flu Season is a hoax.</p>

<p>Peter Doshi explained that annually, an average of only about 16% of the illness diagnosed by doctors as Influenza actually is the Flu.</p>

<p>Doctors diagnose illness based on symptoms. A patient displaying symptoms similar to the flu will be diagnosed as having the flu, but lab tests generally only turn up evidence of the flu virus in about 16% of those having been diagnosed with influenza.</p>

<p>That means that approximately 84% of the people told by doctors they have the flu, don&#39;t. They have something else. That something else, whatever myriad microorganism or virus that may be, isn&#39;t going to be prevented by a flu shot, ever... because the flu shot only (supposedly) protects against the flu.</p>

<p>Sharyl Atkisson corroborated this with her investigative reporting into the 2009-2010 swine flu &quot;epidemic&quot;. The CDC was reporting numbers that were fabricated, because when the CDC lab results indicated that only very small percentages of those diagnosed with Swine Flu actually had it, or any flu at all, they ignored their federal mandate and literally stopped counting Swine Flu cases because reality wasn&#39;t conforming to their declared epidemic.</p>

<p>Risky vaccines were pushed anyway and a false pandemic was hyped because millions had already been invested in the swine flu shots by influential pharm companies. </p>

<p>Thomas Campbell is a nuclear physicist and has tried to tie physics, metaphysics and philosophy together to explain how quantum and cosmological, small and Big can work together without using different rules for each to balance. Very interesting and in my opinion the biggest conspiracy would be if this knowledge is true and has been suppressed for generations.  </p>

<p>The guy hasn’t as far as I know been on a DMT trip to get to these conclusions but instead worked to try to measure empirically his results in an environment to be repeatable under scientific conditions. </p>

Coke is referred to around here as the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room whenever talk of recycling and using glass bottles comes up in the state legislature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>astrology is nuero-linguistic programming that has been given legitimacy by wrapping it in ritual and (psuedo)science.</p>

<p>I also wonder if the daily horoscopes you find in most newspapers is actually a messaging system similar to the one the Allies used to communicate with underground resistance and partisan groups in occupied territories.
  Maybe it just me, but the phrase &quot;theres a bad moon rising&quot; sounds a lot like &quot;the red dog barks at midnight&quot;, if you look at it from the point of view that its a code word/phrase.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am suggesting that &#39;ancient history&#39; is a complete hoax, mostly written over the past 100 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The placement of the pyramid at this location in no way falsifies the idea that it was built by the indigenous Bronze Age civilization located there. You have provided no reason why this placement is relevant aside from its status as a (disputed based on your Wikipedia article) curiosity.</p>

<p>Hypothesis: pristine civilizations tend to pop up in circumscribed river valleys. They tend to build large monuments to their gods and kings.</p>

<p>Evidence: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Moche, etc.</p>

<p>Sure beats “this is weird therefore aliens”</p>

<p>Also, I am not unsure about our modern capacity for engineering. I am unsure which YouTube video you guys are all watching telling your that stone pyramids are impossible for the civilization that built the Burj Khalifa. Spirit Science?</p>
