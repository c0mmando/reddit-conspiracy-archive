      <h1>
       "Moderators vs Editors"
      </h1>
      <p>
       Here is the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8d4sw6/presstvisrael_has_secret_info_on_grahams/dxl9qzv/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8d4sw6/presstvisrael_has_secret_info_on_grahams/dxl9qzv/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure how I feel about this.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         i had two sentences
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         my SS was actually "upvoted" (before the mod removed the post)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       so my questions are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         w/ or w/o the SS, was the OP content worthy of
         <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
          /r/Conspiracy
         </a>
         ?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         was my SS "partisan" and "garbage" -- therefor, worthy of complete removal ??
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       NOTE:  no disrespect to mods.  i realize i am (probably) risking my entire account by even "questioning" the actions of a mod.  but... i am sincerely concerned that mods are taking too much authority -- becoming "editors" (not just "moderators")

       yes, i disagree.  it's not "partisan"

      <p>
       last time i checked, partisan == DEM vs REPUB.
      </p>
      <p>
       so no... my SS had nothing partisan about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       ps.  even if i did post a "partisan SS" (more to the point): where does the rules say "you may not post a partisan SS" ?  i can't find it... maybe you can give me a link... ?

       if anything, all i see is this detail re: SS:

       I don't understand what the problem with your post was. How was it partisan? Even if it was, that shouldn't really call for it being deleted. This seems a bad decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the SS system we should all be on high alert for censorship. There is a real danger of it because its another rule that can be abused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it shouldn't matter if the SS is partisan. This is your post and posters are sometimes partisan. Its also extremely hard to define what partisan means. It shouldn't be an obstacle to somebody posting.

       maybe vague if one doesn't know what "pizzagate" is... but i don't think it's reasonably for mods to expect that SS should further define "terms" that are used within the SS -- that's just ridiculous.

       The SS is meant to give a little context to what the link is about and why it is conspiracy related. I agree with the mod u/aleister on this one. "harkens of pizzagate" is not enough when the title only says he might be a homo. And I hate the r/politics mind in a box people too, but that sentence doesn't fulfill the SS.

       They have admitted to bending the rules on submission statements already depending on the post, I was behind it at first but it's obviously being selectively enforced.

       Submission statements are judged on a case by case basis. The submitter and the subject of the post are obviously taken into account by the mods before they take action. That giant post a day or two ago about Trumps lawyer and Hannity, for example, was removed two or three times by mods. They said it was because of the submission statement "not fitting all of the required criteria." I believe it was actually a case of them wanting to derail big threads that were generating a lot of discussion and traffic because they didn't like that it made Trump look bad.

      <p>
       I'll state this for the record: If the Mods are going to insist every OP lay out the whole enchilada, that every OP must tell each reader what to think, believe or be directed
       <em>
        towards
       </em>
       then we should scrap the Subs Motto.

       what does that SS tell you about "Graham’s homosexuality"?

       who the hell is Graham for that matter? i know, but I'm just noting the lack of detail that very easily could be included.

       dude - would "Go back to T_D" as a SS seem a little partisan to you?

      <p>
       And yeah, you talk about someone being a 'homo' and then don't even bother to mention it in your SS; that's some pretty basic stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's so hard about listening/reading the link you posted and saying something useful about it?

       1) i didn't say that.

       It already has gone the way of digg, only instead of the site itself filtering and curating the content, the power users and mods do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of whether people will ever leave reddit for something better, it seems unlikely. Reddit has been around for a while now and there are plenty of people who’ve grown up using it, just like Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it will die a slow death as something else starts taking new users instead, but it seems unlikely for there to ever be a mass exodus as happened with digg. Each community is compartmentalized and there are plenty of subs who wouldn’t even care if reddit started censoring whatever topic, and reddit would remain the best place to discuss that interest.

       No you didn't. You had two short bullet points, as a submission statement. I'm 50/50 about SS's, but, I agree with the removal of it not being "enough", however I disagree with the "partisan" part. Just my two cents.

       I'd support it for being removed for being vague and incomplete (read: extremely lazy) but I didn't notice anything inherently partisan about the submission statement either. Still, the post was a steaming pile of poop.

       I mean, your statement was about pizzagate. And your post was about Lindsey Graham, not pizzagate. You didnt explain your post at all. I dont really see any wrong doing on the mods part.

       The funny thing is, I’m not a big fan of the submission statement at all.  I saw the original post and just ignored because of the lack of effort the OP put into it and the clear political hackery.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, by removing the post it has now drawn more attention than it ever deserved.  Thats the main reason why I disagree with the removal and the rule that allows mods to subjectively pick and choose.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO it’s better to ignore these types of shit posts.

       is it a problem or a conspiracy if he is gay? or is the problem just that he is a dem? I really don't understand the problem.

       One thing I will say is that the SS was kind of vague. It didn't make much sense to me what you were implying. But still don't think it should be removed. Maybe you can resubmit it?
