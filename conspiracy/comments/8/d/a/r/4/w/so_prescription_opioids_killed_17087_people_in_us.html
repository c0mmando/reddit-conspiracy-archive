    <div class="md"><p>you ever go to Flint, Michigan or something, you&#39;re gonna have sulfur water, things lighting on fire, egg water - they get all different kinds of stuff. People are really used to this flavor. And you know what else they&#39;re used to? Taking it in the ass. As in, they pay taxes, and they get that water, and they do nothing about it. They might scream a little bit, but they end up not doing much. So I like to emulate that sentiment of paying really high taxes and getting nothing in return. Not even clean water.</p>

Someone&#39;s death could be &quot;linked to&quot; watching a vampire movie and &quot;associated with&quot; eating too many Cheetos but the only thing that killed them would be the actual cause their death is &quot;attributed to&quot; like a heart attack or gunshot wound etc.</p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>For example, most persons killed while riding bicycles were wearing sneakers/ athletic footwear.</p>

<p>Using the FDA&#39;s logic, sneakers, having been &quot;linked to&quot; bicycle deaths, should be banned.</p>

<p>Yes, the FDA&#39;s &quot;logic&quot; re: kratom really is that dishonest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the best use for kratom atleast for me was to get off opiates , it completely takes the withdrawals away with an appropriate dose and lets you get to sleep, work and recover from whatever horrid opioid you are abusing. The only downside is that since it works in a similar way there definitely are withdrawal symptoms from stopping heavy kratom use also, its just a way-way lesser evil. But non opioid users should not use it for fun... ALSO TASTES LIKE ROTTEN ASS</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never been on opiate withdrawal, but i can tell you about kratom withdrawal.</p>

<p>after daily use for a few months, a cold turkey quit will be uncomfortable. You lose motivation for a ~week, have some strange discomfort in the body for a few days, and have trouble sleeping for a week. I think I only got 12 hours of sleep in the week after I quit. All the physical side effects go away after about a week though, and they&#39;re all mild. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing this is miles ahead of heroin / pill withdrawal </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too have never had full on opiate withdrawal but I have had heavy kratom withdrawal after being a daily user for 6 years. I was also taking ALOT. And quit cold turkey
Lots of Sneezing, yawning, runny eyes and nose.
Severe lack of motivation. Body aches and pains in places you forgot existed.
Also I got sick as a dog, as in cold/flu. I think kratom boosts your immune system because when I&#39;m on it I maybe get sick once every 2 years and opposed to 3 or 4 times a year. And when you do get sick it&#39;s very mild.
The worst part though was the RLS. It was bad enough to keep me up with little sleep for a week.
However that whole experience was not enough for me to give up kratom forever. After all was said and done I really missed the benefits of taking kratom responsibly. Now I am EXTREMELY motivated all the time and live with little to zero pain. It&#39;s helped me shed alot of weight and become more active.  It also does wonders for anxiety or social disorders. My job is very physical and there is no way I would be able to do it without kratom. I am now at and staying at half the dose I was using before I had to quit the first time due to money issues (not stemming from kratom.) And I find that a smaller dose, especially on an empty stomach works far better anyways</p>
