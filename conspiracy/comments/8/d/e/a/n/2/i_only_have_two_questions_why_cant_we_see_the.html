<p>Secondly there is evidence of a 757. We have engine pieces, pieces of the landing gear, and chunks of the airframe all over the place. I don’t know why you think the tail would be intact. The fire from the impact was intense. That being said remains were found and identified as well as the “black box”. The Flight Data Recorder was intact but the cockpit voice recorder (which used tape) was damaged. There is no evidence of anything being planted so...</p>

<p>pieces easy to plant</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying it&#39;s easy to plant a large chunk of airplane engine into the middle of a building that&#39;s on fire? Is there any evidence that suggest the pieces were planted?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no big section of tail</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would there be a big piece of tail section? This isn&#39;t a cartoon where the plane would only bury itself halfway into the building with the tail sticking out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no luggage,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well the fire burned and melted a lot of shit. Why would you expect to find luggage? Do you actually know for sure that none was found or are you just assuming that none was found based on your &quot;research&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>penetrated a series of walls like a bunker buster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure a bunker buster would have went through more of the building. Are you saying that cinder-block construction should have withstood the force of a fully loaded 757 flying in at full throttle? Whats with you guys and cartoon physics?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a flight path that would be difficult for even a pro</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not impossible</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the supposed pilot couldn&#39;t fly a cessna.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a big difference between legally piloting an aircraft from take off to landing to flying a plane into a building. I really hope you can understand this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when instead it could do a simple dive right into the middle of the building to do the most damage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well it&#39;s debatable if flying straight down could do the most damage but it&#39;s certainly not easier. It&#39;s actually pretty simple, so hopefully you can follow along. He flew the plane until he had a visual of the target, then he dropped altitude and turned around to actually be able to hit the target. If he had simply tipped the stick when he saw the Pentagon, then he probably would have overshot the building when the plane would exceed it&#39;s VNE and lose control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>surely the expected evidence isn&#39;t present, and what is there, is very suspicious..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No the evidence is there, you are just choosing to ignore it because it doesn&#39;t fit your fantasy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is evidence from the cabbie Lloyd England that the lamp posts scene was staged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d love to see this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you ever see what a bird does to a plane? how does this supposed aluminum plane penetrate dense reinforced bunker wall like a bunker buster? the physics is impossible. that&#39;s why they make bunker busters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you don&#39;t understand planes or bunker busters or buildings. I don&#39;t know if I can hold your hand long enough to explain all of this to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there were 80 odd cameras that didn&#39;t see a thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Were they for sure pointing at the impact area?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we get a few frames of</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of what looks like a silver airliner. Then we couple that with the actual evidence, the missing plane itself, and the remains of people who were on the plane but now in the debris in the building.</p>

<p>Put all of that together and we get evidence of a plane hitting the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Now, is there any actual evidence of a missile or anything other then a 757 hitting the Pentagon? No. Hmmmmmmm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man how many times does this have to be explained to you.</p>

<p>You are the one who is rejecting the overwhelming evidence that AA77, a Boeing 757 flew into the Pentagon. It is no longer a theory that AA77 hit the Pentagon, it is a fact. This isn&#39;t a scientific proof.</p>

<p>You are rejecting the overwhelming evidence of AA77 hitting the Pentagon. At this point, it is on you, to provide the evidence of something other then AA77 hitting the Pentagon. You are the one making the claims that the evidence that exist doesn&#39;t make sense. That means you need to back up those claims with evidence. Get it?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>By the way, if you want people to take you seriously you need to stop spouting words you don&#39;t understand. You don&#39;t seem to understand what the effect of an actual bunker buster type munition would have on an office building like the pentagon. Because in the real world (not the cartoon physics world you believe in) a bunker buster would go through the office building upper levels of the pentagon, through a good chunk of the basement and blow up, underground in whatever is under the Pentagon. It would not, pierce only a few walls, doing less and less damage as it went into the building.</p>

<p>Also it would not leave behind the debris of a AA 757 but I take it, it might take you a while to figure that one out.</p>

<p>You seem to have some problems with your logic.</p>

<p>Lets start again.</p>

<p>Debris that clearly resembles parts from an AA passenger jetliner were found all around the point of impact. You don&#39;t dispute this right?</p>

<p>It is your claim, that this debris did not come from an AA airliner. You need to offer proof of that.</p>

<p>No you didn&#39;t. You told me what you think the plane should do but what your knowledge is based on, I don&#39;t know. So far you have shown that you believe in &quot;cartoon&quot; physics where the plane should have stripped off its wings and tail intact when it hit the building or it should have flattened against it like a can getting smashed. Both of those are wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In this essay I asked what conclusions about the Pentagon attack were supported by physical evidence -- primarily post-crash photographs of the site. I found that, in every aspect I considered, this evidence comports with the crash of a Boeing 757. At the same time, the evidence does not conclusively prove that the aircraft was a 757, much less that it was Flight 77.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does that say no proof? That says that all the evidence points to it being a 757. He&#39;s saying it&#39;s not conclusive, which based on his evaluation it might not be, but he isn&#39;t saying It&#39;s not a 757 either.</p>

<p>I linked you a much better article by the way. Make sure you take the time to read it.</p>

<p>So he evidence fits with a 757. The witness saw an AA airliner, so that fits with a 757. We have a radar track of AA77 leaving the airport and then crashing into the Pentagon. We have the remains of passengers who were on AA77 found in the crash at the Pentagon. But you, for some reason, even though you don’t have any evidence to support your theory, think it was something other then AA77?</p>

<p>It stands up to the scrutiny in the article you yourself posted! Did you read the article I sent you? It stands up to scrutiny every time you actually apply the scientific method and analyze the actual facts and not all the misinformation that conspiracy theorist like to push around. There is a mountain of evidence that flight 77 hit the Pentagon. There is zero evidence that something else hit the Pentagon. I’ve been following these conspiracy theories for over 10 years and to date there is still no evidence of a “missile” or anything other then flight 77 hitting the Pentagon.</p>

<p>There is not one thing that convinced me but all of he actual evidence is what convinced me.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That’s you changing the subject and making a claim without offering any evidence.</p>

<p>Let’s stick to one thing at a time.</p>

<p>So right now, all the evidence points to AA77 hitting the Pentagon, there is no evidence that supports the claim that something other then AA77 hit the Pentagon.</p>

<p>So why are you still claiming it wasn’t AA77?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;American Airlines Flight 77 struck the portion of the building that had already been renovated. It was the only area of the Pentagon with a sprinkler system, and it had been reconstructed with a web of steel columns and bars to withstand bomb blasts. The steel reinforcement, bolted together to form a continuous structure through all of the Pentagon&#39;s five floors, kept that section of the building from collapsing for 30 minutes--enough time for hundreds of people to crawl out to safety.</p>

<p>The area struck by the plane also had blast-resistant windows--2 inches thick and 2,500 pounds each--that stayed intact during the crash and fire.</p>

<p>What seeing something unrealistic like the plane tail sticking out of the building or luggage surviving the fire? You do understand basic physics right? Just because the plane hit the building doesn&#39;t mean everything else on it should stop instantly from 400 miles an hour and land on the grass, away from the fire.

<p>No I&#39;m not speculating. I&#39;m telling you what happened. You are speculating that the impact site should look differently, not me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You mean the horizontal and vertical stabilizers then. The tail would refer to the whole aft structure. The stabilizers were obliterated during the impact. They are not nearly as strong as the wing structures. Only an idiot would expect the plane to leave a perfect silhouette. Remember, this isn&#39;t a cartoon.</p>

<p>Into small hard lumps of plastic. Have you ever dug through the ashes of a house fire? You can usually only pick out large chunks of steel and stone.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Whole suitcases? Sure. Small personal effects of passengers were found throughout the wreckage.</p>

<p>again, speculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, speculation on your part. Why do you keep speculating that a 757 didn&#39;t hit the Pentagon when all the evidence points to a 757 hitting the Pentagon? Do you have evidence of something else hitting the Pentagon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you actually aren’t asking the question then?</p>

<p>We know that a plane hit the Pentagon, we have debris of a plane, we have a plane missing and we even have some shitty footage from a security camera that looks like a plane. Do we have any evidence of anything other then a plane hitting the Pentagon?</p>

<p>As for building 7, why it failed is a bigger discussion that took many actual engineers time to figure out. Conspiracy theorist were screaming “where is the report on building 7?” Over and over again and the. When the report on it was finally released, they ignored it.</p>

<p>My understanding of the report was that the fire protection failed at a much lower temperature and a much shorter duration then it was designed to. WTC7 like WTC1 and 2 relied on a lighter construction method that meant that the floors were spanning over relatively large distance. When the trusses supporting those floors failed in the fire, they pulled in on the vertical columns. This caused the sagging and leaning that people, including the FDNY saw, before the fire crews were pulled out of the building.</p>

<p>It’s one thing to have actual questions, it’s another when you are attempting some bullshit “redpill” strategy to get people to follow you down your rabbit hole and maybe buy some merch on the way.</p>

<p>You mean plane debris? I&#39;m sorry a 757 flying into a building didn&#39;t leave the amount of debris you were hoping for.</p>

<p>If you were honestly asking the question &#39;what debris of a plane&#39; well then you should know, that question has been <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-was-there-no-plane-wreckage-in-9-11-terrorist-attacks-on-the-Pentagon">answered already.</a></p>

<p>So we know for a fact that there was debris of an AA 757 found at the pentagon. So much for that &quot;question&quot;.</p>

<p>As for the NIST report on building 7, my point was that people like you, desperately looked for something wrong in the report, couldn&#39;t find it on your own, so you cling on to some vaguely smart sounding person who disagrees with the report. Mind you, before the report came out, the talk of conspiracy theorist was that the reason the report hadn&#39;t come out, was because NIST found out something they shouldn&#39;t have, and the report would clear it all up. When the report was released, those same people dug their heads in the sand and screamed that it was wrong.</p>

<p>For example, the report is 137 pages and I&#39;ve seen nothing in it that was redacted or classified. They list their sources and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if not all of the publications were free to view though.</p>

<p>It really seems like you didn&#39;t actually read the report or at least unbiased summaries on it. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>The data from two models is classified. Not the output, nor the rest of the report. That doesn&#39;t negate the information in the report. It&#39;s just a easy excuse for you, and others like you, to ignore the report that you CTs previously were asking for.</p>

<p>Oh so now you are making more unsubstantiated claims! Do you have evidence that the debris of an AA757 was planted or just more shitty conjecture?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have evidence of it not being AA77 that crashed into the Pentagon, you just have evidence of AA77 but you don&#39;t like the evidence (because it doesn&#39;t fit your views).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What actual evidence is there for any of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is actually quite a bit of evidence. Engineers want to know what went wrong with the systems that were designed to withstand these fires. We understand that WTC1&amp;2 had tremendous structural damage, and the fires burned without any attempt at containment. WTC7 showed us that fire protection systems that were thought to be able to contain a fire for a longer duration of time in fact didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we have studies and reports that look into this.</p>

<p>What we don&#39;t have evidence of is explosives or missiles or whatever nonsense that Avery stirred up when they were making Loose Change (They actually made it as a joke but realized that conspiracy theorist were eating it up).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They assumed the now classified inputs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb here and assume that you think things only get classified because of some national security reason. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the some parts of the models were classified so that the company that provided the modeling software wouldn&#39;t have to release their (very expensive) software to the public as part of a public records request.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not science, because nobody else can repeat it with the same data.</p>

<p>Who says they can&#39;t?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We haven&#39;t been given real empirical &quot;answers&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you&#39;ve been given the answers. The problem is, you don&#39;t like them. They don&#39;t support your fantasy. And no matter what, you will never find the answer you are looking for because in the end, you aren&#39;t actually looking for answers. The good news is, you will most likely grow out of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s too bad they shipped all the real evidence to china so damned quick, a real travesty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean it&#39;s too bad that of the evidence that exist, you guys couldn&#39;t find anything to support your claims. The steel sat in multiple yards for years. You can even find chunks of it all over the country now. Hell it wasn&#39;t even all removed from Ground Zero until spring of 02. Yet not a single person found any evidence of explosives. But don&#39;t let that complete lack of evidence stop your imagination!</p>

<p>Footage of the pentagon being hit also shows how the defenses of the pentagon (if any) reacted to the plane and other foreign nations could use that information to plan on attack on the US in the future in the case of a land invasion that could (but most likely wont) happen in the future. </p>

<p>I think it comes down to the fact that the heart of the US Military was hit so easily with a regular passenger plane is just something that the US Military would want everyone to conveniently forget about because it shows a weakness to fucking passenger planes from the most powerful military on the planet. </p>

<p>Our military response that day was somehow disabled. I heard it was in part because of the training that was going on at the time. We&#39;ve since upgraded our response techniques. Your points are not strong enough to warrant refusal to comply with massive public calls for the release of the confiscated footage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No commercial airliner lands at 250 knots. They don’t even land above 180 knots and a plane that size would land around the 140-160 range depending on weight and other variables. Furthermore 350 knots is well too fast for their near sea level altitude. Planes fly faster as they go higher because air density begins to decline, thus they need a higher air speed to avoid stalling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it had more than enough lift but that was never a question. At those speeds that low it would be stressing the airframe an immense amount and require a large amount of skill to be flown the way it was and complete the maneuvers it did. The question is was it really a 757? And to further that was it really piloted by who they said it was? The first no one can answer till more information is available but the latter most people with a working knowledge of aviation would cast very large doubts that it could be flown with that success rate by someone as untrained as the supposed terrorists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dad is a 22 year veteran pf the army (most national guard but hes been to all the major stuff since the 80s). Hes a science teacher for middle school turned 5th grade teacher. He is about to complete a 2nd masters (has one in education this one is for education leadership/administration so he can be a principal)</p>

<p>I asked him why I cant see the footage and he said because I dont need to :/</p>

<p>I asked him why the pentagon looks like a missile strike just like the picture of the building in iraq I sent him when I was there in 06. He said because the plane behaves like a missile. </p>

<p>I asked him where all the debris is and he said it was vaporized</p>

<p>I asked him why they hit the only section of tge pentagon reinforced to withstand a bomb. He said bad luck.</p>

<p>I asked him how building 7 fell and he said what the he&#39;ll is building 7 I yold him and he said it must have been fire. </p>

<p>I asked him how come america has the only towers in modern history to fall due to fire and he said because god is pubishing us </p>

<p>So...I dont think intellect has much to do with it </p>

<p>This gets repeated a lot but it&#39;s not actually true. A 17 story steel skyscraper fully collapsed due to uncontrolled fire just last year.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasco_Building">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasco_Building</a></p>

<p>In 2005 another 32 story skyscraper had a partial collapse due to fire.<br/>

<p>These are obviously pretty uncommon because fires tend to be put out before they get this out of control, but for obvious reasons firefighters were a bit spread thin on 9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was skeptical like you, then I actually read the entire NIST report on building 7. The building was shaped like an extruded trapezoid with the weakest part being the main beam in the middle. This beam had many other beams attached to it perpendicularly. The heat from the fire expanded those beams which in turn pushed laterally on the main beam, forcing it off its bolts. The rest was a domino effect. Part of the reason it falls so fast is the core of the building collapses before the outside. In the video you can see the roof fall into the core seconds before the rest fall.</p>

<p>I consider myself highly intelligent and these facts make me buy the story more. Yes, it&#39;s surprising an undamaged building could collapse at freefall, but the series of events they released do fit with the laws of physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had read that the plane was moving too fast to be caught in the cameras frame rate (simple math), and saw pictures of airplane debris in the pentagon lawn.</p>

<p>I have a &#39;soft&#39; opinion that the pentagon was actually hit by a plane (personal research not extensive, open to being wrong).</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the black box&quot; &quot;It was a missile&quot; &quot;it looks like a controlled demolition&quot;. If the pentagon was not hit by a plane, why is that the narrative &#39;they&#39; came up with?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be much simpler to car bomb / suitcase bomb / missile strike the pentagon, and then just say the terrorists did exactly that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting considering It flew right over the freeway, with it&#39;s wings hitting light poles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many witnesses saw the plane hit light poles. In all, five light poles were torn from their bases and broken into pieces. Pole pieces had considerable curvature as if hit by a blunt force at high speed, such as the moving wing of a plane. One pole piece pierced the windshield of a taxi driven by Lloyde England. The back seat of the taxi was pierced indicating how the pole piece was supported at that end and stuck out through the windshield. The separation and positions of the downed light poles indicate a plane wingspan of more than 100 feet, but less than 130 feet. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 124 feet 10 inches.</p>

But for me a simple explanation for that would be that the investigators knew it was him because of previous tips and information that they did not act on.

<p>I’m not positive that’s the case. But at least that one has a simple <em>possible</em> explanation that points to cover up rather than conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blackboxes are largeish and heavy. A passport is a small and light. Most if the surviving debris is small stuff that won&#39;t get destroyed immediately on impact. A black box is basically too big for its own good in this situation. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with finding the passport I guess. It&#39;s a weird point to latch onto since it was ultimately not really a piece in the investigation. 9/11 had a lot of weird difficult to explain situations, but the passport thing is just a red herring that people are stuck on.</p>

<p>Makes sense. About as much sense as an aluminum airplane punching through a building that was designed to survive a jet airliner that size impacting it.</p>

<p>As much sense as it not only slicing through the outer steel superstructure, but also the massive core columns that most people forgot existed, which would have remained standing if the outer building partially collapsed...</p>

<p>The fact that three steel buildings fell within hours of being hit, directly down into their own basements.</p>

<p>The nanothermite residue. The fact that wtc7 didnt even get hit, yet fell into its own basement from &quot;office fires&quot;. The fact that the NIST models are garbage.

<p>Seriously? 3 modern day skyscrapers were completely flattened, and you &quot;guess&quot; there&#39;s nothing wrong with finding <em>multiple</em> passports that were in the god damn <em>cockpits</em> of the very planes that demolished said buildings?

Well let&#39;s just agree to disagree, to say the fucking least...</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure you misunderstood the concept of the Big Lie because you seem to be falling for it. Why do you believe that it&#39;s obvious that only Bin Laden planned 9/11? The FBI had Bin Laden on their Most Wanted list for other terrorist attacks i.e. the USS Cole Bombing &amp; the Embassy bombing in Nairobi but it makes no connection between 9/11 and Bin Laden. Mueller has been on record stating that in all (a treasure trove) of the evidence that they recovered, not one single piece of paper mentions 9/11. Bin Laden has been on record, more than once, emphatically denying any involvement with 9/11.... then, right before the &#39;04 elections, a new video magically appears in which Bin Laden does take credit for 9/11.... keep in mind that the authenticity of that particular video has been discussed ad nauseam.</p>

<p>Certainly your claim that &quot;obviously Bin Laden panned those attacks&quot; is dubious at best and hearkens back to Hitler&#39;s definition of creating a Big Lie that regardless of facts, people will continue to believe that there must be some other explanation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. I don’t know the answer for sure. Maybe it’s just that: sloppy bullshit that wasn’t meant to happen. Maybe it’s just as normal for the passport to survive as it would have been for the buildings to have survived too, if you get what I’m saying. After all, the passport was found a block away from the WTC <em>before</em> the towers collapsed. Sounds like a really convenient and somewhat believable story/reason for finding the passport. People do believe it after all anyways. But I’m also skeptical of the passport being able to make it that far away from the site only from the initial impact of the plane itself. But like I said maybe it is true. What do you think, it’s fishy if you ask me but not completely unbelievable, which maybe makes it the perfect lie. But maybe the passport really was found the way it was, but if you ask me, it’s not normal for a paper passport that was in one of the planes itself to survive something that 3 skyscrapers were completely flattened by in a matter of seconds, one of which was completely untouched by a plane. I think either the passport was a lie, or if it wasn’t a lie, then those buildings should have survived just as the passport did, but they didn’t. Why lie if it’s untrue, and if it’s true, why did the buildings demolish in free fall fashion while a paper passport was left to survive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I have yet to see you make a coherent argument that doesn&#39;t use a logical fallacy.</p>

<p>I mean, right here, this is an entire argument from incredulity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why plant a passport on the streets of NYC. That&#39;s not really believable to happen, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are refusing to look at what we actually know, but base truth on what you deem is &quot;believable.&quot; </p>

<p>This is what is known as <em>a priori</em> reasoning: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would have been possible to plan it to look more like a collapse to you. Wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is similar to the argument, &quot;If this conspiracy were true, MSM reporters would be all over it!&quot;</p>

<p>The fact is, 9/11 was a sloppy job. Like, really sloppy. We have a mountain of evidence in multiple fronts, including a money trail and clear-as-day motive. These people <em>know</em> that there will be enough people who will refuse such a thing is possible. All they have to do, as the poster above said, is use the Big Lie method in conjunction with CIA&#39;s vast Mockingbird-influenced outlets in order to cement the narrative and quickly label those who question it as crazy &quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the literal approach they used for JFK, <em>and it worked.</em> This is what they used for the MLK assassination, <em>and it worked</em>.</p>

<p>My friend in the military told me there&#39;s no way it was an inside job because the government isn&#39;t that organized, they would have slipped up somewhere and there would evidence.</p>

<p>... the evidence is the stuff I just told you. How can you say there&#39;s no need to look into any evidence, because if it was true, there would be evidence?</p>

<p>So weird that people think like this, it&#39;s just them being too close minded. My personal theory, most people think they live in a &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; world, and dont believe close door conspiracies happen (like MKUltra, the list goes on and on obviously, but I dont have to tell you all) so to get them to look at something one way, when the TV is telling them it was a different way, would shake their world view, and it&#39;s hard to shake someones world view.</p>

<p>Most people believe that the source of truth is the TV, so it takes someone like Edward Snowden to get on TV and tell them about something before they believe it. <em>TV knows all</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>the thing is, the tv does tell us the truth - if we know where to look for it.  all kinds of movies and shows have story lines with conspiracies in the government, elite circles, the mob, the military, etc, etc, that allude to these kinds of things happening in real life, behind the scenes.  in these stories, the news media conspires to hide the evidence and tamper with the story for reasons either alluded to or unknown.  there are often a lot of gaps in these stories, but they occur so often that we must recognize that there is truth to them.  and the reason that these stories are allowed to be made over and over again is because if the uninitiated see these &quot;made up&quot; stories first, they will refuse to believe that the news stories that they watch can be similar to the fiction that they watch on other channels.  it&#39;s called hiding things out in the open.</p>

BUT there is always a morsel of truth in these articles and stories that is not only invaluable to the story, but to the truth seeker as well. You just have to be able to identify this morsel of truth when 90% of an article is bullshit. You cross reference this with all types of different information; social media, MSM, alt media, and so on and take the morsels of truth out of those if there are any, mash them together and form the bigger picture, or your own opinion.

    <div class="md"><p>What was unclear? I just specifically said people over 20 or so(is Gen Z over 20 now? They keep reclassifying when this generation began and the last ended.) tend to be the brainwashed ones.</p>

<p>If they are concerned about that, hate Amazon, etc then they <em>arent</em> the brainwashed ones. The millenials and <em>older</em> are the ones who are mostly brainwashed. </p>

<p>Im pretty sure this upcoming generation is pretty redpilled, woke, based, whatever you want to call it. They&#39;re also the most conservative generation since WW2.</p>

<p>Its like an oscillating system. The last few generations got progressively more and more socialistic, leftist, politically correct, decadent, dim witted, and now the i believe the tipping point in the sysyem has been reached(self organized critical point) and the generation currently growing up is going to be <em>better</em> because they will reject the culture of apathy that the idiots of my generation took to its most extreme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think most millenials(currently 28 plus) are. In fact, socialism is on the rise in popularity among that age group, plenty of SJWs and biology deniers in that range too. </p>

<p>I think millenials ideologically aligned with Gen Z are the exception, not the rule. I mean, just look at most college campuses. A lot of them are trying to turn the USA, Canada Australia, UK and much of the EU into some socialist failed state. Bernie, a literal socialist candidate, was popular among the millenials too...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SJW is the key term I am speaking of. It is designed to shut down someone when the other party is concerned primarily with social welfare. If you believe that socialism is slavery, then how do you feel about capitalism? It is common knowledge that capitalism is far more like slavery than socialism ever has been. Millenials seem to be concerned about the fact that CEO to worker ratios have gone up from 25x in the 50&#39;s to 300x now. They are concerned that inflation has risen 300% but wages have remained stagnant. They are concerned that the vast majority of taxes go to a military industrial complex in a war most if the country disagrees with and yet social services that we pay into get slashed. That&#39;s the blame of the GOP, not people wanting a safety net for a failing economy. On average you must make at least $24 an hour full-time in the cheapest state in order to afford adequate living conditions. In the 50&#39;s you could support an entire family, buy a car, and pay your mortgage on one salary alone.</p>

<p>You are wrong, just plain and simple, you are wrong. There have been many, many studies done that show how the generation of millenials has had to work harder for what they have more than any other modern generation. Would you like some links or do you know how to use Google Scholar?</p>

<p>Yes, I am greatly concerned that there are individuals out there in the wild that hold wildly and factually wrong, unfortunate opinions towards an entire generation. That&#39;s a pretty shitty attitude, even if it was founded in reality, but it&#39;s not. Have fun with your whole lack-of-empathy thing you&#39;ve got going on though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about the issues you speak of, yet you have the typical misconception about capitalism and socialism that i wanted you to spell out by baiting you with trigger words, and you revealed exactly what i suspected.</p>

<p>How is the exchange of value for value, the core principle of capitalism, which is completely voluntary, <em>like slavery</em>? It is diametrically opposed to slavery.</p>

<p>Socialism and communism are essentially legalized theft. If you make more money than me, a greater portion of your money goes to taxes. Its a perverse incentive that makes people either become welfare queens or shelter their money where it cant be taxed(Panama papers style).</p>

<p>To me, its much less compassionate and empathetic to say &quot;well you are forced to work harder because more of your money will be going to <em>other people and their families, many of whom dont even work</em> than the voluntarism of capitalism. </p>

<p>Forcing people to work and then taking the products or profits of their labour is basically slavery in a nutshell, and socialism too.</p>

<p>You think taxing the ultra rich cunts who did a bunch of unethical shit to get rich, and should never have gotten rich to begin with is going to fix the system that made them rich and the middle class poor? </p>

<p>All that mentality has done so far is lead to economic collapse in socialist failed states, and the rise of mega corporations and monopolies <em>which are antithetical to the free market</em> of a capitalist system.</p>

<p>What you call the evils of capitalism are the evils of a corrupt socialist elite, who does not play by the rules they make for the middle class, who they enslave through socialist tax schemes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yikes, there&#39;s a lot to unpack here. I am not wanting to start an argument, but I would like to address every point that I can. I would also like to be very clear that you are speaking in a lot of broad terms about what people other than yourself believe and are mispresenting it dramatically, as well as making sweeping assumptions about my viewpoint when I merely pointed out obscene inflation. If we cannot agree on that basic point, then I don&#39;t see how we have enough common ground to continue this discussion, but I will bite. </p>

<p>I also would like to add that I absolutely do not tolerate manipulation tactics in conversations and if there cannot be mutual respect going forward then there is no use continuing. I am not sure why I even have to tell you how inappropriate it is to try and &quot;bait&quot; someone to try and validate misconceptions you hold about them. That is incredibly off-putting and disconcerting. Moving on. </p>

<p>The system of capitalism <em>is not voluntary.</em> To suggest so is a logical fallacy. That implies choice. You have no choice but to participate in capitalism. If not, you are homeless, which I have been, as I am disabled and am largely socioeconomically worthless. <em>You do not have a choice but to participate in society.</em></p>

<p>Taxes work as ratios. If I make more then you, I pay more taxes. It is basic math. Right now, however, if I make more than you, I pay significantly <em>less</em> taxes. How does that work out? That makes zero sense. Absolutely nutty. </p>

<p>Right now, the large portion of my taxes go towards a military industrial system I do not morally support and a federal debt that is designed to keep growing. I would much rather my contribution go towards infrastructure, schools, healthcare, etc. I do not consent to where my taxes go, and yet I involuntarily pay them in order to justify a roof over my head. </p>

<p>You seem to think that people like being on welfare and other various social services. That&#39;s a misconception I don&#39;t even know how to address except for. I am not sure if you are aware how social services work, what requirements you have to meet, or how payments are distributed. I would love to share recourses with you if it matters towards your general feelings. As for sheltered taxes, that would be in offshore tax havens so the people who pay less taxes than they should, pay even less than that.</p>

<p>To clarify welfare, I have never known a single person in my entire life that solely lived off of social services unless they were disabled and were unable to work. I know many people on food stamps and medicaid, myself included, because it is physically impossible to make ends meet while still working beyond our means. What you are speaking of is a non-issue and social safety nets would not be needed, had wages rose with inflation.</p>

<p>We have a system right now where people are forced to work, whether they like to or not, whether they physically/mentally can or should not. Unless you are diagnosed with a severe mental or physical disability, you absolutely must either have a job or live off of someone else who has one. Period. Nobody has a choice to opt out of this system. No family lives for free.</p>

<p>To answer your question if taxing the ultra rich cunts would fix everything, no, I don&#39;t think it would, but I think that having them proportionately taxed to the rest of us would be a great start, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that we do not currently have a system of mega-corporations and monopolies? Wild.</p>

<p>I appreciate you trying to split this into capitalism VS socialism, but you must know that I hold neither and none of those or any political ideologies. I just see things that are obviously unfair or don&#39;t make any sense, and I see things that obviously need to be fixed. I am unconcerned about other so-called socialist nations as they are not examples of perfectly executed socialism and as such, I am again not a socialist but believe in what is clearly fair and just. If some of those things are what a socialist would believe, cool coincidence, but I am not a socialist.</p>

<p>There is no need for ad homing and creative assumptions about my life. I have no doubt you display very kind attributes. I am simply unimpressed and disappointed by the viewpoints expressed within our dialogue and as most of them are largely just generalizations  against me and my peers as people, you could understand why that might make me feel a lack of empathy from you. Especially given that I have spent four years of my life living on the street, am disabled, have earned two degrees and have devoted nine years of my life to service work. How about we both agree we do not know what each other has gone with and at least agree to not make assumptions about each other based upon little to no info? It will help me feel like you are less uncompassionate with the way you communicate your feelings. </p>

<p>Again, it is severely offensive to make some of these assumptions. Beat you and steal your wallet? Are you fucking lost? I can&#39;t even watch anything but kids cartoons because I am such a pacifist marshmallow. Our government holds no empathy for me, or for you, for that matter. I am wholeheartedly against our current political and social structure. I don&#39;t need a government to tell me to be a decent human being. It&#39;s called having a moral compass and caring about other people and having empathy. </p>

<p>Do <em>you</em> need the government to tell you not to steal and cheat? If not, why would you assume I do? Because I expressed that I wished the super-wealthy was held to the same fiscal and moral standards? </p>

<p>Government corruption is possible because of capitalism. Politicians are bought like products. Regulations are controlled by whoever holds the cash flow. Whoever holds the cash flow controls the laws and whoever controls the laws controls where the money goes. Our system isn&#39;t even capitalism anymore; it&#39;s capitalism gone rogue. </p>

<p>And, uh, you just listed several incredibly recent events that have literally nothing to do with the steady nosedive from the 50&#39;s till now that I addressed multiple times. Each bullet point was also a dramatic oversimplification that has absolutely nothing to do with staggering CEO/worker wage inflation, housing crisis, education debt, I could go on. Would you like me to go on? </p>

<p>When I think SJW, I think of someone like me and my peers, who are graduates and can&#39;t afford to live anywhere but squeezed in apartments with multiple strangers, who has to pay for gas in quarters or ride the bus, who will be paying for their education into their retirement, who can&#39;t find a job paying a living wage or benefits even though they obtained a degree in a competitive field, who has to choose between their phone bill and food for that week, or has a cavity and can&#39;t get it filled so they just deal with pain for months, or works even if they are on the verge of vomiting and because they cannot afford even a day&#39;s worth of missed hours... I think of people like myself and my peers, who spend every ounce of their energy justifying their existence when they grew up raised by parents who walked right out of college or even high school and got to play house with a wife and cars and a normal life and who told them they could be anything they wanted to be. </p>

<p>But again, I would love to share with you dozens upon dozens of articles, studies, forums, etc if someone living life in a certain demographic telling you what life in that demographic is an unreliable primary source. At the end of the day, I may not help your perceptions. However, the official consensus is certainly unanimous on this matter, whether you like it or not. It just sucks that you have to be so loud about your unfortunate opinions, because they are literally, factually just straight wrong, and it can really bum out people like me who have really, really big hearts. Have a good night🐵! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Taxes work as ratios. If I make more then you, I pay more taxes. It is basic math. Right now, however, if I make more than you, I pay significantly less taxes.&quot;</p>

<p>Im not sure where you live that taxes are set up that way. Progressive taxes mean the more you make, a larger % of your money goes to taxes.</p>

<p>Its basic math that&#39;s the opposite of an equitable system too. If it was &quot;fair&quot; high earners would pay a smaller percent since their smaller percent is more money than a lower earners actual amount put into the tax system. </p>

<p>Or a truly &quot;fair&quot; tax would be a flat tax. But we cant have nice things like a flat tax because people who get into positions of power are often dickheads who shelter all their money like Jeff Bezos and his ilk.</p>

<p>And actually, government corruption is incentivized by feeding the government more money and making it larger, something capitalism doesnt have much room for, but socialism is the epitome of.</p>

<p>I also didnt list recent events. Getting off the gold standard was something the Roman empire did before it collapsed, when they used base metal coins instead of gold and silver, and in the USA they started in the early 20th century(1913 i believe) and finished abolishing the standard in the 70s. Now your money is worth less than the denim its printed on. So a lot of whats wrong started long before the 50s.</p>

<p>Inflation because of outsourcing to slave labour countries isnt new either. Its been a slow slide into a new dark age where everything is made in a communist shithole, which makes a few CEOs wealthy while obliterating the middle class.</p>

<p>You wouldnt personally hold me at gunpoint to take &quot;your&quot; slice of my money. You have the government to do that on your behalf. Thats what socialism is: forced wealth redistribution to accomplish equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity.</p>

<p>And in a capitalist system, despite your accusation that it leaves people to starve if theyre unable to work because of disability, there is no reason not to have a safety net for stability. The Golden Rule applies there. Which is where the rationally selfish aspect of capitalism works wonders.</p>

<p>If i am able to work, but i get sick or hurt and cant work, obviously i would want some kind of safety net. So its in everyones best interest to have a system like that in place. Only its not pretending to be something it isnt, like in a socialist system. </p>

<p>In a socialist system, the government takes your money disproportionately and wastes it, lining the pockets of politicians and bureaucrats under the guise of social welfare.</p>

<p>The college debt thing isnt new either. Its a symptom of a paper pushing debt backed fake economy, where many people who &quot;make a living&quot; do so by doing something either completely useless or actually detrimental to others(think pricks like Bezos who exploit the system to get rich).</p>

<p>Failing to make your point means you have to fall back on the &quot;false consensus&quot; logical fallacy? Really? </p>

<p>So you cant defend socialism well enough with facts and reason, that you literally resort to &quot;However, the official consensus is certainly unanimous on this matter, whether you like it or not.&quot;</p>

<p>Official consensus amongst who?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually agree with most of what you said. I’ve lost many dear friends growing up because we just became incompatible over time. Most people just want to “conform”. They want the “cookie cutter” life. They want to “fit in” and be “normal” so bad they are willing to smother the part of their mind that begs for critical thinking and fearless individualism.</p>

<p>Then, on the other hand, I am also a skeptic. To me, 9/11 as an inside job has always been too far-fetched. But I’m always willing to change my mind, if I can see facts and logic. Just like I once did with the Mandela effect, for example.</p>

<p>so let&#39;s just say hierarchy is based on various shades of cannibalism, all shades require provisioning, so a 10 pounder goes to a 10 pounder eater and so on. in this case specifically, we would need roadmap knowledge, for instance this incident is part of a build up for west muslim 4th world war, we also need design knowledge specifically opportunity cost minimization, what all can be achieved by a single event and its msm portrayal</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They find passports and other identifying information left behind terrorist attacks all the time, it does not necessary mean government conspiracy. In fact terrorists are encouraged to ensure they are quickly identified. Also when the airplane hit there was massive ball of debris raining down the streets, its not like the passports were the only thing that survived its just that this is the most talked about and most well documented debris found.
If something is incredibly unlikely and the odds are really low, it does not mean that its impossible, that is a logical fallacy. In reality, either they actually survived or were planted at the location by co-conspirators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest data mining.</p>

<p>Once a flight has been hijacked, I suggest it would be fairly easy to identify the hijackers based on specific patterns: they likely worked in a group; you can probably eliminate families, regular business travelers. The FBI claims that they made very few attempts to conceal their identity, which would help quite a bit.</p>

<p>Then according to Wikipedia, the flight crew on one flight told them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two flight attendants called the American Airlines reservation desk during the hijacking. Betty Ong reported that &quot;the five hijackers had come from first-class seats: 2A, 2B, 9A, 9C and 9B.&quot;[5] Flight attendant Amy Sweeney called a flight services manager at Logan Airport in Boston and described them as Middle Eastern.[5] She gave the staff the seat numbers and they pulled up the ticket and credit card information of the hijackers, identifying Mohamed Atta.[6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At that point, it&#39;s probably trivial to figure out who was a hijacker and who wasn&#39;t, based on their connections to this group.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s significant. Small, light objects are more likely to survive an impact intact, so passports are a candidate, assuming they escape the burn area. Given the momentum, there&#39;s a decent chance a passport could escape the immediate crash site.</p>

<p>Not really a strong indicator for conspiracy.</p>

But then again, and I know this is one of the hotter topics discussed about 911, I just dont see why they would even lie about finding this. It wasnt very significant in helping to id, meaning they found out their id&#39;s through many other ways. And basically the entireity of the intellegence community was working on it post haste.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it was flying really low and knocked down many poles. It was in broad view of everyone driving to/from the Pentagon so there are vast witnesses. I&#39;m also pretty sure someone would say something if they were pre knocking the poles by a main road. I&#39;m on board with a false flag but I don&#39;t believe the no planes story.

Something like a dozen eye witnesses reported seeing a low flying plane but it was on a different path than the official reports say (iirc stuff like it was seen north rather than south of a particular building, it was banking in a different direction, different altitude, etc) and several eye witnesses claimed to have seen the plane flying from an opposite side of the pentagon, which would have been impossible if it had truly struck where they said it did. </p>

<p>People always point out that many witnesses saw a plane near the pentagon (such as the comment I replied to), I was merely adding that “eyewitnesses saw the plane” doesn’t confirm the official narrative at all, and in fact many of these eyewitness’s accounts cause more doubt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That... that makes a lot of sense. </p>

<p>Plus, having a heroic story of passengers fighting back and sacrificing themselves is probably a better, more reassuring story (especially in the wake of tragedy) than the government shot down a plane of people- even if absolutely necessary, because it was hijacked. That would turn a lot of people against the government, tbh. At least I would think so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no reason to lie about this as on 9-11 during the early morning chaos people were actively calling for fighters to shoot down planes.  The public would have totally understood why this was necessary after the planes hit the WTC.</p>

<p>You have to understand that hijackers crashing planes into buildings <em>never</em> happened before 9-11.  Prior to that day, hijacking meant someone stormed the cockpit, and flew the plane to another country, taking the passengers hostage as part of some political ransom.  The PLO did this in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, and communists tried to hijack planes and take them to Cuba in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s.</p>

<p>If you listen to the ATC tapes on 9-11, the hijackers come on the radio, explain that they have a bomb, and that they will issue their demands shortly.  They say this because this is exactly what happened with every single hijacking before this.</p>

<p>No one ever expected people to crash planes into buildings.  The moment people saw it happen in New York, people in the streets were demanding that other hijacked planes be shot down.</p>

<p>So the government wouldn&#39;t hav to lie about this because the public would not have been outraged.  It would have been the opposite.</p>

<p>What did outrage the public was the fact taht the fighters that were scramble over Northeast US airspace were <strong>all unarmed</strong>.  There was no protocol for scrambling fighters with live ammo in response to a commercial hijacking.  Because again, hijackings usually ended with he passengers surviving, and scrambled a fighter in pursuit raises the risk of the terrorist setting off a bomb if they have one or an accident or malfunction causing the jet to be shot down.</p>

<p>So suffice it to say, if commercial aircraft are intercepted in restricted airspace zones in the US, they are now intercepted by fighters with live ammo and a rigid engagement protocol that has the possibility of ending in an authorized shooting down of the plane.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_hijackings">Here is a list of hijackings from the entire history of commercial aviation.</a></p>

<p>How many of those ended with the hijacked airplane deliberately crashing into a building.  Not accidentally crashing, not a thwarted attempt to crash or a stated intent to do so, how many actually ended that way?</p>

<p>Interesting. Is there any precedence to this phenomenon occurring? Or is 9/11 the first example of that?</p>

<p>Another interesting theory. Do you have any sources for that? Because I&#39;ve been studying the 9/11 story for years, and that&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever heard that as a reason for NORAD&#39;s failure to respond. The only other place I&#39;ve ever seen the &quot;places in between radar towers that can not be detected&quot; was from the newest Fast and Furious movie with Charlize Theron.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How did a plane disappear entirely into the ground, without any debris</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was lots of debris. Generally, when a plane crashes, it does so under some minimal control. The pilots do everything that they can to prevent the crash, and so the plane is moving as slowly as possible when it hits the ground. This wasn&#39;t that. If you look at examples of plane crashes where a plane hit a mountainside at speed because they didn&#39;t know it was there.... in those crash sites, there&#39;s very little material left above a certain size.</p>

<p>In terms of the physics, this makes sense. In a low speed crash, the parts of the plane that take the initial impact absorb the kinetic energy and pass on only part of it, resulting in mostly intact fuselage and other parts while landing gear and the bottom of the plane will probably be completely destroyed.</p>

<p>But at higher velocities, the kinetic energy that is passed on by the parts that take the impact are still gigantic relative to the tensile and sheer strength of the rest of the parts of the plane. Essentially the ENTIRE plane acts as the impact point!</p>

<p>So what you expect to find are lots and lots of very small pieces strewn across a cone-shaped area as the motion of the parts become more and more an exercise in fluid dynamics, rather than something that approximates a simple newtonian point mass.</p>

<p>In other words, inside the pentagon, you expect to find a radiating cone of very small parts of that plane, passengers and cargo. :-/</p>

<p>Note: this comment is not meant as a pro-or-con statement with respect to any conspiracy theory. It is merely clarification on the physics of plane crashes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;m not commenting on any conspiracy theory surrounding this, and I&#39;m definitely not taking a side, here, but I also didn&#39;t say anything about anything vaporizing. Indeed, I was quite specific as to what one would expect to happen and what one would expect to find.</p>

<p>As to passports. Do you want me to get into why documents on someone&#39;s person might be intact? I assure you that it&#39;s not a description that is not without some ... unpleasant details. Suffice to say that water (which is basically all humans are in such a kinetic event) has some interesting properties related to its behavior, and while the chances of a document on someone&#39;s person being preserved are low, they&#39;re better than if that document were out in the open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since we&#39;re explaining things I figured I&#39;d also chime in to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How was a hijacked plane allowed to fly in the skies for over an hour without NORAD intercepting it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pre-9/11 there had been dozens of plane hijackings, but they were all hostage situations. 
you can check a full list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_hijackings">here.</a></p>

<p>Shooting the planes out of the air was the last thing on people&#39;s minds. They assumed it was just another hostage situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a vague memory as well of hearing some interviews with key people (who were close to, but not in the line of decision making that day, since obviously any lawyer worth their salt told the people who were in that decision making chain to shut the hell up) saying that they would not have shot them down, even if they&#39;d suspected the danger. A military attack on a US civilian aircraft over US territory would absolutely result in several court marshals pre-9/11 and might even have reached as high as impeachment hearings, had there been proof that the President was in the loop.</p>

<p>The fact that 9/11 weakened our national sense that the military should never be used against domestic targets is, IMHO, one of the strongest pieces of evidence that a coordinated conspiracy existed (regardless of who you think originally planned and executed the attacks).</p>

<p>To go even deeper into that rabbit hole, I would say that conspiracy theories about whether planes caused the towers to fall or whether there was a plane that hit the Pentagon are dangerous distractions from the real threat: that nearly instantaneous response from the intelligence and military apparatus that shifted the balance of power in the United States, resulting in the casual use of NSLs; the cementing of the notion that the President can engage wars wherever and whenever he likes and should inform the Congress more than engage it in an advise and consent role; the sharing of information between all intelligence agencies; the unifying of Homeland Security (a disturbingly totalitarian sounding phrase if ever I heard one); and the deep ties established between banking and intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>All of that happened very, very fast by government standards, and I don&#39;t think anyone really understands the extent of what happened or its full implications, outside the heads of those organizations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry, but this could not be more incorrect. In fact, one admitted reason for their lack of response, is that NORAD jus so happen to be running a drill about commercial planes being hijacked to be flown into the White House.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your link says that norad had practiced drills for intercepting rogue passenger planes coming in from other countries. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t change anything I said in my post, other than maybe they had thought about the possibility. </p>

<p>Either way, there had still been dozens of plane hijackings, almost all hostage situations, most of which were handled successfully with few or no civilian deaths. There was no way norad was going to just shoot down a passenger plane full of U.S. citizens, that wasn&#39;t even part of the conversation back then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there was a TON of debris from flight 93, spread across a considerable distance. Have you seen images of other plane crashes? 93&#39;s &quot;small impact hole&quot; was entirely consistent with what one would expect given similar crashes in the past. Jesus H, there are legitimate, science-based responses to so many of these types of queries--the conspiracy here is why, despite rigorous and detailed explanations for much of the phenomena consistently recycled as evidence of some kind of grand cover-up or government collusion, otherwise intelligent people continue to debate these things ad nauseum instead of examining the questions and aspects of the event that are geopolitically imperative to discuss. The government, as a whole, is far too incompetent to orchestrate such an event; why intelligence regarding threats of such an attack were not responded to seriously, and adequate defense strategies against the threatened terrorism not implemented, are far more interesting avenues of query, as are the govt&#39;s subsequent response, war, and entirely overreaching legislation and programs that completely trample on citizens&#39; rights with no oversight in the name of &quot;security&quot; that interest me. Saudi Arabia harbored terrorist groups with impunity, the Bin Ladens were quickly flown out of the US, but instead we go after Iraq and depose Saddam, an admittedly horrible man, but one who managed to keep factions somewhat in check in the region and had no culpability in the event. By doing so, we basically installed ISIS and created even more intense anti-US/westetn hosyiloyu. We supportrd the mujaheed with weapons and training when the RRussians invested Afghanistan, and those same US-sponsored groups suddenly became &quot;terrorists&quot; and enemies. Everythibg subsequeny to thre attacks, inclusing MSM&#39;s narrative reharding the Middle East, is criminal. But no, let&#39;s discuss thermite and &quot;molten steel&quot; that didnt exist and controlled detonation and the planes were actually holograms! bullshit. &quot;Red pill&quot; the &quot;sheeple&quot; with ridiculpus shit, becUse anything else actually requres some critical thinking and brainpower.</p>

<p>I have a lot of questions about the Pentagon, don&#39;t get me wrong, but let me play Devil&#39;s Advocate for a moment, why go to all the trouble to hit the twin towers with airplanes, then hijack an airplane to fly really close to the Pentagon but only to hit the building with a missile?</p>

<p>What&#39;s the thinking behind that?  Why not just hit it with the plane?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By JOHN M. DONNELLY The Associated Press 03/03/00 5:44 PM Eastern 
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military&#39;s money managers last year made almost $7 trillion in adjustments to their financial ledgers in an attempt to make them add up, the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general said in a report released Friday. 
The Pentagon could not show receipts for $2.3 trillion of those changes, and half a trillion dollars of it was just corrections of mistakes made in earlier adjustments. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>January 7, 2001
The Defense Department&#39;s inspector general recently identified $6.9 trillion in accounting entries, but $2.3 trillion was not supported by adequate audit trails or sufficient evidence to determine its validity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>January 11, 2001
Senator Byrd: A recent article in the Los Angeles Times, written by a retired vice admiral and a civilian employee in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, accused the Department of Defense of being unable to account for the funds that Congress appropriates to it. The authors wrote, and I quote in part, quote, &quot;The Pentagon&#39;s books are in such utter disarray that no one knows what America&#39;s military actually owns or spends.&quot; ...
That audit report found that out of $7.6 trillion in department-level accounting interest, 2.3 trillion in entries either did not contain adequate documentation or were improperly reconciled or were made to force buyer and seller data to agree. This DoD-IG report is very disturbing..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ebruary 12th 2001
The inspector general of the Pentagon said there are 2.3 trillion dollars in items that they can&#39;t quite account for. That&#39;s not billion. That&#39;s trillion dollars. $2.3 trillion -- and the General Accounting Office said there are about $27 billion in inventory items that they can&#39;t find.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>It was announced several months before, and had been discussed in the MSM circuit that entire time, and on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s so easy to test that I&#39;m surprised no one has done it full-scale. The hard part would be making a rocket sled powerful enough to get a fuel-laden wing-section up to speed.</p>

<p>Quarter-scale tests would be a lot cheaper and fairly convincing too. </p>

What about the plane debris recovered at the scene?  What about the clean up crew who claim they were cleaning up a plane?  What about the black box recovered at the scene?</p>

<p>lol I love a good conspiracy theory, but this one has always been hilariously flimsy.  There is no evidence to support it was a missile, you just want to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t see footage of the Pentagon being hit because in 2001 there were no cameras point at that side of the pentagon that were recording at a frame rate high enough to capture the plane entering the frame prior to being hit  and it hitting  the building in a subsequent frame. There is footage of the impact and explosion, but the frame rate is too low to capture the plane.</p>

<p>More specifically, because you would want to see the plane&#39;s identifying marks (the livery colors, the logo on the tail or side, etc), 
you can calculate the necessary frame rate by determining the camera&#39;s optimum distance from the building, the camera&#39;s FOV necessary to capture all the detail you want, the length of the plane (or at least the length of the plane from the tip of the nose to the identifying mark), and the speed of the plane.</p>

<p>And when you do this math, you will find that for an ordinary camera at 60 FPS to capture that impact with all the detail necessary to dispel any suspicion of it being a missile, that camera would have to be so far away from the building that you&#39;d all be suspicious of the fact that a camera that far away was pointed at that building at that time.</p>

<p>Building 7 fell in the evening because it had been on fire since the morning, and it was too unstable for fire crews to enter.  Debris from the collapse of the other buildings made it impossible to get larger fire engines, cranes, etc to the scene.  </p>

<p>In addition to the fires burning for over 8 hours, the collapse of each of the WTC towers was the seismic equivalent of two magnitude 2 earthquakes.  And building 7 was right at the epicenter of both of those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an unfathomable suspense of reason to believe even one of these arguments.  Regardless of your explanation of frame rates that sound correct but aren&#39;t how could you possibly believe that the plane was flying fast enough and the walls of the pentagon being strong enough to DISINTEGRATE AN ENTIRE AIRLINER???  </p>

<p>If a magnitude 2 earthquake could take down a huge building in New York City then there is a whole other set of questions that need to be asked.  </p>

<p>I usually stay away from this subject because I lived through the aftermath and admittedly Im not well versed in the details but for god&#39;s sake.  Things do not add up.  There may be one or two explanations that sound reasonable but when you look at the whole of the disaster.  There are way more questions than answers.  Any reasonable person whether &quot;tinfoil hatted&quot; or not has to be able to see that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are cherry picking.  I never said what you are claiming I said.  I said fire + earthquakes could have brought the building down.  Specifically, the building was on fire, then it was at the epicenter of a magnitude 2 surface level earthquake.  Then it continued to burn, then it was at the epicenter of ANOTHER magnitude 2 earthquake, and then it continued to burn for 8 more hours.  Then if finally collapsed.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this, how many times has a building already on fire been at the epicenter of 2 earthquakes, then continued to burn, but did not collapse?  Has that ever happened?  </p>

<p>Not a building that was on fire started by the earthquake, but the building had to be on fire first already, and then randomly and totally by coincidence endured two earthquakes centered 60 ft away?  What are the survival statistics for this kind of building?</p>

<p>The Parthenon survived 2000 years through earthquakes and multiple explosions, but is now being completely destroyed by <em>rain</em> that happens to be a bit more acidic than usual.</p>

<p>Catastrophic failure is the result of multiple marginal failures in a cascade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not cherry picking. I could see this POSSIBLY happening if the entire building was engulfed in flames and didn&#39;t have a STEEL structure.  How would the steel collapse from a normal building fire? There couldn&#39;t have been jet fuel in that building because no planes hit it.  A magnitude 2 earthquake is not much at all.  Buildings are built to survive much stronger earthquakes.  A 2 is a bit of shaking.  The structure should have withstood all of this.  Instead it collapsed in free fall?? </p>

<p>The basis for your argument is mostly speculation. Yet you choose to believe that it makes sense to you.   You believe what you want to believe but to me there are a lot of questions.  </p>

The video is shot from about 900ft below and at least 200 feet away, so call it 800 feet away. Look at how fast the plane comes in from the left, and how few frames you get of it.</p>

<p>The entire length of a side of the pentagon around 930ft.  If you want to capture a plane hitting the pentagon with this same low quality, then camera would need to be in Arlington Cemetery, or a  random spot halfway deep into the parking lot, and again, they&#39;d have to be this far away and pointed back at the building in order to capture a fov that is completely useless in every respect except on the odd chance an airliner crashes into it, at which point you have a video that proves a plane crashed into the building, as if the gaping hol and the fire and the debris wasn&#39;t proof of this.</p>

<p>These were <em>two</em> quakes, right at the surface, and immediately adjacent to wtc7, which had already been on fire.</p>

<p>So the question is neither &quot;Did fire bring the tower down&quot; nor is it &quot;Did the seismic shocks from the collapse of the other buildings bring it down&quot;.  Either of these separately may not have brought them down.  The question is whether the combination of the two did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Fact is this still remains the only tower to have ever fallen from fire damage. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one has stated that it fell from fire damage.  I haven&#39;t made that claim.  I&#39;m saying that there were multiple contributing factors, of which fire was one, and the combination of all of them brought it down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what free fall means.  Free fall is when the only force acting on an object is gravity.  The moment you drop something from your hand it is in free fall.</p>

<p>More importantly, a building isn&#39;t in free fall whether it&#39;s bombed, detonated or jsut collapses under it&#39;s own weight.  Building, especially steel buildings are a lattice, and different parts of it can move at different times.  So the entire building is not in free fall or not, but parts of it may be at different times.</p>

<p>It you want to believe that that building was felled in a controlled demolition, then you should be able to prove that using facts that don&#39;t also support a completely different theory.  </p>

<p>For my part, I think the building collapsed due to a prolonged fire across multiple floors lasting over 8 hours which stressed the internal structure of the building, that stress being exacerbated by the seismic shock from the separate collapse of two of the tallest buildings in the world less than 3 blocks away and which sent additional debris into the building causing additional damage and fueling the fire.  I can prove that (a) the buidling was on fire (b) the shock from the collapse of the WTC towers registered on seismographs as two separate magnitude 2.x earthquakes, and (c) I can show that the fire cause structural weakienng on at least two floors prior to the collapse as shown in videos where windows in rows and columns are shattered and the framing appears buckled (suggesting the floor above has partially collapsed).  </p>

<p>You and the WTC7 theorists in general cannot provide a single shred of evidence.  Not a single witness who will testify under oath, not a single shred of paperwork or other documentation.  Nothing.  You have the same amount of evidence to back up your theory as the theory that aliens zapped WTC7 from space. </p>

<p>Today is the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. Whereas the 19 9-11 hijackers killed almost 3000 people in 3 buildings, Timothy McVeigh was able to destroy 1/3 as many buildings and 5% that number of people all by himself with a rental van, fuel, and fertilizer.  Now which is scarier to you: that there is some hidden conspiracy centrally planning, controlling, and executing all national events according to some plan to enrich themselves and extend their dominance, or that a small number of people can slaughter thousands whenever they want using only the items and materials we all have at hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if anyone posted this- speed post. There is a theory too that the plane meant for building 7 was flight 93. If you time up the trajectory, it would have hit the building just before its controlled demo. This also falls in line with the &quot;pull it&quot; thing, and why people saw an f-16 take down 93. This is my theory: the people on the plane DID try to stop what was happening, and thus, it was shot down. (Do you even know how great of a marketing campaign that is? Not only did they kill everyone on board flight 93, but they also made money off their death in the sense that a major motion picture was put out, dedicated to their heroism. It&#39;s fucked up) Then, the controlled demo went down on building 7, and the government figured the people would never think the wiser, despite the blaring contradiction of an event as building 7 was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgot the guy&#39;s name, Ryan something. Did an AMAZING documentary on 9/11. Its honestly the best I&#39;ve seen, most logical, and most compelling. He basically traced their intended route and it matched up perfectly with the building 7 collapse, I think by a few minutes. So if you can consider that 93 may have been meant for building 7, it paints a whole new picture on what may have happened with the two separate incidents. I think it makes way more sense that 93 actually an incident where people reacted correctly, and we shot it down. Why else wouldn&#39;t they want to show the second debris field? ;-) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The explanation I&#39;ve heard for Tower 7 kind of makes sense. I think the theory is that gigantic pieces of debris had fallen from Tower 1 or 2 through the roof of Tower 7, creating major damage to the frame of the building. That, combined with fire fed by tons of paperwork, ultimately resulted in the collapse.</p>

<p>Fire alone has never brought down a building, but dropping a few tons of concrete through the roof might.</p>

<p>Hell you could have 100 towers hit by a plane in the exact way, and 50 fall and 50 are saved.</p>

<p>That wouldnt mean if 2 towers were hit 1 must fall while the other survives. </p>

<p>We have evidence of buildings collapsing due to fire only, due to structural failure, and similar buildings not failing under similar situations.</p>

<p>No not any of the wtc buildings, other buildings have collapsed due to fire alone of similar construction in nearly identical ways.</p>

<p>How the fire propogates, how it is starved or supplied oxygen, what structural columns are intact or not intact and hell pure luck(aka not all buildings of the same design are the same, corners being cut, some higher quality steel some lowe4 quality steel while both still meet minimum standards etc etc etc)</p>

<p>How much steel weakens then? A quick google search said normal house fire can reach 1800F. How much of stregth would you say is left at ~1000F? </p>

<p>Enough to make the top floors slide off? Break down ABOVE the fire? Maybe. Make the whole building symmetrically fall in on itself at freefall speeds? And not just two buildings, one that wasnt even hit by a plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just asked about steel stregth for now..
I investigated myself.
At 1800F the stregth is reduced to about 10%.
At 1100F 50%.
Plane crashed and it cut some structures but the building could take it and didn&#39;t collapse. Seems that Jetfuel burned rather quickly(minutes) and the main heat source came from office interiors allowing supporting structures to weaken. Why did you mention only jetfuel burning when reports say it basicly just started the fires?</p>

<p>Knowing this I&#39;d say there was enough heat for a few floors to collapse even on such a redundantly strong building.</p>

<p>Wikipedia confirms the top collapsed
From wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the South Tower collapsed, NYPD helicopters relayed information about the deteriorating conditions of the North Tower. At 10:20 am, the NYPD aviation unit reported that &quot;the top of the tower might be leaning&quot;, and a minute later reported that the North Tower, &quot;is buckling on the southwest corner and leaning to the south&quot;. At 10:28 am, the aviation unit reported that &quot;the roof is going to come down very shortly&quot;.[26] The North Tower collapsed at 10:28 am, after burning for 102 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s ask more questions..
How much weight can one floor support?
When top falls and collapses like that can the floor below it support that? They are not designed to for sure.
Every floor below that has more crap to support. Easy to assume they come down like they did atleast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the videos. There was no visible buclking or leaning until it started to fall <em>straight down into its own footprint</em>.</p>

<p>And even if the jet fuel, which is kerosine, and not particularly hot burning in an open air deflagration, started fires in a steel, concrete and asbestos building... wtf burned? Some chairs, carpets and wood desks? The WTC wasnt some giant dry wood structure doused in gasoline. It was mostly nonflammable. </p>

<p>Also, people walked through the area that was supposedly a raging inferno, without any equipment, some of them multiple times. How? Fires didnt burn the stuff they said, thats the simplest explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you can quite easily calculate the forces involved. Thats why airplanes dont just fall out of the sky very often, buildings can be built thousands of feet tall, vehicles can fly into space and survive re entry. Its because people can calculate the forces involved.</p>

<p>Or how about the RS25 engine(Space Shuttle Main Engine) If you think humans cant create things designed to withstand extreme forces, with exacting precision look no further than the turbopumps, metallurgy, and design of the RS25 engine. </p>

<p>Yes, there are failures that can happen unexpectedly, but given the fact that all 3 WTC buildings that fell... within hours of each other... were designed with <em>several times</em> the strength needed for redundancy, its highly unlikely that they failed due to cool burning office fires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually as surprising as it seems it would. I mean when you think about it it make sense. The steel is holding all that weight above it. It weakens due to the heat, won’t take many beams to fail before all the weight then shifts to the other weakened beams and you’ll have full failure of that section. All that weight on top then comes crashing down and triggers a chain reaction. Steel is great for holding things in place, but any movement or sudden impact/shift in weight it will buckle and fail. - I work with steel. I’m not saying this wasn’t a set up, I’m just saying the steel beam melting argument doesn’t hold up. Plenty more do, you should Argue them instead</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re saying is very true, except that i would argue in the scenario which you describe, the failure would surely be asymmetrical (from the weakest point and spreading out)? </p>

<p>And I&#39;ll even go as far as to say that there is always a chance in a million that you could get a perfectly symmetrical failure but that &#39;chance&#39; increases astronomically when you add in the 2 other buildings also falling symmetrically on the same day, with 1 of those buildings being a completely different design from the other two (WTC 7).</p>

<p>I also have an issue with &#39;top section&#39; theory, the one that crashes through the lower section. Aside from obvious problem with the physics of it (Newtons 3rd law).</p>

<p>And in relation to the &#39;top section&#39; theory is also the question of the massive steel cross section &#39;hat truss frame&#39; that sat on top of the towers <a href="https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=910105">[Figure 6]</a>. As there was no weight above this, we would expect to see it somewhat intact on top of the pile. It was not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fourth major structural subsystem was located from the 107th floor to the roof of
each tower. It was a set of steel braces, collectively referred to as the “hat truss”. Its
primary purpose was to support a tall antenna atop each tower, although only WTC 1 had a tall
antenna installed. The hat truss provided additional connections among the core columns and
between the core and perimeter columns, providing additional means for load redistribution.</p>

<p>The fact that the official story even says that something like 90% of the fuel was consumed on impact, the WTC was full of fireproof asbestos, and not much to burn, plus the smoke was black... except for unexplained white smoke occassionally, then a stream of molten steel pours out, then it falls down, indicates that other than at very specific times the fires burned very cool and oxygen starved(like 700C cool).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But like, he seems to be connecting it with satanic imagery, so he is even wrong on a theological level. The Pentagon in no way looks like a *pentagram (which I think he meant), and the number 7 can easily be considered holy in mainstream Christianity. The seven years of tribulation in the book of revelations, or the 7 days it took for god to create everything according to the book of genesis. I&#39;m not religious, but anyone who reads the bible can easily see the flaws in this logic. </p>

<p>I happen to live in a location in the midwest that is close to &quot;the devil&#39;s tower&quot; and a beautiful pool deep in a canyon called &quot;Devil&#39;s bathtub&quot;. These weren&#39;t named that due to some overarching satanic conspiracy, just like the pentagon sure as hell wasn&#39;t built to represent that. </p>

<p>The pentagon, as a shape and word, has been around since the time of the ancient greeks, far before the birth of Christianity. So basing any of his point in supposed satanic imagery is even more ridiculous.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Four of the hijackers&#39; passports have survived in whole or in part. Two were recovered from the crash site of United Airlines flight 93 in Pennsylvania. These are the passports of Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al Ghamdi. One belonged to a hijacker on American Airlines flight 11. This is the passport of Satam al Suqami. A passerby picked it up and gave it to a NYPD detective shortly before the World Trade Center towers collapsed. A fourth passport was recovered from luggage that did not make it from a Portland flight to Boston on to the connecting flight which was American Airlines flight 11. This is the passport of Abdul Aziz al Omari.&quot;&quot;In addition to these four, some digital copies of the hijackers passports were recovered in post-9/11 operations. Two of the passports that have survived, those of Satam al Suqami and Abdul Aziz al Omari, were clearly doctored. To avoid getting into classified detail, we will just state that these were manipulated in a fraudulent manner in ways that have been associated with al Qaeda.&quot;</p>

<p>3 of the 4 were reasonable imo. The one in NYC seems a tad ridiculous.</p>

<p>Same thing happens if there&#39;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXnZ-5bj8as">bomb threat</a> or a hijacking. </p>

<p>So seeing fighters following flight 93 doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it was shot down. Neither does the particularly sparse wreckage. You can look up photos of shot down aircraft that are surprisingly intact. Maybe they were shot down, but I think it&#39;s more likely they hit the ground at high speed (as opposed to a speed closer to that during an attempted landing) and were subsequently smashed into smithereens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one in NYC is the least ridiculous.  Watch the impact footage, especially of the second plane (because by then the cameras are fixed and focused on the towers and the shots are clear).</p>

<p>When the second plane hits, you see debris <strong>exit the other side of the building</strong>.  The passports were found blocks away.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible (though I&#39;m not convinced) that on impact the windows of the cockpit were blown out and the clothing of the people in the cockpit who were not wearing belts were flung forward through the building at 200+ miles an hour and were ejected out the side, escaping the fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are some of the &#39;hijackers&quot; still alive?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one report:
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm</a></p>

<p>Pretty sure there were others.</p>

<p>Also this from u/Schkeptick</p>

<hr/>

<p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2808599.stm">BBC reported</a> in 2003 that the FBI obtained DNA from their hotel rooms and rental cars.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Hijackers_DNA_profiles">This page</a> has a really interesting response to that, however - including quotes from one guy who said the pilots would have been vaporized, and that any matching DNA would more likely come from someone who was in the back of the airplane.</p>

<p>And I find <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/remains-of-9-sept-11-hijackers-held/">THIS</a> to be really disturbing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Families of the airplanes&#39; passengers and crews and those who died within the Pentagon provided DNA samples, typically on toothbrushes or hairbrushes, to aid with identification. The remains that didn&#39;t match any of the samples were ruled to be the terrorists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are we seriously saying we decided someone was a hijacker because some family in Saudi (or wherever) didn&#39;t have DNA to submit to the FBI? In the middle east even relatively poor families frequently have a housemaid, and the house is cleaned pretty meticulously every day. You wouldn&#39;t have a hairbrush sitting around dirty for months.</p>

<p>Also the fire that took down the tower had to build over time. The building didn’t fall the instant the plane hit. The building did survive a plane strike. It was the fire after the fact, that built over a period of time and across the spans of a bunch of floors and square footage that allowed enough heat to build up and weaken the steel. It’s not rocket science, just basic science.  </p>

<p>Also there is debris like passports and magazines, news papers, photographs etcetera after almost all plane crashes. </p>

<p>People just want to assign conspiracy to normal science and scenarios. Not speaking towards who organized the attack or why. Just the basic things that are being doubted have very basic reasons behind them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let’s start by doing away with the passive aggressive nonsense ok?  Your question would have been just as effective had it left off the “professor” comment. If you want to have an intellectual conversation with people who have something to add, the last thing you want to do is show your teeth. Ego and entitlement won’t win you a thing. </p>

<p>Secondly, contents burning from within the building added “fuel” to the fire and thermal expansion weakened the structure. I work in the construction field and have an understanding of how things are built. And furthermore due to my extensive training as a fire fighter, hazmat technician, as well as a flood and fire technician I have an understanding of how things burn and react. The idea that explosives brought down WTC 7 is popular theory and for all the evidence out there, it’s not hard to believe either.  That said, structural reports from actual engineering firms spell a different outcome with a less than fantastic ending. As tragic as the events were that took part that day, unfortunately for conspiracy theorists, it’s science rather than fantasy that took that building down.  (I responded to the Pentagon and worked for a very long time in support of that mission) and I’m from NYC, I am personally attached to both incident scenes and don’t take speaking to those events lightly. I’d love to be able to blame it on explosives set by our own government as a coverup.  It’s just not so, at least at that level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s &quot;proving a negative.&quot; which is easy to do.  Here are five simple questions that DESERVE answers and create a shit-ton more questions.  1) Why was there only ONE turbofan (that is too small for the aircraft) pictured @ the Pentagon on a twin-engine plane?  2) Why was all the non-Pentagon local security camera footage confiscated? 3) Why did the wings not shear off--unable to penetrate a concrete building, and the tail section?  4) How is it a violation of national security to release security camera footage of the exterior of the Pentagon--that is in clear view of anyone standing outside of the Pentagon, or Googling images?  5) If they released a few frames from a parking camera of the &quot;plane&quot; hitting the Pentagon, why can they not release full motion video?  What about video of a similar angle?  Bonus Question: Why did a CNN reporter claim a cruise missile hit the Pentagon?  I saw this LIVE on Sept 11 as I watched the coverage on the CNN television broadcast. (Also there is a video of it floating around - find it.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hundreds of people were not involved.  The Trade Centre buildings were the only ones wired by say, 3 small teams during the weekends.  Tell everyone not involved they are doing &quot;maintenance&quot; or &quot;Wiring a new fibre optic network&quot; or something, and you don&#39;t attract attention. How often is maintenance done on a building people work in?  Nobody ever cares, and if they ask, it&#39;s a simple &quot;Maintenance&quot; or whatever.  Also the guy in charge of security @ WTC was GWB&#39;s cousin.   As for the actual people who did the explosives wiring - they were probably not U.S. Citizens, and don&#39;t have any love for the US, or deep black ops or something like that.  In terms of keeping a secret, good God!  How much actually occurs in this world that nobody knows anything about??  A few examples:  The F117 Stealth fighter before it was &quot;presented&quot; to the world.  What about the &quot;Stealth&quot; Blackhawk helicopter from the Bin Laden raid?  Shit, nobody even knows what that looks like!  And we know it exists now, and have seen the tail section.  Sure, there&#39;s theories about what it looks like, but no one has ever seen it in person and told us, or leaked a photo.  Secrets, BIG secrets, are way easier to keep than you would think--especially if the penalty of talking is &quot;death&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What?</p>

<p>All 3 buildings that collapsed at the WTC were steel frame with absolutely no concrete core. </p>

<p>In building 7, the fire was fueled not by paper but all manner of materials in these fully occupied offices. Carpet, plastics, wood and various other synthetic materials. Not only that but I believe it was fueled by fuel reserves from a generator system in the building. </p>

Psst, you might not know this, but concrete is used as the foundation for buildings most of the time.</p>

<p>As for &#39;office supplies&#39; those would of burned up &amp; been gone in a matter of minutes. You ever burn a plastic spoon with a torch? that fuckers gone faster than a deadbeat being asked for child support, and a fire of that magnitude is way hotter than a torch will reach.
Carpet would add a few minutes burn time, same as wood. not keep it going for hours.</p>

<p>And even if there were fuel reserves for generators, they would be ground level or below, First few floors would of been on fire, and we would of seen the fire slowly go up if that had been the case and there were &#39;fuel reserves&#39; for the generators.</p>

<p>&#39;Giant Concrete &amp; Steel building collapsed from a paper fire.&#39;</p>

<p>Why even mention it then? Concrete floors are meaningless. </p>

<blockquote>

You ever burn a plastic spoon with a torch? that fuckers gone faster than a deadbeat being asked for child support, and a fire of that magnitude is way hotter than a torch will reach. Carpet would add a few minutes burn time, same as wood, assuming this is flooring we&#39;re talking about and not chunks of logs, not keep it going for hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are vastly underestimating just how much material is in an office building like this. You talk about a 3 gram spoon as if that is in any way relatable to the hundreds of tons of material in this building. You seem to be out of your depth here in all honesty. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And even if there were fuel reserves for generators, they would be ground level or below, First few floors would of been on fire, and we would of seen the fire slowly go up if that had been the case and there were &#39;fuel reserves&#39; for the generators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>100% inaccurate. There were diesel tanks scattered throughout the building. The largest of the tanks were on the ground floor near the loading docks but several smaller tanks were on the 2nd and 7th floor as well as others I believe higher up in the building. </p>

<p>By the way, going forward...you don&#39;t say could of or would of. It&#39;s could&#39;ve or would&#39;ve as in could have or would have. </p>

<p>Several days later I went back to show a friend and it was gone. In its place was a crappy doctored version showing a glob meant to look like a plane. Early video editing sucked. I&#39;ll never forget.</p>

<p>Building 7 was a controlled demo. They had to yank the foundation support members, because collapsing towers&#39; debris smashed into 7 and it imposed a direct risk to recovery efforts at ground zero.</p>

<p>The Pentagon stuff I assumed was because aliens or some bullshit excuse about national security, so secret service collected all the security camera footage from everyone in a few block radius. Not so sure, but shouldn&#39;t that stuff be accessible now thru FOIA ? </p>

<p>I dunno. National security and stuff seems to hold precedent over certain issues.</p>

<p>I do very in-depth research into these types of occurrences because it is my job. I even considering things, like facts, that may go against my own personal hypothetical idea of what may have happened.</p>

<p>What the fuck is it with you people and thinking it takes explosives to bring down a building like that? That, in itself, shows what little you know about how these buildings are constructed. Seriously, go look it up. By look it up, I do actual fucking research on your own. Credited resources, factual information. Physics, materials and methods, industry standards, and you can probably just graze over demolition techniques because at this point you are probably just going to recite your echo chamber bullshit, that has no actual foothold into science outside the internet infrastructure you watch a few YouTube videos on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, I don&#39;t need to elaborate. That is the idea of adding extra information to further define a point being made. The proof is in the pudding. </p>

<p>You have key structural members in any type of building. Just as you would desire the building to collapse in on itself, in the event it was to ever need to be brought down, ripping out, destroying, However you want to call it, enough structural members will cause the building to collapse in on itself. You do not need explosives to do it either. It&#39;s like dominos. Pull enough of them in particular spot it causes a chain reaction.</p>

<p>The back end of 7 was seriously damaged, there are plenty of photos of it too. They are either ignored or pandered as some other conspiracy involved with another building, and it was going to be coming down either way. Not an if it comes down, but when it comes down.</p>

<p>They used heavy machinery, &quot;pulled&quot; the mainframe members, and building was demoed after they insured it was evacuated. Yes, this was a hasty decision. Yes, it could have gone very wrong and endangered even more people. Fortunately it did not. Unfortunately, that little bit of history and engineer mastering gets over looked in the search for bombs and holographic airplanes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LoL..yeah. Your questions/response is exactly why I don&#39;t provide that info anymore. I am just off work, tired, got my kids, and not willing to dig up old case studies, college research papers, or even suggest more than the idea of using Google to look up &quot;debunk 911 conspiracy theories&quot;. I know your head may explode with you trying to disprove legitimate facts and science, but that works out better for me.</p>

<p>I am just not that emotionally involved with this debate anymore. I did my homework, got the grade, the degrees and I moved the fuck on. I am over trying to piss in the wind with people who think they know what they are talking about when it comes to this topic.</p>

<p>All the buildings fell exactly how they are being told they fell. Stop detracting from all the actual experts who posses legitimate credibility, and professional opinions. Shut the fuck up and follow the money. That is where the real evil and nefarious actions transpired. Greedy rich people allowed fucked up things to happen, so they could better their social economic status.</p>

<p>There was no need for bombs, fake plane, cruiser missles, or anything else. An ex CIA operative left over from cold war times had a vendetta to fuck shit up, and the current American establishment was to busy sucking it&#39;s own cock to even consider the idea of a cave dwelling, black sheep, Saudi Royal was capable of pulling off the next Pearl harbor. With the help of some pesky rich Saudi friends.</p>

<p>When certain members found out about the terror plot is yet tbd if ever. If that timeline could be proven, what motive would they have to not disclose it soon enough, and with the sense of urgency we all know it truely needed?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all good though. Please try to take some college class construction engineering courses though. Even if it&#39;s just the basics like an introduction to construction management, or something similar. It might help you understand a little bit more in detail.</p>

Unwitting actors, such as the head of (forgot what it&#39;s called off the top of my head) the command on the east coast that had all its fighters out on maneuvers are pawns to be played.</p>

<p>It could come down to ten or fewer people, with the rest being unwitting participants. Remember how long it took to find out that MLK was killed not by the assassins (plural) bullet but by suffocation in his hospital bed?</p>

<p>By the time the truth of 9/11 is made known, the people involved will be dead. This is why the truth about JFK will most likely never be known: small amount of conspirators,  unwitting participants, a patsy and they are most likely all dead by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 led to the deaths of 1000’s of American citizens in the military (combat deaths and suicides), 100,000’s of thousands of people in the Middle East (which we do not care about), and made this country more enemies than it has ever had. All this to satisfy the economic interests of those who put the “elected leaders” in their positions.</p>

<p>It also led to the paranoid government taking advantage of a tragedy in order to enact laws that violate our constitutional rights. So, the people that question the government, which should be encouraged (accountability is critical in a democratic system) can be silenced. It is too bad that you believe that we are an insignificant minority. It is your (and people like you) blind faith that put us in the position we are in. </p>

<p>The American military might is a myth. Technology has eliminated the need for a massive military. From a raw numbers standpoint, and the fact that we have stretched our military out over such a large area (far away from home), we are even more at risk. </p>

<p>We are now the bully country in the world today, and bullies eventually get taught a lesson. </p>

<p>Showing a plane hitting the Pentagon would strengthen your position on the need to continue to monitor us all in order to prevent it or something like it from happening again, and would actually encourage more people to trust a more transparent government.</p>

Sure not, but if the windows have frames duh, then you need to see the structural integrity of the thing as a whole, a window at a certain size can be as impenetrable and sturdy as a reinforce wall, and im sure they didn&#39;t use the windows your house use... But i mean what do i know, but if you can tell me, with proof that a jet crash into a window and it didnt shatter, ill buy it, but if you know exactly how the force of the impact was concealed, because obviously the start impact isn&#39;t with the wings, its with the nose, that in itself makes most of the force in the initial crash, then inertia from the crash would do a lot of damage to the wings, depending on how much structural damage was done from the waves of the impact, id like to know what was the amount of force and how it spread on the windows, was it directly to windows? was it mostly toward wall?  most people act like they are experts on how plane crashing into buildings would behave, but im sure they don&#39;t know half of what they imagine it would be like</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not asking you about that data, im saying that without that data, pictures like that, make really no sense, i don&#39;t know what you&#39;re pointing out, what window, and what was the leveling of the plane when hit, what was the direction the wings went after the initial hit, without much data, these questions are not very much more than, Oi, how that person survive a crash when all others died? Eh i call bullshit, plane didnt crash... Uhm there are circumstances in which, unlikely things happen, hell, miracles are quite common when you put things into perspective, but if you have barely seen a small frame of how the plane hit the building, why you so aeger to discredit the main story?</p>

<p>There needs to be a point in which, theories are justifiable, and when theories, are just, looking for any thing that might not make sense, without context... and if people fail to prove how it happen with 100% evidence, then the theory gets credit lol, first nothing ever happened, it was all fake videos, then the videos were real, but they were actually missles, then no they were planes, but the terrorists were americans, then oh my god, when did conspiracy theories went from, proving facts as wrong, to prove this theory wrong, or else it is valid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Official narrative: &quot;the plane was moving so fast that even with the state of the art cameras securing the Pentagon,  only a few frames show the plane in question. High speed cameras are not installed nor are needed. The cameras, perhaps Ill placed as they were; are merely a single tool in the defensive screen that protects the Pentagon.  Building 7 was impacted by falling debris from the towers and the additional weight, as well as the temperatures of the debris caused the collapse of the building.&quot;</p>

<p>And to the average person this sounds completely logical, hell even on the day I&#39;m sure most of us believed what we saw until we looked deeper.</p>

<p>There are too many unanswered questions,  coincidences and falsities regarding 9/11 for even the most braindead loyalist to disregard.</p>

But all records of anyone who said anything that didn&#39;t fit the narrative was scrubbed from any future replays of the videos?  You only see one angle of the impacts... When broadcast live there was at least 10 different videos circulating from multiple different angles.  There was also many videos taken during the collapse, also scrubbed was the videos from angles that showed anything that would be questionable such as the rejecting molten metal as it collapsed into it&#39;s footprint. (Which supposedly that was a &quot;safety&quot; feature that was designed into the building... Why does no other building have this feature from the era that the WTC buildings were made...I mean a fire breaks out and the building completely collapses, not topples as physics would suggest.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Add in the “heat” argument. People were standing in the gaping holes soon after the planes hit. I don’t disbelieve that there was a small window of time of extreme heat, but that was temporary.</p>

<p>People just don’t want to hear the truth and be forced to understand that they were led to believe something false. It is not easy to sleep at night when you have to question why your government turned on you, and have to acknowledge that the government was designed to aid the rich and protect their interests. The Project For the New American Century actually stated that we might need to create a disaster in order to justify using force in order to protect our economic interests, and get the American people to “buy in”.</p>

Also, the planes that hit the towers in NY appeared to have no side windows with cargo at the bottom of the nose of the plane, exploding on IMPACT???? Interesting how the tip of the nose can cause an immediate explosion on glass and stone. Bomb maybe? followed by demolition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this may sound like total B.S... so feel free to ignore it.</p>

<p>The evening of September 11th, my girlfriend (now wife) got a call on the cell phone she was borrowing from her father.  On the other end was a gentleman from the F.B.I., which was odd... since we&#39;re not even American.  They were trying to contact him because he owned a company that specialized in shoring equipment... the type that keeps buildings up after disasters.</p>

<p>The next day he was in the Pentagon with his equipment, and he took pictures... over 150.  I&#39;m no aviation enthusiast, but there are many that show parts that almost certainly came from a plane.  And I mean &#39;almost certainly&#39; in the way that your fingers are almost certainly connected to your hand, unless we discover evidence that says otherwise.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve long wanted to release the pictures somewhere, but have been concerned about the legality of him having taken them in the first place.  He&#39;s always said nobody questioned him about it or told him not to.</p>

<p>My plan has been to wait until he dies, and then upload them somewhere... and from what we hear, that could very well be this year.  </p>

<p>Either way, I have pictures... many of them.  There was definitely a plane.  </p>

<p>Flight 587: 265 lives lost (260 on aircraft / 5 on ground)</p>

<p>92 + 65 + 64 + 44 = 265.</p>

<p>According to the NTSB, flight 587 crashed because the vertical stabilizer ripped off due to the first officer&#39;s &quot;unnecessary and excessive&quot; rudder inputs in trying to stabilize the plane after encountering jet wash. The NTSB concluded that if he had stopped moving the rudders at any time before the stabilizer failed, the plane would have leveled out on its own, and the accident would have been avoided.</p>

<p>But I admit I have questions too.
Why didn&#39;t they shoot down the plane when it came into the air space surrounding the Pentagon?</p>

<p>Why is it always referred to as the collapse of the twin towers when it was three buildings?
Why has the media been so quiet about building 7, to the point that less than half of the population even knows that the building collapsed?</p>

<p>Why did it take so long for a building so far away to collapse?</p>

<p>Why did a plane strike cause a building (built with a latice of steel meant to withstand the impact of a plane) to collapse into its own footprint for the first time in history? Twice in row?</p>

<p>And with such a catastrophic result, why didn&#39;t the file a suit against the builders of the WTC?</p>

<p>It&#39;s bad enough that people know Israel was largely behind 9/11, but if people knew that Israel nuked NYC??? Whew.</p>

<p>Also, the derp state uses nuclear weapons and devices much more commonly than we&#39;re lead to believe. They want to keep that quiet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can see the footage. Just the moment of impact is conveniently missing. </p>

<p>Also, they discovered who the hijackers were because one of the hijackers wrote a suicide note, which he placed into his luggage to get on the plane he was about to fly into a building. (Why write the note) and just luckily his luggage was the only one that didn&#39;t make it on the plane. </p>

<p>Also no plane debris was found...Just a few passports which happen to conveniently pin point the hijackers.</p>

<p>Also several of the accused were found to be alive and well.</p>

<p>Not to mention building 7..</p>

<p>It seems that the only conspiracy theorist about 9/11 are those of us who have studied it.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>And because Larry Silverstein bought the Twin Towers just before the attacks, including building 7, which at the time were uninsured for Terrorist attacks via hijacked airplanes.</p></li>
<li><p>Larry then made his insurance company come up with a plan to insure his buildings against them, then 9/11 happens. The Twin towers FREE FALL into their own footprint, along with No.7 exploding. (By standers and fire fighters both report explosions) even though the building was physically untouched. Mind you, a steel building HAS NEVER once in the history of human kind fallen to any fire ever. It’s not hot enough. It happened 3 times on that morning.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Larry made billions that morning, and guess what? He made them pay out x3, 1 for each building.</p>

<p>As for the Pentagon, 2 billions dollars worth of gold went missing from the basement that day.</p>

<p>And the Twin Towers has countless records that many elite wanted gone. Back then, not everything was digital, lots was permanently destroyed. </p>

<p>Finally, it was our excuse to get in the war, we did the same exact thing for WWII with Peal Harbor.</p>

<li> move our entire west coast fleet as close as we can to Japan (Hawaii).</li>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no dude.  There was no terrorist who couldn&#39;t fly.  He clearly couldn&#39;t get that done.  My view is that they had a computer control that plane.</p>

<p>If you wat h CIT&#39;s work on the event, it should be pretty clear the plane never crashed there.  It flew over.  They had just recently renovated that exact side to protect it from bomb blasts specifically.  Perfect cover to rig the place to blow.</p>

<p>Thats why you dont see plane wreckage.  Click on my history and find my linked post with videos.  I am not making this up and I am also not being the asshole.  I simply know who was interviewed that day and what they said.  The witnesses to that event at the pentagon prove a plane flew by but were all fooled into thinking it impacted.  </p>

<p>Again, the gov confiscated 84 videos from the area that day.  Don&#39;t you think there would all be available to the public if they all showed and confirmed their side of the story?  Or are they with holding them because they would show something completely contrary to the story they sold the public?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well how about this one to throw into the mix.  There is a lot more evidence that the loop the plane did was different than the one we are told about via the NTSB.  The loop that is provided by the NTSB shows a fairly tight loop going into the building and also at a very high rate of speed.  The catch being, all this data came from the potential culprits, the Gov&#39;t or intelligence agencies.  So, a question to ask yourself is, do you trust that data?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5D2K19Y-aI">Either way, Steve Chaconas is another witness to the plane, though he was way down the river and saw it pass over the river showing a different flight path than is provided to us.  He is a fisherman who was taking some people out on the river to fish for the day.  He saw something quite different that the provided info.  The flight path provided by the NTSB did not at all have it pass over the river, the plane that hit the Pentagon (according to the NTSB has it coming from the east.  The video shows this.  Please watch it or at least glaze over it as well?</a></p>

<p>Then again, they confiscated all the video tapes from the area, 84 in all.  One would think that if those 84 videos supported the official story, you would see them posted everywhere as support to their version of the events.</p>

<p>[If you need more, watch the whole documentary put together by CIT.  They paid their own way out there and expected to see and get multiple witnesses to the event confirming the Gov&#39;t theory.  As you can see from Lloyds testimony in the car, they got entirely the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a conspiracy to not tell the american people the whole truth. A clear example of this &quot;blanket over the american mind&quot; you speak of occurs in the show the looming tower (amazon/bezos), that I think is quite blatant. It didn&#39;t take 15 minutes through the first episode to find a key misrepresentation of what Osama bin Laden said was the reason for the US being a legit target.</p>

<p>In the 1998 ABC interview of Bin Laden shown early on they cut around the previous and last sentences where he says exactly why a fatwa had been declared.</p>

<p>what they aired in subtitles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets, and this is what the fatwah says...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The middle eastern FBI character is shown transcribing the interview in arabic, presumably showing the full text of what they cut out. Why arabic? Because they don&#39;t want the majority of the audience to know what he actually said before and after.</p>

<p>Further, immediately next scene the characters have a discussion about WHY Osama is angry with America, is warning them, and conclude that it is because they are in the middle east and Saudi Arabia specifically. Had they included what he fully said they&#39;d know the main reason, and the reason which 20 years later Americans are just beginning to understand. </p>

<p>what OBL actually said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot; <strong>Your position against Muslims in Palestine is despicable and disgraceful</strong>. America has no shame. ... We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets, and this is what the fatwah says ... . The fatwah is general (comprehensive) and it includes <strong>all those who participate in, or help the Jewish occupiers in killing Muslims</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a network TV show that purports to be telling the public the truth about why 9/11 happened they do a pretty good job of selecting the basic facts to totally misrepresent it. </p>

THIS is what happens to a much m ore durable Phantom F4 when hitting a reinforced concrete wall during a durability test of French Nuclear reactors... nothing left but the wing tips</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FXIGCEiD7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FXIGCEiD7U</a></p>

<p>add to that ridiculously low capture frame rates at the pentagon.. you got cameras missing the action and virtually no plane remaining (much lighter aluminium instead of the Phantoms Titanium construction.   If you have ever watched a few eps of aircrash investigations, it is also clear how a plane at speed smashing into the ground leave s litte behind and a no too big crater.   I really really wish we could move past these points as part of the 911 conspiracy, cause there are other VERY good questions still remaining.... ie wheres the other Pentagon footage from local cameras... why the change of building insurance... Building 7, Building 7 and of course Building 7 which I really struggle to come up with even a ridiculous scenario that could rationally explain it&#39;s collaps. Why were the Sauds allowed to fly while Busch was grounded, why is the molten aluminium multiple expolosion hypotheseis totally ignored (and very likely)... why did an enquiry by Catherine Austin Fitts YET AGAIN result in federal records being lost in a building expolosion during an investigation into TRILLIONS missing from the budget (Rumsfeld made mention of this in the days before)</p>

<p>VERY VERY VERY worth watching.... dry, but extremely enlightening for those who &#39;follow the money&#39; - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0mimIp8mr8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0mimIp8mr8</a>
something every ufo, 911 and black ops conspiracy theorist should see  (she avoids all conspiracy topics and JUST talks about the money trail and her tendency to organise audits in building just about to blow up... including Oklahoma)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Building 7 has always perplexed me. We know it sustained damaged from debris from the collapsing towers striking it and it did have some fires inside. But nothing suggests it should spontaneously collapse like it did. It went down very neatly too, at least the footage makes it seem so. Instead of the whole building experiencing structural failure simultaneously throughout the entire building I would instead expect parts of the building to sag or collapse(if at all) depending on where the shrapnel from the other buildings struck it. I know its not a perfect comparison but still to make a point here; consider the Murrah building which was bombed in 1995. The whole front of that building was blown apart and yet the remainder of the building still stood. So how could pockets of damage here and there cause Building 7 to collapse completely as it did? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My questions are , why are people after over 15 years, with no real evidence or anyone credible have come forward and dismantle the biggest conspiracy, cause, the media was on it (fake videos) the  pentagon was on it, the president was on it, everyone was on it, cause they wanted to attack iraq right, yet no one credible has come out and pull the mask from the monster, why after 15 years have people not say, well you know what? Maybe the questions we are asking, are the problem, if you see a guy surviving a fall from 5 stories building, and he is a one in a million guy who survive such fall, and then after it happens you&#39;re like, WAIT, how did that happen?? Knee caps can&#39;t stand that force, and then dismantle every video about it into saying it can&#39;t possibly be truth, and you know no one can&#39;t prove you wrong, cause who is gonna jump 5 stories just to prove you wrong? Right? Who is gonna redo the towers or crash a plane on the pentagon without the upgrades that have come from last decade, its impossible, and its so easy to question everything that isn&#39;t self explanatory, but no matter what answer you get, you&#39;ll just brush it off and say, its not, cause you want to believe that you are part of something unique, in on the secret, the few ones who really know what happen that day. And that&#39;s an issue within yourself. But eh, im not even sure why im looking at this sub, i prob shouldn&#39;t cause it makes me sad to read people so out of touch with reality, pure skepticism and full on paranoid minds, with a little touch of wanting to be smarter than everyone else. Just trying so hard and the problem is that, 1 time they get it right, and it validates all the other million bad conspiracies that hurt real people and when they are proven wrong, they just pretend like they never supported said conspiracy, but oh give them 1 right, all their unproven conspiracies are  facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you that too many people have predetermined &quot;truths&quot; when approaching 9/11 there are still tons of odd circumstances around it that (I believe) are so unlikely without foreknowledge that it exceeds the natural incredulity of something like your example: &quot;surviving a free fall from an airplane&quot; into &quot;surviving a free fall because it just so happened there was a mile wide pile of marshmallows where you landed&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s well known that there were [multiple simulations happening]( <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2006/08/norad200608/amp">www.vanityfair.com/news/2006/08/norad200608/amp</a>) involving fake radar blips for simulated rogue planes that morning and throughout the attacks. Additionally several other practice missions for the airforce ultimately meant <a href="https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2012/08/31/in-the-heart-of-darkness-of-911/">no jets could be scrambled for the entirety of the 3 attacks</a>. It was only until after the Pentagon was hit that NORAD finally shut down every training radar blip being piped into all of the ground controller&#39;s radar.</p>

<p>Why did Silverstein buy the WTC at a huge loss when it needed almost a billion dollar asbestos removal project? It just happened that he didn&#39;t come to work that day and neither did his daughter (if I remember correctly). This is very similar to how the ATF office was <strong>completely empty</strong> at the time of the OKC bombing.</p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s always uncertainty in circumstantial evidence and to me all of the frame by frame &quot;that can&#39;t happen&quot; WTC analysis is simply people thinking they know far more than they do much like all those flat earth &quot;proofs&quot;. </p>

<p>I also agree we really have no way of ever solidly understanding the mechanical process of collapse because of how unique the circumstances were, I&#39;m not satisfied with balsa wood recreations proving it was a controlled demolition and conversely I&#39;m not convinced the terrorists did 9\11 by themselves because a guy bent a heated steel beam on youtube. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really focus on how they came down because it&#39;s essentially futile, even engineers working years constructing a model still only have a big ole&#39; system of differential equations and nothing more. To me the only reasonable evidence we have is that the circumstances of the day it happened were so serendipitous for the attackers it approaches absurdity. </p>

<p>Again no proof, just heavy circumstantial weirdness suggesting <em>someone</em> on the inside knew something involving a plane hijacking was going to occur. </p>

<p>Not to beat a dead horse but we should never forget the Council on Foreign Relations and what they had to say about the necessary conditions to start this series of regime changes in the middle east:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Further, the process of transformation (<em>comment: meaning the Balkanization of the middle East</em>), even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem of analizing a single day in history and trying to find how much the odds are of what happend that day, is by not analazing that day only, but history as a whole, while you might see everything after 9/11 as , wow that would never happen together at the same time, what are the odds, first of all, it wasn&#39;t just some junkies randomly stealing a plane and deciding to crash it at the towers, it was a long plan, where sure, some people knew of it, ofcourse, there were people who had to know, but why don&#39;t you see how often were sumilated missions done? Was it a known thing that simulated missions were going to be done? I mean, they had to select the day in particular, with particular circumstances that allowed them to fly undetected for as long as they did until they crashed, they needed chaos, and they found a loophole on the air traffic system, in which, it was certain times were it oversaturated with missions simulations and stuff, the problem with people is that they see &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; and they say OH A HAPPEN CAUSE OF C, when they forget that C happen because of A, or that A happen cause of B, which no one even knows what B is, and b was affected by C but not entirely....</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you a random personal story without much details just to make a point, my dad was arrested falsely for fraud because he pissed off the wrong corrupt people and they pulled strings, our neighbor was the mayor of our city, and our friend, we had no money, no idea of what to do, except call our neighbor, the mayor, he was in an accident and was suppose to be on a plane to a different place in the country and was not going to be able to be in contact until next week, but luckily he got into an accident, the plane was delayed literally few minutes, and he miracluesly answer my mom&#39;s call, she told him what happen and he told his personal lawyer to stay behind and help us, 2 days later dad was back on and we were sue&#39;ing the city and the officials that falsely arrested him, but not before being blackmailed/and life threatened while my dad was in jail, bad people were exthorting people inside it and had it not been because the neighbors lawyer told us what to do, we would have lost everything to try get our dad back safely, and who knows what would of happen, but it didn&#39;t because some randomy thing happen and we were lucky that we catch neighbor literally minutes before he got on a plane. So if you look back to that day, you&#39;re like, Wait what? so he happens to get into an accident and then plane gets delayed just enough to get your call? that&#39;s shady, and if i break out the day, there is a million little things that add up making it a surreal day, but it happen, it wasn&#39;t prescripted, it was a random day on a very very normal family that just got into a random issue that we never expected.</p>

<p>My point is that, why do you have to see things as being s causation when they might of been motive? How much pattern have you studied pre-9/11? You refuse to believe the most believable story because, you already put too much effort into finding alternatiive possibilities? , cause its not fun to being proven wrong? </p>

<p>You see silverstain buying WTC at huge loss as shady, but he bought world trade center 7 back in 1980? and he wanted buy the whole complex back then, just it wasn&#39;t for sale until 2000.... So he been planning this attack for 30 years? LOL or what? just for insurance fraud? Dayum, what a scam...  I mean most of your shady things, are basically seeing things from 1 point of view, without seeing well... the WTC were put for sale on 2000... so it took 1 year to finish the sale to silverstain, instead of saying holy shit that is some bad luck , now he is somehow complicit, again, how many times did silverstain and daugher went to the WTC, do you have a check in where it shows, how they went every day before and the day the attack , they dont? cause without that proof is like saying, You &quot;Trumpetspieler&quot; were not at the towers when they were hit, coincidence? I THINK NOT, you know beforehand what was gonna happen, TRAITOR; BURN WITCH.</p>

<p>The problem with late conspiracy theories is that, you find a weak spot, you attack it, and then you&#39;re done, when you should see, wait, why was this spot weak?  IF you really care about the truth, then try find it sure, but if you are satisfied by half assing and just making random questions that are hard enough to answer but not good enough to actual hold up then, you are just trying to be hipster, pretend to know more, or be more smart than others, when you don&#39;t really care for the truth. just to win the arguement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sorry if i offended you, i wasn&#39;t specifically talking to you, was just making a generalization of all of it. With a few personal examples, anyway, I meant later as in lately, sorry. Sure there always been random theories, but lately, there are some heavy theories heavily supported with 0 evidence and people just go with it, and go &quot;redpilling&quot; people with by giving questions they can&#39;t answer and forcing people on a suggestive state.</p>

<p>Again, i wasn&#39;t trying to be harmful to you, just on the whole idea of people making questions that, sure maybe can&#39;t be answered easily, but that maybe are not worth being a question to begin with, not everything is a conspiracy, but surely, there are real conspiracys around, so thats why its annoying that people just put them all together, 1 people just think conspiracy theorists are nutjobs nowdays, and conspiracy theoriest feel like, the world is all a conspiracy, But was talking in general as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah it&#39;s all good, I&#39;m just happy we managed to break through the usual internet argument trench and have a normal conversation.</p>

<p>I do completely understand what you mean about giving events significance after the fact (that Damn strobe light on the Mandalay is a good example, the audio professionals analysing the audio, on and on...) and how literally everything can be NWO staged these days, I liked the anecdote.</p>

<p>Also I have no problem admitting it was half assed as a paper written to show someone the odd events on 9/11 but the forum we&#39;re in kinda prevents that in most cases.  Of the two links I put up there I&#39;d say the first is rock solid as far as reporting goes so if it was poor planning or even negligence it is a pretty disturbing thing to listen to the people (they have the tapes of the radar operators) frantically trying to figure out which of the 4 or 5 suspicous aircraft on their screen is real, it&#39;s a wild perspective of 9/11 that isn&#39;t very well known compared to some of the really wacko shit out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah, i think there was a lot of poor planning and even negligence which is why things changed drastically after 9/11, TSA and aircraft security went skyrocket, and sadly, every tragedy or terrorism, happens when someone exploits a weak link, like in niece paris where a truck ran over a bunch of people, you think that will happen again? Nope, same with a bunch of other things that have happen, both domestic and international, i do not belive the plane attacks were staged or even an inside job, i think, it was very possibly just terrorism, it feels like even the fact that USA invaded iraq with the excuse of the terror attack, feels just too unrealistic, basically just because, if they had the audacity, intelligence and the means to do such a high quality job, collapsing the towers, and all the coverups that come with it, how did they not manage to fabricate a simple sheer of nuclear evidence on iraq to justify the war there? LIke if they had found a nuclear warhead there, suddendly, the war would be justfiied and GG, bush be a hero not a war criminal as much ppl claim he is, Now did USA make mistakes oversea that eventually led to terrorism, yes for sure, lots of mistakes everywhere from almost every country, humans are flawed, but i feel like, this huge event, was just a terror attack that was just too hard to explain for the sheer work it took to accomplish, it feels unreal, and the amount of people that were damaged, its hard to say, oh well it was just a terror attack, you look at the other people who didnt stop it in time, and think, they obviously did something wrong, but when something like this happens, sadly, normally is a new different way each time, sometimes a bomb, a shooting, a suicide vest, a vehicle, sadly sometimes you just can&#39;t do anything, and the only way to stop terrorism is to give up your privacy, but people can&#39;t deal with that anymore, facebook and amazon and so many ppl in troubles for data collecting, obama for agreeing to surveillance , when honestly, how can you prevent terrorism where you don&#39;t even know how it will strike next? With people, and you can&#39;t just select, oh, this person looks like a terrorist, you gotta check all, or none and be okay with the domestic and or international terror attacks.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry again if i offended you, and im all in for stuff not being what it is, but this, i feel like, there is too much material proving it is what the history says it was, and it feels like occam&#39;s razors, there isn&#39;t a need for such a deep explication when there are several ways to have achieve the same stuff without making it seem like a terror attack, and hell not even needed to be on the US</p>

<p>Several days later I went back to show a friend and it was gone. In its place was a crappy doctored version showing a glob meant to look like a plane. Early video editing sucked. I&#39;ll never forget.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You <strong>can</strong> see the footage of the Pentagon being hit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwzT0QnwtTE">It&#39;s called the parking lot footage</a> and it was leaked in 2002. It&#39;s been available for years. The only tapes that were confiscated by the FBI , from Citgo gas station and Doubletree hotel, were released years ago.</p>

<p>For a detailed explanation, read below:</p>

<p><strong>There is no proof that more than three tapes around the Pentagon&#39;s vicinity were seized by the FBI.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is no proof that other tapes apart from the parking lot footage depict a Boeing 757 impact.</strong></p>

<p>The rest of the claimed &quot;85 confiscated videotapes&quot; were <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php?title=FBI_hides_84_Pentagon_videos#The_videos_in_detail"><em>voluntarily sent in</em></a> from private individuals to the FBI&#39;s field offices, and are privately held footage. Thus, in order to release them publicly, permission would need to be secured from the individual who owns that footage. The majority of the tapes sent in have no relation to the Pentagon crash at all. </p>

<p>Neither the DoD nor the FBI ever claimed to have eighty-five tapes depicting a Boeing 757 crash into the Pentagon, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re referring to. </p>

<p>A 2004 FOIA request asked for footage depicting the crash of Flight 77. The agent who <a href="https://heavywatergate.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/macguiredeclarationseptember2005_fbi.pdf">replied</a> to the FOIA request determined that the FBI &quot;was in possession of eighty-five videotapes <strong>related</strong> to 9/11&quot;. It then went on to categorize what was contained on 29 of the tapes she reviewed personally. (The other 56 cropped up in an initial database search and didn&#39;t even show the Pentagon building). </p>

<p>16 of those 29 tapes showed the Pentagon, but <strong>&quot;did not show the Pentagon crash site nor the impact into the Pentagon.&quot;</strong> Of the remaining 13 videos, 12 showed the Pentagon only <em>after</em> the impact. That leaves just one tape: the parking lot footage. Which was released. 14 years ago. 
The other videos weren&#39;t released, because <strong>those did not fulfill the claimant&#39;s request.</strong> The person asked for footage of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, and the <strong>closest tapes to that request</strong> that the agent could find were the Doubletree and Citgo tapes (i.e. it captured when the impact happened, but not directly).</p>

<p>In other words, the agent was simply itemizing the tapes she thought the FBI had, and excluded the ones which weren&#39;t relevant to the person&#39;s request. </p>

<p>Somehow, no-planers read the quotation above, and got the idea that the FBI confiscated 85 tapes that showed clear footage of the impact. This is how the &quot;confiscated tapes&quot; claim got started: from a misreading of a reply to a FOIA request.</p>

<p>In complying with the FOIA request, the FBI released the relevant footage it had. This is how we got the Doubletree and Citgo videos. Up until 2006 we only had the five-frame Pentagon video (which is the only tape the Pentagon has which clearly depicts the crash).</p>

<p><strong>The seized footage has been publicly released and is available on YouTube.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>1: Several reason:</p>

<p>Watching something hit something else gives you tons of information on the structure of both targets. The pentagon obviously has a classified structure, to make it harder to attack. They don&#39;t want to release this footage because.</p>

<p>I think that there probably aren&#39;t many security cameras pointed at the sky. Given one camera in a parking lot pointed at the building, and the easily obtainable speed of 500 mph, a 20 frame per second camera might not even see the plane before it hit. An object at 500 mph takes .13 seconds to travel 100 feet.</p>

<p>2: Because it sustained a large ammount of structual damage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why can&#39;t we see footage of the attack on the Pentagon?</p>

<p>Answer
Because no plane hit the building.</p>

<p>The answers are right in your face...
No plane hit the Pentagon...
No plane went down in Shanksville</p>

<p>And WTC7 was a pre planned implosion.</p>

<p>Look at the so called crash site in PA...
There is not one piece of metal in that hole.
WTC7
Just miraculously fell with only office fires bringing it down.
A third grader could understand a building wouldn&#39;t free fall due to office furniture on fire.</p>

<p>The people trying to convince you building 7 fell without the help of explosives are the same people who want you to believe a man in a cave brought the US to its knees ..when No one could find him CNN waltzed in their and interviewed him with no problem.
It still dumbfounds me to this day people are still ignorant to the fact 911 was planned by the US and Israeli government</p>

It’s woefully naive to believe that the positive benefits of appeasing that minority outweigh the negatives.

    <div class="md"><p>You are cherry picking.  I never said what you are claiming I said.  I said fire + earthquakes could have brought the building down.  Specifically, the building was on fire, then it was at the epicenter of a magnitude 2 surface level earthquake.  Then it continued to burn, then it was at the epicenter of ANOTHER magnitude 2 earthquake, and then it continued to burn for 8 more hours.  Then if finally collapsed.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this, how many times has a building already on fire been at the epicenter of 2 earthquakes, then continued to burn, but did not collapse?  Has that ever happened?  </p>

<p>Not a building that was on fire started by the earthquake, but the building had to be on fire first already, and then randomly and totally by coincidence endured two earthquakes centered 60 ft away?  What are the survival statistics for this kind of building?</p>

<p>The Parthenon survived 2000 years through earthquakes and multiple explosions, but is now being completely destroyed by <em>rain</em> that happens to be a bit more acidic than usual.</p>

<p>Catastrophic failure is the result of multiple marginal failures in a cascade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it was flying really low and knocked down many poles. It was in broad view of everyone driving to/from the Pentagon so there are vast witnesses. I&#39;m also pretty sure someone would say something if they were pre knocking the poles by a main road. I&#39;m on board with a false flag but I don&#39;t believe the no planes story. Likewise I have friends in New York who saw the second plane quite clearly as they were looking at the first plane incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes a paper passport <em>soaked in jet fuel</em> is likely to survive a massive fireball impact, while the black boxes specifically designed to withstand plane crashes wouldnt.</p>

<p>Makes sense. About as much sense as an aluminum airplane punching through a building that was designed to survive a jet airliner that size impacting it.</p>

<p>As much sense as it not only slicing through the outer steel superstructure, but also the massive core columns that most people forgot existed, which would have remained standing if the outer building partially collapsed...</p>

<p>The fact that three steel buildings fell within hours of being hit, directly down into their own basements.</p>

<p>The nanothermite residue. The fact that wtc7 didnt even get hit, yet fell into its own basement from &quot;office fires&quot;. The fact that the NIST models are garbage. Even though they dido say most of the fuel on the planes was <em>instantly</em> consumed, meaning the fire weakened the beams is bullshit.</p>

<p>But anyone with basic metallurgical or structural engineering knowledge knows the official story is a lie. </p>

They could barely piece together papers from the destroyed buildings but you think 3 out 4 of the passports survived intact? Like they just flew out of the vest jackets of the &quot;hijackers&quot; and went blowing out a window safely landing to the ground with nary a scratch to be found in short order?</p>

<p>Do you have evidence that debris was planted? No? Then you are just ignoring actual evidence in favor of your fantasy.</p>

<p>The pentagon was easier.</p>

<p>And as for why? Only takes someone high up saying the heart of the military was hit, footage could show the US to be weak and maybe lead to other attempts if it was that easy. Also for the investigation.</p>

<p>Only really takes one paranoid person in a highish position. </p>

<p>But in the end footage doesnt matter. Hundreds of eye witnesses seen a plane, and there were parts of the plane in photos all over the place, lawn and found in building.</p>

<p>People will just deny that exists and aay because footage wasnt released it didnt happen which means nothing, because even if that footage was out theyd be arguing it was doctored, fake or a missle shaped like a plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one in NYC is the least ridiculous.  Watch the impact footage, especially of the second plane (because by then the cameras are fixed and focused on the towers and the shots are clear).</p>

<p>When the second plane hits, you see debris <strong>exit the other side of the building</strong>.  The passports were found blocks away.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible (though I&#39;m not convinced) that on impact the windows of the cockpit were blown out and the clothing of the people in the cockpit who were not wearing belts were flung forward through the building at 200+ miles an hour and were ejected out the side, escaping the fire.</p>

<p>See that&#39;s the problem. You wanted evidence, you were given it but you are ignoring it because &quot;it&#39;s not the expected evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>Well first of all there is the physical evidence of AA77 hitting the Pentagon. There is also the fact that AA77 and all it&#39;s passengers are missing but their remains were found at the Pentagon so...</p>

<p>but there is no debris to make a claim about without your original extraordinary claim that such debris came from that passenger plane..</p>

<p>You seem to have some problems with your logic.</p>

<p>Lets start again.</p>

<p>Debris that clearly resembles parts from an AA passenger jetliner were found all around the point of impact. You don&#39;t dispute this right?</p>

<p>It is your claim, that this debris did not come from an AA airliner. You need to offer proof of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I told you something recognizable from that plane would do</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you didn&#39;t. You told me what you think the plane should do but what your knowledge is based on, I don&#39;t know. So far you have shown that you believe in &quot;cartoon&quot; physics where the plane should have stripped off its wings and tail intact when it hit the building or it should have flattened against it like a can getting smashed. Both of those are wrong.</p>
