       I hate hilary clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to get that out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       She's terrible and a god awful person.  And recently a rumour has been going around about her and huma slicing off a prepubescent girls face and wearing it during part of an adenochrome harvesting  satanic ritual. It sounds chilling.  So of course I looked into since yeaterday.  What follows is the result of about 4 or 5 hours of reaearch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was able to trace this back to what I believe is the original article.  It's this yournewswire article here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://archive.is/oddP1">
        http://archive.is/oddP1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The articles writer, Baxter Dmitry states that some video codenamed frazzledrip was circulating on the internet and goes on to give examples, but it only took me a few mins to find past articles from dmitry, and honestly,  his track record isn't so great much like his employer, yournewswire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I was finally able to track some of the pictures to a video posted on April fools day.  Some are saying that this video is just a teaser, but others are saying it's the whole thing.    Here is the video in question:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WAHBkEqdvXo">
        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WAHBkEqdvXo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, at 1:23 in the video, that image is the one that everyone says is huma wearing a child's face as a mask.  To me it obviously looks like a mask that someone would wear to a masquerade ball or something like that, but I could be wrong.  After all, everyone is freaking the hell out about this image, and honestly I could see how it looks like her.  Too bad it's bullshit.  See, I traced that image to a restaurant in Washington DC called the hush supper club.  I. Fact, it's the second image down on their website here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.hushsupperclub.com">
        http://www.hushsupperclub.com
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That definitely the same image, NOT huma abedin and certainly not a childs face for a mask!
      </p>
      <p>
       So in conclusion, it's bullshit.  Don't believe anything that is too sensational to be rel, and don't believe anything just because it fits your own worldview.  Don't let fake news do your thinking for you.  And keep up the good fight.  Fuck the elites and fuck their plan dmfor one world govt.

       Yes, StoneyStone and screen caps of his stream were the earliest sources when I looked into this a few days ago.  Not sure why you're in the negatives for pointing that out.

       I can't say definitively that there is no fire behind the smoke and rumors, but everything related to it that I've seen so far has been BS.

       Im guessing its the YNW being a whipping boy comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Snopes is using it as the source coupled with the fact we can argue that its not the source with verifiable evidence, proves the whipping boy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe some people think I'm trying to legitimise YNW, I'm not.

       I dont. It's Schrödinger's video at the moment. Seems odd to downvote someone for neither pushing, nor debunking the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way i see it, if a video
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       come out, we should be going through it with a fine tooth comb before reaching any conclusions as to who it is. Due process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although given the supposed content I'm not sure how that would work, I certainly have no interest in verifying that kinda crap and I'm sure most think like me in that respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only came here to point out that YNW wasnt the source and that the screenshots we've seen so far, were actually from someone's instagram.

       any reasonably intelligent person can tell that this person clearly has an agenda. his heavily biased &amp; second-hand opinion is presented as fact. when people are trying to enlighten people and spread truth, they do not do so in such inarticulate and aggressive fashion.

       The screenshot is from Sasha Lord's Instagram page. She's a local DC concert promoter. It's a picture of a projection on the wall from a Baby Alcatraz set in 2014 at Comet Pizza. I'd link you to her Instagram account but your fellow travelers harassed her into setting it to private already.

       apparently his name is supposed to be like a Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort type deal where it means “j’aime les enfants”, and it’s to cover up the fact that he’s secretly a Rothschild.
      </p>
      <p>
       it almost makes sense as long as you don’t get bogged down by the fact that “J’aime les enfants” and “James Alefantis” aren’t anagrams and there’s no actual proof

       Yeah, it creeps me out cause it's a black and white security camera still, (supposedly) of 2 very controversial public figures inside the back room of a pizza place that has been shrouded in conspiracy for over a year. Anons have compared the purse in the shot to one that Huma wears, and quite frankly it just creeps me out. If it's them, WTF were they doing there? I'm hoping this was just some weird act where two people dressed up as Hillary &amp; Huma for some fucked up skit, because it really looks like them laying there.
      </p>

       Why are you going around asking people why this creeps them out? Why do you feel the need to defend this certainly creepy picture?

       Because it's an image of two people lying on a ping pong table. I truly can't fathom what's so creepy about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a picture of Hilary and Huma (it was lifted from an instagram account and tagged with something band related like '#stilltourtired' - see one of the links in these comments). And
       <em>
        even if it were
       </em>
       a photo of those two, what would be 'creepy' about them lying on a table in an establishment owned by someone familiar to them? Wouldn't it just be really weird?

       I guess it's just that Hillary is so meticulous about how the public views her, everything she does is seemingly very scripted and rehearsed so that it goes well. If this is her, seeing her laying down is very out of her public character image and it feels like something we are not meant to see. And it's just extra strange that it's at Comet, of all damn places for her to lay down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if there was a leak of a black and white security photo of Trump lying on a dirty Russian hotel bed. Or maybe lying on a hotel bar, because the bed makes it creepy for a different reason. People would find it coincidentally creepy. The conjecture about the conspiracy around the location is what makes it really creepy to me.

       The screenshot is from Sasha Lord's Instagram page. She's a local DC concert promoter. It's a picture of a projection on the wall from a Baby Alcatraz set in 2014 at Comet Pizza. I'd link you to her Instagram account but your fellow travelers harassed her into setting it to private already.

       Heh...Baby Alcatraz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alcatraz is a notorious prison where Al Capone was held. So a band with name "Baby Alcatraz" isn't too difficult of a metaphor to decipher. It makes the subliminal connection to the rest of Sasha's curating quite obvious.

      <p>
       Sasha curates this stuff on purpose for whatever reason we can only guess. It's not that edgy or interesting, it's not punk, the music sucks from what I've heard, it doesn't remind me of the weird visual stuff on MTV either, it's more like curating mental illness, homosexuality and chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are like the most obscure crappy bands you could possibly find, and for an upscale audience in DC no less. It doesn't make a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself, what is family-friendly about Baby Prison and Sex Stains? Or Heavy Breathing (Amanda Kleinman)? Or the art on the walls and the photos on jimmycomet's Instagram? Have you even seen Heavy Breathing's website? It's riddled with disturbing homosexual artworks that look like the scribbling of an 8 year old child who might have been sexually abused. Any parent with his/her head on straight would say this stuff is inappropriate and borderline cultish. Other parents are too ignorant to think their children will know what the adult stuff even means, but those children will figure it out through the grapevine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention Edgar Welch, the guy who went to Comet with a gun and fired just ONE bullet, directly into a hidden computer they had there. Edgar had previously struck a child in a hit and run accident. It seems he might have been put up to the gig via the "disenfranchised plea deal" route some certain three letter agency loves to employ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the story about the previous owner and chef of both Comet and Bucks, Carole Greenwood. Rumor has it her son was sexually assaulted in the Comet kitchen, and she quit working there because of it. Someone even did an AMA on Reddit about this or a similar experience, providing email evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is awry with Comet, so for me at least, the case isn't closed.

       this is what people all across the net (YT, Twitter, Darknet, etc) are discussing. Personally, I entertain the idea because of the Clinton Death list, the $60,000 in "hot dogs" sent to Obama in Hawaii, Pedo Slang used in Hillary Emails, the women who stepped forward about Bill Clinton Raping them and his half black illegitimate son he had with a prostitute, Hillary referring to sacrifices to Moloch in a leaked e-mail, and on and on and on

       Whether 65k was flown in specific to the event in the email, it seems as if the channel exists.

       So my question remains unanswered.

       So, why exactly is this evidence enough for you to state as a fact that this actually happened?

       That picture is from sasha lords instagram.  She's an entertainer and has worked with comet ping pong.  Also, if that were hilary, she's lookin awful find  for someone's granny.  But anyway, there is nothing to state that definitely IS hilary and huma.  I guess whoever started this rumour didn't think anyone e could access the archives on 4chan like so:

       I never said they were. I said that this is all being discussed on the webz as being them and that I did not know. What is there to retract if I never stated any facts?

       Protip:  If you are going to make a hoax video, try not to use every single effect in Adobe Premiere.  To wit:
      </p>
      <p>
       The jittery thin white vertical lines at the start of the video:  These lines are an artifact of low quality 8 or 16mm film.  In other words,
       <strong>
        no modern device will ever product these lines
       </strong>
       .  So unless you are claiming you hoax is a student film from 1974, don't use this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scanlines: No, just no.  No video recording medium produced the scan line effect, in which parallel horizontal lines of hte video are of different brightness.  This is a crude effect intended to emulate the
       <em>
        visual appearance
       </em>
       of actually watching a CRT monitor or television.  But the video on CRTs was either on tape or film and exhibits no scanlines (look at news footage from the 80's for example).  Don't use scanline effect unless you are faking a recording of a Ploybius cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Poor Tracking
       </strong>
       - an artifact of watching a videotape playback.  The tracking problem is not on the tape itself, it would only show up when you played a tape, and it would (a) be different every time, and (b) not always be a problem on every VCR.  Don't use this unless you are New Retro Wave.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Vertical hold and Tube distortion
       </strong>
       These are artifacts of watching a TV screen.  again, the raw image would not include these.  And you certainly would never have v-hold scanlines and video compression artifacts at the same time.  Analog video was not compressed, and therefore didn't have glitches or compression artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sepia tone - just fucking stop already.  Images recorded with videotape don't yellow with age.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to fake a video, hit me up and I will straighten you out.

       Be careful , you don’t want to upset people who are too diluted to accept anything other than what they have been brainwashed to believe. Some people’s minds are only equipped to deal with sensationalized garbage and there own feelings , facts and proof are no longer accepted , as feelings are now mistaken for argument points . Pizza gate is fake as fuck ,  pedophila is real , and people will try to use people’s feelings to push an agenda . Also pizza gate was monetized and anytime anything involving truth has A price tag you better believe you are being sold something ( bullshit clickbait ).

       This is the same type BS as that other video where it has some kid screaming. You can't see anything in it but supposedly, it is Podesta torturing some kid. How do people believe stuff like that? Absolutely 0 proof but it is real to them

       This is worse than that.  With the fatherhood video at least there's an actual video to hang the BS on, even if it predated the 2016 elections and any tie to Podesta.  With this, the image of the hush supper club demonstrates that this is 100% hoax.  The teaser looked like a junior high schooler's art project.

       Either way that video is one of the most disturbing things I have ever seen on the internet. Podesta or not, it's fake that kid is one hell of an actor. I really think it's a kid going through something horrific. Hopefully not.

       No, this isn't "the same type of BS" because there is an actual video that can potentially be evidence. There is another video comparing his actual voice to the one in the video, and they sound pretty darn the same. Podesta has mentioned in an article that he has an evil alter ego... However, we cannot make conclusions because we don't actually see Podesta in the video -- but at the same time, you shouldn't stop considering that video.

       So I just have to say cuz this cuz it seems way too obvious to me. There probably exists a video but its not gonna be under that name. No, see that's what we call a honey pot.
      </p>
      <p>
       You remember when that "alien selfy" shut down 4chan in like 2 seconds and scrubbed archives and even fucked up some harddrives iirc. So the military has tech that can literally crawl or scrub the entire net in an instant and if something certain pops up that they know can't be seen its Insta nuked. I think this is happening with this actual video(which does exist), and this Fragglerock is the honey pot/ magnet that pulls in those that know of the tapes existance. Just wait for it to be on the regular web just censored. Cuz horrible violence is chill just don't swear or show your jennies.

       I spent a long time in discord groups solely for researching the alien selfie phenomena right after it popped up and nobody ever found any proof whatsoever of it to be true. All the alleged photos were fakes and the people who claimed to have seen it were trolls. 4chan goes down sometimes and there's always a group of pranksters who try and make people believe its because someone on /pol/ or /x/ posted a government secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem here is that you're assuming the video exists with no evidence whatsoever and in response to the lack of evidence you stretch even further by claiming there's unknown technology that's able to instantly wipe video off the internet and destroy the computers of people who downloaded it. Maybe, just maybe the video doesn't exist and is yet another hoax from a website that only produces fake news.

       Well you see the whole alien selfy was the cover. The real thing that shut down 4chan that day were the coordinates to area 51 where you could see the planes they said were used on 9/11.

       Well I don't know anything about the whole chan alien thing but it could be the case that the current google earth image is scrubbed and that someone found an unscrubbed image, or maybe  google uploaded the unaltered version without noticing back then . Long shots, but a current picture provided and altered by  google isn't any proof imo.

       For Christ’s sake, do you really think it’s more likely that there’s some kind of crazy alien conspiracy and the government is keeping it under wraps than that Area 51 is just a research facility testing planes and shit? Life is not a movie.

       Not at all, I was just pointing out that current images created by google or w.e aren't good evidence in the eyes of  the ayylmao researchers. I try to think the way the people believing jn this kind of stuff do, because those people only accept arguments if you structure them a certain way.

       Area51 is something I don't know much about, but it's probably just an army base where maybe some tests where done with experimental aircraft and the like imo.

       I wouldn't know. I also wouldn't assume it doesn't exist like you have, based off the findings of a snopes article. This whole Hilary and huma video has been talked about since Nov 2016. Its now gaining traction cuz people in the Qanon groups believe it will soon surface. Never said it was real, just stating your points on why it must be fake, are easily refuted.

       Great research, its honestly fascinating to see how these stories with no basis in reality get spread around like wildfire and believed by so many people. They've been pushing the envelope for a while now with what they can get away with but this Frazzledrip garbage reaches a new height. We've gone from misrepresentations of a candidate's stance on an issue to claiming there's video of them raping and mutilating children with absolutely nothing to back these claims up. Thankfully it already died out and it looks like not too many people were fooled but it was very disheartening scrolling through Twitter and seeing how many people out there genuinely believed it to be true.

       I blame old people going on 4chan. Does anyone remember The Grifter? This is like that meme, but for an older, tech-illiterate audience that hasn't seen it before, with HRC thrown in for good measure.

       I do think this is the internet arm of a propaganda machine, though. There's been too much push of this, and too many fake things made to try and fool people into believing it. Shouts out to Brad Parscale.

       Nothing to back it up? The Hillary investigation was reopened because of her emails that were found on Anthony Weiners computer, this is a FACT, Comey even stated this when he went on Colbert this week. The NYPD officers investigating the laptop said what they found made them sick to their stomachs, that’s saying a lot because NYPD has seen some shit.

       Wasn't this another "Q" psyop prediction? He also frequently says that the elites are going to be arrested very soon and that Trump is leading an onslaught against "deep state pedos".

      <p>
       Pizzagate was absolutely real, but I feel like the inteligence agencies who monitor discussion forums and push the "Q" shit are using Q as a way to delegitimize the investigation with false predictions and filling people with false hope.

       No idea if Q "predicted" this, you can predict a lot when you use vague platitudes and have a large following of diehard believers. I remember a while back when Marines were supposedly storming the CIA headquarters, there was no proof at all of this occurring but you had all of these Q-drones going on and on about it. They live in their own version of reality, its actually kind of sad.

       Thanks!!  Although some people ITT are holding on to hope/belief that either the video does exist  (even tho the video presented has been proven a fake) or that I have debunked nothing at all despite the evidence of their eyes.  Some people just want it to be true so badly that nothing will Convince them it's not.  Which really says something about people's character.  They want so badly for hilary and huma to have tortured a pre pubescent girl that they will believe they did, while being videotaped, no matter what instead of just being glad no children were hurt just for a spoooOOOOOOoooky video on the internet.

       Can you blame them though? She became the official Boogeyman of politics basically since she became the SEC of State. I agree she's probably seedy and corrupt, but for the majority of my adult life she's been under one investigation or another, and none of them ever produce anything. But it allows her political opponents to say "look at all the investigations"

       There will still be people who will argue about it. I say we go a step further in debunking it just to put the final nail in the coffin for this bullshit theory. First, we need to prove that this is
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       video. Second, we need to prove that the website OP cites added this picture before anything on this video hit the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they are going to say is one of two things: Either a disinfo agent made this video and the real one was scrubbed, knowing that this random website used the image so they can point to that as "proof" it's debunked, or this random website is owned by disinfo agents and they put the image on their site, again as "proof" that the image is fake.

       It very well could be a psyop, a larp. It could be real, fed through a dodgy source to discredit it. I happen to think it's real, but being released by the derp state** to deliberately make the US look like monsters to the rest of the world and justify a nuclear strike by Russia.

       I don't necessarily believe in the Mandela Effect. I was interested in reading about it though, especially a few years ago when it was discussed a lot. But none of the examples did anything for me, so I never paid attention. But I saw Hilary going to Hillary with my own damn eyes. There was a thread in the r/MandelaEffect last year saying how Hillary had changed to Hilary. So, out of curiosity, I googled Hilary Clinton and literally ALL results had Hilary(with one L). I looked in wiki, articles, newspapers e.t.c Then a month later, another thread pops up saying it went back to 'Hillary' with two Ls. So I google her name again and to my shock, every single piece of article, newspaper, wiki e.t.c had her name with two Ls. It was the first time I thought that there might be something to the ME. I still doubt it's real but I saw this case with my two eyes.

       It’s real. I’ve seen quite a few changes. Fruit loops to froot loops really spun me as it was one I was keeping an eye on. I googled it one morning and just stared at the screen blank.

       Ribbon seals 
Great Wall of India 
Rainbow trees
Rainbow mountains (not before 2016 as I’m aware they’ve been all over social media since) 
Saiga antelope (some have heard of this one)
Commorson dolphins

       None of those you will have likely have heard of. It’s all pointing to the fact we live in the matrix. It’s completely changed my view on the world

       The closest one for me is Interview with A Vampire now being Interview with THE Vampire. It was one of my favorite movies growing up and I specifically remember it being 'with A'. Even the Greek translation of the movie's title has an 'A' instead of 'THE'.

       Yeah, Oni outted himself pretty obviously with this piece.  Notice his rallying against the "impending one world government/NWO", this is a dead giveaway and a deliberate attempt to cover up unum sanctum, the cest'ue que vie accounts, and the one world government that already owns the Vatican, DC, and London.

If a video was circulating of a presidential candidate cutting off a girl's face and wearing it, you wouldn't be reading "multiple sources" from the dark net talking about it. It'd just be released. No one in their right mind would sit on information like that.

       Stuff like this hurts any other conspiracy related to Hillary, because at some point you're just going to lose people to the ridiculousness of the story.

       A Russian site has a report with more details on this snuff video:

       Yesterday I was looking thru YouTube search and saw an image of a woman's head with the face skin filleted off, but tonight it's not there. I did not connect the horrible image with this story until today. She was stretched out on a table, her head hanging over the end, no lips, no eyelids, no nose, just raw flesh, and you could see where the cut was made just along the edge of her hairline. Could not tell the age of the girl, but was not a small child. Might have been a different victim than the one in question. They probably do this to many victims, like it's a regular thing, but seldom recorded.

       My conjecture is that the original file found on Weiner's computer was the real deal, but you can imagine a thing like that would get intense criticism as fake from every power that bees to squash it from becoming evidence. The truth/fiction answer lies in the NYPD.

       PS Looking thru the comments suggests to me there are a very large fraction of trolls on this sub, because there is a difference between a real conspiracy aficionado and a person expressing instant doubt. Real buffs, such as myself are always skeptical, but always open to possibilities. The mendacity of the elites is truly incredible, in the original sense of the word.

       Great research man you did well!

       I'm glad to see you reached the same conclusion that I did regarding your news wire. I made a thread on this website a while back. It appears to be either a money grab or a disinfo/muddy the waters type of setup. To me it seems like a money grab because that Dmitry dude never responded to any of my emails I sent him regarding sources for articles. Obvious red flag

       Great research and thank you for reminding me to be vigilant.

       Sometimes it is like a train wreck. You just can't look away.  It's amazing to watch how some people think, connecting imaginary dots with no logical link between them. It fascinates me personally.

       Hillary and "James" spent good money on a PR Firm to defend them in these topics and damnit they're getting their fucking money's worth. Just sucks for them it's so obvious with the +40 for all the employees' comments and -5 to -20 for the normal users.
