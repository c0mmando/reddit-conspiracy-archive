       The weather at this time of year is extremely strange...
Ice storms in Canada, freezing cold weather elsewhere; i guess what im hinting at is climate control.

       I agree, haarp was a big thing that they say is shutdown now but theres 30 odd other stations like it, also yeah to the holographic as they can easily fool us to think that a god is in the sky or that aliens are landing when in actual fact the aliens are coming out of the bottomless pit and are really demons

       I've read countless theories about the elites wanting to trim down the earth population. Lies and deception, they can't tell you upfront, they can't reveal it, so they could have indeed a plan to just fuck the weather system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now is it this ? This feeling most of us have that something's about to pop. I have no clue if this is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is sure, many agendas are being executed right before our eyes and I can't believe people just let this happen. On another side, I have no clue how one would go out pointing finger at the government without looking like a fool. I'm pretty sure we're just fucked at this point lol

       Man I completely agree with you. I thought I was the only one with the feeling... definitely strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the hidden agendas. Absolutely no doubt about it. Look into it people, the food is rotten, and poisonous in the USA. They are trying to reduce life spans of people. Cardi B came out and said on IG live then the video was completely removed from the internet. Not a trace. And I watched it! I managed to find 1 version, but the part about the food is muted. Very very strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Countless others things being executed under our noses (and in plain sight), just wish I knew what they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I think the reason people let this happen is because they're consumed by instant gratification and non sense distractions planned by the government, higher ups, and elitits through social media to strategically distract the masses
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately you're right, and when I start hypothesizing about anything nowadays outside of the norm, people immediately think I need a tin foil hat. Smh.

       Yeah, seems like every bit of our world has been figured out well before us. We are just as they need it. Asleep, watching t.v. countless hours, burning time with whatever our hobbies are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always said it, we are way too comfortable to even consider protesting, let alone have a great awakening of mass, as in everyone just clearly see throught their plotting suddently and feel betrayed/threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that we are having this discussion, on this forum, we are already in a database somewhere other than the one from reddit.

       They have unlimited power and money, when we think of high technologies from the military the greatest achievement was made in the 60's or even before with their B-2's. We think of them as the holy bomber and the deliver of nuclear arms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you, what ever your ideas or conceptions are, imagine what kind of weapons they have right now and how much has been hidden from the population?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully when this all ends we get a quick "How fucked you were from the start" video that explains how we ended locked inside our bodies as sentient beings, feeling useless about stuff going around, you know, all the why's and how's.

       I feel like the problem with trimming the population using weather control is that it mostly affects people in rural places. Whereas the places that need more population control are the major cities where people are highly concentrated. It seems to me that people in cities affect weather negatively more so than people out in the countryside.

       It feels different. It's warm in the Netherlands too. But the warmth doesn't seem to stick. Early in the morning it feels normal and pleasant on the skin. But breathing in there's a sharp cold to it. Looking at the temperatures, it's a huge difference between day and night.
Almost as it doesn't seem to heat up. It's feels not natural.

       If that’s what they want us to think, they’ve done a pretty good job by creating a theory in the 1800s that has stood every test done against it and then creating models over the past four decades that have shown over and over again that increased extremes (colder winters, hotter summers, more violent weather) is the inevitable result.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it could all be a long con, but if so that’s some pretty impressive made up math and science.

       Hasn't every SINGLE model they've ever created about this has been extremely inaccurate? Lol not that that makes this all a long con, but it certainly doesn't help their argument.

       This isn’t true. On average, the accepted models have been

        extremely
        <strong>
         accurate

       That paper says nothing about the accuracy of other models in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worse, its primary author has been on the payroll of oil companies for decades and it’s only pushed by sites like Watt’s which are also oil company funded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now why would an oil company have such an interest in atmospheric science?

       You know that's a legitimate claim right? I love how people use that to discredit Alex Jones, when if you look at the study he is referencing, that is
       <em>
        literally

       an accurate statement.

       Aussie here. We had 2 hail storms during the summer... 36degrees C then suddenly a storm with hail stones the size of marbles... I’ve also noticed a change in weather in one way or another after days with increased ****trails in the sky... hmmm 🤔

       The magnetic poles are shifting. For the last couple of years weve seen seasons starting a few weeks later than they used to. This means they will end a few weeks later than theyre supposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not bad in itself. The issue comes if the poles completely shift. We will have melting and refreezing and landscapes changed for the next 20k years
      </p>
      <p>
       This is kind of what happened during the flood mentioned in most religions. Egypt used to be a lush landscape with trees and shit everywhere. Now its a desert

       I think that the technology for weather control has advanced so far that they do not need HAARP arrays any more. They can hijack weather stations and airport radars and use them to control/influence the weather (or something like that, I am not pretending that I have proof for this) . They cannot make a dry day wet but they can encourage cloud formation to speed up. They can't create earthquakes but perhaps they can fuck with the atmospherice pressure in a way that influences the oceans or tides that in turn can trigger tectonic plactes to slide.
      </p>
      <p>
       My other theory is that TPTB are fucking with us, and they have zero control over the weather but are promoting the idea that they control it so they appear more powerful than they actually are. The airforce used this method to co-op the ufo sighting in the 40s and 50s by claiming that 98% of the sightings were military aircraft...there must be a name for this type of operation but it basically piggy backs on an  existing phenomena, like so called "weird" weather, and then points at a "powerful shadow government" run "conspiracy".

       I agree, haarp was a big thing that they say is shutdown now but theres 30 odd other stations like it, also yeah to the holographic as they can easily fool us to think that a god is in the sky or that aliens are landing when in actual fact the aliens are coming out of the bottomless pit and are really demons
