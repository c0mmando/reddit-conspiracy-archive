    <div class="md"><p>Jesus? Where did that come from? Anyway, yeah I remember hearing something about it a while back but they are still going on(one just happening in Hawaii recently). Just because the reports go way back doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t still a relevant mystery. Also what do you mean by &quot;The ghost of Satchmo&quot;? When I googled it all that came up was a band with that name full of a bunch of middle age geezers, so am I missing something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. A sense of humor and much knowledge. Satchmo was Louis Armstrong, one of the greatest jazz trumpet players of all time.
The Bible says Jesus will return with a trumpet sound from Heaven.

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the point was lost on you, so I will systemically lay out the argument:</p>

<p>1) The news has reported fake things</p>

<p>1.A - sam hyde</p>

<p>1.B - 4Chan</p>

<p>2) That long list shows how much ACTUAL fake news there is, and this confuses people. The Infamous 4Chan, alone, seems to confuse MSM researchers.</p>

<p>2.A - That &#39;news&#39; is a categorical term for a type of broadcast and print media that contains FALSE things and REAL things, in the way of facts about events and existence. </p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>You have to use your own sense about things. The &#39;news&#39; as a category seems like another form of programming, where the facts of life as as accurate to life as a TV drama attempts to get before pushing it out.</p>

<p>Extension to the case: That what you see on the news can be a hoax. That just because it is broadcast by LOCAL news, does not mean the genius researchers at the LOCAL news station are not idiots.</p>

<p>Likewise, the noises are those of over-laid sound bytes over video of poor weather or cloudy days.</p>

<p>The reason is to make &#39;Project Blue-Beam&#39; - a conspiracy theory term for a secret government program involving a false alien expression to the &#39;world public&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awfully strange noises. Sounds like some large metal containers grinding across concrete, but usually containers like that have wheels to prevent damage to the concrete and sparks. (I&#39;m thinking of a dumpster)</p>

<p>I researched this a while back actually, best I could find was that it&#39;s a train dragging on a track due to some locked brakes, or its a bulldozer scraping the concrete, or it&#39;s someone pulling a prank with recorded sounds on a computer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still undecided. Would have to see all the locations this has been reported to make a better case out of it.</p>

These videos are a few years old, and when i saw them at the time, i was shocked for the first 5 mins. I quickly found the exact audio samples used to create these videos. News reports, police and militairy don&#39;t know shit about it, because theres nothing to look into. Just a bunch of dickheads on theyre computer creating shitty videos. And you posted this shit....

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the deeper psi-ops that are directed at deceiving Christians.  The ultimate truth is that Jesus Christ really is God who died to shed his blood to atone for everyone&#39;s sins (if you choose to accept it).  The elite know this so this type of red herrings is to tick Christians into believing false doctrine.  In the Scriptures during the end times there are seven trumpets that will be sounded by angels:</p>

<p>Rev_8:2  And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.
Rev_8:6  And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ&#39;s return to physically rule on Earth for 1000 years is after these trumpets sound and all the events of the Jacob&#39;s trouble (commonly called &quot;the great tribulation&quot;) happen.</p>

<p>They are counting on Christians not reading the King James Bible and just believing whatever Jesuit/Mason plant that runs their &quot;Church building&quot; tells them.</p>

<p>Here is the deal, the Antichrist is going to come onto the world stage sometime in the future and he will appear to be like Jesus Christ.  He will have great power and lying wonders.  He will run the entire one world system.  He will appear to be good to the world by likely defeating this obviously evil satanic technocracy that is being set up and slowly exposed to the public as well as whatever false Antichrist it presents.  If they can trick professing unsaved Christians into believing these are the &quot;7 trumpets&quot; in Revelation then when he shows up, those deceived souls will believe he is Jesus Christ coming back to rule.  They will worship him and everything else in Revelation will take place.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, these trumpet sounds are a red herring for professing Christians to make them think they are in a different place in timeline laid out in Scripture than they are.  This is important for the Jesuits/Masons/Vatican working on bringing forth the Antichrist.  They are preparing the ecumenical false church to accept him.</p>
