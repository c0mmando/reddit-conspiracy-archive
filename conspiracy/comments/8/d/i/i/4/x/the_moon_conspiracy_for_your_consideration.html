       SS: The Moon is not what it appears to be, and it appears it's having technical difficulties that have been observed from multiple locations and multiple sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple independent videos and photos of the moon all showing some type of "line" going through it or some type of unusual visual phenomena.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge for yourself.  I work in technology, so if I had to venture a guess, I'd say it's a projection and like any technology, it "glitches" out when the server gets patched or Windows updates get installed.  Fucking Windows updates.

       The Moon is not what it appears to be, and it appears it's having technical difficulties

       I have no idea what would be the point of a false protection of the Moon, but I work in information technology, and the lunar wave looks like a resolution/ pixel issue on a standard computer monitor.  Notice I said it's what it looks like, not what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just pointing out there's visual phenomena that has yet to be explained regarding the Moon.   If you have an alternative hypothesis, if anyone has an alternative hypothesis, I'd love to hear it.

       I’m not an optical physicist, an astronomer, or whatever. All I’m saying is that seeing weird lines and jumping to “it could be a fake projection” seems to be an extreme violation of Occam’s Razor. If you hear hoof beats, it’s probably a horse, not a zebra.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reach the point where a fake moon projection theory reaches even the barest threshold of plausibility, you’d have to assert that:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Every record in human history that references the moon, including the many ancient myths that attempt to explain its origins and meaning, are forgeries that were created within the last few decades, when the kind of technology needed to pull off a moon projection would have been available.
      </p>
      <p>
       (This kind of technology would not have been even have been available when we launched the moon mission, but it would have to have been to convince people there was a celestial body we were flying to).
      </p>
      <p>
       2) That there is some benefit to somebody out there to project a celestial body that essentially has no real value to humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) That this projection technology is ubiquitous across the entire world, so therefore is operated by a global entity with no obvious motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) That there is a projection surface surrounding the planet completely in order to maintain the detail we can make out with the naked eye, which also implicated the sun as a forgery (which would then require an explanation of where that solar energy that feeds life on Earth comes from).
      </p>
      <p>
       5) That the resolution of the projection is so profoundly high that it fools everybody with a high-power telescope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is all that an easier explanation than a photo glitch, optical illusion, or weird cloud?
      </p>
      <p>
       Being into conspiracies is fun if you can come up with valid explanations, but it’s not fun when you simply point to a weird picture. There are WAY too many loose ends here for the “moon projection” theory to be viable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could, if you wanted, retreat into the “we’re in the Matrix” argument, but that argument is valid for every strange experience, and kind of lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and you have some work to do before some glitchy-looking pictures can be considered extraordinary.

       You make valid points and I'm well aware it's not the most parsimonious explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact that this phenomenon has been verified from multiple sources from different locations on the planet tells me there's more to this than meets the eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing on Google or in the scientific literature that explains this phenomenon.  If you have an alternate explanation I'm all ears.

       Looks like chemtrails at night to me.  I’ve seen them in flashes of lightening in a distance. They do happen.  It seems far fetch as you can go on Instagram and see photos of the nights moon from different parts of the world.

       If you are familiar with David Icke theory about reptilians, and the hollow moon(some kind of alien civilization that can and parasite humans, mainly the elites) the earth ancient civilizations that where here and the flood that erased em(Brian Foester). 
Now what I think is, this alien invasion occured, the moon was their "parasite machine" and how the got here, wich was designed to our earth(check all the mathematical singularities between earth and moon) it caused the big flood, that them caused the ancient civilization collapse.

       The moon is 100% man-made. Ancient civilizations didnt draw the moon in their drawings, but they drew other stars and planets. The moon is either a projection or a hollow spaceship that ws brought here.
"The moon rang like a bell for days"

       One thing that could explain the ringing is the metal content of the rock. There was a video from one of the ancient archaeologists that shows rock from south Africa having properties of this sort. I will find the video and post it here.

       This sounds more plausible to me than the "lack of water" causing the ringing sound.

       Maybe it has a solid core compared to a melty one. This would lead to less dampening of the vibrations.

       Yes it could be solid but it just doesnt look right, i hope we learn the true origins of the moon and who built it. Its placed so perfectly for earth. I also wonder about the dark side of the moon and what is really there.

       Very well could be true. The moon may have a thick 3 mile deep dust layer to soften impacts of asteroids, and then an impenetrable hull beneath that. Inside, who knows. Perhaps there are greys inside, or  insectoid like humanoids. They could be spying on us, they could be transmitting frequencies to keep us locked in, and it might all tie back to Saturn.

       The ring like a bell thing is pathetic. It was Apollo 15 experiments that got this going. One person once said it and it stuck, in certain circles.

       They used seismographs and explosives.

       It is similar to NDT saying pear shaped and flat earth twats having a hay day with it.

       I didn't say otherwise. It was done intentionally to seismically study the moon. We know it's internally composition because of these experiments.

       My opinion is that there is a 99% chance the evidence is a result of something happening within 100 miles from the surface of the Earth. There is very little reason to assume the cause is something 240,000 miles away.

       The one thing that got me was the surface temperature being 200+F and the battery rated for max of 140f on the rovers. I am not sure how surface temperature compares to radiant heat, or how reflective shielding affects this. Anyone able to speak on this?
