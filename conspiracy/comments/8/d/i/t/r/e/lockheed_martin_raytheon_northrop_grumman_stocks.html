We are looking to have the most advanced warfare this world has ever seen, and investors are frothing at the mouth. What can we do? Shame stock owners? Educate engineers that their weapons are killing children, creating new enemies and essentially endangering our country through blowback (CIA term for karma)? The reality is investors already know this, and they don&#39;t care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should have them stop making things the government wants, as long as the government is acting like a murder machine. I have no problem making weapons for defense but let&#39;s be honest, that is not what&#39;s happening anymore. It&#39;s all about greed, making weapons and selling them to whoever will buy them, regardless of the wars it creates and the enemies it makes.</p>

<p>For example, I have enough skill to make killer drone software, but I refuse to do any contracts like that. I have enough skill to make the next big data farm, but I refuse to use my skills for that. Shit doesn&#39;t benefit humanity as a whole, it puts more power into the hands of people who don&#39;t deserve it because they don&#39;t exercise it properly. Why should I lend my skills to a murderer? That would make me an accomplice.</p>

<p>Or in your case, we can just sit back and say it&#39;s cool as fuck that Monsanto and DuPont are making agent orange for the government. It&#39;s not their fault! Because that&#39;s definitely what our parents and grandparents did. /s</p>

<p>Or in the case of the Manhattan Project, the scientists who built the atomic bombs looked the other way and erroneously felt like the politicians would absorb the blame. Then the bombs were dropped, and all these scientists had a reckoning of their own.</p>

The Iran deal is a clear case of diplomacy over conflict and escalation.  Something we always ask for but rarely happens.  But even when it does happen, the warmongers just move the goalposts like the terrorists they are.  Similar thing happened when they claimed to care about chemical weapons and soon after a deal was struck to get rid of Assad&#39;s WMD but they just disregarded and moved the goalposts.</p>

<p>If you were a betting man and saw Trump&#39;s cabinet and listened to all the rhetoric on Iran/Russia/Syria buying those stocks would be wise.</p>

<p>Anyone can buy these stocks and the US has already taken some military action with threats of more. Of course people invest at times like these and there is strong public evidence that there is a high possibility of all out war. That alone is enough to push these prices up.</p>

<p>You post implies that TPTB are investing knowing an invasion is planned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russians aren&#39;t robbing us of most of our taxes. Our own CIA-infiltrated &quot;Defense&quot; companies are robbing us. Who&#39;s the real enemy?</p>

<p><strong>An extraordinarily high 60 percent</strong> of our federal income taxes goes to the &quot;Defense&quot; industry each year, and it&#39;s been like that since the early 1950s. That&#39;s an incredible waste of money, not to mention epic Brain Drain. </p>

<p>As former <strong>Assistant Secretary of the Treasury</strong> Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has stated, you have to take into account all the following Departments when calculating total &quot;Defense&quot; spending each year:</p>

<p>(1) The Defense Department (roughly $600 Billion for 2015, but grew by an astounding $100 billion to $700 billion in 2017)</p>

<p>(2) defense-related spending in The Energy Department (for the creation of fissionable nuclear materials, operation of facilities, and many other things) - roughly $50 Billion</p>

<p>(3) defense-related spending in the Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.) -- roughly $40 Billion. (We really should shut down D.H.S. It&#39;s only been around 15 years -- a totally unnecessary department.  That&#39;s what we supposedly have the FBI for.)</p>

<p>(4) Interest paid on the National Debt that is defense-related (roughly 150 Billion, maybe more)</p>

<p>and spending in several other departments like the Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.).  </p>

<p>Spending for the Department of Veteran Affairs is roughly 200 to 250 Billion every year, and rising of course with the many casualties sustained from unnecessary foregin wars.</p>

<p>NASA also spends some of its budget on &quot;Defense&quot;-related activities. So does the CIA. The CIA and NASA were created as independent agencies, so they are not a part of any of the Departments listed above.</p>

<p>Calculating the sum of the above numbers comes to a total &quot;Defense&quot; spending outlay of 1.1 Trillion dollars in 2015 [-- not just 600 Billion!]</p>

<p>The following page shows the U.S. government collected about 1.85 Trillion dollars in federal Income Taxes for 2015 (Individual Income Taxes were about 1.5 Trillion and Corporate Income Taxes were about $350 Billion, so both forms of Income Taxes together garnered the government about 1.85 Trillion): </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/">https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/</a></p>

<p>For 2015, if you divide 1.1 Trillion for Total &quot;Defense&quot; spending by 1.85 Trillion for total Income Taxes, you get about 60 percent.</p>

<p>For 2018, I think Paul Craig Roberts calculated about 1.3 Trillion to be spent on &quot;Defense,&quot; even more of course than the 2015 total.</p>

<p>As former Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others have stated, &quot;Defense&quot; spending is a whole lot more than the official amount announced for just the &quot;Defense&quot; Department (700 Billion). There are many other Departments burning a whole lot of money on &quot;Defense&quot;/War spending. And that&#39;s the way the &quot;Defense&quot; Companies with contracts with those governmental departments like it.</p>

<p>As a nation we desperately need to cut total &quot;Defense&quot; spending in half tomorrow.  We really shouldn&#39;t be spending anymore than 30 percent of total income taxes on &quot;Defense,&quot; and probably 15 percent would be more than enough to suffice.  </p>

<p>By the way, you can probably knock at least 200 Billion off the total just by ending all unnecessary foregin wars (&quot;overseas contingencies&quot; as the government likes to euphemize).  Knock another 150 billion off by shutting down 85 percent of our 900(!) <em>unnecessary</em> military bases overseas (some say we should close them all down).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>....Forgot to add:  In the linked graphic in the prior post above, don&#39;t confuse Social Security and Medicare with <strong>Income Taxes.</strong></p>

<p>The Social Security and Medicare money we give to the government is not considered <strong>Federal Income Taxes.</strong> Instead, they are entitlements for retirees (and sometimes called FICA). We&#39;re suppose to get those entitlements too when we eventually retire, so they&#39;re not actually taxes, since the money comes back to us. When we retire, the money will come from workers who haven&#39;t yet retired. They are transfer payments, not taxes.</p>

<p>Entitlements are mandatory, not part of the government&#39;s Discretionary spending. The government chooses to blow 60 percent of its Discretionary spending (that it gets from <strong>Income Taxes</strong>) on so-called &quot;Defense.&quot; President Eisenhower was so right about the excessive influence of the military-industrial complex, and warned us about it in his farewell address as President.</p>

<p>Again, when calculating the 60 percent, don&#39;t confuse <strong>Federal Income Tax</strong> with Social Security/Medicare.  Medicare is like a health insurance account workers pay into for when we retire (so we&#39;ll have health insurance when we retire), and Social Security is like an investment account or bank account you get money from after retiring that you can spend on anything you like -- again Social Security is like an investment account or bank account.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Stocks this high are only sustainable with...you guessed it...war and arms deals with anyone. Endless deadly war. Educate engineers that their weapons are killing children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Melodramatic. There are better explanations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually because of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Those big companies have gobbled up business from smaller contractors over the years. They even grew under Obama and during sequestration</p></li>
<li><p>They have been gaining overseas and commercial contracts with Australia, Japan, Spain, Germany, Brazil, the UK, France, and many other big world players. It used to be that every country had its own programs to develop stuff, but in the past decade or two, foreign arms sales of tech developed here has become very popular on the world scene.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of them are getting into sectors that aren&#39;t developing weapons. All of those are getting into the cyber business, and a few are getting into the energy sector, building helicopters for offshore ore rigs, developing mining equipment, and other things. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump&#39;s big business tax cuts and defense spending allocations ending the Obama era sequestration has made the stock market very bullish on those companies.</p></li>
<li><p>NASA&#39;s budget has been exploded by a ton of money under Trump. LMC, Raytheon, and NG are all big NASA contractors building satellites, rocket components, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Russia, China. As long as those countries keep driving a new Cold War, contractors will keep becoming more valuable.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some other points - A lot of the things you think of as &#39;war machines&#39; aren&#39;t even made by those companies. Let&#39;s look at some:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fighter aircraft - yea, the stealth ones are made by LMC. Trump has allocated more money for the F35 after Obama had cut them back. So there&#39;s that. But most of the ones we use right now are made by Boeing and Northrop Grumman. Or Fairchild int he case of the A-10. </li>
<li>Drones - Mix of Boeing, LMC, Northrop, Raytheon, BAE, and some others</li>
<li>Naval craft - This is another big segment for LMC, though growth hasn&#39;t been on the combat ship side, it has been on the intelligence side.</li>
<li>Missiles - Definitely a big area for Raytheon, and some from LMC.</li>
<li>Bombers - Northrop Grumman has that</li>
<li>Helicopters - Sikorsky, now LMC. </li>
</ul>

<p>So those are the damning ones.</p>

<ul>
<li>M1 Abrams - General Dynamics</li>
<li>M4s, M16s (infantry rifles) - Colt, FN Herstal</li>
<li>M855 (5.56 ammo) - Lake City</li>
<li>Artillery - Rock Island Arsenal, also the ammo</li>
</ul>

<p>A LOT of the work done in the defense industry, I am very proud of. Most of the time and money spent is working on ways to prevent war through intelligence and superior firepower.</p>

<p>I think it is very naive, egocentric, even idiotic, to blame defense contractors or put the blame on our government for the troubles in the world.</p>

<p>The world stage is a very complicated place. Not everyone gets along. Some factions want to destroy others. If we could get world peace by directing funds somewhere else, we would have done it already. </p>

<p>The idea that cutting edge technology companies NEED warfare to become juggernauts is nonsense. Most of the sectors in the economy that defense contractors enter are WAAAY more profitable than the pitiful FFP or cost-plus contracts they enter into with the government. </p>

<p>All defense contractors operate on pretty thin margins. LMC, for example, even if you ignore the write-down they had to take from the tax bill, were operating, on average, something like 5% net profit margins (10-12% gross). </p>

<p>In comparison, Big Pharma companies are often operating on 25 or 35% margins. Hallmark operates on 30% margins. Microsoft is on a 25% margin. Oracle is on a 24.5% margin.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of money for grabs... but it has to pay for tons and tons and tons of highly skilled technical people to do the very expensive work. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a lazy-gravy-train like Apple or Google or other big tech sits on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s naive to blame our government for the troubles in the world when we literally force a presence by gunpoint all over the world. We have bases in 80 countries. How many is Russia in? Like 9 countries mostly former Soviet union. Most Americans can&#39;t NAME 80 countries period, because our money is going towards invading countries not educating the public that they even exist, have a culture, and enjoy living and not getting bombed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am positive a Company can do both good stuff and bad stuff. Now I am also positive producing weapons is quite unesescarry in the grand scheme of things. For sure there are ways to keep people happy without weapons and technology can be used to transcend differences instead of trying to create more. Now I also Believe humanity eventually will see the folly of fighting amongst themselfs, but it will maybe take Another 50 - 100 years. Eventually we will see that wars is not the only way of settling our differences. </p>

<p>I Think it is naive to say &quot;that if we could get World Peace by directing our funds somewhere else, we would have dont it already&quot;.
It is not unreasonable to consider that people who has taken alot of Power for themselfs wants to keep it, because Power gives the illusion of Control, and our human ego LOVES Control because it gives stability and in stability we feel safe. Power is in the end about feeling safe. So why wouldnt some people want to dominate the World? Especially if they see an oppurtunity for it? </p>

<p>A great leader can elevate their country to new levels. A tyrannical leader can cause devastating effects on the country for generations. 
The decision to go into war is Ultimately a Human decision. The decision for peaceful solution is ALSO a human decision. Some people are in Power position to make these choices, some people decide that war is a solid option, others dont. There is Always a human behind every decision. Always. 
The biggest deciet that can be made is that &quot;the organization&quot; choose this, so that noone can be held accountable. Some people also know this and goes to vast lenghts to make sure that whoever makes the decisions cant be held accountable, because this is in a way the &quot;highest&quot; forms of Power on Earth. To be invisble and make the decisions. Because then &#39;noone&#39; can touch you, you are in the safest position. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the moment I can’t see how war can be avoided. Russia and China cannot match nato in a conventional war. America won’t risk a nuclear war at the moment. It looks as though a strike first plan is in place to hit Russia’s nuclear capability before it can retaliate. This appears to be what Putin is worried about with the Romanian “defence” systems. When the rockets are capable of striking 1000 miles into Russian territory there is a real threat Russian defence systems won’t have time to retaliate and the few nukes that do get sent will be easier to take out. And any damage will be limited anyway. That leaves the mobile launchers. They won’t get them all but intelligence should get a lot of them. </p>

<p>If you were surrounded by your enemy and your only potential way of retaliation was effectively nullified what would you do ?  He has a choice. Strike first while the nukes still have the power to do so. Or sit and wait for the potential of the US striking first. And since the US has already shown it will quite happily strike first under the flimsiest of pretexts. Well....  </p>

<p>These are very dangerous times. The complex is playing its riskiest card. Maybe it’s all a show to justify defence spending in all countries. Maybe it’s more. I’m under no illusion the world is split into countries. More like companies now. But still it needs Russia bought to heal. </p>

<p>Put it this way. Becoming a prepper right now is sanity. Not preparing is crazy. We really do live again in times where a first strike is a real threat. The Russians have to either accept the might of the US or die fighting it....  and if you know what the Russians are like ? Boom. </p>

<p>At least they are all warning us. Personally I’d take those warnings seriously at the moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a war cue I noticed:</p>

<p>I deal in vintage stuff and also military surplus, some of which is truly old, and a lot of which is just that: new surplus. In the past couple months, my international surplus wholesale sources have dried up: gotten too expensive or just don&#39;t have the variety or stock that they used to. During Obama, my access to int&#39;l surplus was cheap and plentiful. Something happened around Trump&#39;s win- things shifted, countries started holding onto their surpluses again &#39;just in case&#39;, I think- though perhaps there were new surplus trade regulations installed,  I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>But the past two months? I can&#39;t get 1/10th of the stock of anything that I used to. It&#39;s just not available, and what is has gone up to retail prices.</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s either countries holding onto their surplus for emergency or the result of more people &#39;prepping&#39; during uncertain times- but mostly it&#39;s just less items being offered at all. And as one might guess, a lot of the short stock comes from Eastern Europe.  </p>

<p>Admire me, admire my home</p>

<p>Admire my son, he&#39;s my clone</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>

<p>This land is mine, this land is free</p>

<p>I&#39;ll do what I want but irresponsibly</p>

<p>It&#39;s evolution, baby</p>

<p>I&#39;m a thief, I&#39;m a liar</p>

<p>There&#39;s my church, I sing in the choir:</p>

<p>(Hallelujah, hallelujah)</p>

<p>Admire me, admire my home</p>

<p>Admire my son, admire my clones</p>

<p>&#39;Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast</p>

<p>Those ignorant Indians got nothin&#39; on me</p>

<p>Nothin&#39;, why? </p>

<p>Because it&#39;s evolution, baby!</p>

<p>I am ahead, I am advanced</p>

<p>I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah</p>

<p>I crawled the earth, but now I&#39;m higher</p>

<p>2010, watch it go to fire</p>

<p>It&#39;s evolution, baby</p>

<p>Do the evolution</p>

<p>Come on, come on, come on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the charts. If this new war is coming they&#39;ve known about it for at least a year now (if that many people KNEW for a fact war was coming we wouldn&#39;t see all markets being so bullish)... </p>

<p>The increase could be explained by the fact that since Trump took office he has been clear about strengthening the military. There&#39;s been many new contracts handed out and a couple of strikes on Syria which could explain the spikes.</p>

<p>When you say &quot;investors&quot; who are you talking about? There&#39;s many many investors in these companies. Many people who invest their money through a broker may not even be aware that their money is being traded in the military sector.</p>

<p>Both Raytheon and Lockheed just won contracts with the DoD (contracts that we know about, that doesn&#39;t include black budget contracts). </p>

<p>Not saying war isn&#39;t coming because it looks like the shadow government are fully intent on it, but to put things in perspective Lockheed had an all time high in February.</p>

<p>Compare over a year. They&#39;ll all been climbing for a while...</p>

<p>Also what happened on the 8th Feb as we see a short bull run from around the 8th - 12th on all 3. 
Was is the defence budget or something?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, you don&#39;t just want to look at defence stocks.
War affects all industries, some not so favourably. Look for other indicators as well. Look at the volumes traded on defence stocks not just the stock value.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the stocks so you can do your own comparisons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have all been rising since around 2013/2014. Each of the ones you have listed has a long term chart that looks like it started running up Mt. Everest around 2013/2014, continuing to present. This would be an excellent thing for someone to dig deeper into. </p>

<p>It&#39;s premature to say that this indicates an imminent major war, although it&#39;s a possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>gear does not matter in a war russia/USA or even china  (and china said they would help russia)</p>

<p>there are a lot people in USA thinking they are save from nukes cause they will be shot down ... but russia dont even need to shoot this nukes at USA. They have over 2000 nukes and it would kill complete planet anyway. So they could just explode them in own country.</p>

<p>I think its insane to even consider a war this days ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are asking if there are stats that back up previous high share prices and the star of wars. </p>

<p>Anyone can buy these stocks and the US has already taken some military action with threats of more. Of course people invest at times like these and there is strong public evidence that there is a high possibility of all out war. That alone is enough to push these prices up.</p>

<p>You post implies that TPTB are investing knowing an invasion is planned. </p>
