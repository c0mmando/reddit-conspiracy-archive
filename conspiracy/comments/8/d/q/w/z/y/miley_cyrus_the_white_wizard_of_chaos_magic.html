        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">0</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TheCIASellsDrugs.html">TheCIASellsDrugs</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Chaos magic is the use of outlandish images, symbols, or ideas to create chaos in the current system of order. The discordians are into this sort of thing, or if you want something less esoteric, you can watch KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov explain how he subverted cultures for the USSR. </p>

<p>It seems to me that Miley Cyrus is using chaos magic to undo the current order in the music industry and Hollywood by taking all of the degeneracy they push and taking it to such an extreme degree that it creates a backlash.</p>

<p>To start, let&#39;s establish her as an adept of the mysteries:</p>

<p><a href="http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/6300000/The-Climb-miley-cyrus-6362406-638-357.jpg">Uncompleted pyramid</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/6300000/The-Climb-miley-cyrus-6359893-636-357.jpg">Moon and stars, path she is walking on is also an uncompleted pyramid</a>.</p>

<p>So, Miley knows what she&#39;s doing. Before she went off the deep end, she was pretty wholesome. Her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus was a country singer that had the hit &quot;Achy Breaky Heart,&quot; and looked like <a href="https://img.wennermedia.com/article-leads-horizontal/gettyimages-107804843-e0610f39-04d9-43de-8160-84fa8136dfae.jpg">this</a>. That mullet is strong enough to kill all commies in a 50 foot radius.</p>

<p>Miley had an &quot;All-American girl&quot; image:</p>

<p><a href="http://images.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/Hannah-Montana-Wallpaper-hannah-montana-103810_1024_768.jpg">Disney star</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3146034/images/o-MILEY-PARTY-IN-THE-USA-facebook.jpg">Party in the USA</a></p>

<p>Then, something changes. Drastically. All-American girl cuts all of her hair off and starts dressing like <a href="http://www.hawtcelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/miley-cyrus-at-2014-amfar-la-inspiration-gala-in-hollywood_13.jpg">this</a>. Miley goes buck wild:</p>

<p><a href="http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/480xflex/public/images/2015/08/080105-vma-miley-outfit7.jpg?itok=fbksdSAQ">You don&#39;t dress like this if you want to maintain the illusion</a></p>

<p><a href="https://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/miley-cyrus-performance.jpg">You <em>definitely</em> don&#39;t do shit like this</a> (notice the eye)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eroticscribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Miley-Cyrus-twerking.jpg">And who can forget the twerk heard round the world</a></p>

<p>What the hell happened? She came in like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8">wrecking ball</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped never asking why
We kissed, <em>I fell under your spell</em>.
A love no one could deny</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
<em>I can&#39;t live a lie, running for my life</em>
I will always want you</p>

<p><em>I came in like a wrecking ball</em>
<em>I never hit so hard in love</em>
<em>All I wanted was to break your walls</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Innocent little Miley got sick of their bullshit. So she came in like a wrecking ball to destroy the illusion they are using to control everyone, represented by the wall:</p>

<p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLUWVWaQL1Q/Ui6I6SD5G6I/AAAAAAAAAJM/asa4hmD_RCM/s1600/youtube-music+videos-miley-cyrus-hot-disney-wrecking-ball-sexy-blonde-girl.jpg">Smashing the illusion with her wrecking ball</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.woonko.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/miley-cyrus-hot-wrecking-ball-2013-4.jpg">Wearing white, smashing the wall with a hammer</a></p>

<p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtL3koB8mIk/UiB7gOjKQpI/AAAAAAAAJtM/eJcZgnh0fVE/s1600/Sans+titre.jpeg">One eye illuminated</a> (she knows)</p>

<p>All of this had exactly the desired effect. The video has almost a billion views, Miley was widely criticized for going too far, and became the standard example of the extreme degeneracy in show business. And now she pretends it was just a phase that she <a href="http://beta.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/miley-cyrus-regrets-wrecking-ball-music-video-article-1.3173659">regrets</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m never living that down. I will always be the naked girl on a wrecking ball,&quot; Cyrus said. &quot;I just licked the sledgehammer. I should have thought how long that was going to follow me around. That&#39;s my worst nightmare — that being played at my funeral.&quot;</p>

<p>Cyrus has since covered up and walked away from the &quot;bad girl&quot; image of her &quot;Bangerz&quot; days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is she doing now? She&#39;s <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a40311/miley-cyrus-on-liam-hemsworth-engagement-ring/">engaged</a> to Liam Hemsworth, and posts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOdep5ohdap/?utm_source=ig_embed">pretty normal picures</a> on social media. Not exactly controversial.</p>

<p>Was it all just a phase? Or is Miley Cyrus the greatest chaos wizard ever to walk the earth?</p>

Ever WONDER why everyone laughs at you? Acts like you are nuts? it&#39;s because you are nuts.
that&#39;s why you all huddle online in your circle jerk, because reality rejects you, you hide here with your &quot;theories&quot; and your &quot;open minds&quot; .
You are failures and deathly afraid of the real world so you construct your own so you can be superior. And you are so whacked you can&#39;t see that. Cult members.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe Miley isn&#39;t particularly talented compared to a lot of other performers out there.</p>

<p>Remember, she got a leg up on the part of Hannah Montana because of her dad. Then, she got a head start on a singing career because Hannah Montana... not because of any great natural singing talent.</p>

<p>So now you&#39;ve got some leftover fans from the old TV show. But that ain&#39;t gonna cut it for long. You&#39;ve got to maintain some kind of interest and keep yourself in the public eye. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t do that with talent, you have to find another way. It helps to play to your strengths. If Miley isn&#39;t a great singer, she does look ok and she&#39;s young and fit. So she went with some shock tactics based on her looks.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s chaos wizardry, but it has worked like a charm. Her career should have been over years ago... but here we are discussing her in 2018.</p>

<p>Yer a wizard Miley!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible.  I still am of the Opinion that she was told by an agent that her career was basically over. That she could not count on her Disney acting fame to keep her career going.  And to hang it Up.</p>

<p>Her response, &quot;Hold my cosmo.&quot;</p>

<p>She took things as far as she was willing to go.  Finally tired of it and then simmered down into a fairly normal life.</p>

<p>As long as she never lost her sense of who she is....Let her have some fun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. Lately i have been thinking that the conspiracies go even deeper... As in deep sleep.</p>

<p>My assertion is that practicing chaos magic is not necessarily an intentional act. I have practiced much unconventional &quot;magic&quot;, and often you are doing something just for a feeling your not thinking about specific actions/effects, that is part of what makes it so effective and dangerous.</p>

<p>The more i research the more i believe that we only understand part of reality. Look into metaphysics/occult. I grew up in that atmosphere, mom is Wiccan and step dad is an ex-seal who is into metaphysics. Im buddhist ;)</p>
