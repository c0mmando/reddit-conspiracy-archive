       I am now 25, and I REMEMBER vividly in 3rd grade waiting to go to school and a guy coming on the news saying "Good Morning America!" and about 5 seconds later, behind him, a plane smashing into thw Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       He instantly was terrified and also say "OH MY GOD" which is not something they do or say on air. But to my knowledge, they claim there is not ONE news airing of this happening. But I SEEN IT.

       I literally can remember the entire environment while it was happening. And I remember a lot of stuff from my past. People I have known since I was a kid, I will bring random memories up and they will say “HOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT??”
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll give you the whole memory right now. I had my hair combed over with gel freshly brushed through it, waiting for my brothers to come in the back room while my mom was doing their hair. The sun was shining through the 3 windows that is towards the east. I was standing there with my backpack alone in the living room waiting for them and the news was on. It just stopped at a commercial and then went back to the news and this guy, slicked sideways brownish black hair sitting there in a building that has a clear view of New York and the towers saying “Good morning America” with a huge smile and all of a sudden a plane comes from left field smashing into one of them. And all of a sudden he freaks out and gets really scared. Then says something just happened and they will be back. And then the channel stops. I run to the back of the house screaming for my mom cause I had no idea what happened and told her something just blew up on the news and she doesn’t believe me and almost every channel is tuned into New York. Nickelodeon, MTV, CartoonNetwork, EVERY NEWS CHANNEL, just showing smoke from the building. I can’t make this stuff up man.

       I saw the anchors freak out when the second plane hit. Before the second plane there wasn't concern that that any other plans could be coming. At the time, it was thought it was some kind of an accident.

       It sounds like you are confused between the first building being hit and the second. All channels did not start showing the WTC until after the second plane hit, so your memory doesn't make sense. (People didn't realize it was a terrorist attack or even on purpose until the second plane hit, they just thought it was a horrible accident).
      </p>

       You were young and it was a massive event that people talked about and you watched TV about for months, if not years, after. False memories happen.

       It's an interesting effect but memories were hold strongly aren't often more accurate. A lot chemically is happening in your brain at intense moments and can skew your memories

       There has to be, but they were probably taken by men in black suits, if you catch my drift. You'd think there were cameras on at least a few of the skyscrapers.

       Like I said, it depends on the purpose of the camera. A purely security camera would be directed on the floor and surrounding area, however, there are other reasons for cameras on the roofs of skyscrapers.

       While this sort of thing doesn't strike me as impossible it also doesn't strike me as very likely.  Both of those sorts of operations could be better fulfilled by cameras or devices (especially for weather data) that wouldn't be capturing a general view of the skyline.

      <p>
       It wasnt until the following day i saw the first plane hit on the naudet film.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I wasnt watching US news at all when the first plane actually hit, so i cant verify or deny your memory but I'm sure somebody else would have seen it and spoken out by now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe your memory of the day is fuddled as you were quite young at the time and seeing everything go to shit would have definitely had some sort of psychological effect on you.

       Thing is tho, I had no idea what it meant. It didn’t distill fear in me. The only memory after I have of it is my step dad a few days later crying about it. That’s it.

       If its any help there are hours of full, uninterrupted TV broadcasts from the various stations on the day, on youtube.

       It's possible that you are the second plane and you've been told by the media that a plane also hit the first tower and so your brain is creating false memories that you saw the first tower get hit too.

       its more probable that it's a 17 year old memory, influenced countless times since it happened and there's absolutely no reason to believe it happened and must have been covered up lol.

       go in a store and try to accurate describe the cashier 10 minutes later. highly doubtful you give an accurate description.. but remembering something Crystal clear from almost a decade ago? oh, that recollection must be legit.

       Why would good morning America have cameras pointed at the WTC on what started out to be a perfectly normal day? It doesn't make sense.  Sure there's probably video of it somewhere taken by a tourist or some shit like that, but that was most likely taken by suits long ago.

       Had the Wright Brothers delayed their first flight by a few months, 9/11 may never have happened. Notice how no kids are named Orville or Wilbur anymore. Coincidence? I think not.

       Yeah im leanig towards you just rememberig this incorrectly. If you were only 8 at the time, then that leaves a lot of time for memory drift.  Our brains dont store images or video; everytime you recall somethig you are recreating it from scratch, but its very easy to believe memories wihot question

       The first impact wasn’t shown on tv until a few days later. It was allegedly captured by these brothers who were filming fire fighters. They also filmed the inside of one of the towers showing the lobby with the windows blown out and heavy slabs of marble blown off the walls.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Bush has said that he watched the first impact live before he went into the class room. He thought it was a bad pilot. Then Card came in and told him about the second impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could he have watched it live?

       The only real 911 evidence from eye witnesses and fire fighters in those buildings is that explosions  brought down the building. Which is consistent  with the demolition  evidence of thermite and the free fall speeds of collapse we witness. Everything else is part of the conspiracy and we may never know what aspects they forged or inserted later to create confusion to distract from the demolition evidence. The planes abd various other aspects could have been forged as the number independents footages are limited, which makes suspect if the whole hijacking thing was a cover up of the demo.

       I literally can remember the entire environment while it was happening. And I remember a lot of stuff from my past. People I have known since I was a kid, I will bring random memories up and they will say “HOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT??”
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll give you the whole memory right now. I had my hair combed over with gel freshly brushed through it, waiting for my brothers to come in the back room while my mom was doing their hair. The sun was shining through the 3 windows that is towards the east. I was standing there with my backpack alone in the living room waiting for them and the news was on. It just stopped at a commercial and then went back to the news and this guy, slicked sideways brownish black hair sitting there in a building that has a clear view of New York and the towers saying “Good morning America” with a huge smile and all of a sudden a plane comes from left field smashing into one of them. And all of a sudden he freaks out and gets really scared. Then says something just happened and they will be back. And then the channel stops. I run to the back of the house screaming for my mom cause I had no idea what happened and told her something just blew up on the news and she doesn’t believe me and almost every channel is tuned into New York. Nickelodeon, MTV, CartoonNetwork, EVERY NEWS CHANNEL, just showing smoke from the building. I can’t make this stuff up man.

       Correct.  This was it.  I always thought he just missed the impact and captured a few seconds later,  but nope he got it.

       The first impact wasn’t shown on tv until a few days later. It was allegedly captured by these brothers who were filming fire fighters. They also filmed the inside of one of the towers showing the lobby with the windows blown out and heavy slabs of marble blown off the walls.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Bush has said that he watched the first impact live before he went into the class room. He thought it was a bad pilot. Then Card came in and told him about the second impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could he have watched it live?

       its more probable that it's a 17 year old memory, influenced countless times since it happened and there's absolutely no reason to believe it happened and must have been covered up lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       go in a store and try to accurate describe the cashier 10 minutes later. highly doubtful you give an accurate description.. but remembering something Crystal clear from almost a decade ago? oh, that recollection must be legit.

       A lot of things happened on that day in my life. I am 100% positive I saw it on Good Morning America when the first plane hit.  No false memories.
