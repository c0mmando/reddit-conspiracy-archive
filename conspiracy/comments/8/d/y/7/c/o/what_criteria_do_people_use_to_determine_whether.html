        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve heard from many sources that there are only 3 or 4 countries that are not controlled by a Rothschild centrally owned bank; Cuba, North Korea, and Iran, (and I think Syria?). Before I go propping up the idea of false flags being driven by the motive of the Rothschild&#39;s thirst for world control and power, I want to get my ducks in a row. </p>

<p>So, what criteria does one use to make this determination? How do we find out? What are some legitimate sources for information that people use to determine this stuff?</p>

<p>EDIT: (Please understand, I&#39;m a noob in this arena, so your responses should reflect that)</p>

<p>so as we all know the Rothschild family are the richest in the world.. the head of the family  Sir Evelyn Rothschild is the personal financial advisor of Queen Elizabeth II</p>

<p>Basically any country with a similar central banking set up to the USA and also have Rothschild banks in their country &quot;Rothschild &amp; Co&quot; are said to be controlled, at least in part by the Rothschilds</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...basically all of them dude. </p>

<p>pretty much every country in the world has a decentralized central bank and some kind of Rothschild presence.. </p>

<p>In 2001 the list was Lybia, Iraq, Afghan, North Korea, Syria, Cuba and Iran. Now.. take Lybia, Iraq and Afghan off that list.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not the place to find the answers you are after. If you ask me where to go to find them I could not tell you either.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no journalist or expert. My best guess would be to take a look at the N M Rothschild n sons financial involvements </p>

<p>A quick Google search shows they are involved in financial planning. Asset management, corporate banking. Investment banking.</p>

<p>The next logical step would be to find factual info regarding which corporate interests bank with them. Which high profile wealthy people have their assets and investments managed by this group.</p>

<p>From there you could start to branch out and find the factual connections you are after in regards to other activities conspiracy theories often tout as truth.</p>

<p>The reality is very few people who participate in conspiracy theory discussion have actually put in the hard research needed to cite you the factual proof you long for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is. I told you. The BIS. Thats your easiest starting piece.</p>

<p>Understand the context before trying to fill it all in. If you dont know about the major moving cogs in the machine then the ownership question is far harder to answer.</p>

<p>Its not like youre going to find a stack of incorporation documents going &#39;rothers wuz ere&#39; for each central bank. Hell, you need to understand what notions like control and ownership mean in this context.</p>

<p>Whilst wrong, blaming it all on them is a easy high level label pointing in the right direction of our mutual enemy. </p>

<p>Its a gross simplification for the age of memes.</p>

<p>They are the more public facing hatchetmen. Its not 1 fam. Its a whole intermingled ruling class with a history going all the way back to the douchepriests of Babel(on).</p>

<p>So what is it you want to get out of this because whichever way unpicking the wicked web is a shitload of work. There are no easy answers to anything.</p>

<p>If theres a more useful question at your level of understanding its what the rough shape of things looks like.</p>

<p>You might find this interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rothschild&#39;s keep their secrets well. You don&#39;t ever see any reports about them. It would be pretty surprising if they had their holdings in their own name, let alone available for the public to see. As such I think the only evidence is that central banking is the brainchild of a Rothschild. There is also the famous quote &quot;Give me control of a nation&#39;s money and I care not who makes it&#39;s laws&quot; which is now being denied as an actual quote. </p>

<p>If you want to find evidence you will have to get really cleaver, and start with how the Federal Reserve system was formed. This conspiracy has been around for a long time, giving them plenty of time to sterilize the books. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate you taking a run at this difficult topic. In this case, having the books sterilized (meaning there is no proof) is the exact same as there actually being no proof. No proof equals it either didn&#39;t happen at all, or it did happen and there is no evidence. </p>

<p>The rest could very well be confirmation bias. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say weather it&#39;s true or not, I just want to trace the path that others have traced to make the determination one way or the other. Make sense?</p>

<p>When you say things like, &quot;you say you are approaching this from the perspective of attempting to prove the conspiracy,&quot; you can&#39;t follow that up with &quot;in fact, you are approaching this from the perspective of disproving it&quot; and pretend they are somehow opposites. </p>

<p>I am trying to stiff out facts. Weather they lead down one path or another is not up to me. I follow facts. </p>

<p>No disrespect, but your comment shows you lack critical thinking and basic logic skills.</p>

<p>My goal is not to prove anything true.
My goal is not to prove anything false.
My goal is to follow the truth where it leads; the conspiracy will then end up either true or false.</p>

<p>They are very wealthy and powerful, however there is many familys above them.</p>

<p>That said this whole world is defintely controlled by a cabal, when you start looking into the top positions of these banks and corporations, you will find jesuit alumni, and knights of the sovereign military order of malta</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a list of some familys you can look into that are higher authority than the rothschilds(red shields)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of this (as far as I can tell) makes any sense to a noob. The part that DOES make sense in the scope of this conversation is when you said, &quot;The Rothschild controlled banks are mostly a myth.&quot;</p>

<p>I have to assume that is a possibility. </p>

<p>The extraordinary claim (ie: the Rothschild family controls all the world banks, except 3) has the burden of proof.</p>

<p>Therefore, so far, &quot;It&#39;s a myth&quot; is more likely true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>does it have a central bank that is controlled by some one other than the elected government?</p>

<p>if yes, then its fucked.</p>

<p>basically if you own a countries money, you are its real owner. if the elected government steps out of line, you crash the economy and when the people revolt its the government that gets the guillotines.</p>

<p>the rothchild family started buying up those banks and buying the political power to have countries shift in to privately owned central banks after world war I (they might have been doing it earlier but that seems to be when people noticed and started keeping track)</p>

<p>their goal is to own them all, thus own all the worlds governments.
the IMF and world bank are basically their main tools to do so.</p>

<p>IF they can get us to a one world government they will have near total control over it because they own all of the worlds debts.</p>
