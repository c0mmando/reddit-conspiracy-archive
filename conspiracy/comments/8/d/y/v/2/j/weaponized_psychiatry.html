       Why do people feel like they have the right to tell others to "get help".
      </p>
      <p>
       We own our own bodies and our own minds.   Abuse, and forced compliance are not "help".
      </p>
      <p>
       We can disagree with one another, but telling someone they "need help" just because they disagree with you is barbaric.
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked for the privilege of having health insurance.  No one should be allowed to turn my hard work against me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't do that so that other people can have a weapon that I pay for with my paycheck.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I disagree with you, or you disagree with me, then walk away.  I don't need you, and you probably don't need me either.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact that psychiatry still stands as a beacon of public re-education is sickening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think psychiatry is one of the worst conspiracies that exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gives the public the wrong idea that they have the right to medicalize opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gives the public the idea that they have the right to take their frustrations out on my body...and this is why psychiatry
is inexcusable violence.

       Psychiatry is about letting corporations dictate what agenda they want to push, and letting the medical industrial complex put everyone onto some type of drug to deal to help them not perceive and live with the lies being told.

       And they call it "help" lets not forget.  The worst part is when the ignorant public says, "I hope you get the "help" that you need.

       Getting out of the Matrix does not only require an ego death, but it requires people to realize that people's perspectives will allow them to do terrible things, and those perspectives are highly guarded by every obstacle convincing them that they are correct in their attitude and beliefs

       You have to know how to take on their flaws. Religion is one of the biggest psychiatric issues in America today, but no psychologist wants to admit that. In fact, much of science is being overtaken by crypto-religious people that see it as an opportunity to do just about anything they want to you, because an imaginary voice is telling them that they are justified in these actions.

       you on the other hand just claimed the problem with psychiatry is that the field has been taken over by religious fundamentalists. Show some evidence, or make an argument for that absurd nonsense.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the U.S., people are less religious than ever. Adults in their 20s and early 30s make up more than one-third of the country’s “nones,” or those who consider themselves religiously unaffiliated. Church attendance among young Americans has also declined, and most adults nationwide rely on internet research, rather than prayer, when faced with life decisions.
       </p>

      <p>
       Since you're obviously just shotgun spraying at anything religious to see what sticks, I wonder if you're concerned at all about The Atlantic's chief editor being a Zionist ex-IDF prison guard?

       Secret takeover is pharmaceutical companies pushing medication as a first resort. The government considers progressive ideas like open source distributed online voting platforms with open architecture, and free educational programs and online development platforms. We are ready to move ahead with science, but we have a President that wants to take three steps backwards to protect his elitist class.

       dude, why are you conflating dozens of different things and avoiding answering the very simple request for any evidence that for your absurd claim that psychiatric field is being run by religious fundamentalists?
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is it's run by psychotic technocrats who want to involuntarily medicate people, and guess what - unlike you I can back that up with the words of a past president of the American Psychological Association himself

       Psychiatry has the ability to force help on to people, or sectioned people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone we come across in a daily conversation usually can't inflict a section, but even advocating for something like that is fascist.

       There are some rare cases of involuntary commitment happening because of neighbors or strangers starting the process though.  That would fall under the category of "gang stalking" but in some US states like Florida that possibility is there.

       For this and other reasons I distrust a mental health model that is primarily pathology-based, i.e. assuming always that something must be
       <em>
        wrong
       </em>
       . People can certainly be helped, but the system is vulnerable to abuse and witch hunts in the guise of science.

       It's a common trolling insult I see when someone has theories that go against the accepted range of groupthink, "Seek help,", "you're off your meds." It borders on concern trolling, when people condescendingly say, "I'm worried about your mental health," when a poster dares to post their unorthodox theory on whatever that is deemed wrongthink. It's conformity, if not just senseless trolling. People want everyone to conform or they get uncomfortable around a noncomformist or someone trying to be above average. Smart or imaginative people may appear either stupid or crazy to idiots.

       They're a scientologist. I see these idiots in my own city staging small protests every once and awhile against "psychiatry".

      <p>
       I mean, I'm all for banning the practice of putting kids on fucking amphetamines, and a lot of psychotropic drugs do more harm than good. But the whole "Debate Psychiatry" is simply Scientologist recruiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to any scientologists reading, I don't hate you, I just don't respect you. You don't need a "system" or a "religion" to fix yourself or the world. You need the self respect and introspection that ONLY you, can provide to yourself.

       Yeah man. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty anti-psychiatry and anti-psych-medication myself. I just see this sort of thing being used very frequently in Scientology recruiting. Happens in the city I live in frequently. They stage a "protest" on a street corner and pass out fliers, and then when you look into the organization on the pamphlet, it's tied directly to Scientology.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think the one thing I'm against more than "doctors" putting children on prescribed amphetamines is organized religion and money grubbing cults. If you wanna gain spiritual insight, learn to meditate and sit by the river. It's free.

       I agree with child no psychiatry . But what about adults? They also suffer .. about in 30s, 40s, 50s etc.
Or older .
Those who claim about these drugs as neuroprotective  should try on themselves... dont advocate before.. i bet they will reap all the benefits of neuroprotection in as little as 3 months.

       I've been on Lexapro and Wellbutrin for about a year in total, and then made the decision to cold turkey on both of them after I decided to start slowly weening off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I learned that the right diet and lifestyle is the first thing that one should approach differently when undergoing mental instability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about psychiatric medicine is that it does help people. Unfortunately, it also makes people far worse off in their condition. There's no consistent, controlled balance when it comes to medication, like there is for diet or lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who is depressed I recommend going on a whole foods, plant based diet. If you dont already, meditate regularly. There is an app that's on iOS and Android called Insight Timer thats full of free guided meditation. Start excercising too, lifting/boxing have become instrumental in my weekly routune, so try and find something that suits your interests yet also implements a form of cardio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be good to your body. Its the only thing you really can fully control in this life, and the condition of ones body is reflective of ones mind.

       It the same tactics the Soviet Union used. They would just label any dissident they wanted discredited as insane and committed. In the future of 1984 anyone who questions authority or believes in God would be discredited in such a way. Oh and Psychiatry has absolutely nothing to do with Science just read Sigmund Freud to learn what a depraved lunatic he was.

       You work for the privlage of health care?
      </p>
      <p>
       The bit about wesponized health care i agree with in a sense, but a bit diffrent than you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to be clear, you believe that if you are born in the United States, you dont have a right to a flu shot or a yearly check up or medicine for your tumor or birth control or insulin or aids medication or care if your in am accident?
      </p>
      <p>
       Health care is a privilage, not a right?

       Yes health are is a privilage.  That being said, I'm not opposed to government intervention to allow that privilege to people who wouldn't otherwise afford it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just looking at it realistically there is no guarantee anyone will help with health care and it's a privilege that others can chose to extend.

       People are obligated not to hurt you, but no one is obligated to help you.

       I would disagree. If you are privilaged enough to be a doctor, then you are privilaged enough to help everyone. Not just thoes who can afford it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is enough food to feed everyone in the world, we activly choose not to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I like that you are okay with the goverment helping thoes who are needy. So, life goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       My bottom line point is that everyone is better off.in society when everyone has a basic guarantee of shelter, health, and food.

       but who owns the doctor and what he does with his time?
      </p>
      <p>
       A doctor is a human, therefore he owns himself. Therefore nobody but him can decide how he spends it, and nobody but him can mandate that he provide charitable work.

       on the surface it might seem like a reasonable goal, it's less important than freedom, and about half as realistic.

       These are goals that a parent may have for an infant, but not goals that a society must have for each of its members.

       I agree with child no psychiatry . But what about adults? They also suffer .. about in 30s, 40s, 50s etc.
Or older .
Those who claim about these drugs as neuroprotective  should try on themselves... dont advocate before.. i bet they will reap all the benefits of neuroprotection in as little as 3 months.
