       (side note) 
The rest of Eastern Europe
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at it, this is a lot of the world.. essentially everyone outside of the NATO sphere, Israel, SA, South Korea, and Japan are really really pissed. They’ve been shat on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the US was say,
       <em>
        sabotaged from within
       </em>
       , I could see this “Eastern Alliance” taking us down, along with U.K./France.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Germany and India are the swing nations. They could land on either side and they are major players.

       NATO or no NATO, Russia could take Europe down and force their governments to capitulate and make peace using strictly conventional means in any conventional confrontation in a matter of months.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been war-gamed just about every year for the past decade and always with that same conclusion being reached. So it's either a nuclear war or no war if push comes to shove in Europe, which is why the US abandoned the non-proliferation Treaty and is now "sharing" nuclear missiles through NATO and actually has them in several European countries that all agreed to never produce or use them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian nuclear arsenal is as formidable as that of the US and between them they have enough nukes to utterly destroy the entire planet three times over. Meanwhile the Chinese know only too well from as far back as the Pentagon Papers that the US intends to destroy them along with the Russians regardless of whether they're involved or not to ensure that they're not most dominant nation after the US and Russia get done with one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The on-again, off-again, attitude that US displays towards it would hardly change their minds about that or which side they're on no matter how the chips fall. They already have a mutual defence agreement and are solidly backing the Russian position at this juncture because quite frankly there is no other choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of that looks good or bodes well for any sane and reasonable people and unless some fools start something that can't be stopped they'll topple their own governments to prevent it if the potential for it to happen gets much closer than it presently is.

       If Russia tried to invade Western Europe they would get tossed over the Ural Mountains, and Moscow would burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian nuclear arsenal may be huge, but is inferior to the US arsenal in every other way. Nuclear war ends the planet regardless though.

       Yeah, that is a far-right dream. Poland and Ukraine are going to ally with Russia? Nope! Besides, what does Russia and the Intermarium have in your words to make the west "fucked"? Russia has nukes, that's it. That is the only reason that get to claim they're world power like the U.S. and China.

       Think China is going to fight on the side with Russia? China and the U.S. have an economic relationship that both can't afford right now to throw away. What economy does Russia have?

       Russia and China are Military Allies (economics means shit), and Intermarium Countries favor Russia over EU/NATO. Intermarium Countries include: Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Belarus, Ukraine, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.

       When push comes to shove (in this scenario), Germany would join them, as well...

       Do you know how many of the countries you listed are part of NATO? You have no idea what you're talking about.

       Germany will leave NATO. Just Russian dreams you have.

       No countries named Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia, try to open an atlas. And none of the countries listed favour Russia. None. Germany join Russia? Dude, you're high, dumb or wilfully ignorant. You know nothing about european politics, and it obviously shows.

        Międzymorze (known in English as Intermarium, was a plan pursued after World War I by Polish leader Józef Piłsudski for a federation of Central and Eastern European countries. Invited to join the proposed federation were the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia), Finland, Belarus, Ukraine, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.

       The US and Russia and nearly every other nation is in essential agreement on most global issues. There appears to be much jostling over the various factions and cabals and their continued control of the financial and weapons industries.

       War doesn't really exist in that risk sense. Almost all hot wars are last resorts. Almost every nation has been conquered through IMF and world bank. Brics is just the other version of IMF.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only nations that are threats are nations that generate their own source of income. Basically if a country doesn't need the imf then they're a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all countries are running a good form of government outside the control (North Korea and Syria) of the global banking. The mere idea of a country being able to operate in that realm is a grave threat to the order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bolivia just announced they were free from this order. For example a hot war is illogical in this instance. So they fund opposition groups and find other ways around the legit government. Sanctions will begin if a covert operation fails. Bolivia could begin a trend throughout the region and it grows exponentially. That's scary for the bad guys.
