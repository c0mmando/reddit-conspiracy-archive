       Disclaimer: I don’t want to disrespect any religion, any belief, and anyone I just want to point out the flaws in the theory and that how easily this theory can be frabicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lately i have been browsing through the internet and then i found this article about how the world is ending on November 19 2017. At first I was like this is fairly plausible until people started putting religion and astrology into in. Well this year April 18 2018 is the year that people say the world will end. Its April 19 now and nothing has happen. Do you know who was behind both of these phrophecies? A person by the name of David Meade. He said that the lining in the constalation of virgo and the planet jupiter will signalize that the world is gonna end. Well first of all constellations name were made by humans, and the meaning of planets were also made by humans so why does the stars and planets aligning say something.  Also in this theory people said that the voice mail form the military or somethingsaid that aliens will invade which by now we can see them or by now we can detect them. And the most obvious one if planet X is gonna crash into Earth why dont we see it by now since the planet will be larger than the moon and that the Earth will be affected by gravitational pull form planet x. Also why does David Meade sell books instead of giving it for free since the world is gonna end anyways.

       2012 was the end of the Age of Pisces, and we are now in the Age of Aquarius. The world you once knew was destroyed (symbolically, metaphorically, or literally).  The veil is being lifted. Do you want to see or will you cover your eyes? God helps those, who help themselves ;).

       You are in tune with it! Don't reject and/or deny it. Embrace and research
       <em>
        why you feel that way
       </em>
       (truth is stranger than fiction). TPTB want you to bury this internal intuition. It's not for your benefit though,
       <em>
        it's for theirs.
       </em>
       We have crossed over. Now, what do you (we do) about it? Cheers!

       Me too that is the reason i wanted to post this the internet is for people to share and express their ideas to other people. The thing is that i wanted to point out that sometimes dont believe what you see on the internet people can mix two different things together and call it something. I have some crazy ideas of my own too haha maybe i will post some one day.

       Haha I think it's better to be open to everything than to be open to nothing.  That's kind of where I am right now.  If you post a compelling theory and present it well and with at least a couple of pictures I swear you'll have a complete follower for about 10 minutes then I start breaking it down mentally or file it away for later.  That and figuring where all this new stuff fits in with my programming from birth is where I'm at right now.

       You wasted a minute. No man will ever know the day. Unless we can actually see it coming like a huge asteroid but chances are slim we would even see it. Imagine the mass hysteria if word got out too, it would be kept a secret. Live every day to it's fullest because one Texas sized rock would wipe out all life on earth. Luckily Jupiter sucks up most space rocks with its massive gravity.

       Continue on the path your on, you seem to be on the right one. You're in tune, and can sense something is up. Dig into it, and don't be afraid to explore and express to others. Plant seeds, both in you and others.

       You believe that this is mans doing but it's not. It's greed and lust for power that makes the prophecies happen. Imagine playing a puzzle where each door you walk into another shuts. These people truly believe they can be like God. So they will do whatever it takes to fulfill their position in prophecy and also their nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't help themselves. It's like telling a child to stand still. Thus they fulfill prophecy.

       You think that it is in our control but it is not. You see once you take something by blood, the only way to undo it is to take the blood back. Thus, war was destined to come.

       Buncha reasons - I wrote it up before but the biggest one is that it's 7 years prior to the end of Kali Yuga.. and you better belive they're gonna commemorate that. I'll dig back and post the more complete explanation tomorrow.

       People should realize the “end times” propaganda is being
       <em>
        heavily
       </em>
       pushed with all denominations. Everyone is probably aware of how prominent it has become among protestant Christians in the US in these past years... but also realize it is (by definition) the key precept of (theosophic) New Age, and that  Muslims are
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       being bombarded with talk about the “Dajjal”, “Mahdi”, and impending “Yawm al-Qiyāmah”.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even some of the battles in Syria were carried out and timed to match Islamic eschatology. This is why they destroyed Palmyra btw. End-times is central in the Islamic State’s propaganda (and we all know who is behind IS, right?).

       My 2 cents: we are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       about to enter “the end times”, there will however be a monetary &amp; social calamity during which the global central planners will make an important push towards power consolidation. They have an interest in making sure as many people as possible let their guard down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible they are themselves also crazed messianists who are trying to fulfil their pet “prophecy”, force the “coming” of their little “moschiah”, and build their ridiculous “third” temple.
