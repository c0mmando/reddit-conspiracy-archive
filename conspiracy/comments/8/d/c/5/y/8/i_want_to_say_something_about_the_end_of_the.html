<p>So lately i have been browsing through the internet and then i found this article about how the world is ending on November 19 2017. At first I was like this is fairly plausible until people started putting religion and astrology into in. Well this year April 18 2018 is the year that people say the world will end. Its April 19 now and nothing has happen. Do you know who was behind both of these phrophecies? A person by the name of David Meade. He said that the lining in the constalation of virgo and the planet jupiter will signalize that the world is gonna end. Well first of all constellations name were made by humans, and the meaning of planets were also made by humans so why does the stars and planets aligning say something.  Also in this theory people said that the voice mail form the military or somethingsaid that aliens will invade which by now we can see them or by now we can detect them. And the most obvious one if planet X is gonna crash into Earth why dont we see it by now since the planet will be larger than the moon and that the Earth will be affected by gravitational pull form planet x. Also why does David Meade sell books instead of giving it for free since the world is gonna end anyways.</p>

If you post a compelling theory and present it well and with at least a couple of pictures I swear you&#39;ll have a complete follower for about 10 minutes then I start breaking it down mentally or file it away for later.  That and figuring where all this new stuff fits in with my programming from birth is where I&#39;m at right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People should realize the “end times” propaganda is being <em>heavily</em> pushed with all denominations. Everyone is probably aware of how prominent it has become among protestant Christians in the US in these past years... but also realize it is (by definition) the key precept of (theosophic) New Age, and that  Muslims are <em>also</em> being bombarded with talk about the “Dajjal”, “Mahdi”, and impending “Yawm al-Qiyāmah”.</p>

<p>Even some of the battles in Syria were carried out and timed to match Islamic eschatology. This is why they destroyed Palmyra btw. End-times is central in the Islamic State’s propaganda (and we all know who is behind IS, right?). </p>

<p>My 2 cents: we are <em>not</em> about to enter “the end times”, there will however be a monetary &amp; social calamity during which the global central planners will make an important push towards power consolidation. They have an interest in making sure as many people as possible let their guard down.</p>

<p>It is possible they are themselves also crazed messianists who are trying to fulfil their pet “prophecy”, force the “coming” of their little “moschiah”, and build their ridiculous “third” temple.</p>
