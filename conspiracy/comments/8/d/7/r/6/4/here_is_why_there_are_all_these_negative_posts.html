        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Jeff Bezos is the CEO of Amazon, Who also owns the Washington Post. As we know the Washington Post is critical of the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Is it a coincidence Trump calls out amazon on taxes earlier this month? Is it a coincidence they are trying to smear Amazon&#39;s image to hurt their profits? To hurt Jeff Bezos? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s thousands of other shitty corporations out there. Why is this one called out specifically?</p>

<p>Also notice how these posts that come up in certain popular subreddits are posted when it&#39;s late at night in the US? when most people in the US are asleep. When people in the US wake up it&#39;s on the front page. It&#39;s easier to get to the front page at night for this because non-us citizens will upvote it because they are less likely to care about US politics or to be following the inner working of it. Since it reaches the front page in the AM when most people in the US wake up, it&#39;s easier to manipulate people into thinking that amazon is bad. </p>

<p>Pretty clever honestly, but we aren&#39;t that stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you acting as if I support Trump? I don&#39;t which is obvious from my comment history. </p>

<p>Amazon is one of many companies that has been reported on when it comes to how bad they are. They aren&#39;t the only focus of journalists and investigators. </p>

<p>And the person who did this investigation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bloodworth_(journalist">James Bloodworth</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Bloodworth is an English journalist. <strong>A former member of the Trotskyist group Alliance for Workers&#39; Liberty, he edited the left-wing blog Left Foot Forward from 2013 until 2016.</strong> Bloodworth writes a weekly column for the International Business Times and wrote for The Spectator&#39;s Coffee House blog from 2013 to 2015. His work has also appeared in The Guardian, The Independent and The Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>He is the author of The Myth of Meritocracy: Why Working-Class Kids Still Get Working-Class Jobs (Biteback, 2016).</p>

<p>Bloodworth&#39;s latest book is Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain, published by Atlantic Books in March 2018. To research the oppressive conditions faced by those working in low-paid and minimum-wage jobs, the author spent six months doing such work, including as a care worker in Blackpool, an Uber driver and in the UK packaging warehouse of Amazon. The book has been praised &quot;across the political spectrum&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the article, good read. So what do you think would be good legislation to pass or regulations to fix this problem? DO neither because they both are bad right?</p>

<p>Do you actually care about the workers there? or are you just bashing amazon? What would you do to help the workers? </p>

<p>Just bashing amazon kind of proves my point honestly :)</p>
