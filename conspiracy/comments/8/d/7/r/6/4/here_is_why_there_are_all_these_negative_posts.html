       Jeff Bezos is the CEO of Amazon, Who also owns the Washington Post. As we know the Washington Post is critical of the Trump administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it a coincidence Trump calls out amazon on taxes earlier this month? Is it a coincidence they are trying to smear Amazon's image to hurt their profits? To hurt Jeff Bezos? I'm sure there's thousands of other shitty corporations out there. Why is this one called out specifically?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also notice how these posts that come up in certain popular subreddits are posted when it's late at night in the US? when most people in the US are asleep. When people in the US wake up it's on the front page. It's easier to get to the front page at night for this because non-us citizens will upvote it because they are less likely to care about US politics or to be following the inner working of it. Since it reaches the front page in the AM when most people in the US wake up, it's easier to manipulate people into thinking that amazon is bad.

       Pretty clever honestly, but we aren't that stupid.

       Look at my comment history. I'm pretty obviously anti-Trump. But, Amazon is a shit company and has been known as a shitty company to work for quite some time now way before Trump was even running.

      <p>
       People should absolutely know about how shitty they are to their employees.

       That doesn't change anything. My point still stands. It's not hard to find dirt on a company if you look for it.

       I just did. People have been talking about the shittyness of Amazon and how they treat their employees for a long time. Just because it's getting attention again doesn't mean that it was planned to help Trump or something.

       Why is it only amazon? There's thousands of other companies why doesnt he call out all of them. Why not make legislation to help these workers if Trump was so concerned about it :)

       Amazon is one of many companies that has been reported on when it comes to how bad they are. They aren't the only focus of journalists and investigators.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the person who did this investigation is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bloodworth_(journalist">
        James Bloodworth
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        James Bloodworth is an English journalist.
        <strong>
         A former member of the Trotskyist group Alliance for Workers' Liberty, he edited the left-wing blog Left Foot Forward from 2013 until 2016.
        </strong>
        Bloodworth writes a weekly column for the International Business Times and wrote for The Spectator's Coffee House blog from 2013 to 2015. His work has also appeared in The Guardian, The Independent and The Wall Street Journal.
       </p>
       <p>
        He is the author of The Myth of Meritocracy: Why Working-Class Kids Still Get Working-Class Jobs (Biteback, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bloodworth's latest book is Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain, published by Atlantic Books in March 2018. To research the oppressive conditions faced by those working in low-paid and minimum-wage jobs, the author spent six months doing such work, including as a care worker in Blackpool, an Uber driver and in the UK packaging warehouse of Amazon. The book has been praised "across the political spectrum".

       I'm not sure what you mean honestly. People are critical of amazon because of the articles bashing them. Which was likely made to hurt amazon by the trump administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical of wapo is irrelevant here. Like it or hate it, It doesnt matter.
