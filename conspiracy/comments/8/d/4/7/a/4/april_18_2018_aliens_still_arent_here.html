Sorry if it sounds silly it&#39;s just a thought that passed through my mind</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. For all we know those aliens could be once-native proto-humans or another species that developed on Earth or a planet within the sol system. For all we know we ourselves are partially aliens. If they were indeed so advanced as to have mastered genetical engineering and interstellar travel, they wouldn&#39;t need to, nor see any incentive in &quot;invading&quot; or &quot;disclosing&quot; themselves. Lile,, what for? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can only theorize. I do know that the genesis is a Hebrew re-invention of the Sumerian Enuma Elis, and god knows what inspired the Enuma Elis.. and what came before it. Same can be said about revelations. All its implicit meanings are likely lost in time and available to a select few. For all we know.. the aliens about to disclose themselves are also proto-humans who lived on Earth.. or who knows. Perhaps they intend to be foreign occupiers - although I doubt that. We would be extremely inefficient and hard to micromanage as an economic slave species. A foreign occupier would be better off wiping us out via efficient means that dont even require a costly and time consuming physical invasion, and will genetically or mechanically engineer a very energy efficient and capable work force. Plus.. if they intended to rule over us they would have done so by now. Why play politics with local elites who are taking so long to enslave earth under a global regime? I doubt aliens would be that hollywood-ish and dumb. It can be anything, really. I dont know. I can&#39;t know since even if we know everything about the Sumerian times.. we dont know what came even before them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bible is one signal of many. Although as the most widely published book in the world, we should note.</p>

<p>So all over the Old Testament the Lord continually practices human trafficking, genocide, rape, murder, and torture of innocents.</p>

<p>Under most models of the universe I have confidence to be potential candidates for the real thing - I don’t believe such violence should exist and obviously especially not to my own family.</p>

<p>However when we do signals processing (aka general intelligence) we look for patterns. Outliers. Generators. Functors. Theories. Then we try to assign some level of confidence in the signals/models and build up from there.</p>

<p>So and forgive me trying to get an ocean deep here with only a puddle of water, but what if we are not in the real universe, we are in a virtual training simulator constructed in order to “protect” the real Earth universe etc and the only way out is to prove to some unknown force that you have pure love in your heart, that you go out and help people, that you don’t destroy the planet, that you are intelligent enough to see divinity and brave enough to have total convicted faith in that divinity?</p>

<p>Much like a child (universe) must learn to crawl, then to walk, then to run, then to drive his own car first before dad throws the keys and says “Here son, take the Cadillac tonight.” I believe a somewhat close version to this analogy is our truth here.</p>

<p>Something must explain how a loving God exists (which I know to be exactly a true constant) and yet the reason for our planetwide abundance of pain hurt and evil.</p>

<p>So the real bitch of the situation is, this theory I just presented would also be the perfect weaponized falsehood too because you either jump head first into these truths or the beast will eat you alive. There is very very little middle ground.</p>

<p>But long story short.. If you put heartfelt time from your life into the bible and again classify it appropriately given all the other teachings and sibling sources, I believe it would be possible for you to see some new truth as well.</p>

<p>Perhaps our great galactic filter scientists theorize (reason for no aliens yet) is that we all need to read the bible and stand up and say NO FUCKING HUMAN TRAFFICKING and if enough of us do, God puts an end to it? Lets us out.</p>

<p>Its kind of like a 2000 year old version of 5D chess. Multiple layers of allegories, stories, truths/lies etc. and at least one cool thing about life is... the takeaway is free for you to choose, and whatever that choice is, just have the courage to stand up and defend it with your life.</p>

Some are completely out of our hands as well. I used to you all too but after this life I longer do. My own sins were too much to overcome. Good luck.</p>
