       Right, I don't have any proof for this but this dawned on me as I was watching a video about flat earth out of curiosity, I watched a few actually and it was very obvious to me that this whole flat earth society is built on top of space travel doubters, this whole flat earth thing is there to discount the valid doubt about space exploration and weather NASA, Space X and ESA are fakes or not.
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcFLmM9tFIc&amp;amp;t=1s">
        this video
       </a>
       as an example, I understand this is partly a meme, but it's so similar to legit flat earth videos, its basically mocking people who might doubt Nasa or  SpaceX and automatically equates them as flat earth believers.

       I watched a couple of FE videos too and i'm surprised no one else has mentioned this but what if earth is bigger than we are told? Could be that what we see in maps or on the globe is just one half of the earth and on the other could be other land masses that we don't control. That could also explains UFO's

       This is pretty much where I am my friend. I'm still back and forth as far as flat v. sphere (although I lean more flat). However I am fully convinced in my mind that the Earth is much more vast than what we are told. When the ice ring conspiracy theory was presented it sold me. As a child, Antarctica as a land mass never made sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Round or flat, I believe we have our own little world and there are other worlds beyond the bounds  of the rings encasing. And that would explain UFO's. Especially the controversial theory that CIA ops leaked that a species of alien looks just like us and can interbreed with us.

       The only thing all the countries of the world can seem to agree on and never fuck with. Shut off to the public. Yes you can book a trip there but it’s an entire continent. Seeing some designated square miles of the place doesn’t exactly close the book on the conspiracy. Maps also used to show Antarctica iceless and covered in vegetation and wildlife.

       Well here’s the thing, your companies want to make money and keep interest. That means you take people to areas with abundance of wildlife and scenic views. Also it’s not a few miles, cruises go multiple days in the area. Show me the maps you’re talking about, if they’re from millions of years ago then it makes sense.

       That's absolutely a possibility and a potential answer to the most-asked question about flat earth: "Why would they lie? Why would TPTB conspire to fake the size and/or shape of the earth." They could be hiding areas twice or more the size of our known Earth, full of resources and even an elite breakaway civilization complete with the slaves of our untold hundreds of thousands of missing and kidnapped people. That of course would raise questions about cellestial objects and how they'd appear over our portion of the Earth (projections, sun simulators?). Earth could be round, but with no measured curvature, it must be many magnitudes of times bigger than they say.

       Flat Earth being a thing has no bearing on anything.  You can literally make anything 'a thing' but it doesnt change what is true, what can be tested.  Believing in something doesnt make it true.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go book tickets right now to test it.  There isn't some impassable boundary.  Man, questioning the world around you is good but this is not a question.  Its just so verifiably true, how could you even hide something like this?  Where?  And no one has talked or figured it out?  It's just not possible.

       Yes, it works well to make a stink around anyone doubting foundational science or facts taken to be known due to foundational science.  The fraud and fakery you point out is part of it, 
...but,
       <em>
        finishes large bowl of mushrooms
       </em>
       , maybe another part is fraudulence and secrecy about physical theory itself.  The formalism of special relativity initially had roughly two hotly debated interpretations (two types of interpretations).  Einstein's approach supposed the 'least machinery' and did not need to suppose that certain 'ether-frame' exists.  With the 'principle of relativity' that states 'physical laws must the same for all observers, (this includes EM laws that require speed of light to be c)', which should not at this point in reasoning be automatically thought of as 'deep' but importantly as an arbitrary addition, 'ad hoc'.'  The supposition of 'same for all observers' could, logically speaking, NOT be true.  It is not absurd to suppose, at this point in the historical debate, that outside of the causal chain of events we can't possible register/measure that there is a reason for them to change.  The principle of relativity cannot be justified a priori.  The second approach that was rejected is usually named after Lorentz, the person who developed the mathematics of relativity (special relativity of course as well, as this only adds the 'ad hoc' principle of relativity / 'same for all observers').  Lorentz relativity supposed what seems most obvious -- the constant speed of EM waves should be interpreted like the constant speed of many other kinds of waves, as to say it is a disturbance propagating through a medium.  This medium was called 'ether.'  There are ways to model particles as a wave-phenomena within an ether.  These ways to model the particles require enormous computational power due to their lacking certain mathematical niceties that were of course embraced by the first modern physicists.  Our physics has been ontologically blinded by having to be formulated and defined within 'hand-calculable' forms.  ... The strange particles, strong force theory, computers, and accelerators all came along in a short span of time.  At this stage the hand-math based theories were far and away the only reasonable choice, but the possibility of the computer-aided ether-based theory was acted upon as well.  A secret interpretation of physical data was thus born and has been kept and explored by CERN and associates.  The Higgs data might be fake.  The real mechanism of mass might have something to do with wave-dynamics and ether mechanics.  Maybe it implies something radical, like that the ether bits are seemingly engineered in some sense, and perhaps are the elements of a 'computer' or 'mind' of some sort that permits super-luminal causality to a limited extent.  Between the initial severance from EM-medium/ether theory and the CERN/strong force era, Dirac may have perhaps accidentally given the most blinding construction of all with the relativistic quantum wave equation of the electron.  He was amazing to find the equation, and its predictions do work, but with this amazing insight, theory seems to have fully walked into having no clear ontological status.  A superluminal dynamic with ontological real histories of a composite structure works yet flips many basic interpretations on their head.  Is LIGO measuring ether-friction, or GR waves? Did satellites explore super-luminal correlations or simple Bell inequality? Does the cosmic background radiation map show an artifact of Earth's fields or is this a wild statistical fluke?  I would not be surprised if many studies taken to bear upon general relativity have been faked in order to perpetuate the lie.  General relativity has serious problems in dark matter/energy.  The trust in the theory at very large scales in the face of mass/energy discrepancy is at best ad hoc, as it represents the only possible data we have for that scale, and it fails horribly.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe there are many reasons to keep the CERN/fraud rolling. I wonder how many more kilometers of tunnel exist, for what purpose, to where?  We should be allowed to take tours.

       Flat earth is obviously a ridiculous conspiracy theory but some of the "NASA hoax" videos the morons post are pretty compelling. A lot of the stuff filmed inside the ISS does look fake as shit when you look at the specific things they point out.  There really is some damning stuff out there that points to NASA not being fully honest. Why they would fake videos, I have no idea. But they do look fake.

       Troll you? No, I'm not trolling you. God that term annoys me. I am just saying if the morons come up with shit that you find compelling, then they are either not morons or you are closer to the side of the morons than you'd care to admit. Like a closet moron.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have stated they look fake. Of course they do. Why would they look fake if they weren't? Ok. So let's just imagine they are fake. why are they fake? If people start putting things together and connecting shit, they'll inevitably come to some conclusions at some point. Sometimes its wrong, sometimes they get it right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been plenty of legit people getting things wrong. Especially if their initial data or information is invalid. People should be free to try and find their own way or answers with out people calling them morons, especially when they don't trust the group at the circlejerk who came up with the shit that all the other shit is based on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even about flat earth or any other conspiracy but just in general if we only trust the academic scientists to give us answers and we only trust the academic historian to tell us about the past or we only trust the relatively small number of people who actually make it to the end of the course. Then it would surely be easy to control those groups. Especially when most of them are to cowardly to speak up against bullshit in fear of being character assassinated and destroyed or it's so compartmentalized that most people that would know some shit actually don't know shit because they don't have the whole picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       From someone who's up for any possible outcome about anything. Like I entertain as many scenarios as I can come up with. It looks more weird that there's far more people saying the same comment. "it's a psy-op" than there is actually flatearthers pushing theories. especially in this thread.

       You really don't see how morons can be right about specific instances but completely off base from the truth? The conclusion the earth is flat is what makes them morons. Not the evidence itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence shows nasa isnt being truthful. But any airline flight or trip up into the mountains will show you the curviture of the earth. But nasa is lying but we don't know about what. I didnt think this would have to be explained but apparebtly you didnt understand what that other dude was saying

       If they are right about specific instances within their theory. Well you think they are right, as apposed to you think they are wrong. They've gone wrong somewhere, sure. But it was based on truth that you agree with. NASA shit looks fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the people who can't afford a trip into the mountains but think NASA shit looks fake? Let's say NASA shit was fake, It looks fake because it is. What is your explanation as to why its fake?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure their have been legit scientists who have found some truth, ran with it and tried to come up with some conclusions. Which may or may not turn out to be bollocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Haha, the funny thing is, this happens all the time. We believe something for 30 years and then the "experts" are like "yeah, we got that wrong" and y'all just eat it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's people who think its flat because they've seen some shit on YouTube or whatever. Then the other, obviously more predominant group that think its spherical because they were told so in High school. Then there's a group that thinks it's a psy-op because their R/conspiracy buddies told them so. Then there's the people who actually know, for sure. 100% what is it. I'm pretty confident you aren't in that group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll say it again. The sheer amount of people saying pys-op and the level of "Make these people look like idiots" (especially when it makes it to UKs Big brother, even the layout of their lounge was in the flat earth model for fucks sakes!) Looks more weird than the people just trying to find some answers in this mad world.

       I mean if the earth is "flat" why do planets looked at in telescopes appear round to us? Are they all tilted towards us? I ask flat earthers this question and they never appear to have a logical answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, I do  believe operation fish bowl was sketchy as fuck and the whole "no one is allowed on Antarctica" thing is kinda odd as fuck too. It's also weird that the rothchids have a piece of land down there. Those 3 things I believe from flat earthers, the other shit is nonsense.

       That science works the way you say it does, maybe it does in hyper specialized empirical research, but by and large scientism has taken over for actual science. Astronomer's reluctance to modify the standard solar model despite overwhelming evidence showing it's wrong is concerning, and shows that science has become scientism.

       How is a pool table flat when all the balls are round? Objects in the sky don't prove the shape of our land and oceans, especially if gravity forming space balls in a vacuum is a hoax.

       It's a pretty reasonable assumption though. Why would there be a ton of round objects in space, but not Earth? Why don't we see even one single other flat thing out there?

       Flat earthers from what I've gathered believe in a geocentric solar system, i think thats the right word. They take a lot from Old Testament descriptions of the universe, basically saying God made all the planets and stars for us to look at. Hope I got that right anyways.

       Flat earthers will tell you that the object fell to the ground because it is less dense than the air around it but not dense enough to fall through the ground. Take what you will from that.

       I don't have a physics degree so I pass that and ask about satellites. They exist, right? I can see the tiny light of the ISS at night (we all have), BUT...how come we never see other satellites from the ISS livefeed? Go look, you will not find a single other satellite or even 'space junk'.

       That they dont understand density OR gravity. I can place dense metals on my wooden coffee table, and wouldnt expect to have them go through. Major lack of understanding the world they live in.

       Because 1.) they didnt put the ISS right in the middle of a bunch of other debris. 2.) They havent filled up our orbits.... kinda like how an asteroid belt is still very sparsely dense, nothing like what Star Wars would have you believe.

       You arent understand what a tiny tiny tiny tiny fraction the ISS takes up of space, and how, as its the biggest, most expensive, thing where highly trained people live, we dont let anything near it. All the objects in orbit are tiny, and nowhere even
       <em>
        near
       </em>
       the ISS.

       Forget how scary that harmless jackasses like me exist (and exist to gleefully troll you), you should be freaked out by the scary rate that kids are being diagnosed as autistic from the MMR vaccine. I just watched Vaxxed on Amazon prime and I have not been more violently shaken awake since flat earth/nasa/moon stuff. I myself wish peace/love/whatever to everyone and I actually don't like telling FE stuff to people. Y'all mean.

       I watched vaxxed and it changed my mind on stuff. Those kids get problems on day 0 with mmr. That. Day. Ok it isn’t an autism injection, but mmr has a large risk of weird bad shit happening. I ain’t anti-vaxxer either, single dose was what vaxxed says was safer. I’m paraphrasing in layman’s terms. Apologies.

       There's no evidentially and rationally justified reason to be in denial of space exploration. 99 % of the arguments about "fake space travel" are based on childish misconceptions, unrealistic expectations and lack of attention to details, that space agencies themselves reveal.

       It's already supposedly circumnavigating the globe, it's so easy to just stick a camera in the cuppula and watch the earth for 92 minutes and see where it ends up. The fact they don't and every "live" stream has cuts and never shows the dark side means that production is suspect.

       Yes, it's nice to have incontrovertible proof instead of offering precise calculations of hypothetical assumptions. Then people wouldn't argue about it, they'd know for sure, just like no one argues that the sun exists and emits light. Instead all we have is gatekeeping and religious insanity from both sides who think they have things "figured out".
      </p>
      <p>
       It would create more peace on earth to have this proof, and yet they don't. Why because some random jerkoff gatekeeper on the internet thinks people shouldn't know these things? Just believe them because they say so? Fuck that noise, no one is that special.

       I actually work in the space industry, and have some understanding of the complexity of systems involved, tight margins, and huge backlog of undone work.  Most in the industry aren't even barely aware that people want to see a video of ISS going around the earth uninterrupted, let alone have the time to mess around with that bullshit.  The ISS cost hundreds of billions and there is very little time to get much done up there, including science and maintenance, so they must ruthlessly prioritize what they do.  Satisfying some schoolyard challenge posed by uneducated ignorants who don't care much about their work anyway is pretty damn low on the list.

       Alright genius. if we're using CGI to fake the earth, why the fuck would we need the video feed to cut out every once in a while due to loss of signal with ground stations?  Just to seem realistic?  And why couldn't we just make a CGI of an entire rotation of the earth without drop outs to get the cave dwellers off of our asses?

       Fisheye is just wide angle. You would want wide angle to capture as much info as possible.

       I can get you footage of curvature without a fish eye if you would like, youll ignore it but I can provide it.

        I want the non-fish eye footage, so we can all see there's no curvature whatsoever except maybe some atmospheric lensing.

      <p>
       Okay, you can verify it isnt fish eye because it starts off on the ground. Noticeable curvature towards the end.

       There is no observable curvature of the ground, but there is with the atmosphere. Think of it this way, if you've ever been spelunking, and crawled around in pitch blackness with only a head lamp to guide you, your vision doesn't end with flat terminator line, but rather a sphere because photons propagate in all directions.

       Sure you did, I can't watch this fake shit for more than 10 minutes straight, what is really annoying is that you're stuck with this pre-recorded broadcast, you can't rewind like you can with most live streams. I guess they really don't want people analyzing this bullshit. If it's 92 minutes it should be flying into the terminator line in roughly 46 minutes, however this stream never goes to the dark side.

       What? There is no straw man. If the world is the alphabet ABC.....XYZ, and you have one chunk of video ABCDE, another DEF, another FGH..M, and so on and so forth, with overlap you can see the entire planet, in real time if thats what you want. They've already done this and removed the clouds, showing what Earth would look like with zero clouds. It was kinda cool.

       As for "the dark side" - there is no dark side, its constantly rotating. Theres nothing special about it, its the side of the earth (or any body in space) that is facing away from the source of light.

       I believe We (Humans) made it to the moon, but i don't believe that any of them made it back in the 60's/70's. I think we got up there, be it American or Russians first and realised there was no way to get the crew back. So we took in as much information as possible, left them to die and replicated the landing back down on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It explains why the footage is easily picked apart due to wind and different lighting etc but it also covers NASA's arse. Ever notice how NASA doesn't dispute that we GOT TO THE MOON. They never really say if we succesfully made it back or not...

       Don't think they are covering up having never been to space. But I do believe the whole Flat Earth thing is a manufactured campaign to discredit conspiracies relating to NASA and separately Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       There used to be a ton of conspiracy videos on both of these subjects available, then they all were either removed or buried so far that I can't find them anymore, in their place flat earth gibberish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then recently I noticed they started throwing conspiracies relating to Nuclear bombs into the Flat Earth Machine. There's a theory (not saying I believe it) that nuclear bombs aren't as powerful as we've been told. Yet, for some reason I can only find videos on it that are "Flat Earth" videos. I can't even put it together in my head how one has anything to do with the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a label they assign to anything they don't want people looking into or they want you mocked and socially ostracized for looking into.

       Flat earth is clearly just an effort to try to dissuade any criticism of NASA. The moon landings were clearly staged and faked and NASA has been caught altering photos for whatever reason. Kubrick was laughing about it in his films. If a person were to go up into the outer areas of space they would have been fried by radioactive sun storms bouncing off earths ionosphere. We were taught in school that our understanding of the universe was so great that their would be a moon colony by 2020 and mars would just be a leap ahead. Their only argument is that we needed to dream big believe all our scientific community tells us and give a lot more money to the so called underfunded space program while Tesla launches a car with a dummy into mars orbit for pure space theatrics!

       In my opinion it's been pushed and popularised to put all "accepted truths" in the same bracket, when obviously it's entirely absurd compared to most conspiracy theories about JFK, 9/11 or whatever. Most people can see that though, I don't think it's working, except on the most ardent skeptics who worship at the alter of prevailing wisdom.

       It’s not just space travel it’s because of other things as well. Some of which I have yet to see rational answers to.  Gyroscopes. Why do they not move on a rotating earth and how did they work in planes in the 30s let’s say with no gps ?

       The mountain experiment is very interesting and needs an explanation

       Moon landings ?  You’d have to be an idiot to still believe those happened. Footprints on dust with no water indeed ? And that footage of the astronauts faking the earth photos ? That is just amazing how it’s not considered a slam dunk apart from many many many other things wrong with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the ISS. Those videos with the women’s hair are just laughable. And what the hell are they doing floating water around the place with laptops and electrics in plain view ?

       To answer your first point :
      </p>
      <p>
       Gyroscopes don't need GPS to work. All the gyroscope is doing is keeping the 3 axis X,Y and Z in the same 'level' to give the instruments they accurate readings they require while your plane is doing loop-de-loops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gyroscopes do move on a rotating Earth. In fact, some planes that are using mechanical gyroscopes (not laser or fibre optic) have a precession to them and require resetting every so often (approx. 20 minutes from what I've done in the past). This is because the 'point' where the gyroscope started is now behind you. IIRC anyway

       Your wrong about the resetting of gyroscopes every 20 minutes. How does the plane know which way round the earth it’s flying ? It’s entirely possible the plane could be stationary in space yet be traveling at 500 miles an hour around the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no thy don’t show any movement in the rotation of the earth when stationary. Least not from what I’ve seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way that is one of three explanations I’ve heard. Including a gravity locator. And super scientific ones.

       I think you misunderstand the concept. A gyroscope 'locks' into position when it's set. The 'reference point' of which is the Earth when it's in a particular place in space and time. That space and time passes as the Earth rotates so the gyroscope is trying to stay locked into the position that you no longer occupy. If you stand still on Earth, the Earth is still moving and the gyroscope will still topple. At least that's how I've had it explained to me. The 20 minutes example was from a particular mechanical gyroscope fitted to a particular type of aircraft. Of course, these were old fashioned and were replaced with fibre optic and laser gyroscopes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane knows which way round the Earth it's flying due to many inputs going into (usually) the main computer. Pitot-static information, terrain following radar/Doppler instruments, altimeter, compass etc.

       You said the gyroscope adjusted every 20 minutes. That was quite clear. So just think of which way round the earth the plane moves. It’s in space the gyroscope aligns itself as you rightly know. But the plane could be at 90 degrees from its original position after four hours. Or it could in fact not have moved at all.

       Not adjusted, reset. If I said adjusted than that was the wrong word. It had to be reset/realigned.

       The plane isn't important. The gyroscope moves with the Earth

       It can’t that’s the point of the gyroscope. It’s not gravity dependant. Not can it determine where it is in relation to the earth. I’m not being obstructive for the sake of it I just can’t see how that works.

       No accusations of obstructiveness here buddy. I'm not Mr gyroscope 2018. I only won Bronze :( So my understanding is only what has been taught to me a few years ago. I could be and very well probably am, wrong.

       Not saying earth is flat but seeing how they fake everything begs the question of what the real nature of this world is. The iss has provided a lot of fake footage, theres a goldmine of it on youtube. In one video a gentleman goes to round a corner and he basically becomes ethereal before he can fully turn.

       This is pretty much where I am my friend. I'm still back and forth as far as flat v. sphere (although I lean more flat). However I am fully convinced in my mind that the Earth is much more vast than what we are told. When the ice ring conspiracy theory was presented it sold me. As a child, Antarctica as a land mass never made sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Round or flat, I believe we have our own little world and there are other worlds beyond the bounds  of the rings encasing. And that would explain UFO's. Especially the controversial theory that CIA ops leaked that a species of alien looks just like us and can interbreed with us.

       That's absolutely a possibility and a potential answer to the most-asked question about flat earth: "Why would they lie? Why would TPTB conspire to fake the size and/or shape of the earth." They could be hiding areas twice or more the size of our known Earth, full of resources and even an elite breakaway civilization complete with the slaves of our untold hundreds of thousands of missing and kidnapped people. That of course would raise questions about cellestial objects and how they'd appear over our portion of the Earth (projections, sun simulators?). Earth could be round, but with no measured curvature, it must be many magnitudes of times bigger than they say.

       You realize you can fly around the Earth, going the same direction, and arrive at your original destination.  The idea that we are not being shown huge parts of the Earth isn't possible as it's easily disproven by being able to travel as I outlined.

       Troll you? No, I'm not trolling you. God that term annoys me. I am just saying if the morons come up with shit that you find compelling, then they are either not morons or you are closer to the side of the morons than you'd care to admit. Like a closet moron.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have stated they look fake. Of course they do. Why would they look fake if they weren't? Ok. So let's just imagine they are fake. why are they fake? If people start putting things together and connecting shit, they'll inevitably come to some conclusions at some point. Sometimes its wrong, sometimes they get it right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been plenty of legit people getting things wrong. Especially if their initial data or information is invalid. People should be free to try and find their own way or answers with out people calling them morons, especially when they don't trust the group at the circlejerk who came up with the shit that all the other shit is based on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even about flat earth or any other conspiracy but just in general if we only trust the academic scientists to give us answers and we only trust the academic historian to tell us about the past or we only trust the relatively small number of people who actually make it to the end of the course. Then it would surely be easy to control those groups. Especially when most of them are to cowardly to speak up against bullshit in fear of being character assassinated and destroyed or it's so compartmentalized that most people that would know some shit actually don't know shit because they don't have the whole picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       From someone who's up for any possible outcome about anything. Like I entertain as many scenarios as I can come up with. It looks more weird that there's far more people saying the same comment. "it's a psy-op" than there is actually flatearthers pushing theories. especially in this thread.

       Sure you did, I can't watch this fake shit for more than 10 minutes straight, what is really annoying is that you're stuck with this pre-recorded broadcast, you can't rewind like you can with most live streams. I guess they really don't want people analyzing this bullshit. If it's 92 minutes it should be flying into the terminator line in roughly 46 minutes, however this stream never goes to the dark side.

       So far all I've seen is some zero g combustion and zero g water bubbles. Other than that, just some "computers that do science".

       To get a greater field of view, and to emphasize curvature when you want to fool people into thinking the earth is round. Particularly seeing as the space station is not a weather monitoring station and we have dedicated systems for those purposes.
