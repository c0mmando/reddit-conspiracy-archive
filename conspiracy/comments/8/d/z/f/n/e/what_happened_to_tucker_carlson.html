       I have never seen his show during it's air time, nor what would be considered a "fan" of Tucker Carlson, but I have watched a few of his segments on YouTube, including the recent ones about Syria. Certainly he was being more brave than any other talking head television pundit propagandist.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Friday, he's now been off of his own show for three straight nights and nobody's talking about it or asking what's up. You remember when O'Reilly and more recently Laura Ingraham went MIA, it was a big deal. Nothing for Tucker Carlson.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's weird, right?

       Ingraham is back now- she dipped for a week for "Easter" but my guess was the Fox Execs told her to take a whole week off to let the David Hogg stuff pass. Not sure what's up with Carlson but it may be something similar- though not because of David Hogg.

       With O'Reilly it was about sex, so everybody in media talked about it. For Ingraham the issue was rooted in guns and made her look bad, so they wanted to talk about it. With Carlson, he was....telling the truth?

       If you have access to it, re-watch his Monday show. Some other stuff on Tuesday, and similar content last week. If I had to guess, it seems that pressure has come on him to tone down the genuine skeptical journalism. He was asking hard questions and pointing out that the Syria stuff is nonsense and the establishment's push for war is ill-advised. It seems that has maybe irked TPTB and he's been admonished for it.

       an update from the other thread.   In Minute 59 of Friday's show, Kilmeade said Tucker would be back on Monday from a vacation, but 7 seconds later, Kilmeade said about himself that, [quote] "I'll be back on Fox And Friends unless I get suspended" [end quote] -- seemingly hinting that Tucker's "vacation" that began mid-week Tuesday night may have actually been a suspension.

       The reason its not a big topic of discussion here is because the Trump shills need to make sure Fox News doesn't get discredited because they need it for their propaganda.  So its hushed up that Carlson has been shipped off to a reeducation center for saying the wrong thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are underestimating the how effective Trump's online propaganda operation is.

       I wouldn't say its weird.  The MSM is anti truth and a pusher of war.  It fits exactly with their clear agenda.  I am not trying to sound like a know-it-all but this fits with what the media is all about right now.

       I would figure the executives are more worried about litigation than anything. Even a pundit ‘entertainer’ can be held accountable for slander. People like Tucker act like journalists but they are just shilling for ratings. When they say stuff that is unverifiable or unsourced and act like they have ‘protection of the press’ to legitimize their opinion they are vulnerable to lawsuits. Just look at what is happening right now, people selling opinions as fact right now are being sued left and right, pun intended.

       He did not visit the site. He was not allowed into the actual block where it happened. The people he interviewed did not say anything to to support either version of events only that they helped hose off folks that could have been gassed. Maybe they were just panicking or hysterical or they were taking advantage of the attack to run propaganda. In any event it is not support or evidence of anything that someone should trust one way or the other.

       I feel like you're implying that he may not fully believe in the things he reports on, and so that somehow invalidates his show.

       I don't really care if he's a true believer, it literally does not matter to me, I only care that he's one of the only ones in the mainstream bringing these topics to the forefront.

       Ehhh I don't know about that.

      <p>
       Even people that deny the weird things about 9/11 and sheepishly nod to the official narrative can have some great insights into other areas. Noam Chomsky is a good example of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just that things like 9/11 and other similar events are usually too sensitive to talk about. Tucker or others that nod to the official explanations of these events without question may even have private misgivings about them, but they know that speaking about it on air would likely not be the best idea and could truly cost them their job, while having them labeled a "conspiracy theorist", a term brilliantly slided by the CIA that makes you seem like a fool for not bowing down to the government and media's official storyline.

       I've been a bit curious as well. It's been talked about a tiny bit on Reddit, but I'm not social media savvy enough to know if it's been discussed anywhere else. I do believe one of the fill in's mentioned he was on vacation. Wouldn't doubt it had to do with his questioning of the Syria narrative. But I'm under the impression, unclear on why I think this, that he'll be back on Monday. We'll see.

       I’m just seeing too much evidence that this syria attack was a false flag. And when there’s too much evidence, and very convenient evidence at that it makes me start to wonder. That interview on sky news cut short etc. No admiral would voice his own opinion when given the government view on the situation. Small children conveniently filmed saying there was no attack.  I’ve seen the speed the MOD can take down an unwanted photo off social media. Trust me it’s quick and it’s decisive, yet here we are with streams of videos about false attacks etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since being in the uk I don’t know Tucker Carlson. But would he have voiced his opinion without his bosses approval ? And would they have so obviously taken him off air ?  It’s screaming a psy op of sorts. A week ago people on the street were talking about the real possibility of nuclear war, now in RT some Russian ambassador has said there’s 100% chance nuclear war wouldn’t happen and little Kim has decided to not proceed any further with his Nuke plan.  I mean WTF ??  It’s like dating a bipolar person one minute you are fighting next minute it’s as calm as a spring morning.

       It's possible Carlson is totally playing puppet, but I don't want to believe that. As I mentioned elsewhere, he's been totally on board with "Oswald acted alone" and "The 9/11 Official Story looks good to me."
      </p>
      <p>
       But he may also have enough freedom and leeway to get off a couple shows before management puts the hammer down, if he really does doubt the Syria story. As a BUSINESS decision, Carlson is doing his job--replacing Bill O'Reilly with decent ratings, enough to continue to win that time slot among all the 24 hour news networks, even if they aren't as high as O'Reilly's in his prime.

       I do notice the whiplash back and forth to drive Americans to hyperactive levels of anxiety, then reduce, and there certainly could be motivation behind that.

       Basically Cenk Uyger agreeing with Tucker Carlson. If people are watching Tucker on the right and watching Cenk on the left, word is definitely getting around. Hopefully whatever is going on with Tucker will be like the Streisand effect and call more attention to the whores at the top and how they play when making the call for war.

       I agree. I don’t really watch the news on tv much but I’ve seen some of his clips and he often seems pretty level headed. I get that Fox isn’t trusted/popular but they need to work somewhere I guess.

       What we see here is a wild r/politics commenter out of their natural habitat. Watch as they engage haplessly from one bout of opinion to the next regurgitating the same John Oliver audience cackling you hear after a depressing fact about reality is described on the show. Their general inability to process information conflicting with their ideologically fueled presuppositions leaves them unable to blend with their surroundings as they wail into the night sky like a manic wraith, nearly unable to be understood but clearly attempting to make some kind of point.
