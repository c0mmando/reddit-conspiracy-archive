    <div class="md"><p>So humans that are RH negative have no relation to any mammals on earth for this specific test? I have also read that a mismatch of this blood test is the result of many miscarriages in the pregnancy process. IE: one person with RH negative and one person with RH positive cannot breed successfully with one another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the mother&#39;s blood is rh neg and has not mixed with rh pos the first pregnancy is fine as long as there is no trauma but after birth she must get a rhogam shot to avoid a future miscarriage if she gets pregnant again and during the 2nd and ny consecutive pregnancies she has to get hogam at 28 weeks and after those births. Also if she had a miscarriage or an abortion of a baby with a father who has rh pos before she must get a rhogam shot after and then again at 28 weeks during the pregnancy and again after birth to prevent miscarriages. In some cases the baby lives but has problems. I know all of this bc i am rh neg. If the father is rh neg the rhogam shot is not required. Also it is expensive.</p>

A few weeks ago I dreamed I was on a bill board ledge with fortune feimster who i didnt know who that was at the time and she jumped off and landed on the sidewalk below and walked away almost fine. Then a few days later i was watching a tv show where she did the same exact thing but from an apartment balcony and landed the exact same way... i had to look up who she was because i was like who tf is that i just thought she was some random woman in my dream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wife is RH-, I&#39;m RH+.
She never received the Rhogam shot with first child.
When we were pregnant with 2nd child, wife developed antibodies against the developing baby.  The miscarriage can come from the baby&#39;s blood cells being attacked by Mom&#39;s immune system.  We delivered an anemic baby that required a blood transfusion.  The next (unplanned) pregnancy required blood transfusions directly into the umbilical cord a few times during the pregnancy.  Mom&#39;s antibodies were extremely high and the doctors were urging us to abort.  Against all odds, we delivered a healthy baby.  Even the doctors were stunned.  This kid may or may not have developed super powers through this ordeal.</p>
