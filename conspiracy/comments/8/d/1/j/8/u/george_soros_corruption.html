       Yes, it's as conflict of interest. Not only did the judge overseeing Cohen officiate his wedding, her husband is a managing director for the Soros fund.

       That's not what I'm saying at all. And you are significantly downplaying the connections between this Judge, her husband, and Soros. They weren't just "in the same room", she officiate his wedding, and her husband has a stake in his business interests.

       No, I'm really not, you're vastly underplaying it. Soros is a very powerful person, and an outspoken enemy of Trump. This investigation is already highly politicized. Her husband is also connected to Soros' business interests. She should recuse and let another Federal Judge take the case so that the investigation remains impartial.

       You just haven't established any reason for this judge to be recused, it's not even the trial judge she's not establishing guilt just making a ruling on a motion regarding evidence put forth by Cohen team. Officiating a wedding of someone with no connection to Cohen is not a conflict of interest, can you even point to anything in regards to yesterdays hearing that what she did was wrong?

       It's not about what she has done so far- it is about her connections to his political enemies, and her husbands connections to his business interests. She can't be expected to not allow that to color her response from the bench- and is now in an important position in, as I've already said, a highly politicized investigation.

       Like I said to another poster- you should

       That is exactly what federal judges are expected to do. Recusal comes into play if any persons involved in the hearing or case have a conflict of interest with the judge. There are none here and again its just a hearing of a motion regarding evidence, this is not the trial judge. How did you expect this to be ruled? That any judge would allow the defense to determine which evidence against them is admissible or not is asinine. This was a hail mary play from Cohens legal team, what's the real issue?

       How do you not see this as a conflict of interest? I'm not saying that this investigation should stop- but Soros is a highly outspoken political enemy of Trump, and the Judge and her husband have connections to him, both personal and business.

       She has connections to their political enemies, and now is in an important position, which demands impartiality, in an investigation that is already highly politicized. It has everything to do with them. I'm really not sure how people aren't seeing this.

       She has connections to their political enemies, and now is in an important position, which demands impartiality, in an investigation that is already highly politicized. It has everything to do with them. I'm really not sure how people aren't seeing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should want her to recuse herself so that the investigation isn't tainted, and any evidence of wrongdoing is fairly brought to light.

       That is exactly what federal judges are expected to do. Recusal comes into play if any persons involved in the hearing or case have a conflict of interest with the judge. There are none here and again its just a hearing of a motion regarding evidence, this is not the trial judge. How did you expect this to be ruled? That any judge would allow the defense to determine which evidence against them is admissible or not is asinine. This was a hail mary play from Cohens legal team, what's the real issue?

       Nothing to do with the scope of the  investigation with this motion, this was just about evidence that was already  collected

       See, this is complete projection.  Soros isn't Trump's enemy, he a supporter of liberal causes.  Only you folks turn everything the left does into warfare while being the ones actually committing said warfare.  Classic projection that everyone is battling you because you folks are win at all cost sick.
