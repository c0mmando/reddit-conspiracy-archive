       Just curious if anyone has written or thought about this... California's radical liberal worldview is legislated by the government and educated in the school system.  It's so far left, and getting worse, causing even mildly liberal people to want to move to other states... systematically dispersing its worldview to other states that might not be as liberal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could this be a strategy from someone?

       Actually, the majority of Californians leaving seem to mostly be Republican. Getting while the getting's good. Besides SF and LA metro, most of the state is red, including OC and SD. It's Gov. Reagan's amnesty to illegals that flooded the state and flipped it blue, and the illegals and their offspring have been keeping a left majority in the state ever since then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the left goes out and legally/ illegaly votes since there's no ID required, allegedly pay groups to vote for them, multiple times in multiple precints, to stay winning the majority every election year. The whole west coast seems to just accept their fate. Doesn't help the DNC basically promises free money to anyone who votes them in.

       You don't need Cali to be a person who aligns with the Left. Different life experiences and choices will lead someone towards one leaning or another. I was raised in a Conservative household, went to a private school, and now see myself as an Anrcho-syndicalist/socialist and am at odds, politically, with most of my family- tho I do not let this get in the way of our relationships!
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry about California. Worry about demonizing other People because they hold different beliefs, and worry about those who do.

       Here are some things to remember, California delivered Reagan to the nation, and is home to Reps, Issa, Nunes, McCarthey and other notoriously conservative Republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also have a large number of immigrants, legal and non-legal who don't vote but who do have an effect on and about our views of each other and generally we are ok with all this multiculturalism that seems so scary to some.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some will become citizens but I don't know of any predictions they will be liberal. 
I think in California large numbers of the Vietnamese community, formerly refugees and their children are Republican.

       You talk about GOP smear machine, have you not watched the news since the election? Come on, you are not that oblivious to the war of ridicule waged by the left. Small hands (penis size), orange, racist for wanting existing laws and boarders enforced.....
      </p>
      <p>
       And the deep state wars march on. Both sides being played like a bunch of fools.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the left, especially Cali, loves the state. They love the state to direct the lives of the people. They love it when the state expands it's self and it's power over the people. They love when the state entwines it's self in commerce and businesses. They love to have the state censor speech that opposes their ideology.  They are more like Fascists than they understand.

       Our budgets were always pretty tight until the Enron fiasco forced us to buy long term energy deals at above market rates.  Then we got screwed by 2008 which hurt everyone in all 50 states.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've responded to financial crises in the past and quickly recovered.  Just like we did after 2008.  The work Brown has done to address the deficit problems following the 2008 crash, which devastated state income taxes because of the mortgage defaults, is nothing short of miraculous.  When we started stabilizing, we started to put the money back in the areas we had cut from like education and increased the taxes on the wealthy.  The states in surprisingly good fiscal shape compared to many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bay Bridge is one civil project and it really has nothing to do with the argument.  Civil projects in all states frequently cost more than estimated and are completed later than promised.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bullet train project is a multi-decade project and will allow the free flow of labor, especially in the tech industry, to get from San Diego to San Francisco.  Infrastructure projects, while expensive, are the best return on investment for taxpayer dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       CA has a robust economy and the government has a large part in maintaining that climate.  We have the best schools west of the Mississippi, including our state run universities, turning out graduates that start businesses in the medical, entertainment and high tech industries.  We are the hub of the aerospace and defense, entertainment, technology, biotech, medical devices, textile and agriculture industries.  We have the highest GDP and property values in the nation.  Our government creates a climate that makes people want to live here and own property, raise and educate their children and then start businesses.  That might because our government regulates and allocates money for the things that matter to its citizens like clean air and water, education funding, property rights, infrastructure and other things we realize contributes to our overall success.  We're not myopic by nature, we see the bigger picture, maybe because we're building the future and exporting culture to the rest of America.

        The Golden State continues to rank No. 1 as the state that has waved goodbye to more residents, about 143,000 last year, than welcomed those who have moved here, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report.
       </p>
       <p>
        And despite the state losing 3.5 million people to other states from 2010 to 2015, many demographic experts said there is no mass exodus from California.

       Truthfully that's a byproduct of our success.  Because of all the high paying jobs pushing the land value, rents and cost of living up, it shakes out people with low wage skills or commodity businesses with low margin goods and foreign competitors.

       We've also been working on addressing those issues.  There are multiple bills addressing affordable housing, the homelessness problem and no-cost access to education for job retraining.

       The Bay Bridge cost over $6billion (vs the $1b original estimate) and ran over 10 years late.
      </p>
      <p>
       The train from Madeira to Fresno (the only part of the HSR under way) is already twice as expensive as advertised and has been held up in court because the Gov’s office tried to illegally bypass environmental protection studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post-2008 housing crisis funds were illegally (according to the judge who heard the case) diverted from forclosure relief programs to the general fund to the tune of over $300 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bring these examples up to point out the LACK of financial responsibility in CA government. Consistently low-balling taxpayer funded projects of that magnitude is not in any way “fiscally conservative.”  That is my point.

       California subsidizes other states. We pay more per capita in federal revenues and take less. It's the red states (other than Texas of course) that are freeloading. We pay more than our share. Leaching off of the economic success of other is something conservatives rail against, but that's exactly what they are doing to California and the ingenuity of its workforce and entrepreneurship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, the bay bridge is 1000x better looking than the original plan, and is engineer d to last 150 years. It's an American marvel. And 70% of the costs are covered by affordable tolls. We upgraded our goals. We deserve it.

       California subsidizes other states. We pay more per capita in federal revenues and take less. It's the red states (other than Texas of course) that are freeloading. We pay more than our share. Leaching off of the economic success of other is something conservatives rail against, but that's exactly what they are doing to California and the ingenuity of its workforce and entrepreneurship.

       Btw, the bay bridge is 1000x better looking than the original plan, and is engineer d to last 150 years. It's an American marvel. And 70% of the costs are covered by affordable tolls. We upgraded our goals. We deserve it.
