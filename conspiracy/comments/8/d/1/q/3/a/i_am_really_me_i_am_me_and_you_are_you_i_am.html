You are you. Im really here. All my experiences put me here today. I am me. I can move my fingers. I am me.&quot; </p>

<p>I couldnt think about this for longer than a minute or two. My heart would race. It felt like it would skip a beat and it threw my mind off and I had to stop thinking about it. But now when I try to think about this, and get the same reaction, I cant. I used to be able to do &quot;this&quot; all the time as a kid and now I can&#39;t. Did they update the simulation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I experienced the same thing! Often through staring at my reflection in the mirror.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an &quot;update to the simulation&quot; as much as it is the maturation process of our brain and our own self perception. When children, this thought is a novel one, and upon realizing it we must internalize it. After a while, we <em>do</em> internalize it, and it becomes less &quot;special&quot; because it is something our mind now comprehends on a fundamental level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First you need to define what &quot;you&quot; is. That is the key to everything. Are your memories stored in your brain? What about your heart as many ancient traditions teach? What is consciousness? What does it mean to be conscious? Does your brain create it? Does your brain simply allow a universal consciousness to interact with this reality? Is your brain more of a receiver than a generator of consciousness? Here&#39;s a quick little thought experiment....what if you didn&#39;t have a name? Didn&#39;t know your parents? How would you define self? </p>
