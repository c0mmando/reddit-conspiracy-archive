        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Google, Facebook and Amazon have denied using data coming from private conversations, but pay attention to their exact words. They always says they do not use &quot;recordings&quot; (which does not include real-time keyword recognition) or they specify that &quot;we&quot; do not use voice data (which does not mean that the third parties who contribute to their apps do not use voice data).</p>

<p>I believe they (and probably others) ask third parties to write part of their apps with a wink and a nod, then very intently look the other way, allowing them to say with a straight face that &quot;we&quot; do not use the microphone for targeted advertisements.</p>

<p>Have you ever looked at the third party licensing notices in some of your apps? For example, in the Amazon Shopping app, some third party code is licensed under the MIT license. Here it is in its entirety:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get Facebook, Google and Amazon to deny that their apps use keyword recognition on private conversations, regardless of who wrote the code, but they are refusing to answer.</p>

<p>Please find attached a file documenting how I came to that conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So get this.... I saw a post on Imgur about a dude trying to hire folks for general contracting for anyone who needs a job. I thought it was neat, so I Direct messaged him in the app to say &quot;good job internet citizen&quot; we had a quick back amd forth exhanging pleasantries and he sent me his email address and said if you ever want a weekend gig semd an email. I did not reply with my contact info bc scary internet and I have a random account tied to imgur not my gmail. </p>

<p>So pleasant convo ends, sick of reposts, open Reddit. I shit you not the very first ad i see is for General Contractor&#39;s Union is hiring in your area!!! Nothing is sacred my friends not even the holy grail, Imgur. Its all the same. Dammit. Its all facebookoogle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt that it was Imgur. It could be a keyboard app doing it. But it&#39;s more likely to be Android or iOS itself.</p>

<p>Both have kernel modules/extensions that automate input priority and access, so that various input methods can switch seamlessly, like secure PIN entry, changing virtual keyboards on the fly, bluetooth keyboards, etc. It&#39;s the same thing as a filter driver on Windows, which is the method used by a lot of malware keyloggers.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt that Google and Apple put the input stream through a keyword match and sneak it back to them as telemetry data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because that&#39;s just how the internet is now. If you don&#39;t have adblockers and stuff to prevent it, everything you do is being tracked and tied to you.</p>

<p>When you visit a website that uses Google Analytics, for example, it will use the site you are visiting to determine what you&#39;re interested. Whoever advertises on the Google ad network can target people using the data Google collects. It&#39;s just how internet ads work. So because you read something about general contracting, it was tracked by Google or another ad service, then the advertiser was able to show you an ad for contracting.</p>

<p>Facebook is the same way. Any website you go to even with the simple Like button tracks you... By embedding the Like button on a site, that&#39;s also embedding Facebook&#39;s code that tracks users.</p>

Maybe a few years ago, people would&#39;ve cared, but now they&#39;re just resigned. it seems we&#39;re like the frogs in boiling water: we let our privacy get eroded over years and decades, and now we&#39;d rather just deal with the heat than jump out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People just have to be smart about using devices like this. </p>

<p>I have a ton of smart home stuff, including several Google homes scattered around my house. The actual smart devices are insanely handy and fun to use - lights turning on at night when I open a door, coffee pot turning on when my alarm goes off, etc. The voice assistants are great for interacting with everything without having to move or touch anything. As lazy as that sounds, it&#39;s amazing how effortless it makes little tasks. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m also smart about it. I have all of my Google homes plugged into smart outlets. If I want to shut them off, I literally just have to tell them to turn the outlets off and the power will be cut to them until I turn the outlets back on from my phone. </p>

<p>I leave them on most of the time, because convenience, but shut them off while I&#39;m sleeping and while I&#39;m on work calls.</p>

<p>Just assume that anything that is technically possible is probably happening.</p>

<p>A buddy of mine got into an argument about a decade ago about the new NSA facility and their ability to store and record every text, call, email, etc.</p>

<p>His logic was that the technical capacity to store the data didn&#39;t exist which made it impossible. Not only was that wrong, but it was woefully incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that they&#39;re doing it or not. They are doing it. If they didn&#39;t, they would not have the data to train their AI. I used to work on the cortana AI back when it was used for winphone and Xbox Kinect. It was always recording/overwriting like a security camera and starts saving when it hears specific keywords. For Xbox it was something like &quot;go Xbox&quot; that I had records for but you could theoretically put anything you want as the keyword. Like &quot;I should buy x&quot; or &quot;I like y&quot; or &quot;I need z&quot;.</p>

<p>Basically there is no doubt it&#39;s always listening/recording because you need it to do that to be able to record from the beginning of the command and to be able to train the AI. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always listening with a buffer of several seconds, but only sending recordings to the provider when it hears activation words. What they do with what is sent to the provider depends on what you agreed to.</p>

<p>Apple have one of the better privacy policies afaik, they don&#39;t even use recordings to improve their service unless you opt-in - then do so but it&#39;s anonymized and used just for that. Whereas with both Google and Amazon you can actually go and listen to the recordings stored in your account! But I don&#39;t know what else either of them do as I don&#39;t use their products, they may well use it to better personalise ads and suggest purchases.</p>

<p>There are thousands of security researchers who scrutinise these things like crazy. So if they were recording everything all the time or sending that off we&#39;d know all about it. People just refuse to accept both confirmation bias and how frighteningly good they are at tracking us already.</p>

<p>Although every device you have with a mic/camera can potentially be exploited, affected by malware or doing things you&#39;re not aware of. Best to be educated and aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, &quot;anonymized&quot; by that they mean they don&#39;t put your name/account next to it. But they put your location, time, date, language and anonymous &quot;ID&quot; in there. Plus, whatever you say or write isn&#39;t anonymized, they take it as is. At least MS does and I&#39;m sure they all do since it would be stupid amount of work to remove that data and to do it automatically, again, you need to have trained with actual data.. So for me, I knew about some people&#39;s affair, their name, which hotel they met. Some German guy asking his girlfriend in marriage over SMS. Some guy trying toake the gps work to go somewhere that I definitely can hear him say about 14 times, kids recordings (way under 13, not even sure that&#39;s legal), etc, etc. And this is what I had access, as a low level anotator working for a Microsoft contractor, 6 years ago.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine what they have now. Actually I ca and its fucking scary.</p>

<p>You know the most scary thing is actually about what defines anonymity legally Vs what is anonymous for an AI. Those aren&#39;t the same, they overlap and that&#39;s right where they want to be. &quot;anonymous&quot; while being able to get everything they want from you. Everything. Your mood, thoughts, deepest fears, all meta-tagged. It would be fine if it was just to sell you stuff, but the end goal is much more nefarious. </p>

<p>Anyway, the way I look at it is that they&#39;re constantly filming and recording audio, but they don&#39;t actually browse the files unless they need to. OR they don&#39;t browse at all, and just sell the data to FBI/LE when or if they need it.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m not okay with it. Nobody should be, but like my cousin, he always just makes a joke of it and doesn&#39;t seem to mind at all.

When you ask Apple/google you have to phrase it, “is my phone listening to me?”... “am I being served adds based on my private conversations” (obviously we are, it happened to me about 5-6 times in a single day..)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not possible for all cellphones to always be recording and transmitting from their microphones and cameras. That&#39;s far too much data being sent, far too much data that needs to be processed, and would eat up far too much battery life.</p>

<p>They are gathering data on you and from your friends. What they are doing is actually more insidious than just recording the cameras and microphones.</p>

<p>There are some individuals out there who have their devices targeted to be used to gather audio/video, but this is not for the purposes of advertising and such, that&#39;s at corporate/government espionage level.</p>

<p>What&#39;s scarier is that they can get enough data to make it seem like they are always recording simply by correlating your location, those near by you, search terms, etc..</p>
