       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       </a>
       users are increasingly aware that this sub is under attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain obsessive hate subs have been emboldened by the apathy of the reddit admins, and the brigading of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       posts is now the rule and not the exception. It's also becoming apparent that much of this activity is now originating from outside reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The battlefield has evolved, and we need to evolve with it lest we get left behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, despite the political world being chock to the brim with conspiracies, apparently they are attempting to craft the narrative that only
       <em>
        certain
       </em>
       ones should be entertained by
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, take this thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8i1a5c/att_confirms_it_paid_trump_lawyer_michael_cohen/">
        AT&amp;T confirms it paid Trump lawyer Michael Cohen $200,000 for 'insights' on administration.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the discrepancy between the top voted comments and the buried comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top comments, despite some receiving
       <em>
        hundreds
       </em>
       of upvotes, are "complaining" about meta bullshit, maligning
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and generally adding nothing constructive whatsoever to the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also patterns to be noted among those users...many of them are either non-
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       regulars, or
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       participate on certain topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       To find the regular
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users ITT, one has to scroll to the bottom to the comment graveyard (numerous comments downvoted to the negative).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the interesting thing is that these political threads are the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       ones that
       <em>
        consistently
       </em>
       show such a large comment karma discrepancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comments that attack this sub receive hundreds of upvotes, and comments that defend it are significantly downvoted to the negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, much of this is due to the high volume of traffic
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       receives from the rest of reddit when these political conspiracies are trending.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the amount of recycled taking points and voting patterns are indicative of a larger agenda to disrupt and misinform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, notice what happens when a political conspiracy (also from a MSM source!) is posted that goes
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take this recent story from the WSJ:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8innvm/about_that_fbi_source_did_the_bureau_engage_in/">
        https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8innvm/about_that_fbi_source_did_the_bureau_engage_in/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ...as well as this analysis of the story:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8inp9p/fbi_allegedly_hid_a_mole_in_the_trump_campaign_i/">
        FBI Allegedly Hid a Mole in the Trump Campaign: "I believe I know the name of the informant, but my intelligence sources did not provide it to me and refuse to confirm it. It would therefore be irresponsible to publish it."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the veracity of this claim,
       <em>
        this is a conspiracy theory
       </em>
       and it
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       deserved to be discussed on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice which comments in those two threads received the upvotes...it should be very telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, the disruptors of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       have deemed this to be an unacceptable conspiracy theory, despite being from the MSM, as the comments were lambasting the reporter for offering "speculation as evidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you spot the hypocrisy?
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been given so much grief for not thoroughly embracing the Russia Collusion conspiracy theory,
       <em>
        which is based on speculation
       </em>
       , but when evidence emerges that corroborates the alleged criminality of the FBI, we have to dismiss it because it's speculation!
      </p>
      <p>
       What should we do about this blatant manipulation?
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, don't fall for it! Learn to spot their tactics, and most importantly, call them out (rationally and politely)!
      </p>
      <p>
       The more genuine users engage and the less effective these destructive tactics become.
      </p>
      <p>
       And pay attention to which subjects are attacked the most...
       <em>
        these
       </em>
       are the ones we should be paying attention to. Ironically, they reveal this to us with their increasingly impotent attempts at censorship.
      </p>

       Agreed. I upvoted you in a +12 Axol and 0 you.  Interesting where it ends up. The dynamics here are so out of whack - we have triple-reverse psychology coming out our noses! Hence nobody knows who the real culprit is, and that's how they want to keep it!

       Wow, if the post really was removed in 20 minutes that is some damning evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although that isn't the only thing we should be talking about in that post. I suspect that won't want to be discussed.

      <p>
       Even if some of the people commenting in the thread are TMOR, which your fellow mod just accused them of, make good points. I've seen people say what's the big deal if Russian ads were anti Syrian war. Thanks Putin!

       The link is crazy bad and people are defending it to the death in a thread that should have died. Seems like organized faction war to me tbh.

       in that post that needed to be discussed because it was posted by a bot and was X-posted and brigaded. As far as "accusations" of it being TMoR, go look at their histories.

       Exactly. We aren't worried that bots are posting pro-Trump propaganda? We are more worried about the people posting to shit on said "bot?"And then shit on the people who blatantly defend it for partisan reasons.

       We have safeties in place to take care of bots, namely Rule 13 and the bot that removed the post. After that, the bot was banned.

       The spam filter didn't like the link in OPs SS so it stopped the SS from showing up in the thread but it still registered as a comment so it didn't trigger the Rule 13 bot. Tbf, I don't care for the link, either, I'm just quickly demonstrating for you that there
       <em>
        was

       an SS, it was just hidden from view outside of the mods.

       It's wasn't just a few months ago. This sub was left fairly left alone until November 2016 - and since then it's been a constant uptick in shills and shitposts until now where this sub isn't even comparable to what it once was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is what caused the uptick? What caused the 'fake news' brigade? I'all give you a hint: it wasn't Trump winning the election. Those who remember know what I am talking about.

       If you can turn on virtually any news station and hear your "conspiracy theory" being talked about, it's not a real conspiracy theory.

       has been a great sub because it covers news that the mainstream and government-funded media

       cover. This is serious stuff that might actually be kept under wraps. It's not the propaganda that CNN, MSNBC, NPR et al are pandering 24/7.

       "We've been given so much grief for not thoroughly embracing the Russia Collusion conspiracy"  The same can be said for fellow users who feel that there is something to the russia conspiracy. To imply that "real users" are the ones heavily down voted is bullshit. There are over half a million users on this sub that all have different opinions. Your constant attempts to paint users that disagree with your view on conspiracies as shills or not "real conspiracy theorists" is a conspiracy in itself to push a narrative.

       There are at best a few thousand real live humans that actively participate at any given time. Unless of course there's a big bot brigade push. Then you'll see 5,000+ users mostly bots and alts and you'll see them push some shit. The regulars know their patterns too well already, nice try though.

       Idk why it's so hard to believe he legit won. All people seem to have is a feeling it was unfair and cling to any excuse that justifies the unfairness. He won. Get out of your liberal echo chamber and interact with average Americans. They are not a bunch of racists, they're often goal oriented family oriented and voted for him for what they saw as economic security. Many have no regrets.

       Donald Trump did not win legitimately. Even without "the Russia thing," Republicans did everything they could to cheat in elections. They shut down the Voting Rights Act 5-4 in 2013. of Republicans with the VRA gone. They permitted secret "proprietary" corporations to count our votes unchecked by a paper trail, but suspiciously in defiance of exit polls. As the era of electronic voting came into play, the official vote total came to "red shift" against the exit polls, hitting a whopping four percent by 2006. The Kris Kobach CrossCheck system purged hundreds of thousands of voters in each of the swing states.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Donald Trump and Republicans stole the election, and all we hear is "Hillary stole the primaries." The simple fact that we hear one and not the other should tell us who has the greater control of our entire information stream. Yes, the Democrats gamed the primaries toward HRC, but she did not steal it -- you might want to look at "liberal" MSM for helping moderate Hillary beat progressive Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the Democratic primaries, where people say Hillary stole the nomination, there was what we might call "red shift" toward Hillary -- but the shift occurred in primaries where Republicans controlled the voting apparatus -- and not in caucuses where the Democratic Party controlled the count.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2016 in Ohio, hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the voter rolls for simply not voting for a few years. This case is at the Supreme Court right now.

       It's politics. The concept of a 'legitimate win' is a laughable waste of discussion. Both sides push every law and loop hole as far as possible to win. Both sides play dirty. Both sides are the same. We get to hear the "left" complain that Trump stole the election. Prior we had to listen to the "right" complain Obama stole it. Before that we had to listen to how W stole it. Get over the naive idealism and open your eyes to the fact that nice people don't run the world. I doubt there has been a "legitimate" candidate during my lifetime. I would love to be less cynical however all the evidence points the same way.

       You know what's naive? This ridiculous notion that all human beings with power are exactly the same. We learn in pre-school that all people are different. We can look at our own families and see that up close. We can also look at history and see times of progress and times of reversion. IF TPTB had total control of everyone, we would already have lost every last bit of freedom a long time ago. This is simple stuff.

       It's ridiculous to think similar types of people are attracted to certain jobs? I didn't mean to imply they are exactly the same however they do share certain qualities like the desire for power. I don't think there's a group with total control, but there are groups who attempt to steer the masses toward their own views. If I had the means I would certainly try to push society towards my vision of what's 'right'. My view on 'right' would be met with people saying my vision is wrong. You can't escape human nature and you can't please everyone. Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as my point on peoples complaints about elections it was a lazy summary of what I've seen and heard from others, you're right. I don't believe we've had a legit POTUS since Kennedy, but it's a semantics argument about what the term 'legit' means. I think American politics are ugly and uninteresting because there's a severe lack of justice involved but the wider my horizon gets the more I see it's a world wide problem.

       No, this is a problem in nature, so I agree here. However, there are enough differences though to make choices that bend the paradigm. Over time it bends quite a bit.

       I am fine with everything else you said including the difficulties in determining what is "legitimate." I'd say a few presidents have been legitimate since JFK.

       I hope some of them have been legitimate haha I've just grown so cynical to the whole dog and pony show. I get your perspective in that around the world people with power are definitely different, but I would argue it's their context that makes them different. Running for POTUS is an awful gauntlet that only certain personality types would view as desirable so that automatically narrows the field. Much like how currently the average CEO checks many of the boxes for

       For rulers who are born into their position they have a greater chance to have a different personality type and I think the only real chance for the theoretical "Good King". However "good" is always subjective so perhaps it's a pipe dream to think it could happen.

       Also american citizens get involved in "political and social issues" in other countries all the time.  There are hundreds of NGOs that do this.

       Hillary spent 7 million dollars on a paid army of Trolls.  R/politics is all DNC trolls.  She had over a BILLION DOLLARS in her warchest. 
She had nearly every major TV and print media outlet behind her.  She had celebrities, 99% of Democrats and former Democrats and even some Republicans endorsing her.

       I would define "involvement" as organized, paid groups spreading disinformation and providing financial support. The link you provided also shows that happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wether it actually swayed the election is impossible to really say but with a victory margin of 60,000 votes it wouldn't take that much. The amount of influence they had is irrelevant.  What's important is what we can do to minimize it in the future.

       Hiring companies to work on your campaign is expected and legal.

       Having foreign companies donate undisclosed campaign resources to pretend to be other Americans is not expected or legal.

       Lol no I for sure didn't admit "Russiagate" happened.  I HAVE admitted I wouldn't care though since there is no difference between what they did and what those backing Hillary Clinton did other than the fact that Hillary did it far, far, FAR more than them.

       It's legal for Americans to participate in their own elections. It's hard to take you seriously if you're going to pretend to be this dumb. Trump is a wannabe Oligarch himself so don't pretend he was a victory for the common man.

       Donna Brazile explained it very clearly in her book.  Wikileaks as well.  She was in complete control of the DNC leadership and finances during the entire primary and used her influence to rig the contest against Bernie Sanders.  The NY department of elections (the state she represented as a senator) illegally purged 200k legitimate voters from their rolls.  (Nobody was charged with a crime for that by the way) She colluded with the media for favorable stories and coverage.  She cheated in the debates multiple times with help from Donna Brazile/CNN.

       I see so you don't think Clinton's allies did anything wrong by spending 7 million on professional trolls attack people online and spread disinformation.  Your position must therefore be that the Russian Trolls didn't actually do anything wrong either...its just the fact that they did it while being "Russian" that you object to.

       It's obvious you can't discuss this stuff in good faith. I'm tired of being misquoted and you acting dumb and having to call you out on it. I'm not a Clinton supporter and your whataboutism is annoyingly endless.

       Trump is the piece of shit in charge and if he had any balls they would be going after Clinton.

       I dunno.  The only people who use the term "Whataboutism" are Clinton/DNC trolls.  Literally nobody else uses the term because they understand that hypocrisy and doublestandards are a real phenomenon.

       You simply don't want to admit that what the Clintons and the DNC was actually far far FAR worse than what you claim these 'Russians" did and therefore the entire "Russiagate" story is nothing more than a distraction from the real problem...massive corruption in the Democratic Party and rigging of our elections by wealthy Americans.

       No self respecting American would be happy or “not care” that a foreign adversary manipulated their democratic process for their own gain, at the expense of the US.

       It’s illegal because foreigners shouldn’t have the ability to influence an election. Why can’t you understand this? Foreigners aren’t citizens and have no right to the democratic process. Russia is an enemy, they don’t want to help you. They want to help themselves.

       No evidence that happened.  So far there's been some indictments of 13 twitter trolls employed by an advertising firm that spent about 100k in ads, most of which aired after the election.  Meanwhile Hillary spent 7 million on a paid army of trolls called Correct the Record.  Well documented.

       you will see that relations were strained during the Bush admin and that Obama’s tried to “reset” relations. Ultimately, they always remained an adversary and invaded Georgia under Bush and annexed The Ukraine under Obama. Both sanctioned Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also a long time adversary who were powerless during the 90’s because they collapsed. They have regained strength now.  It’s disingenuous to say they are/were no longer an adversary.

       Oh so there aim wasn't to help Trump now?  I thought Trump was "colluding" with Russia?

       So let me get this straight. You’re a progressive, who is bitter Bernie lost the democrat nomination even though he has always been an independent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, you spend all your time shitposting about the DNC, Hilary and Democrats in general. Going so far as to support Russian meddling and say you wouldn’t care if it was proved with evidence. I’m assuming that’s because they “uncovered the truth about the DNC”.
      </p>
      <p>
       All while failing to understand that by selectively hacking and releasing DNC emails Russia meddled at the highest level and completely owned your political thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       You decry Hilary and the Democrats as evil “moderate conservatives”. Yet fail to say anything negative about the party who are simply, conservative. Weird for a progressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow. Your gymnastics, it’s phenomenal. I give you a 10. Good day.

       1 - Bernie didnt lose the primary.  He was cheated.  That is a fact beyond dispute.  His precious party affiliation is irrelevant.  If Dems didnt want him why let him run as one?  They wanted to sabotage his candidacy obviously and they succeeded.  Now we have Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - you are totally correct that Im happy whomever it was stole/leaked the dnc emails and you should be too if you actually care about Democracy and this country.  His name was serh rich by the way.  Not Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       3- I attack the gop every day but they are not the greatest threat to Progressive policies.  The DNC is the true enemy.  We cannot have two corporate owned parties in charge of everything.

       You just can’t see that Russia hacking Hilary’s emails was them influencing the election. You can’t see that they selectively hacked it to manipulate people who hold your political persuasion. It clearly worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had they hacked both candidates, it would simply be known as an attack by everyone. But by hacking one side they were very smart about it. They turned one side on itself, and united the opposition even further.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just don’t want to believe that you could be manipulated. I get it.

       Spamming links without any quotes and expecting somebody to read through them all is a common troll tactic so I'm obviously not going to waste my time.  I'll let former FBI Director James Comey destroy the Russian Hacking theory for you himself:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The FBI requested direct access to the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) hacked computer servers but was denied, Director James Comey told lawmakers on Tuesday.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        We’d always prefer to have access hands-on ourselves if that’s possible,” Comey said, noting that he didn’t know why the DNC rebuffed the FBI’s request.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI Director James Comey, testifying under oath to Congress on 01/10/17
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/313555-comey-fbi-did-request-access-to-hacked-dnc-servers">
        http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/313555-comey-fbi-did-request-access-to-hacked-dnc-servers
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So as you can see there is absolutely zero evidence that the DNC server was hacked , that anything was stolen or that Russia was responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry buddy.  You're gonna have to peddle your BS elsewhere.

       Well maybe you should do some broader reading.

       You are asserting all the intelligence agencies, and the very recent senate intelligence committee are all wrong in their findings. And you, AdSin15, know better than them?

       You cannot be reasoned with. It doesn’t matter to you anyway, because you have stated you are  HAPPY Russia meddled. And presumably want to give them some sort of honour for their clear intent to simply help the American people /s

I am very happy Seth Rich gave his life so that the whole country could see the truth about they Democratic Party and how they hate the voters and rig the primaries.

       Lol. You’re the one that made this about the losing party cheating in a privately run primary. I’m giving you the facts. I was pointing out the ridiculousness of you being happy about Russia meddling and supporting it. I can’t keep telling you the same thing without you taking it in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was selectively leaked by Russia. If Russia had hacked both sides and released both sides this would be an outright attack and also meddling. By only hacking one side this is simply manipulation of the populace for THIER desired result. Ie meddling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway from what I can see, pretty much everything you say is Fox News talking points, wrapped up in an “I’m actually a progressive” point of view. It was a nice back and forth, but you just won’t accept facts or reason. So I’m gonna have to leave it here.

       You’re making it about election fraud, when FYI the primary is not an election for a gov position. I’ve stated it multiple times. Bernie, an independent, is/was free to run as an independent, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you support Russian aggression? Why do you believe Russian propaganda? Why do you not believe the bi-partisan Senate intelligence committee? why don’t you believe the intelligence agencies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is everything you say Fox News talking points wrapped up in some BS progressive perspective. How can a real progressive actually believe the Democrats are the real problem in Congress after all the votes this year?
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound like propaganda.

       So why are you totally ok with the DNC lying directly to your face and rigging the primary?
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary is a government run election paid for by the U.S. Government.  Bernie was allowed to run in the primary.  If the DNC didn't want him to run they could have simply not let him run right?
      </p>
      <p>
       They allowed him to run as a dem  specifically so they could cheat him and knock him out of the race.  They feared him running as an independent.  They were afraid he would win and they needed to ensure he lost.  They lied to the american people and claimed the primary was fair bit of wasnt.  It was a sham.  Democrats are a sham party and the leak of the DNC emails showed us that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats are rhe problem bc they are owned by the rich and they help trump all the time.  They helped him pass the military budget and his tax cuts for the rich.  They helped Gina Haspel bc cia director. They gave have trump unlimited spy power.  Democrats are faux opposition.  They do the bidding of the rich and powerful and screw the american people all the time.
       <br/>
       Democrats are the enemy bc they literally oppose every policy we support.  The also cheat in elections, lie to !y face about it even when caught and attempt to blame people like Jill Stein for their losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are an obvious paid still for the DNC.  Your account is clearly fake and you aren't a real person.  No real human being could be this obtuse and pathetic.

       If you see Judicial Watch videos on voter rolls being completely corrupted by dead or moved away people and in LA County it was 154% ... 54% over legal resident voters.  They flood illegal aliens in and Bus them around to vote. CA even posts registered voter names so they can pick one.

       I am sure they spent most their time stuffing in the swing states and forgot maybe ones they thought were in the bag.  But I just remember the LA County numbers on the JW papers. They are suing several to make them follow the law and clean up the voter rolls.

       Well, fucked if I know dude. What other nation on Earth gets behind the 'Win At All Cost' philosophy in pure visible numbers greater than America? No one. And it's not just that, it's worn like a badge of honor as if the philosophy offers some type of greater value of good to humanity on the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       When did the belief of 'winning at all cost' is all that matter's become redundant? No shit, believe it or not I don't actually have a team in the soap drama that's shape shifting itself in to some bizarro type of 24/7, reality/soap drama/comedy/fictional hybrid sport event of REDS VS BLUES of which is based on two political parties. What's the league called if you don't mind letting me know?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're leading me to believe that he had not just the street smarts and foresight to envisage this, but the nous to pull off what can only be described by a casual viewer such as me as simply 'greatness'. Considering his opponent, who I accept had an empty tank physically and was only able to function to the minimum capacity via the commission sanctioned peptides, uppers, growth hormones and steroids that just got her in a position to  be able to be rigged up with strings and pulleys in human string puppet form. Himself in his rookie season accomplished this against a veteran with around 36 years in the league?!
      </p>
      <p>
       How did she not see that either A. he may attempt such a play or B. she didn't either personally attend Commissioner Jack Tunney office or send her lobby team over to push for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can anyone be angry at what I'm still in disbelief! A rookie changed how the vote ballet counting dictated who won and lost. I must give credit to these Russians as well. I'm guessing it must be Ivan and Nikita Koloff , Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov. Smart move for the bring ol' skool Soviet Union tactical ability and heat.

       Non American here so I'm removed somewhat from the politics but over the years it's coverage has been greatly increasing here and even via the internet the 2016 election was the one I had followed the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an outsider I have to say the interactions between the non believing, 'it was rigged' crowd and people who just accept it for what it something I've never witnessed in relation to anything before.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all honesty I predicted Trump winning months out,  a friend who's father is American would pass on messages, 'that I'm out of my mind and it's not possible' especially when she told him I'd put money on him at 6-1 odds two weeks out :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia has a rather large gambling culture, if not the worlds largest but I wonder if the fact Clinton was so short at around 3-10 and 1-4 that a lot of people are just unaware there's no such thing as a sure thing? Over here we're fully accustomed to seeing red hot short priced favorites lose at the track and on the sporting field that there's no sense of disbelief as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary from what I witnessed on the internet received the majority of coverage which was very similar to Aus commercial TV. Just using youtube though I'd be witnessing Trump rally's where they had to lock the gates for venues would be at capacity. Sneakily though not surprisingly what commercial TV would broadcast compared to  general members of the public streaming from Clinton events was disgraceful and so deceitful. Youtube streamers would show instances of the crowd being manipulated and cameras being moved so as to create the illusion of the venues attendances being much larger and removing any camera pans to the side which would show stands totally empty. I'm not sure if a lot of people are aware of just how small her rally events where compared to Trumps.
      </p>
      <p>
       She always was having strange fits and feinting episodes that was sold as pneumonia from memory but then not more than a few days later she's photographed with I think Chelsea's newborn and perhaps even living with her! No grandmother in their right mind would do such a thing and expose a newborn baby and their weak immune system to anyone let alone yourself that's suffering pneumonia. There was a lot of bizarre things really and even what appeared to be the use of a body double. The 1600 pound Elephant in the room was surely the private server dramas not to mention the workbook full of other questionable practices or acts from dinners with bankers for $$, Haiti, The Clinton Foundation donations to name but a few. All of which received attention in the local media over here, not at saturation point of course but is was common knowledge. I'm led to believe the USA media largely ignored it considering the disbelief seen since she didn't win. Honestly it truly is the weirdest thing but maybe that's as an outsider looking in? I was biased with my personal opinion and hope for the result that followed but anyone who took 10min and opened their eyes would have been aware that what the polls and the media indicated was waaay further from the truth and reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all honesty Trump was the lesser of the two evils and ideally neither of the two would be the possible winner. I took a real liking to that Dr Ron Paul who run years ago and who even appeared in the movie 'Bruno', he seemed like a breath of fresh air compared to the usual suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the election rigging.....I don't see it myself and even more than that I don't get how people are still going on about it now. The election was 2016 and I don't recall seeing any definitive proof of terminals being hacked or anything, I may have missed it perhaps?. The funny thing is that in a two party system of which Australia operates under that irregardless of the party that wins there's absolute minimal change or affect to the general average citizen on the whole. At the very top of the ladder I imagine is where it can have a greater affect, multinational corps worth billions. Not your average Joe. People are going on about it like it's a matter of life or death to them, hahaha it's not nice to laugh but they don't realize their total insignificance and lack of importance to the government. 
Did Russia meddle? Yeah probably. But so what? It's nothing different than all the past elections nor is it any different from what the deep state who is of no fixed political party operating out of the USA who meddle in numerous worldwide elections themselves. Is the common citizen not aware of that or just ignorant? I can't believe the whole thing is still an issue. Nearly the whole world who's outside looking in is totally baffled and left scratching their head. One second last point. Why is this rigging/meddling such a massive issue when after all this time the evidence hasn't been presented? Yet....travel back to Bush vs Gore and Florida......enough said yeah? Hypocrisy much?! If the penny hasn't dropped following that event alone or the massive magic show rolled out to create the illusion that the average persons vote matters just as much as big businesses then you'll never wake up and smell the coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last point...the almighty buck rules all of America like nothing else. 'In God We Trust', lets not forget. The almighty greenback. Why is it so, in my memory at least, all Presidents whilst in office and once out are judged on a single thing and single thing alone. The state off Wall St and the economy comes above and beyond all else. Succeed there and you'll be given a pass for killing Bambi. From what I see where it's at under Trump at the moment it gets the massive tick of approval. What's changed recently that not since America sold out to the Fed has a winning economy not meant a winning President?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be great if somehow the outsiders looking in could do some overnight trade with the insiders looking out, obviously not all require it but some perspective wouldn't hurt quite a few it appears.

       For whatever reason Soros hates Trump so most of the Leftist do too.  And their puppet celebrities and "journalists" fall in line.  Trump was never a racist to them until he ran dor office.  Now they white wash Kanye West and post on Twitter because he said he lomes rhe man if not all his policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hate is strong. Ztronfer than for Ron Paul and he scared them so much they omitted his name on poll results and kidnapped his delegates on a bus.  He was my President and still is someone I admire and respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was never someone who imspired eorher but seeing then try the same thibg in him and failing to stop him made me a supporter.  For now. In memory of my Ron Paul hopes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Clinton is a vile and evil woman.  Known that most my life.  Glad she wasn't our 1st woman.  Usually I dislike Dems more than Reps (except RINOs) but I would probably vote for Tulsi Gabbard.  I am libertarian I guess but not party affiliated.

       It was rigged from all sides. It was a complete shitshow and a race to see who could rig the hardest. Pointing the finger solely at the rigger who won in the end is counter productive. It's not a bipartisan issue, it's a global political culture issue. Most global super powers and even smaller intelligence agencies have a hand in pretty much every election world wide. Public democratic voting has been usurped by political interests and social control worldwide.

        If anyone denies Russia executed a cyber campaign to sow discord within the American citizenry and champion their choice for Trump as President, your logic is deluded. It has been proven ad nauseum.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       it hasn't been proven.  the internet research agency appears to be a domestic propaganda outfit and there hasn't been evidence given that they were involved in the very small clickbait ad buys claimed by the corporate american press.

       BUT, it IS proven that israeli agents have sewed american discontent and promoted the trump presidency.  Between all the airtime that zionist press outfits gave to Netenyuahu's bff Trump, and even the the donald sub itself which was founded and closely managed by the tard sub israeli intelligence provacateurs who destroyed digg.

       This is r/conspiracy. The "russian conspiracy theory is pushed by main stream media" for the same reason MSM always promotes what it promotes -- to distract from the fact that the Republican Oligarchy interfered in the election far more than Russia could ever imagine. And furthermore, to the extent Russia interfered, they did it with the help and support of the Republican establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where this is going: MSM is going to find (correctly) that there was "Russian collusion," and they are going to take some small measures to prevent it in the future -- sweeping all the other election cheating that we've seen since
       <em>
        Bush v. Gore
       </em>
       under the rug. Not difficult to apply our usual understanding of how conspiracies work to this situation.

       Yes, we are getting many "mainstream media approved" conspiracy theories being pushed here to drown out any real discussion. They are pushed by corporate media loyalists from the top  propaganda subs on Reddit such as r/politics and r/worldnews. Subs like these have been purchased by mainstream media and only corporate news is allowed. Watch as they link directly to some MSM rag when they brigade here. As an attempt to combat actual dissent and conspiracy theories, the government and the media are simply crafting their own that serve their interests. With so many trapped in the Trump hysteria created by the media, consumers of their propaganda will fall lockstep in their narrative and never stray from it out of fear. The shattered minds of anti-Trump and democrat partisan voters makes it child's play to indoctrinate them into their new way of thinking. Which is entirely divorced from any genuine dissenting values they once had. Hate Trump? Better hate progressives. Hate Trump? Better hate Russia. Hate Trump? Better support more war. Hate Trump? Better support corporate democrats. The fragile psyche of partisans makes it simple to control them once they have lost, and the democrats have lost more than just an election, they have lost their damn minds.

       You're right, its actually a very good indication of their goals, it's less about controlling you and more about herding you back to "acceptable" news sources, most of them just CFR mouthpieces.

       These brigades come here to push their chosen narrative to the top and downvote everything else below the threshold.  So take away their ability to do so.  Put everything into contest mode.  Everything.  Otherwise you will be accused of bias by the brigaders.  They already managed to get on mod kicked out because of that, as I'm sure you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the only way to stop the brigading.  In the comments at least.  But if they can't control the narrative in the comments, I think they will be less likely to vote brigade posts as well.

       This sub will be shut-down. Have you not seen the influx of anti-Israel topics? Sure, discuss what they are doing, but flooding the sub with hundreds of topics going against any country, let alone Israel, is too obvious.

       lol the only reason this sub hasn't already been shut down is because the mods are in the admins pocket, it's so obvious. They delete posts and ban users that the admins tell them to. Why do you think r/pizzagate got shut down but not this sub even though it's a prevalent topic here? Because the mods make sure the discussion of it is kept to a limited scope. They know they can't keep people from discussing it but they can give people false leads and point them in the wrong direction very easily.

       If they wanted the sub shut down it would be shut down regardless of how well the mods follow the rules, that's the whole point. The idea that the mods have to do these things is silly because it doesn't actually stop the sub from getting banned, what stops it from getting banned is that the mods push an admin-friendly agenda that is disguised as opposition.

       The only reason TD hasn't been shut down is because it's much larger than Reddit lets on. They don't want to lose a big chunk if they're base. Bring on the downvotes, shills. You're only reinforcing OP's point.

       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/84ilfn/today_there_are_millions_of_kids_marching_all/dvqtsnz/?context=0">
        comment saying you were banned
       </a>
       , but then later
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8do93h/democratic_party_files_lawsuit_alleging_russia/dxoquyo/">
        you posted in r/politics
       </a>
       which proves you weren't banned. The only thing I can see related to your claim is a couple of comments that got deleted probably because you kept saying "you mad bro" and being obviously inflammatory, which like it or not violates their "be civil" rule, but that's not the same as getting banned.

And you obviously didn't read it all the guy called me stupid for in about 5 different messeges I asked him if was reading from a script he kept calling me stupid a d I asked of he was "mad bro" I got banned for trolling.. A few weeks later I called r/politics a circle jerk full of idiots and nothing.. Why would you even comment on something you know nothing about lmao

       You literally told people to look though your post history for proof so that's why I did, and now it's seems like your upset that I'm calling you out for making shit up. Like I said dude r/politics is a shithole but lying about this stuff just makes you look like an agenda driven hack, so congrats you're a hypocrit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol and the closest he came to calling you stupid was "Judging by your written communication, you were walking out of school everyday." which he said once. Why do you keep lying about shit? It's right there in your post history for everyone to see.

       lol never said it was, I'm not defending that guy or r/politics if that's what you think just pointing out that you keep exaggerating things to push your agenda. And it's lying because getting two trollish comments deleted is not the same as getting banned, and you were literally posting in the sub later, which you can't do if you are banned

       So you're still saying I didn't get banned? Granted it was lifted the next day and I might have exaggerated how many times he directly called me stupid.. But it's all there I asked an honest question got berated then asked em if he was mad an reading from a script and I get a ban that was lifted to a week the very next day which even seems more shady to me

       lmao it's shady that you got banned for one whole day after spamming "you mad bro?" at somebody? How do you not see how disingenuous you're being? You asked about school walk-out and those comments are still up, other people were questioning it too and were back posting the next day because they didn't get banned for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you got banned, it was for one day for being a troll, congrats, you still lied to push your agenda.

      <p>
       Several of your comments criticizing kids walking out are still viewable on the comments page, the only ones that got deleted are your "you mad bro?" trolling comments, if you were banned for 7 day (not really a ban though if it's not permanent) it was for trolling and not for what you originally claimed.

       I hope your trolling now or are 12 because you're missing the bigger picture, asking people on the internet if they are mad is a well know trolling technique, the exact phasing is irrelevant but it is hilarious that you literally used the meme as is which gives you no wiggle room to say what your intentions were. No one is going to believe your "I was just asking a question" excuse.

       I don't even know how it all works.. How can you see it if it's deleted? You keep back tracking first it was I was lying and didn't get banned.. Then I think you were butt hurt over the difference between ban an temporary ban.. Now the mods did there jobs in TEMPORARILY banning me because I was using the very well trolling technique you mad bro?
      </p>
      <p>
       (Which is also how people talk in the Real world)
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a full on ban at first then they made temporary for "you mad bro" really? I'll say it again I asked legit questions got sassed for it threw a lil sass back there's way worse "trolling" I even went back and trolled! An no ban
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't get banned for trolling you know it you're either stubborn and internet arguments are fun for you. Or I don't even know
      </p>
      <p>
       But apparently "you mad bro" is the Holy grail of trollling you can ask legit questions and if someone doesn't like it an insults you better not ask them if they're mad..
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously why is this so important to you? You know the ban wasn't for trolling..

       The comment is still visible on your user page just not the actual comments for the article, the ones that got deleted are the "you mad" comments, the other ones are still completely visible, why would they leave those up if they were the real reason you got banned? It makes no sense except you want it to be true because it fits your agenda.

       Why would they delete an innocent question? An easy question, that alot of people were also asking? like you said.. They'd have to delete all of them and That would be blatantly fishy.. I think you're missing the bigger picture
      </p>
      <p>
       The only person talking about trolling was the dude I was arguing with then I get banned for trolling? For asking if he was mad after insulting me unprovoked? Honestly I think the ban happened because I asked of he was reading from a script like I asked if he was
      </p>
      <p>
       I even messeeged the mod telling them it was shady and talked some shit.. After they switched it to a temporary ban.. It stayed that way I went back an purposefully trolled and nothing..

       How can you keep claiming it's an innocent question? Have you spent any time on the internet? "you mad bro" is a well known phase that is used to illicit a certain response from somebody (which is literally the definition of trolling), it's like the most basic and well known form of trolling. Like holy shit I hope you are 12 or are just trolling right now if you don't understand this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really don't get it then please just understand that the vast majority of people on the internet will see the question as trolling, sorry if you don't see it that way but everyone else does.

       When you're being insulted unprovoked? I think its an innocent question context is a thing ya know he was mad.. you obviously read the whole thing, let's just say it's a masterfull trolling technique... does that completely negate my original question??
      </p>
      <p>
       what does the school walk outs accomplish? What did they accomplish? Why was the entire shooting and aftermath and everything in the media pretty damn shady???

       lol i never said it was masterful trolling (I literally called it basic) and I never said anything about your original question, in fact I think it's a great question, we don't have any disagreements their maybe you missed where I pointed out that r/politics is a shithole.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just not the reason you were banned, their is literally no reason to think that, your comments asking legit questions about the walk out are still up, your "totally not trolling" "you mad bro?" comments were, other people even asked similar questions and were back posting the next day because they weren't banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/politics sucks, they ban people for stupid reason, in this instance you got banned for shitty trolling, that's it. Funny I'm saying this here but not everything is a conspiracy.

       This place is and likely will remain a battleground in the foreseeable future. It is something that, as sad as it may seem, we have to accept. All forums that consist of conspiracies, whether on Reddit or off this site, that in any way compromise the activities of various political, economic, corporate or military groups, national and transnational are and will continue to be brigaded, subject to shills, provocateurs, disruptors....etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the name of the game, I'm sorry to say and I don't think there is a way around this. As long as the ideas presented here are inflammatory and controversial, as long as they clash with the interests of a wealthy and powerful minority that are part of the conspiracies discussed here, there will always be groups of people, whether paid or voluntary, that seek to "correct the record" on any topics and discussions where they feel the narrative isn't coming across as they would like to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do encourage seeking out more solutions to make their jobs harder, but the key to understand here is that it's almost impossible to remove the provocateurs from the equation without creating a closed community that is invite only and carefully screened. And in that case you lose the organic users that wish to seek out more information, that wish to find alternative viewpoints, that wish to see what is being hidden from them. If you make a community or forum private, you eliminate the very people you are trying to "awaken" from the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good solution is to simply make a stickied post or perhaps add a warning to the sidebar that states something along what you are saying here - that due to the controversial and inflammatory nature of this sub, due to the fact that the topics discussed here step on many toes (at times even of conflicting interest groups - especially in the case of political parties, where both sides are constantly doing the brigading and shilling), every thread should be looked at in its entirety, critical thinking and discernment should be used, downvotes and upvotes do not mean always make something a correct or high quality comment (though again this depends on the controversiality of the thread and how brigaded it is, I often still see high quality comments and threads rising to the top in less or non brigaded threads)....
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically warn users that the sub is being tampered with in many ways. In heavily brigaded threads show that the thread has been linked from TMOR and call out the obvious brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       If users know it's going on, especially users that aren't aware of it (users that don't frequent this sub), they can be more discernive and critical of the content presented to them and the various narratives being pushed. They can be made aware this sub is a battleground of many interest groups that each want to push their own agenda, as well as many genuine users that wish to contribute and discuss things in a genuine manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the provocateurs that are paid, that really is the best you can do. Remember, it is some people's job to do this stuff. They have a lot of time on their hands. What we have though is heart and truth, as well as a passion to uncover what has been hidden and help make the world a more peaceful place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course not everything posted on this sub is true, even if it is by genuine users - but the main benefit of having such a sub is to have a place for open, free and polite discussion without agenda, to really come to the bottom of every rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think I speak for the majority of this sub when I say that most of us do not want more wars, violence, injustices and that every one of us, in our own way, is trying to make the world a better place through spreading awareness on subject we deem important

       It's all about controlling the perception of reality. If you notice certain hard working users really want you to have the Washington Post/Politico only perspective of reality. And they have a team to back them up with brigades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then if their perspective does not gain traction on this sub they throw a hissy fit and complain about the sub calling it compromised or whatever like this instance.

       I personally feel that many actually take the corruption and conspiracies perpetrated by the wealthy and powerful few occurring on this planet with way too little seriousness, especially until they feel it is not about them or feel it doesn't affect them (or does so minimally).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only now, but throughout history as well. People seemingly enjoy being ignorant instead of at least trying to see what is going on and then at least attempting to oppose the corrupt power structures so massively prevalent in our society (and again, throughout much of world history) - spreading awareness about it if nothing else.

       You’re pushing a narrative right here with this comment.  The Russian collusion conspiracy is driven by facts (there’s people testifying about this shit in court, people being fired over it, etc.) but you’re rushing to call it “speculation”.

       Those are some unconnected facts there.   He didn't register as a foreign agent when he lobbied for the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, and he lobbied for U1 long after the sale.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of that gets anywhere near the  U1 scandal alleging Clinton approved the sale in return for CF donations, and WJC speaking fees.

       Thanks I've been wracking my brain trying to remember what made me first question whose side Mueller is really on.  I forgot about this Podesta and Manafort link.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a crazy conspiracy theory unfolding live and sadly so few see it.  Mueller has some pretty shady past re Anthrax 2001 investigation and railroading innocent people as prosecutor and abusinf surveillance state Then parallel constructing evidence to use in court.  I wonder what he ans Trump discussed at that "interview" where both knew he wasn't eligible as he maxed his term limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rep Gohmert has a long list of Mueller's bad behavior in his website.  I need to read over it but haven't yet.  He also let Uranium One to through and let DOJ threaten his CI with gag order or prison.  Did he play Dems all along? Or did he get flipped by something Trump had on him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it's crazy the people who lived in Trump Tower. He could have dirt in everyone like that creep Schniederman.  Yet he sat like a patient spider before he caught that sicko and exposed him.  It is an interesting read About him trying to shake down Trimp family in 2012 or something. And what really happened with Trump University.

       Mueller like you said has had a shady past. I mean, he got in as FBI director a week before 9/11 lol He's a 100% swamp monster (in origin) but that being said, doesn't mean he didn't have a shot at redemption. I think he played his old cabal friends. He might have played along for long but once he got exposed to the complete plans of what would happen, maybe he thought his redemption arc could be worth living instead of going to rot in Guantanamo like all the others

       Interesting news today Mueller had a secret and illegal it seems task force paid by a Russian oligarch aluminum names Oleg Deripaska. He bank rolled some private people for a 25 million to help retrieve that poor guy Levinson the Iranians have had as prisoner.  This was in 2009 and 2010 and the State Department under HRC ran interference and shut him down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really seems like Obama didn't want this guy back aa he wasn't included in the hostage exchange for cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have always felt bad for Levinson especially when they didn't get him back with that abysmal Iran Deal.  Seemed to me they want him kept there.  And this even though illegal makes me dislike Mueller a bit less.  And it's something I could see might really anger him and with HRC out of his way finally...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Then in fall 2010, the operation secured an offer to free Levinson. The deal was scuttled, however, when the State Department become uncomfortable with Iran’s terms, according to Deripaska’s lawyer and the Levinson family.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI officials confirmed State hampered their efforts."

       Its getting more interesting. Now seems McCabe met with Oleg Deripaska and wanted to hear his old business partner, who screwed him, Manafort could have been working with Russians and got laughed at and told no way. Manafort burned all those bridges. Then McCabe and company say keep an open mind.

       They dangles a visa around sanctions at him supposedly.

       And Levinson was set to come home flight waiting for him on tarmac when HRC bailes last minute refusing to concede on some wording?

       And someone on here thinks Mueller wantee to expose 911 a long time.  Would mean anthrax cases too and lord knows what else.

       Guy from the Hill who broke this or maybe it was Ingrahamm (don't watch her much but saw she had author on) said something about Reagan agreeing not to say "tear this wall down" in his speech 1987 but he did it anyway at Bradenburg

       And the Manafort case his attack dog from the Clintons told the judge he didjt need to, and wasnt allowed, to see the SC scope from DOJ as 80% is redacted.  Judge Ellis called them out gave them 2 weeks fo produce it (deadline is this Friday I believe).  He also accused them of manipulating courts to try and flip manafort on something to use against POTUS and he understood that but nothing they have came within their stated scope as its 10+ years ago and work product of a different prosecutor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump may be guilty. I doubt it on this charge anyway.  But the DOJ and FBI have been weaponized as political tools to destroy the unfavored candidate. This should infuriate all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now it looks like they set anithee entrapment like Garland Texas when FBI Agent found some angry Muslims. Trained and armed them then told them by text to "Tear up Texas" and ddobe then to Garland Muhammed cartoon festival (done in memory od murdered cartoon artists etc) and sat in his car photographing the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI is covering his tracts and stonewalling investigation. Security that took bullets stopping the attack saw him clear as day and watched him drove off suddenly and not call in ambulance or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tons of these cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two under Clinton POTUS
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets remember how the ATF and FBI with tanks murdered women and children after CO2 gasing them they set fire and burned the last alive.  All this after weeks long siege.
      </p>
      <p>
       OKC Holder then FBI set up McVay and provided bomb materials.  Someine warned fed employees to call in sick that day.  I believe ATF had an office there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love or hate trump but don't deny FBI is corrupt to the core. Since inception under JE Hoover.  And they fixed Uranium One and Classified materials crimes for HRC among who knows how much else.

         Trump is undeniably showing weird favoritism towards Russia (refusing to enact sanctions demanded by congress, trying to excuse/downplay wrongdoing by the Russian government, etc.).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Multiple members of Trump’s campaign and cabinet have been found to have sketchy ties to Russia.  Some have resigned or been fired because they lied about their involvement.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russia regularly fucks with other countries and then lies about it (Crimea, etc.).  Since they can’t invade they have been waging an information war against us - Russia is a huge source of misinformation (which is a classic tactic for them when they’re doing something shady, they deny it and spread lies about their enemy) and it potentially fucked with our election.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There’s a lot of evidence backing up these claims but none of them definitively prove collusion between Russia and Trump.  My guess is that Trump is just a pawn and the collusion is happening all around him, and at the end of the day he’ll probanly take the fall for whatever they were trying to accomplish.

       1 - no he definitely is not.  He is actually doing exactly what the Deep State wants and escalting tentions with Syria and Iran.   If Trump was trying to help Russia why did he just cancel the Iran deal and let Isreal bomb Syria which the Russians are furious about?
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - Same with the Clintons.  Bill got a 500k check from a putin controlled bank andnmet with him personally.  Manafort and Podesta worked together fornthe russians in Ukraine.  Uranium One?  Why arent you accusing them of "russian collusion"?  Is it bc youre a hack?

       3 - the usa has fucked with more countries than every other nation on earth combined bro.  This is the weakest response I could have imagined.

       Yes it does. Russia desperately needs oil to be at least $100 a barrel for them to have a functioning economy and cancellation of the deal

       go some way to achieving that. Thankfully the rest of the world seem to have had enough of the idiot in chief though and will ignore his temper tantrum and continue the deal in good faith.

       I’ve suggested disabling downvoting a couple of times and never gotten a response that explains why that won’t solve part of the problem. Sure, some comments will get artificially inflated, just like some posts do (the discrepancies between comment and post voting is another big issue here). But at least nothing would get buried. Add somethings like sorting by new or controversial and you take away the impetus to forum slide and distract.

       I personally get dismayed to see a conspiracy message board filled with users actively peddling disinformation in order to protect the biggest power that be, Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate, Seth Rich, all the weak stories offering total nonsense in an attempt to protect Trump from the constant Russia revelations...its all politically motivated nonsense. The fact that people are so actively pushing it ...and usually reflexively whenever bad news comes out for Trump...is a conspiracy in and of itself.

       Nothing in that says anything about "stealing Burnie's spot".  Clinton bailed out the DNC and had a JFA with them.  Burnie had a JFA too, but didn't actually use it, they just signed it so they could use the DNC's voter database for free.

       I would bet that the vast majority of readers around here can spot the hypocrisy and manipulation that is going on here.  Its not like its hard to see,  especially if you have been a regular around here for any significant amount of time.

       TBH,  I would guess that ultimately this astroturfing will be counterproductive.  This is a sub for conspiracy minded people,  and the more obvious the astroturfing becomes,  the more ineffective it will become.  Even if astroturfed comments continue to rise to the top of our discussions,  they are going to change very few minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The subreddit is called
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  People who come here are conspiracy minded.  An easily identifiable shill/troll campaign will ultimately be completely counterproductive when this campaign takes place inside of a forum specifically for people who disregard official narratives and believe that powerful forces are trying to influence their minds.

       Conspiracy theories are theories, there going to be some far fetched ones in with questioning the accepted narrative. Is Keanu really a vampire? Were the holocaust figures accurate? Was there hampster in Richard Geere's ass? Was the Sony hack a stunt?

       as David Irvin said, Auschwitz (a nazi corporate industrial complex) became Jewish Disney land and MSM marketable (easy to visit) , the real death camps were in eastern Poland (hard to visit), Treblinka, Solibor, Belzec.

       It's very easy to tell these "authentic" accounts come from subs such as
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or one of their 50+ branch-off spam subs. You'll notice how anything critical of what
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       supports is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       downvoted yet cookie-cutter comments about this sub being T_D 2.0 are
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       upvoted.

       I agree with that.  It's because there is no real filter on the new tab.  You just see everything being submitted and coming down the pipe.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all becomes up to
       <em>
        you

       at that point which posts you pay attention to and which ones you don't, however.  I definitely prefer it that way over being told which ones I should pay attention to via possible vote manipulation though.

       That's not low at all (1 in 59). Its gone up steadily from 1 in 150 or so just a few years ago. (2006)

       And it is one of many types of reactions and autoimmune disorders and deaths. Take the HPV vaccine.  This killer causes infertility and Guillain-Barre Syndrome when it doesn't just kill people.  Now they are forcing it on boys and newborns.

       And now a family finally won a court case (usually foeced into the vaccine court which is not a real court but a way to hide it).
      </p>
      <p>
       "The final ruling has been confirmed by the Department of Health and Human Services: Merck’s Gardasil vaccine causes autoimmune problems that cause sudden debilitation and/or death. If the young girl had been gunned down by a madman with an AR-15, then there’d be national headlines and a march on Washington. Since this young woman was “shot” to death by a vaccine, the whole story gets swept under the rug."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Never mind that the Gardasil vaccine is responsible for ending the lives of 271 young women to date, according to over 57,520 adverse event reports obtained from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. If 271 young people died in a school shooting, the news coverage would be nonstop in support of gun bans. How about a ban on Gardasil – a real modern day assault weapon?"

       It usually just takes 5min to see the 5 year old low karma troll account, scroll down til you see football, basketball, or hockey (dont see much baseball oddly). These are north american shit eaters. Or the 5 month account with
       <em>
        high
       </em>
       karma, same thing, few posts here, then right into sport sub, a location sub, and a handful of general interest subs. Also, usually an IT sub of some sort, because talk what you know about. Also blatant marketing usernames, that is new though.

       They are not hard to find, but they are getting easier to catch. But it is a huge game of whack a mole. We punt 1 sick, 3 more show up.

       Sort comments by new and controversial if you want to see what real people are saying. Expand collapsed negative comments. And for the love of god upvote quality comments you find there. They have more resources, but we can still punch back so maybe a new user can see what we are about.

       Hate to be that guy but Tom Clancy predicted that world war 3 will be started years in advance as an information war. False flags, fake news, blackmail over and over again until the world is primed for a war and willing to back it 100 percent. Wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing planes crash from supposedly Chinese laser pointers.

You asked about school walk-out and those comments are still up, other people were questioning it too and were back posting the next day because they didn't get banned for it.

       it hasn't been proven.  the internet research agency appears to be a domestic propaganda outfit and there hasn't been evidence given that they were involved in the very small clickbait ad buys claimed by the corporate american press.

       Non American here so I'm removed somewhat from the politics but over the years it's coverage has been greatly increasing here and even via the internet the 2016 election was the one I had followed the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an outsider I have to say the interactions between the non believing, 'it was rigged' crowd and people who just accept it for what it something I've never witnessed in relation to anything before.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all honesty I predicted Trump winning months out,  a friend who's father is American would pass on messages, 'that I'm out of my mind and it's not possible' especially when she told him I'd put money on him at 6-1 odds two weeks out :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia has a rather large gambling culture, if not the worlds largest but I wonder if the fact Clinton was so short at around 3-10 and 1-4 that a lot of people are just unaware there's no such thing as a sure thing? Over here we're fully accustomed to seeing red hot short priced favorites lose at the track and on the sporting field that there's no sense of disbelief as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary from what I witnessed on the internet received the majority of coverage which was very similar to Aus commercial TV. Just using youtube though I'd be witnessing Trump rally's where they had to lock the gates for venues would be at capacity. Sneakily though not surprisingly what commercial TV would broadcast compared to  general members of the public streaming from Clinton events was disgraceful and so deceitful. Youtube streamers would show instances of the crowd being manipulated and cameras being moved so as to create the illusion of the venues attendances being much larger and removing any camera pans to the side which would show stands totally empty. I'm not sure if a lot of people are aware of just how small her rally events where compared to Trumps.
      </p>
      <p>
       She always was having strange fits and feinting episodes that was sold as pneumonia from memory but then not more than a few days later she's photographed with I think Chelsea's newborn and perhaps even living with her! No grandmother in their right mind would do such a thing and expose a newborn baby and their weak immune system to anyone let alone yourself that's suffering pneumonia. There was a lot of bizarre things really and even what appeared to be the use of a body double. The 1600 pound Elephant in the room was surely the private server dramas not to mention the workbook full of other questionable practices or acts from dinners with bankers for $$, Haiti, The Clinton Foundation donations to name but a few. All of which received attention in the local media over here, not at saturation point of course but is was common knowledge. I'm led to believe the USA media largely ignored it considering the disbelief seen since she didn't win. Honestly it truly is the weirdest thing but maybe that's as an outsider looking in? I was biased with my personal opinion and hope for the result that followed but anyone who took 10min and opened their eyes would have been aware that what the polls and the media indicated was waaay further from the truth and reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all honesty Trump was the lesser of the two evils and ideally neither of the two would be the possible winner. I took a real liking to that Dr Ron Paul who run years ago and who even appeared in the movie 'Bruno', he seemed like a breath of fresh air compared to the usual suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the election rigging.....I don't see it myself and even more than that I don't get how people are still going on about it now. The election was 2016 and I don't recall seeing any definitive proof of terminals being hacked or anything, I may have missed it perhaps?. The funny thing is that in a two party system of which Australia operates under that irregardless of the party that wins there's absolute minimal change or affect to the general average citizen on the whole. At the very top of the ladder I imagine is where it can have a greater affect, multinational corps worth billions. Not your average Joe. People are going on about it like it's a matter of life or death to them, hahaha it's not nice to laugh but they don't realize their total insignificance and lack of importance to the government. 
Did Russia meddle? Yeah probably. But so what? It's nothing different than all the past elections nor is it any different from what the deep state who is of no fixed political party operating out of the USA who meddle in numerous worldwide elections themselves. Is the common citizen not aware of that or just ignorant? I can't believe the whole thing is still an issue. Nearly the whole world who's outside looking in is totally baffled and left scratching their head. One second last point. Why is this rigging/meddling such a massive issue when after all this time the evidence hasn't been presented? Yet....travel back to Bush vs Gore and Florida......enough said yeah? Hypocrisy much?! If the penny hasn't dropped following that event alone or the massive magic show rolled out to create the illusion that the average persons vote matters just as much as big businesses then you'll never wake up and smell the coffee.

       Last point...the almighty buck rules all of America like nothing else. 'In God We Trust', lets not forget. The almighty greenback. Why is it so, in my memory at least, all Presidents whilst in office and once out are judged on a single thing and single thing alone. The state off Wall St and the economy comes above and beyond all else. Succeed there and you'll be given a pass for killing Bambi. From what I see where it's at under Trump at the moment it gets the massive tick of approval. What's changed recently that not since America sold out to the Fed has a winning economy not meant a winning President?

       It would be great if somehow the outsiders looking in could do some overnight trade with the insiders looking out, obviously not all require it but some perspective wouldn't hurt quite a few it appears.

       Have a look. The SS was posted an hour ago so the bot wasn't triggered. I just let it through the filter, so now you can see it.

       Well maybe you should do some broader reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are asserting all the intelligence agencies, and the very recent senate intelligence committee are all wrong in their findings. And you, AdSin15, know better than them?

      <p>
       You cannot be reasoned with. It doesn’t matter to you anyway, because you have stated you are  HAPPY Russia meddled. And presumably want to give them some sort of honour for their clear intent to simply help the American people /s
