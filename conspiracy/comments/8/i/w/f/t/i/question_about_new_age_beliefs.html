    <div class="md"><p>I think you may be specifically referring to Wicca, a lot of new agers think more in terms of universal consciousness. For a lot of them, I think it is to challenge the traditional belief systems that only value masculinity. For others, it may just make more sense that god is a woman because women give birth and are a symbol of a creative power. I think labeling something, with a gender, that is supposed to be outside our complete comprehension is pretty silly myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think god is a spirit not a gender. Humans always try to relate to their own life. We anthropomorphize everything we can. I also think organized religion is a conduit to control humanity in a number of different ways. The spirit is immortal and can be reborn into a body an infinite amount of times. The earth could be stuck in a soul trap in which the spirits that are reborn have no recollection of past lives. Also time is abstract so it is possible upon rebirth to be in a different time say 5000 years in the future or past. </p>

<p>sure, it is now, churches in america are a corpse because they abandoned law.  it wasnt the case when we liberated ourselves from britain.  whats your opinion about the declaration of independence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>youre not looking at it right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
Jude
4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
2peter2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if they remained, the world would be even worse than it is.  its not just our own sins but the betrayal of a third of the angels whose rebellion exacerbates our condition.</p>

<p>humans are not automotons, theres a degree of free will man is given, and man chooses to do evil.  sorry if i sound like a religious person, but believe me when i say that the churches today are no sanctuary from evil, they are corpses.  i believe the bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I encourage you to read the apocrypha. I also highly recommend Gods of Eden by William Bramley. The God in the old testament is different from the god in the new.  There are too many hypocritical things to list but like i said God of the old testiment was ok with killing as long as he ordered it but in the same sense made the commandment thou shall not kill. Doesn&#39;t make sense and there is no logical way of explaining it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God destroyed the whole world in the flood. Promised he would never do that again. Revelations says it will happen again with the promise of a thousand years of peace.<br/>
