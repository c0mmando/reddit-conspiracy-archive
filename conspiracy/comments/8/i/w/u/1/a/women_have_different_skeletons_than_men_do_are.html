<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Glover">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Glover</a></p>

<p>When I saw some bits of his video “This is America”, his shirtless body was screaming out at me that he was born a woman. I didn’t say anything because what do I know? What are they doing to kids on these military bases? It’s been coming out that the government has been doing trauma based mind control on children. I’m going to leave it at that. This content creator Phony Persephone explains all the ways in which Childish Gambino clearly possesses the skeleton of a female. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gender Inversion Conspiracy Theory Submission Statement: There is a theory that many of the most privileged people also happen to be dark occultists who raise their children up as the opposite gender. Part of that theory is that the media presents the children of these couplings as the most sexy and desirable to trickle down mass gender confusion. The idea is that this gender inversion is done largely to pay homage to the Luciferian goat god Baphomet. </p>

<p>I’m presenting this video as evidence to back up this theory. Childish Gambino was also seen making Luciferian hand symbols and the Met Gala and he wore an all seeing eye on his back similar to the one on the dollar bill. The family who controls and prints US money is also suspected to be a group of secret Luciferians. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s &quot;Odd&quot; Because the dancing is minstrel show style and because he affects a jim crow pose. It&#39;s fucking art not a military conspiracy. And Glover has known other than &quot;massive success&quot; dude has worked his ass off in nearly every facet of the entertainment industry to secure his own voice and place. DISCLOSURE: I&#39;ve met the guy, he&#39;s a he and a decent person and this theory is some pathetic shit. Also there are videos of him dating back to when he was in college and you can easy find yearbook pictures from his highschool and junior highschool days. Being androgynous and transexual are very different things OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you don&#39;t know anything about either.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with homosexuality and everything to do with emotions and attraction.</p>

<p>Women are not allowed in a the majority of the top 10 armed forces, with Israel being the only exception Iirc. </p>

<p>If a woman is shot or injured a mans natural reaction is to help or assist. Sure, you can brainwash this reaction out of men, but it still takes them 1/2 a second - 1 second for them to think then rethink their idea. During that split second, you have just lost two more men, your jet is shot out of the sky, your tank rolls over an anti-tank mine.</p>

<p>Homosexuals are attracted to men. If a homosexual sees a man injured or shot, he will have the same reaction a heterosexual man has towards a woman.</p>

<p>It is that simple. It&#39;s nothing about hating gays or sexism. War is about killing people. The most efficient killing machines win wars.</p>

<p>There is no time for politics, opinions or feelings on the front line. It is literally kill or be killed, do or die. If you&#39;re slow to react, you die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And people who were under the legal age of joining still signed up for the Wars. That doesn&#39;t mean that allowing every 14 year old to join up is an effective idea.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck who is stood next to me as long as they have my back, I have theirs. There is a line though. Would you be bothered if you were fighting alongside a guy who once tried coke? Probably not. What if he was a complete coke head though? Or a stereotypical heroin-addict? The chances are you wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>No doubt women can shoot, gays are effective soldier and some 14 year olds can kick arse.</p>

<p>With war though it&#39;s risk vs reward. The risk is you offend some civvies who, let&#39;s face it, probably would never sign-up for combat anyway vs reward of knowing you have a competent fighting squad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt it.</p>

<p>What I do doubt, is the honesty of the majority of the replies. </p>

<p>At best my post was a poorly fleshed out post with a little thread of truth to it.</p>

<p>At worst it was a driveby shitpost.</p>

<p>Does that warrant so many down votes? Besides, what issue to people have with what I said? They, in their own minds, believe I am saying gays = civilisation collapse. That is an over-simplification of a very real fact. </p>

<p>Any, country, nation, empire or civilisation that allows so much to go unchecked, unquestioned and even championed to the point of punishment for not following the narrative (r/conspiracy sure likes to pick and choose when this happens) opens itself up for invasion, coercion from foreign interests and destruction through divide and conquer tactics.</p>

<p>So let us see, what does conspiracy believe? </p>

<p>TPTB are trying to divide us.</p>

<p>Israel has coerced congress to do their bidding.</p>

<p>Migration is a plan to load up countries with cheap labour so that the migrants vote a certain way.</p>

<p>My post would have been accepted if I hadn&#39;t, in some peoples minds, called out homosexuality and transsexuality.</p>

<p>Do you not think that is very, very suspect?</p>

<p>The collapse of the Roman empire is often stated as proof but in reality the collapse was the composite result of multiple factors.</p>

<p>Even if we had a definitely true previous example, you can&#39;t state that it IS going to happen again because that&#39;s induction. Leave induction in mathematics please.</p>

<p>Have you got any trends we can see which are clearly detrimental (not from a personal moral stand point)? At the moment some of the largest economies in the world are the countries supporting these rights. Countries with the highest HDI also correlate with LGBT rights.</p>

<p>Nobody should be persecuted for their beliefs. Even those who don&#39;t agree with how others should live their lives.</p>

<p>You might have more armed forces than 90% of other nations but your tactics are...well, shit.

<p>The point isn&#39;t about how great the US military is (I don&#39;t know enough about militaries in general to have a strong opinion), but that we&#39;re not going to be invaded anytime soon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America isn&#39;t getting invaded anytime soon, I agree. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s your military might that&#39;s stopping it though.</p>

<p>How many of your citizens are armed with enough weapons and rounds that they could say, kill a family? Or 10 families? How many communities could take down a small country, if they pooled their arms? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said for many many years that the American civilians are the strongest army in the world. Good luck crossing the vast continent of America while wiping out every last man and woman who is opposed to whoever or whomever invades. </p>

<p>Ask the Nazis how their campaigns on the Eastern Front and in France went. La resistance and the small groups of scattered militia in the Eastern bloc made it impossible for Hitler to gain a stranglehold.</p>

<p>When people can&#39;t discuss their personal opinions on the matter.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have to be gay/trans. It can be black, white, fat, small, hell, any label you want.</p>

<p>How many people on this sub are up in arms because you can&#39;t deny or question the holocaust? </p>

<p>Yet, if you question homosexuals it ends up, well, like this. It is very strange. One rule for one, one rule for another.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve stated vague ideas but not the mechanisms. How does accepting transgender people create a weak society?</p>

<p>I could potentially see the issue you might have with immigrants, given the risk of bringing people into the country. But as for LGBT rights, it has no impact.</p>

<p>All you&#39;re doing is attaching your prejudice about LGBT rights to some unfounded belief that it&#39;s destroying society.</p>

<p>You would only champion this ideology if your intent was to destabilise the traditions of that nation and thus conquer it through the divisions the championing creates. </p>

<p>Not to go all &#39;twas the Russians&#39; but they have stated in their (kalergi, kalgeri?) plan that in order to take over America it must be done through subtle division and not direct brute-force. So, which other nations see the same tactics?</p>

<p>Ever considered it&#39;s the opposite? Perhaps the movement exists and they&#39;re using the fact people have a traditional distaste towards the movement to push negative propaganda.</p>

<p>By this logic we&#39;d never have any progress. Trying to improve the life of those on the fringes of society MUST have some other motive. Black people should never have been given any rights, because that went against traditional values of slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the huge flaw if you look at it from that angle.</p>

<p>What i&#39;m saying is; blacks should be seen as equals, because they are, but at the same time their differences should be celebrated and their weaknesses discussed. Not hidden, not shoved into quiet corners never to be spoke about, otherwise how do we have progress?</p>

<p>I just see progress as making a topic so normal that nobody cares. While that subject, either pro or anti, is in the media, then people will care.</p>

<p>Look at the huge let-down that the first gay marriage was. Those on both sides of the event were expecting either huge celebration or huge backlash. Neither happened, because nobody really gave a fuck. That&#39;s how it should be, a respectful &quot;cool story bro&quot; and move on. </p>

<p>To see any group put above others sends alarms off in my head. The Aryans were held to a high standard in Germany. In Russia Stalin held up the ideology of Lenin in order to gain power. There are countless tales through history were one group is held to a higher standard than another group leading to war and ultimately destruction of one group.</p>

It&#39;s a troll from that other sub which will remain nameless to make this one look dumb which it doesn&#39;t need because it does a great job it does on it&#39;s own with toleration of flat earth,moon landing is fake and political shitshow posts designed to just derail this sub in general. The other option  for what this is. People can just be plain crazy or dumb. Crazy people see connections that aren&#39;t really there all the time and have paranoid delusions.  There is the possibility that this and other posts like it can be counted as just a dumb post. A person not comprehending what they are seeing or reading drawing unintelligent and uninformed  conclusions from an article or video clip. I know this a huge sub with a lot going on. I just wish mods took care of it better because it  used to be a place where good discussions could take place. Now it&#39;s all absolute lunacy like this or political squabbling shit shows. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s being just overwhelmed by crazies,dumbasses and political cheerleaders real and bot because it&#39;s just a huge sub or being intentionally neutered.</p>
