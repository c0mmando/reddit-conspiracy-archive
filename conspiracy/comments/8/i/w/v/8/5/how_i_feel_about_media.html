<p>How would you know what they know? </p>

<p>Perhaps <em>they know that RT is designed for outside of Russia</em> while NPR is designed <em>to educate America</em>. </p>

<p>Propaganda exists in all varieties but do you think Trump can call up NPR and force a story or kill a story?</p>

<p>Is there a reason why Trump&#39;s party tries to de-fund NPR all the time? </p>

<p>Do you think Putin has these challenges with RT? </p>

<p>RT was setup <strong>specifically</strong> to provide the outside world with news that has a Russian perspective on it; sometimes it&#39;s a great thing - other times it&#39;s not; but NPR and RT are in no way similar. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re to believe what we&#39;ve read recently, the CIA has infiltrated much of our media so this has zero to do with NPR. </p>

<p>Ha ha that&#39;s a funny way to say <em>pure Russian propaganda machine</em>. </p>

<p>RT was designed to provide information to folks <em>outside of Russia</em> from a <em>Russian perspective</em>. I don&#39;t have a problem with that, but  they censor <em>what they want</em> and not <em>what the US gov&#39;t/media wants</em> so you may see that as less censored but watch RT during Russian elections and then me they aren&#39;t censoring. </p>

<p>Is there any difference between these two types of government? </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of self-government or are you so jaded and deluded by what you read online that you forgot in America, <em>we the people have some control</em>; certainly not all of it and most of the time not enough of it, but compared to Russia it&#39;s not even a conversation. </p>

<p>Fair enough but what does that have to do with NPR? </p>

<p>It is <strong>not state run media</strong> and it is not broadcast outside of the US (at least not before the Internet). </p>

<p>Exactly what control do &quot;we the people&quot; have over NPR?</p>

<p>LOL I wasn&#39;t talking about <em>over NPR</em> but rather in general. </p>

<p>But let&#39;s dispel these misconceptions you have about NPR real quick. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR">In 2010, NPR revenues totaled $180 million, with the bulk of revenues coming from programming fees, grants from foundations or business entities, contributions and sponsorships. According to the 2009 financial statement, about 50% of NPR revenues come from the fees it charges member stations for programming and distribution charges</a></p>

<p>And how exactly is our control any greater than the control of Russian citizens?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha ha ha ha ha ha you are really equating Russia and the USA when it comes to individual rights and our ability to collectively organize and <em>change the ways of our government</em>???</p>

<p>For real?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with media is that they need to make money some way or another. That literally is 90% of the problem. Real investigative long-term journalism is dying because it costs alot and makes you less money than a nice fluff piece about Kanye Wests latest tweets. It&#39;s an industry wide problem and realistically really hard to solve as traditional media have to compete with low-effort and low-quality internet sites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re at all familiar with the history of the so-called mainstream media, newspapers, TV, et all, what was originally considered to be &quot;news&quot; or &quot;newsworthy&quot; was a far cry from the mash-up and mix-up it serves people today. </p>

<p>Moreover, delivering and covering the most important news of the day was the main focus and most competitive aspect that existed between news sources and news providers. </p>

<p>People selected their newspapers mainly on that aspect and the networks that provided what people believed was the best and most accurate news coverage was one that they&#39;d also watch more and more often so far more money was spent on news programming than the advertising revenues that could be derived from them due to that. </p>

<p>Too many commercial breaks during the news was also a distinct turn-off for viewers that had to be avoided as much as possible that also contributed to that situation.</p>

<p>There was also such a thing and an important thing that was simply called &quot;hard news&quot; dealing specifically with critical national and international issues without any slant, spin, or editorializing along the way. </p>

<p>&quot;Business news&quot; was also a completely separate and far less important and compartmentalized topic altogether, both in terms of broadcasting and the business sections of daily newspapers. News that wasn&#39;t particularly important to anyone that didn&#39;t own a business or was wealthy enough to invest in stocks and bonds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fluff pieces and entertainment news and gossip was always left to the very end and would be lengthened or shortened depending on how much time was spent on the more important items. </p>

<p>The present and deliberate lack of priority diminishes the distinction between what is and isn&#39;t important or deserving of a follow-up with more details or not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The news here in Thailand is still very much like this. The reporters are very serious and it is just straight up news, funny shit comes at the end with the weather as it should.</p>

<p>Add to that the Prime Minister comes on TV once a week and actually talks about what the govt is doing to make Thailand more competitive in the world and how they plan on doing it. Actually fostering national pride instead of the divide and conquer tactics  we get in the USA.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like night and day walking around busy shopping malls on a Tuesday afternoon rather than the shuttered ghost towns of America. People actually look like they are looking forward to the future instead of fearing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are both behind the times and yet still in better and more honest times that North Americans once simply took for granted. </p>

<p>Undermined and sold down the river right along with all the rest whose actual importance wasn&#39;t realized until it was too late to actually do anything about it.</p>

<p>One of the alternate sources I&#39;ve often found useful and more informative with a different perspective on many major issues along with many issues that simply aren&#39;t covered at all by the North American media is the Asia Times that still makes some effort to present the often divergent views that exist throughout Asia and the Pacific.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch <em>Century of the Self</em>. Poke around at <a href="http://www.prmuseum.com">www.prmuseum.com</a> </p>

<p>Its the job of the reporter “to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.” I’m not even sure where I first heard that line, but it captures the way most journalists think about what they do. Translate the first part of that compassionate-sounding idea into the daily decisions about what makes news, and it is easy to fall into the habit of thinking that every person afflicted by something is entitled to help. Or, as liberals like to say, “Government is what we do together.” From there, it’s a short drive to the conclusion that every problem has a government solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every national news broadcast has become the Anti-Trump show. Even apolitical people are turning it off because it has become obvious that it simply propaganda. That is one of the redeeming qualities of Trump&#39;s presidency, it has forced the oligarchy to reveal itself to the masses. </p>
