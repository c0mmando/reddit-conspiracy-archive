       I dont know how to get the full stream ? Some people from the / nasa section should know- 
They only recently have been using this method (augmented virtual reality) to steal billions
They used to use normal cgi to fool your idiot asses - now we can actually tell the difference between virtual reality cgi to real live footage! But soon we wont! This is really important- they will be livestreaming elon musk on mars soon

       Why? Either to hide aliens r something
Or to hide the flat earth, the dome, the truth- if we knew we lived on a flat earth domed in an artificial environment we would want to get out! Probably aliens &amp; flat earth is the truth-
But simulation theory as well is true, there is evidence just search the double light slit experiment &amp; quantum entanglement ,spooky action at a distance
Who the knows whats correct, who wants to know? Delete the corruption &amp; find out, how do we start a new government?

       I was hoping to come here and see something better.  I'm fully ready to entertain the idea that NASA doesn't tell the full truth all the time, or that they do some things in space that isn't public knowledge.  But then i clicked the video link and it went to a flat Earth page.

       I've said it before and I'll say it again. There is going to come a time when the WILL send private citizens in to 'space' however they won't be looking out windows. What they will be looking at is liquid crystal monitors that will simulate what (insert private NASA type business here) wants you to see/and what you expect to see OUT OF A 'WINDOW'.  It's be nothing more than a very realistic depiction of what they have been lying about for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       A round earth? Sure. Stars? You bet!
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever it is they want you to see during their show, is what you'll see. It'll be a feast of the eyes. Too bad it won't be real.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, the most skeptical of truthers will either concede to that falsehood narrative, OR be labeled as truly insane. In any case; expect it.

       It'll be the same as when Elon Musk takes people to Mars (
       <a href="https://youtu.be/XP5_aWM62nM">
        as prophecy foretold
       </a>
       ). They'll say they are normal citizens but they will be actors like any astronaut. On TV we'll see the Mars Landing and the first steps, and we'll see their building of a society just like in the movie the Martian. It may as well be a Hollywood movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, remember, people get sucked into their TV and movies and get entranced. They love to watch it and believe it, and they will do the same with the fake Mars Landing. Just like truthers pointing out he Moon Landing was fake, the mindless drones will attack you for suggesting the Mars Landing will be fake. They want to believe, they
       <em>
        have to believe.

       Want to know NASAs big secret?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Golden Nugget and beyond. NASA knows of asteroids, locations on the moon, etc, that have more rare earth mineral that would crash the commodities market.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would usher in a new  era of amazing technological wonder, but would disrupt markets where established rich bastards might have to actually compete and adapt. So it is much easier creating war over the scarce resources of earth and getting that crack hit of oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if we spent 10% of what we spend on war getting resources from the solar system. The logistics and economy it would build.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the crime. That is why the professionally corrupt political bribers hate NASA. Because NASAs discoveries are a threat to thier profit motives. It means thier business needs to change and even through they are worth billions and can afford the most luxurious life and never ever have to worry about money - they refuse to evolve. In the process holding the entirety of mankind back, profiting off the suffering of others.

       Wow...  The “established rich bastards” would have strip mined the solar system years ago, were it possible.  These same elites OWN the government.  As if NASA would keep the materials for themselves  (and not give it straight to the “Rich Bastards”) or, more moronically, share it freely, collapsing the market???  Really??  Wake the **** up, Dude.

       They would rather keep the scarcity and war  increasing thier own value of hoarding what we have on earth than to bring about progress. This isn't NASA so much as it is the corrupt people who are depressing NASAs budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at what Goldman Sachs does in hoarding metals. What would happen to the value of those metals if on one shot a craft found more metal in a single rock in space than what they are hoarding on earth I order to manipulate markets? Thier value would plummet. There is value in mining. There is value in logistics. There is value in all the cool stuff we could have, but it is lazier and more greedy for these cats to maintain scarcity for themselves rather than invest in productivity because that means they have to share with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASAs budget is depressed for a reason and it isn't evil government program stealing your blood sweat and tears tax penny. You want a bloated government program eating your tax bucks, look at the military. There's a saucy budget flush full of fraud waste and abuse.

       This answers nothing as to why NASA lies and deceives. The moon landing, CGI earth, green screened ISS videos. The list is long. It’s our tax money and the defense of this corrupt agency shows just how low we have the bar for one another. NASA steals from us, deceives us, and presents fiction as fact. Why? It’s a government agency run by free masons and Nazis. I’m out of this thread. NASA defense team will be here shortly to slide this shit. Be well and raise the bar for yourself brother :)

       interesting.

       They can charge batteries for satellites and ships locally and then ship those charged batteries back and forth into deep space where solar isn't strong. Greatly extend the range of manned missions and power hungry telescopes and probes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could be pretty fast since there isn't much weight in just a logistics platform. (no need to support life) and we could quickly send them ahead of ships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then if they can beam that stuff back to earth, or relay it through a laser to other sats further out so we can increase the bandwidth of deep space ops rather than the trickle drops we get now.

       You have alluded to manufactured scarcity and how technology deployed by NASA could remedy those problems. You're spot on there. I'm going to direct you to a few resources regarding the  orbital ring space elevator, which is a project we could construct now and could deliver untold revenue:
