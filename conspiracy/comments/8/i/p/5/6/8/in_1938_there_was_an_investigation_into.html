    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the problem I&#39;m debating but your solution. Your idea is another committee to purge anyone associated with Israel or anyone suspected of being associated with Israel. You don&#39;t think that is a massively dangerous tool with the serious danger of becoming a political weapon (just like the HUAC)? If you don&#39;t want people with dual citizenships serving in government, why not start with a law against that? And make it apply to ALL dual citizenships. That would be better than jumping right into blacklists, purges, and more Mccarthyism. </p>
