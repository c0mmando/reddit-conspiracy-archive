    <div class="md"><p>Just take a look around and see what kinds of sexual activity are being promoted and which kinds are being suppressed.</p>

<p>Reproductive sex is only encouraged in a narrow range of circumstances, while for non-reproductive sex anything goes.</p>

<p>This explains why having a problem with authority gets labeled as &quot;oppositional defiant disorder&quot; and a guy who wants to become a woman is perfectly normal.</p>

<p>Nature has nothing to do with what&#39;s normal or not. That gets determined by what society needs (group vs individual). Right now, it looks like society wants zero population growth.</p>

<p>Actually I like that. Why? Because it means that my comment (and my idea) is getting their attention and triggering a cognitive dissonance reaction.</p>

<p>One sure fire sign of CD is an impulsive need to reject the idea, hence the downvotes. I might not be scoring karma, but the idea (and awareness) is getting out there... and that&#39;s worth a few downvotes any day.</p>

Becomes trans &amp; beats the shit out of women.  It’s offensive to say she shpuld be fighting men.  Public restrooms are biologically sexed.  If you cant have a period you do not need to use the restroom for biological females.  Transitioning children who are not 18 or older is child abuse.  Let them dress however they want - but giving them hormone replacement therapy is totally irresponsible.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t. You don&#39;t have gender separated toilets at home, do you? Does that cause a problem?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Becomes trans &amp; beats the shit out of women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one is forced to fight her. If other fighters considered her to have an unfair advantage, they can simply refuse to fight her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you cant have a period you do not need to use the restroom for biological females.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that excludes post-menopausal women. I guess you expect your grandmother to use the men&#39;s toilets...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let them dress however they want - but giving them hormone replacement therapy is totally irresponsible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some children, the opposite is true - forcing them to conform to your views of gender can lead to them becoming suicidal. That is just as abusive.</p>

<p>That <em>is</em> a difficult issue that needs to be carefully approached by professionals - it is not simply black and white, no matter how much you would want it to be.</p>

<p>But again, what has any of it got to do with <em>you</em>? It&#39;s none of <em>your</em> business unless <em>you</em> are considering it for you or one of your children.</p>

<p>No one is sticking their nose in <em>your</em> business, so keep your nose out of theirs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we differentiate sex and gender. Gender is a mental game, sex is a physical one. Its really simple, and I dont see why people have such a problem with understanding it.</p>

<p>In fact there other aspects to gender identity as well, such as orientation and expression, and theres something else I&#39;m forgetting. Point is: this is <em>gender theory,</em> in academia we use it to identify cultural phenomena and deconstruct it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>M2f trans.  biological sex is male.  Gender is female.  But dont point out that from a biological perspctive they are male or you are transphobic.  It is simple.  They way you discuss their biological sex they consider it to be hate speech.  Just because you feel like a woman doesnt mean you are one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes and no?</p>

<p>I, for example, don&#39;t call my foster brother Michael, his first name, I call him by his middle name, Percey, because he asks me to.</p>

<p>While on his birth vertificate his first name says Michael, everyone calls him Percey. Does this mean hes technically still Michael but merely identifies as Percey? Yeah, technically, but he doesnt like or respond to Michael.</p>

<p>Ysee, we&#39;re talking about identity, and worse, self identity, which essentially means &quot;this is how I see myself,&quot; or rather, &quot;this is who I am&quot; and while yes, technically their identity doesn&#39;t match the little gender modifier on their driver&#39;s licence, their self identity is <em>more important</em> than ... Well I guess <em>other people&#39;s conclusions about them.</em></p>

<p>There are exceptions, for example at a doctor&#39;s office, if the doctor asks for your gender, he probably means sex, which you should give him the accurate (note how I didnt say honest) answer to, as some conditions or diseases affect men and women differently.</p>

<p>But as far as most interactions with people, self-identity is one of the pillars of freedom. You dont question or try and undermine someone&#39;s identity if they identify as a pirate, or as a teacher, or as a father, or as a manwhore, or a runner, or a avid coca-cola enthusiast, so why would you if they identify as a woman, or dont identify at all, or as something random.</p>

<p>The core message is that it doesnt matter as much as society tells us it matters. :)</p>

<p>Am I helping or am I wasting my time? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite band has a trans lead singer.  I will call you by whatever pronouns &amp; names you want me to use.  But i will not deny science &amp; pretend as if you are something you are not when it comes to certain aspects of our society.  It not transphobic to keep restrooms biologically sexed.  This community is demanding respect &amp; giving none in return.</p>
