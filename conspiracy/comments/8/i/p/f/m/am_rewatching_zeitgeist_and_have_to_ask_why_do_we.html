    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad that you are correct. It&#39;s sad that people are more concerned with the latest celebrity scandal than the fact the G Bush jnr and Snr have walked free from creating a immoral war for profit that&#39;s killed thousands.</p>

<p>Also I think that accepting the &#39;conspiracy&#39; means realising that the government are NOT out to help you, they are NOT above killing innocent people for profit and that the media do NOT report news. </p>

<p>I think the best way of explaining the whole thing is showing someone the family guy episode where Peter and Lois&#39;s dad are trying to make money.
Peter comes out on a unicycle creating a distraction whilst Lois&#39;s dad tries stealing money from her purse.</p>

<p>Peter would be the media and Lois&#39;s dad would be the government and all the huge private company&#39;s and Lois would be the general population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are brainwashed. They <em>expect</em> the official story to hold up, because, to them, the reality of our government (or, more specifically, the MIC) doing it is too fantastical. They don&#39;t seriously look at the evidence at all. They don&#39;t let themselves get to the place, mentally, where they can look at the matter objectively, with no agenda. That element of it being too fantastical is always there, trumping the evidence. It&#39;s that whole big lie/little lie thing. Their minds are really an excellent example of people needing to retain comfort/their worldview. They don&#39;t know how to interact with a world in which the forces in control are sinister forces. That implies so many things. It implies that action in opposition is necessary, and it also implies that peace of mind, and an unconscious, contented, consumerist existence is no longer possible. People rail against that in desperation for the preservation of their current frame of mind. So what they do is join with the others in mockery, hoping it will work and the bad alternate reality will just go away.</p>

<p>I am not from the USA, so it&#39;s not really my government, but given the track record of previous administrations in general and that of Bush jr. in particular I really wouldn&#39;t put it past them. </p>

<p>The fact that it&#39;s possible doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s actually true however. I think the evidence to support such a claim is shaky at best. </p>

<p>Coming back to your original post however, my point is that you cannot marginalise other people based simply on their view point. Which is, from my perspective, what you are doing. This is a dangerous avenue you&#39;re on because you&#39;re blocking out competing views and focusing solely on evidence to support your pre-existing conclusion.</p>

<p>Maybe you should treat those who see things differently not at enemies or as being below your standard, but instead think of them as intellectual sparring partners. This is how I see you and other people here on Reddit. </p>

<p>The primary claim to be considered is the official story. Critics of 9/11 Truth present themselves as attacking conspiracy theories. I consider that to be misdirection. Obviously alternatives to the official story get discussed, but they are secondary. </p>

<p>Do you look with skepticism at the official story? I do, and find it quite lacking in credibility. If you see no problems with it, that&#39;s fine. In that case don&#39;t bother yourself with alternative theories. </p>

<p>I got a similar reaction in the Socialist subreddit for questioning and criticising Socialism.  I don&#39;t agree at all.  These are open forums and this is a place to discuss conspiracies, whether you believe them or not.</p>

<p>I also argued against supposed &quot;chemtrails&quot; and got downvoted simply for entering into a critique of some supposed evidence.  </p>

<p>Right. And you should have. It&#39;s a place for socialists to talk about socialism. The tenets of socialism are not in doubt there just like the tenets of Christianity are not in doubt in a church. There are a million comparisons I could make. </p>

<p>Subreddits that say they&#39;re one thing shouldn&#39;t be hostile to the thing they say they are. If anything, they should be hostile to things they&#39;re not. I never go into the capitalist or Libertarian subreddit or the anti-conspiracy subreddit, or whatever. I let them have their place. All I ask is they let us have ours. </p>

<p>Have you ever not wanted to defend your beliefs because you either didn&#39;t have the energy or because you thought it was pointless?</p>

<p>Nonsense.  It&#39;s a place for topics relevant to Socialism to be discussed.</p>

<p>Nobody is hostile to the concept of conspiracies.  Only the insane or willfully obtuse could claim that nobody ever conspires.  Just because you believe some things are conspiracies does not mean you believe <em>all</em> conspiracies.</p>

<p>I for one do not believe the official story about 9/11, therefore I believe there was a different conspiracy.  I am, in common parlance, a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; regarding 9/11.  However, when people posit nonsensical conspiracy theories I might try to debunk them, even in the Conspiracy Reddit.  This is entirely appropriate.</p>

<p>But not a place to proselytize other belief systems. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But 9/11 isn&#39;t just some conspiracy theory. It&#39;s, like, the biggest one. And its pretty much proven. Anyone who is going to constantly try to debunk 9/11 truth doesn&#39;t belong here IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes. So?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is that place where you shouldn&#39;t have to defend what should be accepted as truth, because that would make this something other than the conspiracy reddit. It would make it the conspiracy vs. non-conspiracy reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who says we buy it?</p>

<p>As a firsthand witness to the Pentagon crash, I can safely say that it was in fact a chrome colored American Airlines flight that hit the Pentagon.  One of the severed light poles nearly hit my car, and I watched the approach and the impact.</p>

<p>That said, was it a Muslim terrorist in control of the plane?  Was it really an American Airlines plane?  I only saw the plane hit.  I cannot confirm who was piloting or if the flight was a dummy plane or not.</p>

<p>I simply do not buy the official story because there are too many holes.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I have never seen Zeitgeist, and likely never will.  I prefer my information to be based on solid fact, and not on speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was never contacted by the FBI.  After the Pentagon attack, I waited in the traffic, and was eventually let through.  The FBI didn&#39;t contact everyone that day.  There were hundreds of cars involved in that backup, all within perfect viewing distance of the crash.  I would suppose they would have done their sampling at random.</p>

<p>I only wish I was one of the ones interviewed, as I, even at that time, had a fairly good knowledge and understanding of current airlines and aviation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iraq war isn&#39;t a big plot, but we&#39;re wasting trillions of dollars on it. Yeah, it&#39;s not a big plot, but we&#39;ve got over 150k people over there. It&#39;s not a big plot, but they&#39;ve been plotting it for over 10 years. Let me guess: You still think osama bin laden is a big part of it, huh?</p>

<p>You know what your problem is? You don&#39;t go on facts. Look at what you wrote. It&#39;s full of &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I feel&quot; or &quot;it seems&quot;. You&#39;re a total sheeple trapped in their emotional psy-op. Of course, you&#39;ll get all defensive and deny it, but don&#39;t feel so bad. They got most of the entire country trapped in their emotional psy-op; that&#39;s why you&#39;re considered a sheeple, part of the herd. That&#39;s why they showed the planes crashing into the WTC over and over for weeks, to stun the collective conscience of the USA, make us feel helpless, and beg for them to do something to save us. Then these people come out and trump up Hussein, his &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; and the potential for a &quot;mushroom&quot; cloud. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve really got you fooled, but all you want to debate about is whether his plan &quot;seems&quot; right to you instead of what actually went on. In other words, you want to dismiss illogical real world events (911 ---&gt; saudi terrorists ---&gt; attack iraq) and argue about some fantasy agenda that suits your illogical world.</p>

<p>Perfectly? Not even close. Plausible? Yes if you stretch the definition of &quot;plausible&quot; a little bit... I&#39;d say the NIST report on the twin towers did show it wasn&#39;t impossible (but unlikely) for the towers to collapse, but it didn&#39;t address the really curios way the collapse actually occurred... </p>

<p>Now if you consider <strong>both</strong> unlikely events happened, plus even less likely wtc7 collapse, the divine intervention is only way terrists could get it done... what was the saying? &quot;Once is a happenstance, twice is a coincidence, three times is Allah intervention...&quot; ;)</p>

<p>As already discussed in this section, we talked about what caused the buildings to collapse and how they collapsed. It may look like a controlled demolition, but it is not. When floors began to collapse upon one another with a tremendous weight below them, the only way to go is down. That said, it may &quot;look&quot; like a controlled demolition, but believe it or not, that&#39;s just how buildings generally fall down, regardless. I imagine people expect when a massive building falls for it to fall over like a small building, but this simply is not the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the speaker is making up fake physics one should not be surprised there&#39;s no citation.  Unless you know what tall building naturally collapsing he&#39;s talking about?  Oh right, never, ever happened.  </p>

<p>So, we have your favorite debunker caught red handed making up lies.  Does that make you think some of his other arguments might be wrong?  Or consider this stellar logic...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NIST reports that pockets of fire hit 1832 Fahrenheit, caused by the burning of various materials in the building, including rugs, curtains, furniture, and paper [34].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the citation number 34 says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He says that while the jet fuel was the catalyst for the WTC fires, the resulting inferno was intensified by the combustible material inside the buildings, including rugs, curtains, furniture and paper. NIST reports that pockets of fire hit 1832°F. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your friend the debunker is clearly not a fan of thermodynamics.  Carpet, paper etc. physically cannot burn at 1832 F in 1 atm of 21% O2 air.  The NIST&#39;s lackluster logic is that some steal was heated to a temperature which would theoretically require 1832 F fire, so therefore 1832 F fires existed.  Can you say &quot;Ad Hoc?&quot;  </p>

<p>Your debunker&#39;s site is just as short on actual science and logic as most conspiracy theory sites.  Take another look at his arguments, but this time think &quot;does this really contradict the argument from Zeitgeist with rational arguments?&quot;  </p>

<p>Dude, look at the news/video footage. Do you not believe that it was 2 large aircraft, loaded with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel that hit the WTC?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal.  Some people may not want to believe that radical muslim terrorists are capable of doing terrible things (never mind the cultural suppression/oppression of women, etc., etc. etc. (the parade of horribles perpetrated by fundamentalists of any religion is too long to get into), and would much rather find a way of blaming rich white Americans/Jews/global elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>debunking911.com is written in such an irritating adversarial style, much like the annoying fractious arguments we often see here.</p>

<p>Popularmechanics, while otherwise one of my favourite magazines, never looked at the questions objectively.  To quote their intro:
&quot;In the end, <strong>we were able to debunk</strong> each of these assertions with hard evidence and a healthy dose of common sense. We learned that a few theories are based on something as innocent as a reporting error on that chaotic day. Others are the <strong>byproducts of cynical imaginations that aim to inject suspicion and animosity into public debate</strong>. Only by confronting such <strong>poisonous claims</strong> with irrefutable facts can we understand what really happened on a day that is forever seared into world history.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s doubtful that the West is so consumed with self hate that they would prefer to blame their own leaders, rather than islamic extremists.  Look at the level of hate engendered in the general population towards the islamic world, post 911.
i.e. people want to believe the official story because it&#39;s more comfortable that way.  However all these question marks arise, making it difficult to do so.</p>

It&#39;s one thing to point out the problems, but what so few people do from there is to offer a solution.  To take a stand and say, this is the direction that we should focus on.  To illustrate the fact that the only reason we aren&#39;t there yet is because of the faults of our society.</p>

<p>But I have to warn you the guy that&#39;s done these videos is Christian so he&#39;s got a bit of an angle too. I disagree with his Christian view point, but I think he&#39;s right that there&#39;s been a new age infiltration of the truth movement.</p>

<p>I got a similar reaction in the Socialist subreddit for questioning and criticising Socialism.</p>

<p>Right. And you should have. It&#39;s a place for socialists to talk about socialism. The tenets of socialism are not in doubt there just like the tenets of Christianity are not in doubt in a church. There are a million comparisons I could make. </p>

<p>Subreddits that say they&#39;re one thing shouldn&#39;t be hostile to the thing they say they are. If anything, they should be hostile to things they&#39;re not. I never go into the capitalist or Libertarian subreddit or the anti-conspiracy subreddit, or whatever. I let them have their place. All I ask is they let us have ours. </p>

<p>Have you ever not wanted to defend your beliefs because you either didn&#39;t have the energy or because you thought it was pointless?</p>

<p>But not a place to proselytize other belief systems. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, when people posited nonsensical conspiracy theories I might try to debunk them in, even in the Conspiracy Reddit. This is entirely appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But 9/11 isn&#39;t just some conspiracy theory. It&#39;s, like, the biggest one. And its pretty much proven. Anyone who is going to constantly try to debunk 9/11 truth doesn&#39;t belong here IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes. So?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is that place where you shouldn&#39;t have to defend what should be accepted as truth, because that would make this something other than the conspiracy reddit. It would make it the conspiracy vs. non-conspiracy reddit. </p>

<p>As opposed to sitting around watching the television and the msm waiting for a possible alternative theory to &quot;actually&quot; get some exposure, I&#39;d say watching zeitgeist (and other derivatives and / or similar productions) is actually the willful seeking of alternative theory.</p>
