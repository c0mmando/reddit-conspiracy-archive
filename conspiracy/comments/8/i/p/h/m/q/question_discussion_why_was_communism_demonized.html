      <p>
       Looking to seek out what you know, and your opinions about the demonisation of Communism in the 20th century.  I am trying to summarise what I know to be concise and informed.  I’d value the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       My basic theory, which I’d like feedback on is this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The demonisation of Communism (and Socialist governments) is, bottom line, about the minority elites owning everything, and staying rich.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The 1800’s saw Monarchial rule overthrown across the globe.  The Elites saw the threat of losing power, property and resources, and wealth.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The US supported the Czar of Russia and sent a military expedition in 1917
to counter the revolution
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         World War 2 ended with the two super powers (Anglo-Anerican vs. Soviet) fighting for the control of the world especially Europe and developing nations (Latin America)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       ** - At the end of WW2 The US adopted the philosophy that they ought to control the world ** and have since exerted effort toward complete hegemony.  The Soviet Bloc’s expansionism was a threat to that
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Communism contains labour force empowering ideals that would undermine established wealth and private property
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Elites fear empowering the labour force who may turn against them, revolt in violence, and shut down profitable industry (unions striking, the cost and hassle of labour laws and equality)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The argument that Communism erodes human rights (the oft heard rhetoric about democracy) is a red herring as an examination of both the West and East show totalitarian and fascist mistreatment of the populace and other nations (as in coups)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It also boils down to something I heard about the historical ‘inventorying’ of the finite resources of the planet and seeking to own and control them
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Western hatred of Communism is also fuelled by the Marxist-Leninist stated objectives to undermine the West
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Catholic church finds the inherent atheism of Communism a threat and wicked (so like a religious and morsl crusade)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Communism can involve closed, protectionist economy that cannot be exploited by foreign markets
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Those are some of major “why” answers.  It’s multi-factorial in nature, surely.  I’m trying to organise this a bit better and include the most salient bits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks in advance for your feedback and sharing what you know and your opinions!

       Communism was demonized because it was hijacked by fools that created the USSR and CCCP- two states that were/are definitely not Communist except in name, and that perpetrated many atrocities against their own people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism as an ideal endgame isn't a bad thing. But all attempted implementations have fallen victim to human nature. I don't think we will accomplish real Socialism/Communism until we establish a post-scarcity environment- and that is easier said than done.

       You’ve clearly never lived under Communist rule. All these pseudo-intellectuals living in the West who think Communism is good would not survive a day in it. The only reason you think it would be good for you is because you’ve never witnessed it first hand.

       you can see there's about an even split of people in former soviet countries that thought communism was better than capitalism.  clearly not the black and white picture you painted in your original comment.

       He's a professor of psychology but that doesn't mean he can't talk intelligently about political theory.  He can't talk intelligently about Marxism because he has never read a primary source on Marxism.  In other words, he's talking out of his ass.

       For fucks sake he read the entire gulag archipelago which I couldn't even finish out of sheer boredom and staleness.  There is only so many ways to deprive people of their dignity and live.

       But out of curiosity what is the source of your claim that he has never read a primary source on Marxism, and be specific.  What do you qualify as a primary source on Marxism?  Obviously I would assume Marx himself is a primary source but if linked a video of Peterson discussing his detailed studies of Marx's writings you would probably move the goal posts.

       Welp I wasted 12 minutes trying to find where during the video he makes a specific critique of Marxist theory.  He doesn't argue with any familiarity of theory or texts.  He's arguing non-specifically like a poor student who has not done the assigned reading.

       Lol it's funny really. How modern defenders of communism are a holographic copy of the same people who caused so many millions to die in the past.  Any criticism is explained away, dissidents are just purged and their service to the revolution glossed over.  Hilarious, it's like a performance art.

       Okay well a process of historical development is just a fruity way of saying history.  Which is probably accurate since you're all obsessed with a failed ideology from history.  One that was born in the same cradle as Nazism and only survived a little longer than Nazism because of mutually assured destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're honest with ourselves here Nazism would have survived longer than Communism if both had been left alone to experience the "process of historical development".  Thank God that's not the case it's bad enough we had to put up with communist as long as we did.

       I discuss ideas and theories too, that's why we're talking.  You seem to prefer to spend more time discussing the faults of the person presenting the ideas, like your criticisms of Jordan Peterson and I instead of considering the merits of the philosophies like Marxism/capitalism.  The entire reason I'm talking to you is that you failed to defend Marxism and instead attacked Peterson as ignorant of Karl Marx.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guarantee you that Peterson is familiar with Marx's writings regardless of the fact he doesn't promote them.

       Yes we have handled some dissidents poorly.  But it's a testimonial to the superiority of our society and government that there hasn't been 100,000,000 "dissidents" and that we don't actually have a law on the books criminalizing dissident behavior.

       But you discount any that doesn't frame communist Utopia as great and splendid.  There is no historical literature about it's implementation that isn't negative in it's totality.  We literally have evidence that it devolves into a purge feast.

       No.  There is a lot of contradiction among the Marxist writers.  Trotsky and Luxembourg have problems with Lenin.  Michael Parenti wholeheartedly disagrees with Noam Chomsky, and to a lesser extent, Richard Wolff.  We fight amongst ourselves over the best way forward. We generally agree on the end goal of equitable distribution of produced wealth but there is a lot of disagreement on how to administer it and the strategies to get there.  We have a goal.  We are in the debating stage of formulating the process to get there.

       You have no familiarity with theory and neither does Peterson.  You both are posers.  It's like if I went to the American Medical Association and spout the argument that bloodletting is a viable medical procedure because I read some quacks who support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot formulate the Why and the How the theory is invalid without resorting the arbitrary "human nature" argument and the small data sample of the last century.  You also ignore the dynamics of geopolitics among the players and make false comparisons.  Cuba under Castro is better than Cuba under Batista.  Cuba is not as good as Canada because Canada industrialized 100 years before Cuba and the US does not impose a trade embargo on Canada.  I am a History major.  90 years is a blink in the timespan of human development.

       The numbers of the purge are greatly exaggerated by Timothy Snyder.  He doesn't have the documents to back it up.  Wikipedia is pop-culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purges of counter-revolutionary agents are necessary otherwise the revolution fails, the old regime gets back into power, and the revolutionaries are executed.  This happens in every revolution.  If Robespierre didn't implement the Reign of Terror, the French Revolution would have failed and there would be no liberal ideological model for the American Revolution to copy, so it too would never have happened.  Benedict Arnold was purged.

       Oh? What haven't I read? I've read capital volumes one and two, the manifesto, Collier's Marx, countless works by US socialists, namely Norman Thompson (he's legit), dialectic of enlightenment, one thousand plateaus, Adorno "the culture industry", Lenin "On labour unions", among other smaller works. The fact that you choose not to even engage in discussion with someone critical of your world view clearly shows the religious nature of your belief system, or B.S.

       My problems arise in a metaphysical sence. Capitalism and communism are a false dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am neither.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem isn't with Marxism and its critique of capitalism, it is with the poor knowledge of human nature and incentive systems. Marxism works on paper, but when applied greed overrides the greater good of "communism".

       I agree with you that capitalism and communism is a false dichotomy.  They don't oppose each other as much as one will grow out of the death of the other.  Capitalism will kill itself through it's internal process of concentration and force societies to choose between domination of the rich against the poor or the domination of the poor against the rich.  Either way, there will be violence.  Just as capitalism grew from the death of feudalism after a period of bloody revolution, so will communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marx's critique of capitalism is almost universally accepted as accurate.  How to replace it is the next step and no one has yet figured out how do that.  And that's OK.  It's a work in progress.  Greed and corruption applies to every system.  It is not unique to communism.  There's no easy answer, it's up to the people to democratically punish and remove corrupt leaders.  That will be part of the struggle. It's a long process.

       Capitalism is not the same now as it was in it's early stages.  Corporatism is the stage of capitalism where the power of the bourgeois outgrows democracy itself and takes over the levers of the state.  There is no purely free market.  It has never existed and never will exist.  A
       <em>
        free
       </em>
       market is more of a utopian construct than communism.

       The theory is incomplete.  There is infighting so far among socialists between Anarchists who want to skip the hard part of defeating the bourgeoisie and Marxist-Leninists like myself who recognize the need for a temporary centralized state to defeat the bourgeoisie.  I agree with Lenin that after the revolution all power should go to the soviets, that is, local control of the economy.

       ... I'm not the only person who writes on the subject of anarcho monarchism. I assure you it is a sound political philosophy. Just because you dismiss it doesn't dismiss the existing academia on the subject.

       I agree about artificial scarcity.  There is enough to go around but the greedy don't want to share.  I disagree about controlling your own destiny.  We live in society.  We are not atoms.  We work together or we perish separately.

       Yes, we make choices individually but individually we are all largely influenced by the way we were brought up i.e. the dominant ideology.  Yes I believe we are a product of the accrued culture of human civilization and more specifically our local culture, also allowing for unique permutations.

       Because reading the Communist Manifesto is so hard that it requires some sort of bullshit degree to understand it? Fuck that. Peterson has nailed it on the head and you only have to look around and listen to what these radical leftists are spewing to verify it.

       What do you think works then? No matter what way it’s ran, it fucking blows, that’s the reality of life. But under capitalism, an individual has many more chances to improve their life than under communism.

       I’m a pessimist.  I don’t think there’s anything that would work (that I am aware of).  Life sucks that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do appreciate people who have devoted their lives looking for an answer.  If people have good intentions toward improving the society and the lives of others, that counts for something.  That said, I can understand the position that results and outcomes are the best measure and that the proverb is true:  the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don’t think that oohing over the perceived benefits of Capitalism is a positive because it encourages a wilful blindness to history, present corruption, and the unfulfilled dreams of many and plays in to the ‘complacent sheep herd’ mentality that is conspiracy fact.

       You should consider nihilism instead, it’s much more fulfilling than good old pessimism. I agree, life sucks, but there is nothing we can do. Both systems suck, but the reason we are capitalist is the reason we can say that.

       The truth about both communism and capitalism is politically incorrect and therefore impossible to discuss on public forums like this, but essentially both are variations of the same thing, invented by the same group, benefiting the same group, the same organized crime syndicate.

There is a ton of academic research that goes against the myths of communist horrors, totalitarianism, and general badness propagated in the popular media but you need to look for it because you will never hear it on TV.

       Socialism/communism is in it's infancy.  The theory is still being developed.  The countries that have tried to implement it are first trials, experiments.  It took thousands of years for civilization to go from slavery to feudalism to capitalism.

       Mao was right.  After overthrowing the bourgeois state the new socialist state needs to institute a cultural revolution to destroy the lingering capitalist ideology.  The Bolsheviks failed to do this and let revisionist opportunists such as Krushchev and Brezhnev worm their way into the leadership and diverge from Lenin's doctrine of "all power to the soviets".  Soviet means workers' council.

       The theory is incomplete.  There is infighting so far among socialists between Anarchists who want to skip the hard part of defeating the bourgeoisie and Marxist-Leninists like myself who recognize the need for a temporary centralized state to defeat the bourgeoisie.  I agree with Lenin that after the revolution all power should go to the soviets, that is, local control of the economy.
