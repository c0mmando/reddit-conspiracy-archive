       When I was a young child, I was taught stories about 'ancient Egypt', and the pyramids captured my imagination. I was amazed that they had been built thousands of years ago by slaves. Then a few years later, the story changed: apparently they were built by workers who were paid in beer and/or other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       This never sat well with me: how could the story change so suddenly, thousands of years after the fact? How did the story change while I was still in school?
      </p>
      <p>
       One day a couple of years ago, I decided to look into the sources of these stories. What are the texts or papyri or tablets (or anything) which modern historians use to determine what happened thousands of years ago? With the benefit of the internet and search engines and archive.org it is now very easy (although time-consuming) to trace through the sources back to their primary point: to the
       <em>
        heart
       </em>
       of the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I discovered shocked me to the core of my miserable soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I am skeptical of all stories of ancient history. Take for instance the 'Pilate Stone'.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCe9kDFnCkk">
        This ten-minute video
       </a>
       explains how the 'Pilate Stone' is a classic example of 'ancient history' being just like the emperor's new clothes: people believe (or go along with) the story because they are afraid of being called stupid for asking questions, or pointing out the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it time for us to get over this fear and start asking the obvious questions?

       I know bro, I find the percision cuts at machu pichu even more impressive because because they are tighter, the rock is harder, and the fit is non linear, but I also believe that given enough people and time even a primitive culture can achieve those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandstone can be polished down pretty easily. So can the marble that coated the sandstone, although that stone is denser and the marble was likely even more a challenge. Also, the bronze cap was huge and pretty amazing, bit the design itself is pretty primitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its filled with spaces to decrease weight on the burial chamber tunneled into it. Its a very fancy burial mound. We actually have found the results of their failed pyramids (built to steeply and collapsed0 and the adjustment to future pyramids (the bent pyramid) and the the small pyramids leading up to this.

      <p>
       But I am sick of step2thejep attacking people's evidence and empiric thinking with none of his own.

       Right after laser transits were invented the Great Pyramid was surveyed with one and the baselines were discovered to be out of true by less than 1/8" on each of it's corners on a structure that covers an area that's about the size of six football fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with laser transits and the best bricklayers in the world we can't even build an ordinary 25' x 45' house without being at least a few inches or more out of alignment that that roof has to be jiggered to compensate for and that's not for any want of trying. Getting it perfect, quite frankly, is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Large skyscrapers are often out of true by several feet and even several yards in some cases, once again, not for any want of trying because it's extremely costly and complicated to compensate for but architects always have to budget for it because it's always going to happen to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can do no more than to be "fairly" or "reasonably" accurate no matter how hard we try.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whoever built the Great Pyramid had to have a method of aligning the base of it that was as accurate as a laser and also had to be capable of laying stones weighing many tons in an absolutely perfect position in relation to one another over a 750' stretch on each of it's four sides and simultaneously in perfect alignment with the four points of the compass. Given the length of time since it was built and the kind of geological shifting that could be expected the small discrepancy that presently exists in all likelihood wasn't there at all when it was built.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short it was "perfectly aligned", and even as it stands it's an absolutely amazing feat of architecture and engineering we lack the capability to do.

       Does it matter how long ago in some distant past the humans who created the Great Pyramid actually lived?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point is that we are unable to duplicate such a monumental feat the way that whoever did managed to; or anywhere near as precise out such difficult materials and there are no records of any kind relating to it being built or who was actually responsible for it's construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of speculation, and yes, you could call the educated guess that is generally taught about that, "a tale" and an insubstantial one at that and there also great many people, myself included, don't happen to subscribe to it because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It remains a mystery and an enigma and has always been one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it bother you in some way to discuss or speculate about such remarkable artifacts from the distant past?
      </p>
      <p>
       What stands on the Giza plateau is also a self-evident physical fact that can be observed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also very ancient and as far as anyone can tell has always been there. By all indications it is of human design and execution. How it was managed is as yet unknown but it speaks of a knowledge and abilities that in many ways surpass our own.

       To you, perhaps, but all that survives from any far distant past are stories passed-down, told and retold, with accumulated distortions and novel enhancements, ultimately becoming the stuff of legends and myths to be taken with a grain of salt or a big blue cow-lick in many instances.
      </p>
      <p>
       It in no way detracts, however, from any substantial artifacts that still remain and can be seen and judged for what they are and what they indicate about whoever created them.

       It reviews ancient tablets found that give a different garden of Eden story and reviews mistranslations.

       Basically the garden was a slave camp for humans when you read the story from another source. Interresting.

       Yeah I have. For quite a moment. Those pyramids are absurd. Our buildings today pale in comparison in what they achieved there.

       My understanding is that they generally claim that ancient history is real, but the dates/timelines are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am asking is, why do we believe 'ancient history'
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       happened?

       Right after laser transits were invented the Great Pyramid was surveyed with one and the baselines were discovered to be out of true by less than 1/8" on each of it's corners on a structure that covers an area that's about the size of six football fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with laser transits and the best bricklayers in the world we can't even build an ordinary 25' x 45' house without being at least a few inches or more out of alignment that that roof has to be jiggered to compensate for and that's not for any want of trying. Getting it perfect, quite frankly, is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Large skyscrapers are often out of true by several feet and even several yards in some cases, once again, not for any want of trying because it's extremely costly and complicated to compensate for but architects always have to budget for it because it's always going to happen to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can do no more than to be "fairly" or "reasonably" accurate no matter how hard we try.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whoever built the Great Pyramid had to have a method of aligning the base of it that was as accurate as a laser and also had to be capable of laying stones weighing many tons in an absolutely perfect position in relation to one another over a 750' stretch on each of it's four sides and simultaneously in perfect alignment with the four points of the compass. Given the length of time since it was built and the kind of geological shifting that could be expected the small discrepancy that presently exists in all likelihood wasn't there at all when it was built.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short it was "perfectly aligned", and even as it stands it's an absolutely amazing feat of architecture and engineering we lack the capability to do.
