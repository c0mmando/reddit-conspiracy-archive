       This sub is tired of western media propaganda telling us we should be terrified of everything and support our government when it gets involved in shit that has nothing to do with us. It's getting old and someone made a sub to expose this. This might not be the sub for you if you're just gonna regurgitate the MSM.

       It's not either 1 or 0. Perhaps it's 0.101. How the heck can you perceive that if everyone is a good or bad guy? Iran is more complicated than good guy or bad guy. They've been wronged by the west pretty badly and fear being oppressed by us. Yet, our culture seeps into their lives. They also are fighting for rights against their religion. They are humans evolving socially. How ignorant it is to condemn them for not being at our current level. The more chaos we give them, the slower the process may go, but that suits the psychopaths in our country we allow to run wild causing wars. How advanced we are in comparison to a country that hasn't invaded a neighbor for 200 years? It's not 1 or 0 as we can all see if we can see in color.

       They are still a threat, and they will and probably have made weapons...and they probably eventually I'll use them. Maybe "bad guy" might not be the correct wording, but they are a threat. That's a fact.

      <p>
       The Iran deal was much conceded on and flawed and its likely they are way ahead of what we think they are.

       Are they a threat? Well, according to New York daily news.

       is a Boston Globe article that sheds some light on what foreign policy really is. Trying to spread propaganda isn't going to help our situation in the US.

        Operation Mockingbird
       </a>
       is a thing. You should look into how and why your information was created. Who do we rely on if the world is as the western media says it is? Hmmm... the same agencies that created Operation Mockingbird. So, they create OM, control what you believe to be reality, they create a reality in which you believe they are necessary. It protects them against people like JFK who would have them dismantled.

       Lol. Do you have a source? If it's the western media, the same western media that backs the White Helmets and pushed for a knee jerk reaction to an accusation in Syria? It's simple not credible. You're not going to convince me of anything using the western MSM narrative. They are propaganda. That's not an endorsement of anything else, but they are definitely propaganda. Ever heard of

       I keep hearing about all these countries that want death to America but all I see is the US letter agencies spreading fear propaganda to convince us we need them to protect us. Meanwhile, they get to run all their black projects and drug smuggling operations with complete immunity. I remember when they said Saddam had WMDs. Do you? It's was all bullshit. But you would have us forget all about shit like that.

       Iran is crazy and immoral, we made them that way. The only reason radical Shia Islam was able to gain state power was because the US disposed a secular republic and established a right wing monarch. The US is responsible for the state of Iran today.

       I support Iran. I believe they have a right to defend themselves against the US as best as they can. history dictates they sure as fuck need to.

       Does no one know we have messed with Iran a great deal in the past? Fixing elections so corrupt politicians were in power that would play ball with th US?

        The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup d'état (Persian: کودتای ۲۸ مرداد‎), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name "Operation Boot") and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project[5] or "Operation Ajax").[6][7][8][9]
       </p>
       <p>
        In August 2013, 60 years afterward, the American CIA admitted that it was in charge of both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda.[18][19] The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out "under CIA direction" and "as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government".[20] **TLDR the CIA admited they are pieces of shit and over threw a democratically elected government to replace one that would

       <li>
        no, they don't hate us for our freedoms, they hate us because we keep making wars there and bullying them. I don't blame them for being pissed and feeling like they need nuclear weapons to defend against US shenanigans.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Thats is the key to why the US does not want them to have nuclear weapons.If you think about it, it is also why TPTB are continuously moving to take our guns.

       So- Iranians hate the US for invading their country, removing the democratically elected officials that were in place, and the citizens  liked, an replacing them corrupt fucks that screwed the population over.

       How would you feel if another country kept overthrowing your democratically elected government, hiring mercs to kill innocent people, arming civilians to kill people and basically conducting operations to ensure there is constant unrest unless Iran gives the US whatever the US wants.

       You are correct. It is too bad you do not realize that it is so we can continue to control their oil and government by bullying, murder, inciting revolt, and covert operations.
