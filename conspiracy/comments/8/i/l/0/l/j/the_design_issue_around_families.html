    <div class="md"><p>what i&#39;m talking about is that the device of families as a ratchet towards genetic improvement creates selfish incentives to maintain the &quot;genetic value&quot;.  </p>

<p>to rephrase this.  imagine you go build something special and you make yourself rich.  now you and your family is cursed with maintaining this advantage.</p>

<p>the psychological modes associated with wanting to &quot;retain value&quot; are suboptimal.  all it does is reduce the set of people who can &quot;compete&quot;.  narrower and narrower.  </p>

<p>so when the predominant structural pattern of families running things becomes, well, predominant, it&#39;s a manifestation of an anti-pattern that leads us to shit.  nobody is talking about how to ameliorate this anti-pattern.  and the people who are &quot;family&quot; sure as shit can&#39;t change it.  why would they?  what&#39;s their incentive.  </p>

<p>it leads a slow death of collective capacity.  and the driver is self-interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the latter is just a manifestation of the pattern i&#39;m talking about in general with families.  </p>

<p>i&#39;m not against families btw.  i think that they are very useful devices.  it&#39;s just that the design of families exacerbates selfishness without external checks against it.  and we can see how that evolves as our current society is basically the product of such a machine.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not sure i agree completely.  the underlying behavioural driver is selfishness.  if you&#39;re in a successful family that driver towards selfishness will be contextual to the family itself.  that is, the family will manifest the collective selfishness.  absent the family part the selfishness is contextual to the individual.  basically the machine of selfishness is contextual to the receiver of benefit.   i reckon the same pattern of selfishness could be expanded to include states, countries, and it move ever larger and larger, <em>if</em> it&#39;s perceived by those groups that there is something of value to persist.  this general pattern in inherent in our psychology, and we&#39;re mostly blind to it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct, your point is obviously expanded to include states etc. but by doing so the result is that the pattern you have discovered is unremarkable. Yes individuals and groups of any size are likely to act in their own best interests and in individuals within that group will sacrifice some of their self determination in favour of the group. This is fairly obvious and that is why we aren’t having a societal level conversation on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>indeed.  but we should be talking about it and trying to understand how to minimize the drivers of it, because it manifests as collective self-destruction.  so we wake up to that or we don&#39;t.  eventually some group will.   and they may isolate themselves from everyone else who, for whatever reason (possibly breeding), can&#39;t understand it.  i know if i were presented with a choice of living/working with people who grokked the self-destructive pattern and avoided it, and those who were bred to be selfish, the choice would be clear.  caveat emptor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sensory overload is a thing.  A &quot;healthy&quot; family unit allows you to process and adopt a certain worldview, whether it&#39;s right or wrong.  But you can develop this as a kid grows up.  Without the family guidance, you&#39;d be subjected to either 1000&#39;s of worldviews from every agenda pushing idiot out there, or one from a &quot;higher&quot; authority, i.e. government.  Our masses are a bunch of unthinking fools, and our governments are filled with murdering psychopaths.</p>

<p>My family taught me a lot of backwards shit, but I&#39;d take my chances with them over the alternatives, every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the anthropological term for what you are talking about is avunculate, specifically how Levi-Strauss uses it to describe the design mechanism that extends the family capacity into an empire - like a keystone in an arch, without the avuncular being a presumption there is no structure towards which to build ... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avunculate">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avunculate</a> ... The wiki makes it sound like it applies exclusively to exotic societies but this is just how anthropologists are trained to talk about what&#39;s happening in their own society.  Please mind the gap, there are plenty of non-avunculate families and cultures and this should raise good questions. </p>
