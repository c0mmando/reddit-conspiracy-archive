At least some of these parasitic entities are in fact interdimensional. The first step to combating these pesky vampires is to acknowledge they exist, and realize the many ways in which they attempt to provoke a reaction, both individually and on the collective consciousness. Each of us emits electromagnetic radiation from our bodies and this energy can be harvested by malevolent entities. It’s important to be aware of the energy that we are putting out into the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok few questions here : </p>

<ul>
<li>How do you truly know that there is a parasitic consciouscness feeding of your fears and sadness ?</li>
<li>What if you have learnt to manage fears and keep yourself happy from small things in life and don&#39;t really give a shit anymore ?</li>
<li>How do we know it feeds exactly from electromagnetic radiations ? </li>
<li>Why are they malevolent ? Maybe they are feeding from bad emotions ? 
-&gt; Just to emphasize on the bad emotions, i&#39;ve learnt to embrace my negativeness and makes it stronger in terms of enjoying anything that I feel which makes me happier. Even being sad makes me happy because it is a strong feeling on the other end of the spectrum. Why would an entity not just feed on hapiness ? why only sadness ? I mean in both cases, those are producing the same amount of energies right ? </li>
<li>What would be the end game here for those &quot;parasites&quot; ? </li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><strong>I am not even trying to understand</strong> at this point. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had the same questions as you do about 20 years ago. </p>

<p>At the time,  I was in school to become a massage therapist. One day,  our instructors deviated from massage techniques and taught us how to balance the chakras (energy centers) of another person by using the inherent difference in electrical polarity which exists between the extremities and opposing symmetry planes of every single human body. </p>

<p>I was blown away,  because I felt sensations I&#39;ve never felt before in my body when the balancing was done to me,  as well as when I was performing it upon someone else.</p>

<p>As I practiced this and other modalities of energy healing,  my abilities expanded and I began to recieve information about health problems in other people&#39;s bodies without them telling me, surprising more than a few who thought I was just playing silly games. </p>

<p>I began to personally experience all manner of phenomena which Western science dismisses as pure fantasy.</p>

<p>I encountered a puzzling enigma which I needed answers for, and set out to find them. Having found them by diligent research and exploration  I now realize we are spiritual beings having a Human experience.</p>

<p>You,  on the other hand,  decided not to explore any enigmas,  but rather,  to take the word of everyone around you that this kind of silly shit doesn&#39;t exist,  and so you find yourself here; trolling strangers in a conspiracy sub whom actually have a better grip on the reality they inhabit than you do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that, and I have been searching about it since I&#39;ve seen someone answering about &quot;The egg&quot; by Andy Weir
I recalled someone saying : &quot;What if it was a parasite making you believe to go back on earth ?&quot; And someone else answering about archons.</p>

<p>So i&#39;ve made my research but can&#39;t find the exact answers I am searching.
So by posting my questions here, I am hoping to get a bit more explanation, opinions from others.</p>

<p>The problem I feel here is that you guys are so used to trolls, shills that when someone comes to ask real questions to try to understand one another as humans and different perceptions of what we think it could be based either on unique explanation or facts, there is this need to say : &quot;Lazy, do your own research&quot;</p>

<p>But I still get where you come from and understand your anger toward me. 
Although please be assured that the only thing I&#39;d like is to understand. 
Maybe we could have a positive and constructive conversation from there ? 
What do you think ?</p>

Tptb can control the population better living in fear and confusion whether that energy is used for other dimensional purposes or not, the end effect is the same for us...but it certainly explains a lot if true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only answer a few of these. 1. You can ask someone else who sees them (some shamans some regular people), likely you have someone around you who can see them. They don&#39;t talk about it though out of fear of being judged as a crazy and get locked in the loony bin. Many people have attachments. Sometimes you can just feel it, some have feelings that they are overcome with dread/depression, they love that energy. Some entities do it in gangs and stick around until they are removed or you are aware and try to change your state of being/get happy.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Then they don&#39;t bother you so much. Your energy is not attractive to bad ones. Good ones hang around when you&#39;re happy. Sometimes playing with your hair/caressing your face.</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#39;t but I&#39;m sure people are working on proof of this, I mean I want to prove the existence of ghosts but others are too.</p></li>
<li><p>There are good and bad entities, the bad ones just love to suck you dry and want you to DIE and join them in the other dimension.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks</p>

<p>So From What I understand, in the case of bad entities (one or more) they would feed on bad energies, making you even more sad or depressed in the case of weak state of mind then there would be good entities attaching to yourself when you are in happy state and able to manage negative emotions.</p>

<p>So from there, would it mean that what some calls &quot;Guardian angels&quot; are kind of the good entities ? 
Aren&#39;t they in a way also some parasites that feeds on hapiness but instead of leaving you empty kind of share the same energies with you ?</p>

<p>Again dimensions I am guessing are based on the different frequencies existing. 
The lower the frequencies the more it is negative, the higher and the more it goes to warmth. As the spectrum is undetectable due to our limitations in human bodies to detect such, they are not seen. That is completely understandable.</p>

<p>What I struggle to understand is, why would bad entities / parasites want you to die and join them ? The way you describe it would be more as individuals that were sad and dragging down people all their life wanting to continue as dead as they can&#39;t find &quot;peace&quot; in a way.</p>

<p>This is completely theorizing and trying to understand from my own point of view.
Not sure if that makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they want to feed off your feeling bad. Sometimes it&#39;s bad spirits, sometimes it&#39;s things I don&#39;t have names for. For what reason they do it I&#39;m not really sure. I suppose it&#39;s different for each of them. Just as humans have their reasons for doing what they do. I guess it helps them thrive in some way. Sucking your energy. I don&#39;t know if they get some kind of karma for leeching and wanting to harm people. Physical changes happen often when people have entities, they look a bit haggard until they (if they) fix the situation. Some people see weird things when they look at themselves in the mirror. When you have an entity they can possess your body where you lose some time, sort of blacking out.</p>

<p>Guardian angels are good beings, almost everyone has one. Physically in your world. Sometimes they&#39;re regular people who get rid of these energies/entities for you. Friends or family. This does cause them physical harm. So be appreciative of the people who are around you, they have probably cleared entities for you unknowingly. Of course you have spirit guardians too, family who have passed on that look after you and open doors for you in the physical world. I wouldn&#39;t say guardian angels are parasites, they more or less try to help you stop your negative patterns and evolve to higher consciousness. To help you change any destructive patterns, or save you from future events that may harm you. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t say why they want you to be with them. It&#39;s probably not all, but the ones that wanted me wanted me to be depressed and kill myself. I was a little dramatic with the last part haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ever find vampire bugs on your bippy at night and become concerned that they&#39;re taking their energy back?  I think that&#39;s whats feeding from my energy because i have these bippies that root around my house all day when im awake and as soon as im asleep they crawl all over me and start feeing their own nutrient deficient bippys.  I dont know, it seems like its a problem but my landlord, who i think is probably a lizard-man, thinks its alright and that i should just keep sleeping in the bippy bed.  </p>

<p>Understanding the ancient Hawaiian practice of Forgiveness</p>

<p>Ho&#39;oponopono can help restore harmony within, and with others</p>

<p>When I first encountered the practice known as Ho’oponopono, it was in an interview with Haleaka Hew Len PhD, a Hawaiian psychologist and shamanic practitioner. I took on the simple yet profound forgiveness practice and found immediate benefits in my personal life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy it that there are parasitic entities doing these kinds of things. I would propose the counter theory that there are beings trying to teach people to overcome their negative emotions.</p>

<p>Whenever there are theories about these mean interdimensional critters I just wonder what would even be the point of them doing bad stuff. It&#39;d be easier to feed off of neutral thoughts, or positive ones. Do you think that the people that come up with these ideas ever watched Monster&#39;s Inc?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either way you look at it, we&#39;re trying to explain why we feel good/bad, happy/sad, etc. Why do we have emotions and thoughts? Where does it all come from? These forces which don&#39;t necessarily exist in the physical world or have a physical explanation for, some call it the imagination, the spiritual plane, the realm of thought, heaven, the Akasha, Atlantis, it&#39;s the same place to me. We do this all the time but we don&#39;t realize it, putting meaning to concepts that don&#39;t have physical shape. We are living as much in a spiritual world as we are a physical one, but our eyes can be very convincing, yet this shouldn&#39;t be confused with misleading, it&#39;s just that the world we see around us is highly convincing compared to the spiritual world we don&#39;t see but also live in and access just as regularly as we do the physical.</p>

<p>I am however not sure about the whole parasite thing. Would make a good scifi novel for sure. And it&#39;s fun to watch some scifis become nonfiction as time goes by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is love and unity (no im not being poetic). And just see what’s happening in the world today, fear, low self esteem, stress, division. All, as you have rightly pointed out, is designed to make us feel bad.  And since I know these entities exist it’s not an impossible scenario you have posted. </p>

<p>We all as individuals have a responsibility to unify the world around us, be it family friends or just smiling at the shopkeeper when you get your morning paper. Small things that go someway to make someone else feel better. I wish I’d learned that a while ago tbh, instead of giving it large. </p>

<p>The entire Don Juan series of books by Carlos Castaneda is highly recommended.  While I don&#39;t advocate the experimentation nor emplementation of their extremely dangerous techniques, they possessed an infinitely valuable knowledge which shouldn&#39;t be discarded.</p>

<p>Over time they propagated innovative ways of perceiving the world which led to the ability to fully perceive the world energetically, seeing everything around them, but not using their physical eyes to do it. </p>

<p>Feel free to share any strategies you’ve learned to gain control of your energy back from these parasites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>finding centre.  go to places where the ambient energies of nature can wash your emotional levels away if you&#39;re feeling &quot;emotional&#39;.</p>

<p>practice visualization.  practice it consciously.  practice it in meditation.  practice it while sleeping.  learn to allow ideas to play over your mind like an animation and pay attention to the overall &quot;feel&quot; of the mental model to see if it &quot;fits&quot;.  get back into child brain where general impressions were much clearer.</p>

<p>think about consequences.  think about your responsibilities.  marry the two so that you can minimize the amount of &quot;windup&quot; you do to others.  be diligent in being polite and unclosed, as your transparency and lack of conflict will facilitate accurate communication and not let triggerable behaviour to manifest in the people you&#39;re dealing with.  or phrased alternately, one doesn&#39;t try to befriend a large dog with violent tendencies by acting violently.   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><strong>I am not even trying to understand</strong> at this point. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had the same questions as you do about 20 years ago. </p>

<p>At the time,  I was in school to become a massage therapist. One day,  our instructors deviated from massage techniques and taught us how to balance the chakras (energy centers) of another person by using the inherent difference in electrical polarity which exists between the extremities and opposing symmetry planes of every single human body. </p>

<p>I was blown away,  because I felt sensations I&#39;ve never felt before in my body when the balancing was done to me,  as well as when I was performing it upon someone else.</p>

<p>As I practiced this and other modalities of energy healing,  my abilities expanded and I began to recieve information about health problems in other people&#39;s bodies without them telling me, surprising more than a few who thought I was just playing silly games. </p>

<p>I began to personally experience all manner of phenomena which Western science dismisses as pure fantasy.</p>

<p>I encountered a puzzling enigma which I needed answers for, and set out to find them. Having found them by diligent research and exploration  I now realize we are spiritual beings having a Human experience.</p>

<p>You,  on the other hand,  decided not to explore any enigmas,  but rather,  to take the word of everyone around you that this kind of silly shit doesn&#39;t exist,  and so you find yourself here; trolling strangers in a conspiracy sub whom actually have a better grip on the reality they inhabit than you do. </p>
