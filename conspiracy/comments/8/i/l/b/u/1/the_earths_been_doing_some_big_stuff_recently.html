Before you take drastic action bc some guy named dutchsinse predicted doom..., please do yourself a huge favor and look the guy up. Read what others have to say about his ahem &#39;predictions&#39;...</p>

<p>Other than that, I recommend <a href="http://www">www</a>. earthquake-report.com over and above USGS, for thesame reasons another poster states, as well as a far more comprehensive site coalesing multiple different data streams in real time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To you and the other poster asking for links:
These are not lightweight matters. We are, in fact, in a solar minimum, which affects quakes volcanoes and sinkholes. (and look up for yourselves what that means,as it&#39;s important and isn&#39;t explained in one paragraph)
HOWEVER, as far as occurrence of eq&#39;s and volcanoes, go read the data for yourself. Don&#39;t take my word about this dutchsinse youtuber as the last word. Look and verify for yourselves,-good advice for any new idea anyways. Familiarizing one&#39;s self with the data could easily provide some more perspective as to what slight, moderate, and severe means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for finally providing a source for me to check out. The video raises some interesting points, but I gotta disagree with its most fundamental assumptions.</p>

<p>First, the creator of this video incorrectly assumes that the map with the arrows that Dutchsinse uses was mostly created by some &quot;random youtuber&quot; who also happened to send him coffee, implying that this person pulled the arrows out of her ass and placed em in a pretty pattern on the map for him to use on his fake youtube show. </p>

<p>The article that the creator of that video shows to back up his point, clearly says in the first paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This map is based on our observed progression of seismic events (earthquakes both deep and shallow) which occur daily, weekly, and monthly around the planet. The seismic pressure transfer has been observed to create earthquakes of similar size which spread out beginning in the west Pacific.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As in, they made observations over a long period of time, and the youtuber helped make the map (likely with photoshop skills that Dutch doesn&#39;t have but which the random youtuber does).</p>

<p>But for some odd reason, the creator of this youtube video completely glosses over this, so that he can exaggerate the fact that he had help in creating the map (as if that is somehow a bad thing? wtf?). Not only that, but he passes off his ignorance and/or inability to read as somehow being Dutch&#39;s fault? LOL. Who the fuck is misleading who here again?</p>

<p>I watched the rest of the video, just to be sure. I could go on, as well as with the rest of the links you provided, but I&#39;m not, &#39;cause this is a waste of time. Your agenda is dishonest and I have no interest in furthering this conversation with you.</p>

<p>But if you actually believe what that guy is saying in the video you linked, and if that&#39;s what you call &quot;debunked,&quot; then I got a bridge to sell you.</p>

<p>We had a few very deep earthquakes a few weeks back and I tuned into his channel and he was talking about them not reporting/suppressing an extremely deep earthquake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the earthquake in Oaxaca with a magnitude of 7.2, a 7.3 in Kermanshah late last year, Papua New Guinea at 7.5 just this year and it was one of the deadliest followed by monthly aftershocks, several 5-6.0++ isolated tremors across Iran, 6.9 in Hawaii and 6.2 in Afghanistan. Some tremors of 5 and above for Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar too. All just this year... </p>

<p>My thoughts, the bill is due and maybe the Mayans were right. It&#39;s the end of a climactic era. The patterns are changing. The land is changing. </p>
