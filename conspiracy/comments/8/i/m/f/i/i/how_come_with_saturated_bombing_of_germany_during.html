<p>This blog states within the very same text:</p>

<p>&quot;Fortunately, one of the most forthcoming and comprehensive accounts in this body of scholarship comes from the Ford Motor Company itself.&quot;</p>

<p>The other statements come from documents that are not vetted by the author himself ..... we have to take it on hearsay.</p>

<p>Even if his reported documents said that they attempted to bomb Cologne Ford Werkes multiple times....the reality ends up being this huge facility was not bombed while they did bomb smaller Ford facilities in other places. </p>

<p>Those smaller facilities did not have the production capability even close to the Cologne factory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The closest the war ever came to the mainland US was the false flag Pearl Harbor attack. Eye witness accounts are notoriously sketchy. People in a panic think they see something and while they’re talking to others they shape each other’s memories and eventually it becomes a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>It was a scheme by FDR to boost our economy. Make a bunch of war machines send them to a land that most people will never see or know what to look for when they get there. He could be building anything and selling it off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the cold war was actually a great thing for us, the rich gave us the new deal because otherwise a legit bloody revolution was about to go down. they also started WWII in part to send young men off to die of course, but I mean after that. 1964 was the high water mark of the economy and our hgains have been getting reduced since so it&#39;s time to Anastasia the rich again. Like Jefferson said we need to replenish the tree of liberty with blood every now and again. Permanent world revolution. World will never be a petrfect utopia but it&#39;s better if it is improving rather than getting worse.</p>
