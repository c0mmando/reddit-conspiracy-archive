        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Christian is the most peculiar person on the earth. He believes that there is a God who created all things who is perfect. His law is that to live you must also be perfect and any imperfection is worthy of blood. They claim that God sent his only son- Jesus into the world to be that blood atonement for imperfection. In their book they claim that this Jesus did amazing miracles that only the true son of God could do, raised from the dead and gave them this Holy Spirit which enlightens them. They claim that &quot;<code>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.&quot;</code> 2 Corinthians 4:3. I can never argue with my christian friends because at the end of it all they will just claim enlightenment through this Holy Spirit and that I&#39;m &quot;lost&quot;. Researching it, theres quite a few today who claim the elite practice satanism and are actively deceiving the masses and have been. Satanists claim that they communicate with angelic entities when they do blood sacrifices at specific places on specific dates. The christian would tell you thats true and that they pray and do &quot;Spiritual warfare&quot; against such things. Again, the christian says there is a &quot;Judgment Day&quot; where everything ever done will be brought into judgment according to Gods law and Satan is deceiving all people until that day. I can&#39;t get around it because no matter what he just claims I&#39;m just deceived and unenlightened. <code>&quot;We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one</code>.&quot; 1 John 5:19. Could these people truly be the ones waking up from the matrix? The red pill being blood?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to submit to authorities of organized religion. The relationship with Christ and the Holy Spirit is personal. Organized religion is a mechanism used to control the truth and keep it confined, ridiculed, and just simply to make the idea of a creator unappealing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In reading these passages you should keep in mind that man’s free will is honored by God.  Those who have ‘been blinded’ made a choice against God, and were ‘given over’ to their choices.  God’s greatest desire is that all men turn to Him in faith. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>/“18The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19since <em>what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</em> 20For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>21For although they knew God, <em>they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him,</em> but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.</p>

<p>24Therefore God <em>gave them over</em> in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.”|
—-Romans 1</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is given to believers at the time of faith in God.  But even then, man can regress into his old nature of this  world. Man can ignore the Holy Spirit’s influence and not seek to follow His promptings.   This grieves the Holy Spirit. It is a dynamic relationship where man’s free will continues to be honored.  Also, the Holy Spirit is given as a ‘down payment’ for the day of redemption (at death), marking believers as God’s property to earth fallen angels.  </p>

<p>God also states—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/18For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19For it is written:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;
the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”
20Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.”|</p>

<p>—1 Corinthians 1</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God does not allow cannibalism. But he did require a blood sacrifice at one point of the finest animal one had to offer. This was the equivalent of burning actual stock and resources (money) to God. </p>

<p>The animals have a different spirit process than humans so don&#39;t feel bad about that. They were made to be ruled over by humans. Sadly we&#39;ve done a very bad job in this department. </p>

<p>Those in the false christian churches drink the wine to symbolize Jesus who was the last sacrifice for those who the Bible pertains to. They mix their own Satanic doctrine  with the Bible on purpose in this aspect because the religion itself was high-jacked long ago by devil worshipers. They follow the roman catholic church which is the remnant of the same people who pillaged, persecuted and destroyed God&#39;s people back in 70 AD.</p>

<p>All animals are sentient and suffer just like humans. This is why God made everyone vegan in the Garden of Eden.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, the Bible is a difficult book to read (time, events and faceless names etc also, rather <em>dry and longggggg</em>...) and perhaps it is made more <em>confusing</em> still, because certain other <em>supporting</em> texts, documents, scrolls (whatever) were removed from the discussion. Add to this, that many Pastors and Priests can come across as <em>trained salesmen</em> in some huge recruitment campaign - if they just teach and preach the nuts and bolts followed with &quot;because, IT says so in <em>this</em> Book!&quot; just to get your butt thru their door$ - you&#39;re probably gonna have a bad time!</p>

<p>So coming from a spiritual but Agnostic stance, I knew all the arguments and <em>trigger passages</em>. One night, a few Christians came into r/conspiracy and they were getting hammered by the Atheists - then they wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t answer my questions about the murderous, genocidal, very angry G_D in the OT in contrast to the new earthly G_D in the NT.</p>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t defend G_D on the utter desolation of Jericho and I found it curious because this theme (thru various other genocidal instances...) is a huge tipping point for many that Christians are encouraged to go out and <em>convert</em> but they&#39;re clueless, really. How are you going to covert someone when you have no idea what Jericho was all about?! Ya just can&#39;t leave some &quot;lost soul&quot; with &quot;because, the Bible...&quot; and expect results!</p>

<p>So, my scrawny butt got convicted pretty hard and I dug into those <strong>extra books</strong> that are not supposed to be read, contemplated or mixed in with Christian <em>faith teaching</em>. </p>

<p>Now no Sunday school teacher is gonna tell a little kid that those giants, those men of renown were really Giants. Nope. That teacher is gonna say simply that they were mighty men of G_D, right? Then why did G_D kill them? Well, cause they fell away and became corrupted...but that teacher is corrupting what the OT actually says. These were some sick twisted beings! </p>

<p>What in the world was going on when Noah was instructed to build this special boat?! If you read the Book of Enoch you get a better grasp of how messed up things were. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only a few months into all this. I wasn&#39;t raised by religious parents and in fact my brief experiences with church things were not pleasant, even if I was sincere. </p>

<p>Satan or the most beautiful fallen one - that dude really has some power and talents. And IMHO, the awakening is going to happen with or without you and I. All that stuff that was hidden and the Power Masters that have withheld the truth - they&#39;re being exposed. </p>

<p>Did those Mythical creatures have a true physical presence here on Earth and are they still here today? I think so.</p>
