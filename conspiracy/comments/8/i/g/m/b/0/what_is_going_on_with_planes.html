       anyone else notice the large influx of airplane/helicopter related emergencies this past year?
      </p>
      <p>
       you couldn’t even pay me to get on plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think that with human’s exponential technological advancements we would see a decline in number of instances, but that seems to be far from the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       could it be intentional? laxed maintenance regulation or enforcement of regulation? cheap labor? cheap parts?
      </p>
      <p>
       a plane crashing or smoking and emergency landing almost every week, if not every other week seems to be too much of a coincidence to not have something more sinister lurking just beneath the surface.

       Maintenance.  My friend investigates air accidents professionally, and he said Southwest is well known for running their planes into the ground.  The best for maintenance are reported to be Delta and United (as much as I despise United)...

       i figured it had to be something like this. or that more people are flying so they don’t wanna lose the potential profit from taking the airplane out of service for scheduled maintenance or speeding it up to get it back up into airspace faster

       so you think airline companies having cabins fill up with unidentified smoke while operating, or windows being broken open via mechanical failure is “minor maintenance”? are you saying this has always happened at the same rate  it currently is but just wasn’t reported? i find that hard to believe. it seems profit margins are putting blinders on safety protocols

       No... he's saying it was

       That last article mentions the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They did touchdown safely, but these kinds of emergency landings occurred 66 times at JFK from February through June of this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's more than three times a week.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That was in 2011. Do you remember hearing about emergency landings three times a week in the first half of 2011? And that was just one airport.

       to be honest no, i was barely even 18 and the news made me sleep, and i had graduating to worry about. i was in school all day with no real access to news, so i understand my thinking on the matter is biased. i would like to mention i was not just talking about commercial air travel. any air travel, any aircraft.

       I'm saying that this stuff is suddenly reported on much harder after one big event happens . Just like after the United beating up a passenger thing, every small debacle that happens is suddenly propped up extra hard

       Let's not forget Mike Green's heli crashing near the Rothschild mansion months and months ago

       I'd highlight the fact that the plane who hit him went from 2x Mike's height and went straight for him

       i’m definitely suspicious. just like malaysia air reportedly had a bunch of HIV experts on board (taken with a grain of salt, i didn’t actually look into it too much) and other infamous plane crashes that killed ‘notable or important people’
      </p>
      <p>
       it’s like plausible deniability.

       But yeah, plane crash is a popular assassination method

       It's easy when you don't care about collateral and it's hard to prove you were assassinating someone (or a group)

       swiss air 111 wikipedia entry listed notable victims were related to HIV as well they only listed two. i wonder if they really were the only ‘notable’ people or if others were left out.

       no.  I haven't noticed anything unusual.  I live in Holyoke, which is very near Westover Airforce Base.  Not much going on other than typical training of C130s.  Even Barnes out of Westfield is quieter than usual.

       honestly i’m deeply terrified of dying by someone else’s incompetence or judgement errors. driving for me is terrifying. i get ptsd like panic attacks where my body is so weak and my legs shake so much i can barely push the pedals. makes me think if i’m ever in danger out in the wild and have to run or fight i’ll just pass out instead because my body is useless and is too conditioned to fear. all i really trust wholeheartedly for traveling are my legs and the damn shoelace express. crossing the road is different, because you have to make the judgement yourself and to be sure cars on both sides are stopped. it’s up to you, and your competence level. it’s mostly up to you when you realize you can stop a lot faster than a metal contraption barreling down the road can stop.

       I'd advise looking up actual stats for the incideny rate. It will likely calm you.

      <p>
       Also if you really do get those sort of panic attacks therapy is really the best idea

       they’ve gotten better through my own self therapy and inner reflections, but they really were a hinderance for a while. numbers and statistics don’t help me. i’m terrified of painful death and death from other people’s actions and or inattentiveness.
