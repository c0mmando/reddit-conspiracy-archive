       Here is Abby allegedly mocking the fact that Men are presumed "innocent until proven guilty" and she basically was allegedly advocating that women have full authority to condemn men as sexual abusers based on their witness testimony alone.

       She allegedly claims to be against "American Capitalist Empire" but she allegedly often voices support for Communism which is inherently violent but she goes so fucking far as to fucking defend North Korea and Stalinist Russia. She allegedly is literally advocating for violence in the streets and violent and forceful "redistribution of wealth." HYPOCRISY!
      </p>
      <p>
       Peter Joseph is allegedly a fucking hacky cuck that used the most outrageous forms of conspiracy theories, which was an embarrassment to the whole community, to shill his ideas about how planned economies "can give people freedom by telling them what to do." Self Contradictory as fuck and also planned economies result in millions starving and toilet paper that is basically the consistency of sandpaper and cardboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is Soviet style toilet paper:

      </p>
      <p>
       My teacher in High School, who had traveled to the USSR in the 70s and 80s told me that the toilet paper was the same consistency as the brown rough paper that the public sector DOL/DMV quality school board had purchased for the school bathrooms as HAND drying paper. Notice how in private sectors usually the bathrooms have at least something resembling tissue paper for your hands or even a dyson drier. But nooo public sector toilets have literally the shittiest paper available.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shows how free market capitalism is the best way to increase the comfort of living for the greatest amount of people. Socialists don't care about pooor people, they're just butthurt and jealous of rich people, because their egos are so fragile. That's what Marxism is about, ego. Socialists would rather have 100 percent of 10k than 1 percent of a trillion. Their solution to poverty is too simply make everyone suffer the same. Chop down the tallest trees in the forest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile someone else's production of wealth does not necessitate that you get any poorer. The only reason that corporations have any kind of non consensual power over anyone is because authoritarians can always be bribed as it's human nature and can be done indirectly. The only way to get rid of bribes is to get rid of authority. And in democracy media attention is enough to make changes in power so any sponsor of a media network or social networking entity can be considered a bribe.. like how a certain foreign government allegedly gives millions to Chunk Yogurt of the Young Turks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fucking free market has this amazing ability of allowing people to do what is in their individual self interest and it naturally forms what is their collective interest as well. What happens before a hurricane??? People start to gauge prices for various kinds of supplies, and that can serve as a signal to merchants who travel to the hurricane areas to sell supplies and undercut the price guagers. Now, it might not happen perfectly everytime but you can bet your ass that if people guage prices long enough there will be people moving into capitalize on that and the prices will correct eventually! That is the beauty of capitalism!
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile in Venezuela, SURPRISE SURPRISE, toilet paper is about as scarce as a fucking snow leopard, especially when there is a problem with the government. It's almost as if decentralized solutions are always superior than centralized ones because centralized systems don't have as many different sub systems to provide redundancy. Yeah Zeitgeist can suck a dick lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just so you don't forget. Mrs. "Muh Empire" is literally the one calling for imperial violence in the streets to extort people and throw them in Gulags just because they are successful and she is egotistical and jealous.

       A hacky cuck? What do you even mean with that? Which outrageous conspiracies? I have watched a lot of Abby Martin and I have never heard her speak positively about communism. Also your quote of Peter is non-existant. The rest of your rant is so full of misinformation, I don't want to spend my time debating you. What literature or documentaries or speakers have you read/watched and listened to?

       SHE literally fucking defends North Korea on the fucking reg. Fucking google Abby Martin North Korea or watch her fucking podcast episode with NK in the title. SHE is a full fucking blown tankie. And are you fucking denying that she fucking said men should be presumed guilty right off the bat?!?!? Are you fucking denying that really when i fucking linked exactly where she fucking said that in her own fucking words?!?!?!??!?!

       He is a fucking CUCK that thinks giving SOMEONE ELSE the power to control your entire fucking life is how to achieve FREEDOM!!! EXTREMELY RELEVANT:

      <p>
       That kind of bullshit self contradictory logic is JUST THAT, it's fucking contradictory bullshit. It's like the "Freedom through discipline" bullshit. Some people are most creative when they satisfy their impulses and comfort. Being a masochistic CUCK doesn't automatically mean that you will have a better life or be more productive. All of the most brilliant geniuses were extremely eccentric and for them their creativity WAS their impulse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The corporate model is fucking flawed but the nice thing is that you have the opportunity to use the fucking means of fucking production you are staring into right fucking now to do something artistic and creative that has infinite demand and use it to become financially independent! All these stupid leftist excuses don't even fucking apply the same way as they fucking did in Marx's time. No longer are farming and factories the only way to produce anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell you could fucking grow your own food in your apartment with a hydroponic setup and use a fucking 3D printer made of fucking legos and a glue gun to make stuff other people will buy!!! Or you could propel yourself into the fucking "science class" or whatever they called it, i think it was like informatia or intelligencia or whatever the fuck archaic term they used, anyway you can fucking learn to program in a few months and be making web pages as a freelancer or about a million other ways to produce something of value that other people will pay for or your can profit from indirectly.

       I didn’t read much of any of this response.  It seems to me to be an ad hominem against Abby Martin.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is, that’s all good and well…but this OP and the interview both aren’t about Abby Martin.  They’re about who she’s interviewing and the very intelligent things he has to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this seems utterly independent of whether Peter Joseph's being interviewed by Abby Martin or Hannibal Lector.

       So if socialism is so fucking great then why the fuck was it fucking impossible for them to come up with a decent fucking roll of triple ply?!??!?! Why is it fucking impossible to get personal items like that of decent quality??!?!? HMMMMMMMMMMMM Really boggles the noggin doesn't it?!??! It's almost as if centrally planned economies don't take into account the very nuanced interests of individuals do they?!?!?!??!
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is makeup impossible to get FROM North Korea?!! Why do North Korean RELY on the goods smuggled in from China on their GIANT black market which is the only way any of them get up in society as it lets them bribe guards?!?!? You realize virtually every fucking "middle class" person in North Korea got to that status by smuggling or trading black market goods and bribing officials?!?!? AHHAHAHA are you too fucking stupid to see why communism makes BLACK MARKETS bigger than ever!!??!? You really think you can stop people from trading freely and claiming property as their own!??!?!

       BWWWAHAHHAHAHAHA (BREATHS IN) BAHAHAHAHA Fucking leftists bragging about who is more ignorant than the other and who has a tougher time reading a few fucking paragraphs!! No wonder leftism appealls to the only people with so little confidence in themselves they think that making other people have almost full control of their fates and destiny will help their life situation. It's like the fucking DOL or MUH REENS.... only people that can't make it in the real world want to give up their freedom for perceived (not actual) security!

       Ahahahahhaha yeah fucking of course this is leftist logic, hear no evil see no evil. You guys love to stay as ignorant as possible and are so fucking afraid of challenging your dogmas that you actually won't even read a few fucking paragraphs. Or are you really that fucking retarded that reading a paragraph or two makes your brain hurt LOLOLOL!?!??! I guess I am not surprised as leftism literally appeals to people who are so afraid of doing anything productive that they think giving a central power totalitarian control is their only chance at a decent life AHAHAHAHA!

       Did you even fucking pay attention to what she fucking said about rape allegations and how Men shouldn't have any fucking presumption of innocence!??!? Do you fucking understand how this shows how her leftist commie logic automatically makes her think that Women should be given the ultimate power to decide a man's fate and she thinks that women are inherently moral and just and can be trusted!??!?! JUST LIKE all you leftists think that giving a government total fucking control will solve the corruption issue LOLOL!!! As if there has EVER been a non genocidal socialist empire?!?!?? HAHAHA

       You missed out on some dank criticisms of his idea that centrally planned economies are better than free market situations where every actor is looking out for their own self interest!

        Why is it that no centrally planned economical system has been able to make a fucking decent roll of triple ply toilet paper?!?!?!?

       It's almost as if humans are TERRIBLE at EMPATHY and looking out for every individual's specific interests!! Good luck cucking yourself though AHAHA!

       It's a video promoting christian bible narratives and attempting to marginalize The Zeitgeist Movement doc.  It's a 2 1/2 hour long circular fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a very good example in favor of your assertion.  If this is all you have, then your reasoning for saying that Peter Joseph is a "satanist" is, to put it mildly, pretty badly flawed.

       Link that, if you will, because the only thing it seems to me that would "disprove and discredit" what Peter Joseph postulates is a possible inability for humans to coexist (something I don't think is an impossibility in the least) - not anything having to do with the theories themselves.

       Communism is literally the embodiment of pure selfish EGO darkness! You think that because your life sucks that you should tear down the entire fucking system which is making so many of our lives wonderful and FREE!!?!?!??!
       <strong>
        The road to hell is paved with good intentions!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Marxism is like a mind virus that spreads to those who are vulnerable of jealously and spite! Jesus literally said that we should pray for our enemies and to be compassionate towards them as well! Yet Marx thinks they should be raped for all they are worth and thrown into a fucking gulag... and furthermore NOT ALL RICH PEOPLE ARE YOUR FUCKING ENEMY!
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you to make it impossible to be independent if you are so disenfranchised with the employer-employee relationship? You are staring into a fucking means of production right at this very moment.. why don't you fucking use to make money online??? Linus Torvalds literally made GIT specifically so he could collaborate on software projects from his home without meeting people in real life.. won't that be outlawed in a communist society because it means the ruling class wants to have even more direct control over you and new innovative ideas are very slow to catch on in archaic bureaucracies?
      </p>
      <p>
       COMMUNISM IS LIKE THE BORG FROM STAR TREK.. They even said so in Voyager and Deep Space Nine. They represent the eventuality of the Federation!! Why would you remove all your fucking options if you are already dissatisfied with what is being offered to you?!?!? Don't you fucking realize that making your money and being independent is the only way to satisfy this?!?! You could literally get paid to produce some kind of content or programming with INFINITE demand on the fucking means of production you are fucking staring into at this very fucking moment!

       This is just blatant Communist propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with 70% of what he is saying including the financial system corruption and the rest of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However his solutions are just plain crazy. Abolish markets? What the hell is that? A market is just a peaceful exchange between Alice and Bob. How do you abolish that without a tyrannical government?
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of leftists realize the issues in the world, but their solutions are just plain savage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and by the way the so called 20 million that die each day or what was it, is not due to Capitalism, it's due to idiocy, like eating fast food garbage and stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Soviet Union people were murdered and enslaved, their entire economy consisted of slave laborers building most of the infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Global Warming hoax makes me nervous whenever a shill brings that up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize that these hoaxers were saying that Netherlands will be under water by 1970 due to the south pole ice melting?
      </p>

       Yeah that says all you need to know about that.

       Global warming does seem to be happening - even though the politicization of it and the lies associated with that politicization are a completely different thing altogether.

How do you fucking explain kids in Afghanistan making web pages to be the fucking richest person in their mud hut village then?!?!? I guess that is pure evil to a man like him who wants everyone to SUBMIT to one CENTRALIZED POWER!?!??! I bet he absolutely RESENTS guys like Linus Torvalds who helped kick off the decentralized production boom on the net with GIT and the open source movement where people have found a way to PROFIT INDIRECTLY off mutual interests!?!?!?!??!?!

      <p>
       OR THIS ONE about how fucking easy it is to get FUCKING MONEY, it's literally called HOW TO GET THE FUCKING MONEY, and it shows how acquiring start up capital is easier than ever in human history with things like kickstarter but even just asking rich people for money if you have a good idea:
