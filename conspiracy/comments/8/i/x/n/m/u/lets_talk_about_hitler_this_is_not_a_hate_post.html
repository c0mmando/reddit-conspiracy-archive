       He was only going to be in office for four years. Those were his own words.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wanted to root out the cause of all of the poverty in Germany, mainly those who signed over the country to the "gentlemen in Geneva" in 1918.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wanted to unite all classes, all races and all groups. In one of his speeches he talks about the unification of all Volk (people) of Germany. Rich and poor, poor and rich. All working towards the goal of a greater Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       He saw 'democracy' as a nation that plunders and steals form the people. He says "authoritarian states" have the power of the people behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wants to eradicate the Jewry* from Europe so that they cannot continue for the next thousand years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, by Jewry, I think he meant the bankers. His speeches point to hate of those who abuse others through money and stature(my interpretation of course). It makes me wonder If one of two things happened :
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The 'jewry' was misunderstood by the Volk, which in turn led to X amount of innocent, honest jews being murdered. We have seen this the world over, especially in Vietnam, where the psychological effects of guerilla warfare sent some commanders/leaders of platoons in Vietnam to call for strikes on innocent men, women and children.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) In order to stop the rise of the unification of socialism, which would have caused communism to think twice, a number of people were 'planted' within the Nazi party to push the agenda and actions of an all out genocide on the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes this more interesting is operation : paperclip. What if, the idea wasn't to 'rescue' Nazi scientists, but to save those 'plants' and bring them back home to the States. Paid for by the international bankers in order to bring down a political movement that threatened their livelihoods.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what you believe, one thing is true: That socialism is seen as the root of all evil and that it only causes hatred in society. Yet those leaders who were loved by their people, were seen as socialist leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, was Hitler a man out to help the people and he was stopped by those who he sought to bring down or was he just a maniac with a power trip and a grudge against people who believe in a certain 'God'?

       He got elected by promising socialist policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wanted to point that out.  I've listened to his campaign speeches and he very plainly sounds like any modern day socialist politician.  This is not necessarily a criticism of socialism, just of the methods used by Hitler to gain a loyal following.

       Is socialism as bad as what people make out? Because, tbh, Britain is fairly socialist and the more socialist we lean, the better the people do. When we cut the money to health, transport and education, people suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always believed in a socialist way of life. That seems like a pipedream now though as you are instantly branded as either a communist or a jew-hating Hitler-lover.

       I find it very strange when group X can't do something because group 'Y' ruined it in the past.

       i live in the uk and we are being forced to take in Muslims immigrants from all over the middle east.
Muslims want to kill gays as well as all non believers.the are also fans of child marriage and female genital mutilation also there religious beliefs say its ok to take women who aren't Muslim as sex slaves .they more or less always try to take over a country and install sharia law when they are 50% of the population.

       What difference does it make?  He came to power under the guise of socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The German people were in a debilitated situation where people's future was bleak and Hitler promised change, he promised a nationally centric form of socialism.  And like every other socialist experiment, it quickly turned sour.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many times do we need to repeat this experiment by letting radical socialist near power?  We have plenty of socialism under capitalist rule we don't need to go full socialist.

       Nothing he did was even remotely socialist though. It can't even be called an experiment. Maybe if he'd actually been a socialist, he wouldn't have had time for all the, you know...genocide.

       Germany is fucked by Merkels socialist policies now anyways so nobody gives a fuck about German opinions because the German identity is being fully erased.  Soon you'll just be a footnote on 21st century nation states.  The fact you're triggered by facts is proof of concept.

       The fact you're triggered by facts is proof of concept

       Where am I triggered and how is this a fact? Is it a fact that Hitler sounds like a todays socialists?

       Can you give me a source for that?

       "Germany is fucked by Merkels socialist policies now anyways so nobody gives a fuck about German opinions because the German identity is being fully erased"
      </p>

       Calling Merkel a socialst is like calling a truck a F1 racing car. She is in the Christliche Deutsche Union (christian german union) a conservative party.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Even on the day our National Socialist movement was founded, we were already governed by the conviction that the destiny of the German individual is inseparably bound up with the destiny of the entire nation. When Germany declines, the worker will not flourish in social well-being, and neither will the entrepreneur. Nor will the farmers or the middle class be able to save themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        No, the ruin of the Reich, the decline of the nation, means the ruin and the decline of all! And no religious faction and no single German ethnic group will be able to escape sharing the same general fate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even on the day our National Socialist movement was founded, it had already long been clear to us that the proletariat would not be the victor over the bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie would not be the victor over the proletariat, but rather that [in such a clash] international high finance would then ultimately be the sole victor over both. And that is what has come to pass!
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognizing this decline, 13 years ago a handful of people and I organized a new movement which, in its very name [National Socialist] proclaims the new national community. There is no such thing as a socialism that does not have the power of the spirit at its disposal; and no such thing as social well-being that is not protected by, and even finds its prerequisite in, the power of a nation. And there is no such thing as a nation – and thus no such thing as nationalism – unless the army of millions who work with their brains are joined by the army of millions who work with their fists, along with the army of millions of farmers.
       </p>
       <p>
        As long as nationalism and socialism march as separate ideas, they will be defeated by their united opponents. On the day when both ideas are fused together into one, they will be invincible!

       I'm surprised to be honest. I thought I was going to be attacked for defending Israel, which I have done a few times.

       I still standby that view though. Israel is the long-arm of the law of the world police of America. That sentence might be a mouth-full but hopefully you get the gist.

       He was against Jews because he viewed them as the total antithesis of the Aryan race. He describes them as selfish, lairs and culture-less. He believes that Jews are parasites that appropriate the achievements of other races.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the second part of the question, its fairly clear that when Hitler speaks of Jews, he is referring to the race ("On this first and greatest lie, that the Jews are not a race but a religion.."  //  "for example, still has not the faintest idea that the Jews are members of a people and not of a 'religion' " ). Also, he speaks how the Jews do not have a country and cannot have one, which also emphasises that his problem is simply a racial one.

       If, what you're saying is true - I have no idea either way, so I will run with your hypothetical - then it won't come to America.
      </p>
      <p>
       'America' is the lie to the free world. Your motto is "land of the free" yeah, unless you aren't rich as fuck. "Home of the brave" if you're willing to swallow the narrative and not question what you are told.

       The 'American dream' that everybody can be a millionaire, unless you're 90% of the population and can't even afford decent drinking water.

       'American patriotism' is another oxymoron. You can only be patriotic to the country that has tried to rule the world since it's foolish break from the Empire.
      </p>

       Don't confuse the American system with the American people though. Two totally different things.

       The American system is broken in many, many ways. But all of us save for one small town (still an atrocity) have access to decent drinking water.

       It was foolish to break away from the empire as you now have no top cover from the monarchy. Sure Britain has its' share of corruption, everywhere does. Your corporations just take it to a whole new level. Which is funny in a way because you're only the leading force economically. When it comes to military might it is hard to argue against the Chinese or Russian military might, mainly because it's so damned secretive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, give it five years and that might change, seems as your money hungry corporations have shipped out all of the know-how to China et al. Now China aren't some shitty commie sweat-shop, they are becoming a main driver in manufacturing.

       Mostly their view on nationalism and tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism/socialsm values EVERY life the same while national socialism only values the life of the countries population and not even then.
      </p>

       In socialism you have a classic one for all and all for one situation (or at least its the goal) that everyone supports everybody and otherwise too. You have the state as a tool to direct and manage all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In national socialism you have a "everything for the country" mentality where the individual life inst important as long its keeps the country running. The country/nation it self gets glorified until a point it takes the place of a religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Young man go die in the millions to "rescue" their country and to die a heroic death for their nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in national socialism everything belongs to the state and he might get you something back if you have the right ethnic group.

       If you think Nazis are socialists, then you'll probably believe that North Korea is a Democratic People's Republic, too.

       It boils down to semantics; it is not very important, as long as we agree tyranny is bad. Which sound we pronounce in order to best describe it is secondary. Socialism is my mind is another word for
       <em>
        collectivism
       </em>
       (and indeed that is the proper definition, even if I'll agree that definition has been hijacked/changed in this last generation, much like
       <em>
        capitalism
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        liberalism
       </em>
       , etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I could use the same rhetorical tool as you.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... if you think
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       Hitler and Mussolini
       <em>
        happened to be
       </em>
       socialist statesmen (member/head of their respective country's socialist party), then you'll probably believe China is capitalist despite calling itself communist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, individual liberty needs to be restored in the US - i.e. the central State shoud lose its power to impose, i.e. coerce / molest, i.e. initiate violence against people.

       On the contrary, it does not boil down to semantics. It boils down to a group using the word "socialism" to get elected and then once elected doing nothing socialist whatsoever. This isn't "semantics," it's outright

       Mussolini was elected as leader of the National Fascist Party, stood successfully as Prime Minister on that party's manifesto, and then once in office (as a National Fascist Prime Minister) effectively abolished democracy and installed himself as dictator.
      </p>
      <p>
       At no point in his ascent to absolute power did Mussolini pursue anything other than National Fascist Party objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps you think this is "semantics," too?

       Mussolini published
       <em>
        Il Trentino veduto da un Socialista
       </em>
       . He was later editor of the Italian socialist Party newspaper Avanti! Under his leadership, its circulation soon rose from 20,000 to 100,000. During this period, Mussolini considered himself a Marxist and he described Marx as "the greatest of all theorists of socialism."
      </p>
      <p>
       From 1912, Mussolini was a leading member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). He was later expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you ask, no, he didn't change his underlying ideology or worldview before being expelled and founding the fascist party - he merely altered his socialism to make it nationalist instead of internationalist. It is really quite easy to comprehend, when you rid yourself of identity biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I presume you didn't remark on Hitler in order to limit your ridicule to only one set of undeniable facts.

       You missed out the fact that he was only a party member for two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was
       <em>
        expelled in 1914, and publicly renounced socialism,
       </em>
       founding the National Fascist Party instead (became the Fascist Party's first Prime Minister in 1922).

       These are historical facts, and your pretence that these facts don't exist (or that you have access to facts that disprove them) is frankly a mixture of alarming and amusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of your post is a mixture of bluff, bluster, and BS, which I think you only wrote on a "quantity over quality" basis, in order to give redditors the impression of having a substantial argument. Because there is certainly nothing in that post that warrants serious attention or rebuttal.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: I didn't mention Hitler, because we have already dismissed that nonsense about him being a socialist. He wasn't. But if you want to carry on pretending he was, please, be my guest. You aren't the first dupe who fell for that pseudohistorical game of word-association, and you certainly won't be the last.

       Well if you'll swallow the preposterous idea he "renounced socialism" and had a complete, 180-degrees revelation after being a socialist intellectual all his life and putting Marx on such a pedestal ... I guess you'll believe anything, and no amount of facts will dampen your identoity bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is you don't understand what collectivism is. You merely
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       something warm/fuzzy when you hear the word socialism, which you've probably been inculcated to associate with Scandinavia or something. My guess is you have graduated from a US (community?) college in a non-technical field no more than 5 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, I don't need to convince you of the proper vocabulary; a collectivist who puts the herd above the individual's right to life and liberty embodies and enables tyranny - regardless of his preferred flavor of it.

       On the one hand, I have the historical evidence that backs up what I'm saying. On the other hand, you have none whatsoever and only your own insinuations that I am biased (yes, I suppose evidence will do that to people...)

       I really don't think Hitler gives socialism a bad name whatsoever. It is fairly apparent that socialist views are more popular now than they ever have been. Prime example is Bernie Sanders and the amount of traction he gained during the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among my peers socialism is the go to political standard. I will be interested to see if people opposed to socialism start to use Hitler and Nazi Germany as an example of the negative possibilities of socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the older generations perspective that grew up with the red scare, cold war, and a generally inept government (wow not much has changed) they see politicians asking for more tax dollars when they can't even take care of what they're already getting. Personally that's my biggest gripe as well. Healthcare, education, public utilities, and infrastructure are necessities but writing a large check to local and federal agencies that aren't even responsible with what they already have is not the right way to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazi's were the National Socialist German Workers' Party. So if you're on r/conspiracy and you believe that WWII was a step towards a one world government (Albert Pike said there would be 3) then you might want to look into what Hitler believed in. Maybe look into Lucius Trust publishing (connected to the UN), Alice Bailey,   or Helena Blavatsky who had a great influence on what Nazism became. WWII with the creation of the state of Israel, operation paperclip creating the US's space program, the occult side of the SS and upper level Nazis, and the amount of prominent businesses that worked with Nazis are all clues of the larger story that's unfolding.

       In no way Bernie Sanders is socialist. And neither was Hitler. Hitler was a Nationalsocialist there is an elemental difference between a socialist and a national socialist. While they might agree on a small amount of economical standpoints they disagree COMPLETLY how a state should be run and how individual life should be handled and how foreigners should be treated etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the US politics is so hard on the right that Bernie now is called a socialist. Let me be clear. This dude is medium left wing at best.
