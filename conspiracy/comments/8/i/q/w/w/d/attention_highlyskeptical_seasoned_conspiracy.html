       There was a huge move to normalize pedophilia in the 60s/70s (PIE, anyone?)
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly believe all the incest-themed porn you see these days is an extension of that. Once I did a deep-dive on pedos, and their MOs, and what they're all about...a LOT of them fuck their own kids. It's like a 'thing' in their communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy the, 'pornhub saw everyone was searching for 'mom' stuff so we designed all the porn to be about incest!' angle.

       Hey, bro, my nemesis, but very loved RMFN, man, I hate you with every fiber in my body and all, but that’s only in our reddit arguments. I really don’t want to see you get into trouble. Let it nag you all it wants, but be VERY careful if you’re gonna “look into it”, you know? Of course you know, you’re a frequent sub participant. You know what
       <em>

       :( I think you missed the jest in my comment. What I meant was that even though we disagree and our arguments might come out as if I did hate you, I don’t. I love your passion and no, I don’t hate anyone for their beliefs. But, thanks for the nice wishes, I guess.

       I'd say aliens, but that's not even as highly contested as flat earth, so I'm going with flat earth for 200 Alex...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to write off and I don't personally like the arguments or leaps of logic brought about by the theory, but there are some aspects to it which interest me still.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, many acclaimed scientists and thinkers believe there is a high possibility we're in a simulation. If that's the case, flat earth shouldn't be ruled out. There are even wilder theories like the "saturn moon matrix" which carry the same core idea, with the added concept of "loosh" or whatever is being thrown around this sub lately (your body is an energy source being harvested by beings in another dimension). So there could be something more spiritual/biblical to it as well. Secondly, there are some interesting coincidence/phenomena with things such as the Sun being the same size as the Moon from our location of observation on Earth. Some things like that one just seem too perfect by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one is geocentrism. It has been argued for millennia whether or not the Earth is actually moving, what is its position in the universe, how do the celestial objects in our solar system actually orbit each other, and why do we observe red shift everywhere. Hubble's observation of red shift suggests
       <em>
        everything is moving away from us
       </em>
       which Hubble claims puts us in a somewhat "special" place in the universe, aka at the center of it, and it may be that every place in the universe is in some way the center.

       Great comment! I watched the Principle, it may have even been you that recommended it to me. It was such a good watch. I think a reason for the NASA lies may be because we are motionless.

       I want to know if the Western financial system is going to implode and if it's preventable. I want to know if it's possible to 'end the Fed' and other central banks around the world, and what would be the repercussions if that were to happen. I want to understand what will happen when China becomes the world's biggest economy. Do we in the US have a chance of holding on to our current standard of living? What would increase or decrease our chances in this regard? Those are a few good ones... I guess it comes down to, how do we as a society prepare for what's coming and do what we can to make the best of it.

       The truth and how its damn near impossible to pin down (Aside from jesus obviously before anyone starts on me). How most truths are personal or a buy-in from the majority. Also who the f*** is in charge of this nonsensical reality. Enquiring minds want to know....

       The theory that TPTB create conspiracy theories in order to distract us from what's really going on and how the world really works, and to foment contention among and between the masses in the form of debating over theories, evidence, and sources, and by calling each other names and passive-aggressively attacking others online for what they believe or espouse. In short: all conspiracy theories are fake; there is no "truth" to anything, and nothing is a lie.

       There is enormous effort to claim, explore and exploit the Arctic. Russia is performing military exercises there, and nuclear subs have been trolling around for fifty years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is targeted effort to keep the Arctic from refreezing. Thus, the cause of "climate change" really is man-made...

       There was a huge move to normalize pedophilia in the 60s/70s (PIE, anyone?)
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly believe all the incest-themed porn you see these days is an extension of that. Once I did a deep-dive on pedos, and their MOs, and what they're all about...a LOT of them fuck their own kids. It's like a 'thing' in their communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy the, 'pornhub saw everyone was searching for 'mom' stuff so we designed all the porn to be about incest!' angle.
