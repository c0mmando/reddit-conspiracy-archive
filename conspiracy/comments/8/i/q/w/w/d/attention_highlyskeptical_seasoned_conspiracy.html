<p>I honestly believe all the incest-themed porn you see these days is an extension of that. Once I did a deep-dive on pedos, and their MOs, and what they&#39;re all about...a LOT of them fuck their own kids. It&#39;s like a &#39;thing&#39; in their communities.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy the, &#39;pornhub saw everyone was searching for &#39;mom&#39; stuff so we designed all the porn to be about incest!&#39; angle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say aliens, but that&#39;s not even as highly contested as flat earth, so I&#39;m going with flat earth for 200 Alex...</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to write off and I don&#39;t personally like the arguments or leaps of logic brought about by the theory, but there are some aspects to it which interest me still.</p>

<p>Firstly, many acclaimed scientists and thinkers believe there is a high possibility we&#39;re in a simulation. If that&#39;s the case, flat earth shouldn&#39;t be ruled out. There are even wilder theories like the &quot;saturn moon matrix&quot; which carry the same core idea, with the added concept of &quot;loosh&quot; or whatever is being thrown around this sub lately (your body is an energy source being harvested by beings in another dimension). So there could be something more spiritual/biblical to it as well. Secondly, there are some interesting coincidence/phenomena with things such as the Sun being the same size as the Moon from our location of observation on Earth. Some things like that one just seem too perfect by design.</p>

<p>Another one is geocentrism. It has been argued for millennia whether or not the Earth is actually moving, what is its position in the universe, how do the celestial objects in our solar system actually orbit each other, and why do we observe red shift everywhere. Hubble&#39;s observation of red shift suggests <em>everything is moving away from us</em> which Hubble claims puts us in a somewhat &quot;special&quot; place in the universe, aka at the center of it, and it may be that every place in the universe is in some way the center.</p>

<p>Some links to consider:</p>

I want to know if it&#39;s possible to &#39;end the Fed&#39; and other central banks around the world, and what would be the repercussions if that were to happen. I want to understand what will happen when China becomes the world&#39;s biggest economy. Do we in the US have a chance of holding on to our current standard of living? What would increase or decrease our chances in this regard? Those are a few good ones...
