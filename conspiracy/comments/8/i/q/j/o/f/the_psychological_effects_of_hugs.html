<p>Study showing that hugs are undeniably positive.</p>

<p>At the same time when you search &quot;family and hugs&quot; online you come up with countless iterations of this article.</p>

<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/girl-scouts-force-kids-hug-relatives-holiday-season/story?id=51275036">https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/girl-scouts-force-kids-hug-relatives-holiday-season/story?id=51275036</a></p>

<p>Why are hugs which are known to have a positive psychological effect being demonized in our society? The American &quot;bubble&quot; is very unhealrhy. A definite sign of a tormented society.</p>

<p>Why are &quot;they&quot; trying to equate familial affection with pedophilia?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;warning&quot; seems like a pretty big stretch, imo. There&#39;s a difference between trying to reinforce the value of Family on a child who doesn&#39;t quite understand that Aunt Mae might not be there when she&#39;s older, and &quot;feeling obligated&quot; to physically reciprocate on a date.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think asking your daughter to hug her aunt (my example) is going to make her think she owes that guy who paid for her dinner anything in return- the guy knows what he&#39;s getting into, and though he may hope for reciprocation he&#39;s an idiot if he doesn&#39;t at least acknowledge the chance of it not happening... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I  agree it&#39;s a stretch, but I also think it&#39;s not great to guilt or badger your kids into hugging someone when they don&#39;t want to. </p>

<p>We rarely see our grandkids, so it takes them a few days to warm up during visits. Their parents will prompt them to &#39;say hello&#39; or &#39;say goodbye&#39; but <em>how</em> they do it is up to them.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s a wave, sometimes they just say it, once one of them gave me a dinosaur(so sweet!), and sometimes they give us hugs and kisses. I like the idea of teaching a kid that you do have to be respectful and loving, but you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to show respect or love physically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is right, the norm is large extended families and an even larger group of extended &quot;tribe&quot; all helping each other out.</p>

<p>The large family only bought one car, one radio, one TV, often one house or farm and shared it. So the nuclear family concept was pushed by the governments of the western world and Madison Avenue pr firms. Splitting the large family up tripled and quadrupled the sales of houshold electronics, cars, houses etc as every new couple needed all that stuff rather then sharing it with the extended family.</p>

<p>A nice TIL for you guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware of tribal living. I&#39;m from Appalachia where it&#39;s common for generations of a family to still live either in the family homestead or in a handful of small houses or mobile homes on family land. </p>

<p>Aside from Madison avenue, I&#39;d say the slave trade and the industrial revolution took their  toll.  </p>

<p>My quibble with OP was that it&#39;s a leap to assume the nuclear family is &#39;broken&#39; by default with an extended family is automatically happy. Many of those extended families are my relatives and while they&#39;re relatively happy, they aren&#39;t noticeably happier or healthier than any &#39;mom, dad and 2.5 kids&#39; families that I know. </p>

<p>Modern life has fractured peoples lives in much more than one area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first article reduces hugs to &quot;It sounds simple; just get a hug a day and you’ll be releasing oxytocin all over the place and you’ll enjoy steady health.&quot;</p>

<p>So instead of hugs being beneficial because of meaningful connection, they are beneficial because they release chemicals that make you feel better.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like science is implying that relationships can be reduced to oxytocin. When in reality...we are much more than physical beings. We are individuals who seek meaningful relationships. The oxytocin is the effect, not the cause, of these beneficial effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is already a reality here in Japan. They  believe that if you hug your children they will grow up to hate you. Pretty fucked up, right? Needless to say, they have a strange idea of what love is. Just watch their porn, it&#39;s sickening. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve definitely met Japanese families that hug, but it&#39;s very few and far between. Kids don&#39;t quite understand love here. If the population keeps declining like it has been there will be too many old people to take care of within our lifetime. </p>

<p>I always wonder when and why it started. Maybe it&#39;s been like this for a long time, but I doubt it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is the nation of japan is a very insular society where its easy to trace the inspiration from previous artworks, and if you view them through a lens of puritanical morality then you are setting yourself up for failure.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a famous example, the &#39;tentacle porn&#39; genre started because of the morality laws forced on them by the US in the treaty after ww2 and did not allow any nudity. It was illegal to show a penis but &#39;dick shaped tentacles&#39; are a legal loophole around these morality laws. The law has since changed, but they still censor any porn not made exclusively for export.</p>

<p>The guy I replied to seems to believe that there is a systematic pattern of intentional moral degradation in Japan. I&#39;m arguing that they&#39;re trying to find something that &quot;sells&quot; just like the stock market and that a person can&#39;t point fingers like that anymore than an Oriental can say that &quot;cheeseburgers and honey boo-boo are destroying western society.&quot;</p>

<p>Its an extremely broad overgeneralized of the issues at best, and its elitist hobsnobbery at its worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The censorship laws are from 1907, which if I remember correctly is LONG before WWII. I didn&#39;t say anything about a &quot;systematic pattern of international moral degradation&quot;. I said that not hugging is hurting them as a culture. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about tentacle porn. I&#39;m talking about the fact that Japanese porn has always been extremely degrading to women and they almost always scream like they&#39;re getting raped. And yeah, western porn has caught up pretty quick. I could explain my case further but you obviously know everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Meiji Restoration is what your talking about and they did not physically &quot;censor&quot; wood cuts, it was &quot;censorship&quot; of western ideas with a ban on pornography. The same way the US government &quot;censors&quot; child pornography by making it illegal. You think japan had TVs in 1907?</p>

<p>The terms of the US treaty said they could have porn but couldn&#39;t show genitalia, which is the &quot;censorship&quot; I was referring to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to a yoga class where it ended with the instructor telling everyone it was time for hugs. At first I was majorly creeped out, but after hugging everyone in the room there was literally love radiating out of everyone. I mean you could feel it in the air!</p>

<p>If that sounds hippy dippy, I don&#39;t give a damn. We are stingy with love and affection here in America, and I think it hurts our society. </p>

<p>I felt such a strong burst of positivity and wellbeing after that yoga session. My friends all nervously agreed it was a great way to end the hour. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would recommend a meditative and/or introspective practice of your choosing. The light is there, it is your natural state. All you have to do to access it is to be present in the moment and aware-  aware of both the peace and light that is here now, as well as the darkness.</p>

<p>The more aware you are of the stillness, peace and light, the more it will grow. The more aware you are of the darkness, your shadows, the more they will dissolve (as long as you embrace and do not resist them). Awareness is key.</p>

<p>Whenever you encounter pain and shadows, allow yourself to embrace them and let them go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is the nation of japan is a very insular society where its easy to trace the inspiration from previous artworks, and if you view them through a lens of puritanical morality then you are setting yourself up for failure.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a famous example, the &#39;tentacle porn&#39; genre started because of the morality laws forced on them by the US in the treaty after ww2 and did not allow any nudity. It was illegal to show a penis but &#39;dick shaped tentacles&#39; are a legal loophole around these morality laws. The law has since changed, but they still censor any porn not made exclusively for export.</p>

<p>The guy I replied to seems to believe that there is a systematic pattern of intentional moral degradation in Japan. I&#39;m arguing that they&#39;re trying to find something that &quot;sells&quot; just like the stock market and that a person can&#39;t point fingers like that anymore than an Oriental can say that &quot;cheeseburgers and honey boo-boo are destroying western society.&quot;</p>

<p>Its an extremely broad overgeneralized of the issues at best, and its elitist hobsnobbery at its worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The censorship laws are from 1907, which if I remember correctly is LONG before WWII. I didn&#39;t say anything about a &quot;systematic pattern of international moral degradation&quot;. I said that not hugging is hurting them as a culture. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about tentacle porn. I&#39;m talking about the fact that Japanese porn has always been extremely degrading to women and they almost always scream like they&#39;re getting raped. And yeah, western porn has caught up pretty quick. I could explain my case further but you obviously know everything.</p>

<p>&quot;Elitist hobsnobbery&quot; lol. How ironic.</p>
