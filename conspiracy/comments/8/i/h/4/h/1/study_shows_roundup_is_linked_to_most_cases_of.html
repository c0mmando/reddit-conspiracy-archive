    <div class="md"><p>Submission Statement : I’ve read a lot about wheat allergies and what not lately because many people think they have them , myself included at one point a few years back. Well a fellow reddit user posted this study a while back and it blew my mind that round up is still allowed to be manufactured. </p>

<p>RoundUp (maybe glyphosate?) is sprayed on wheat during harvest afaik to speed up the drying process . </p>

<p>Off topic but Another thing about this is Lyme disease is starting to get very bad, killing people , causing deformities , increased metal intake , etc.</p>

<p>Another thing about that is supposably now Lyme disease could possible (though a very low chance, male to female via semen) be sexually transmitted and is an off-form of syphillis </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the idea is that by avoiding non-organic corn, soy, etc, one can begin to add organic wheat?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think you realize the span of this in our products . It’s literally in any wheat organic or not, most fruits and vegetables , definitely in any fast food or pizza (as you’ve stated) .. the only way to limit your exposure is to avoid wheat all together, which i did for months, and was quite possibly one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but as i stated above , i was exposing myself to very dangerous amounts of round up and walking barefoot through it daily , to a point where it was effecting me very violently i could barely get up i didn’t want to do shit my body felt like it was killing itself , Idk man. I just attributed it to onset gluten allergies , didn’t link it to round up at the time. Luckily i ran out of the round up and didn’t spray it for months , and as i stopped eating wheat and didn’t spray, i got better after a few months, but it took a very long time for my body to repair itself . </p>

<p>I noticed this first when my shit started smelling like fish. This chemical stays on the ground for a very long time aswell </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a big difference with minimal exposure outside (where rain, wind, etc. are weakening the strength) and concentrated exposure inside (non-porous surfaces, decreased air circulation, etc. don&#39;t help break up the concentration). Products that are for use indoors have all of that in mind. Not to mention that lots of things are safe/irrelevant in small doses, but become dangerous after you reach a certain threshold. How you used it makes a <strong>HUGE FUCKING DIFFERENCE!!</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Monsanto runs the story, no cancer connection, but Celiac disease is deadly if  you continue to consume gluten and that stuff is everywhere in various forms, &quot;modified food starch,&quot;  malto dextrin, caramel coloring, etc.  </p>

<p>Celiac disease was once rare and now I personally know 4 people with it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not saying those people aren&#39;t true celiac suffering people... but I think the reason why most people know more &#39;celiac&#39; people now.. is because, the gluten free people are WELL versed in knowing what celiac disease is. I think certain people who are staying away from gluten get tired of the eye rolls, or the constant explanation of why they are doing it, and some may jump to just saying &#39;oh i have celiac&#39;, which is likely to end discussion quicker w/ some sympathy vs judgement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first one is an article on a well-known study performed by the scientist who originally identified the possibility of NCGS. It is a double-blind study which showed no difference in reactions (to gluten v placebo) in people who self-identified as NCGS. It does have a small sample size (n=37) and that&#39;s a problem.</p>

<p>The second is a summary of a study that showed statistically insignificant results and is on a website supporting people who identify as NCGS. The results were that only 7 people out of 231 reacted consistently with what would be expected for someone who is NCGS. The results were insignificant in that they could have happened by chance. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S154235651630547X?via%3Dihub">Here&#39;s the original article if you want to read it and have institutional access</a>.<br/>
The third, I&#39;ll admit, I wasn&#39;t familiar with, but it supports the existence of NCGS in very small numbers, so I thought you&#39;d appreciate it. And, really, does it matter if I&#39;ve actually read the whole article? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I said there is no test for it, because there is no test. I can&#39;t see where you&#39;ve found that quote, but I am absolutely certain that there is no diagnostic test. I am both a coeliac and a doctor, by the way.</p>

<p>If you &quot;know&quot; there is a diagnostic test, please send me a link because I would be very interested to read about how a test for an illness with unknown pathophysiology was created. Online symptom checkers are not diagnostic tests. There is no available genetic test because we don&#39;t know what genes cause NCGS (or even if there are genes that cause it) so I assume you have misquoted something there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Afaik, there is a lot of confusion about people who have true wheat allergies being conflated with people who develop health problems from prolonged exposure to round-up/glyphosate. Celiac is a real condition that sucks for a small amount of people. The problems from prolonged exposure to round up are generally less accute but affect a huge portion of the population to one degree or another and much like we are finding out the sugar industry influenced researcher results to blame problems caused by sugar on other things like animal fat, we are slowly finding out that Monsanto has influenced research to suppress or deflect the problems there fertilizers and pesticides cause people. It&#39;s no surprise the info on Celiac disease has been confused with info on exposure to round-up. Round up kills shit. In small amounts it&#39;s probably not a problem for humans. Where are the studies for prolonged exposure from birth through adult hood? It&#39;s makes sense to think that round-up could be killing healthy bacteria and cell structures in our intestines and thus presenting somewhat like Celiac disease. It also make sense that research has been skewed by Monstanto fuckery to blame the problems caused by Round-up on varying degrees of Celiac. Whatever the real data is, again, it doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that if round up is strong enough to kill fucking mutant pests it&#39;s probably strong enough to fuck with the cell wall of our intestines as well as bacteria in our guts, especially after a lifetime of consumption from a wide variety of products.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m absolutely not saying that glyphosphate is harmless - all things are potentially harmful - and I have no idea what quantity is safe.</p>

<p>I just think that using cherry picked evidence and limited scientific understanding to come to the opinion that the increase in incidence of coeliac is entirely due to one chemical is a bit silly.</p>

<p>It should certainly be considered as one of many possible causes and is worth further research. This paper is pretty flimsy though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I don not think or am not sure at all that Celiac is cause by glyphosate exposure but I do see ways in which the data and symptoms of Celiac could be confused with glyphosate exposure. A bit ironic that presumably Monsanto tried to blame Celiac for symptoms caused by glyphosate exposure hoping to write off their culpability in messing up people&#39;s intestines and now it comes back to bite them with people blaming Monsanto for causing Celiac when really it&#39;s probably isn&#39;t actually Celiac but other problems cause by Montsanto products. I just hope the day comes when the data gets squared away because I think there is a lot of self-diagnosing going on and until we know what&#39;s what, treating glyphosate exposure as if it were Celiac probably isn&#39;t the optimal course of action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree with all of that.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to find out what causes some people with a genetic predisposition to develop coeliac while others don&#39;t. It&#39;s quite possible that there is some environmental factor that triggers it. My own coeliac experience was that I was a pretty chubby kid, then became very slim and unable to gain weight in mid-adolescence.</p>

Roundup is not a pesticide. It is an herbicide (weed killer) .   It prevents the plants from making certain proteins that are needed for plant growth. Glyphosate stops a specific enzyme pathway, the shikimic acid pathway. The shikimic acid pathway is necessary for plants and some microorganisms.   </p>

<p>It is good to be skeptical like you are being, but it&#39;s also good to not be cheap with the stuff you put into your body every day. If you are as affected as you say you are, just try going 100% organic (and drink distilled water, as tap water has all this same poisonous garbage and more in it too) for a few months to see if it helps. Or keep asking for sources on things until you die.</p>

<p>Our EPA is bought and paid for by the poison producers, do you think they are being unbiased? I just go back from Greece where most food is organic and the people there look infinitely healthier than fatass americans, it was mind blowing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Celiac disease, and, more generally, gluten intolerance, is a growing problem worldwide, but especially in North America and Europe, where an estimated 5% of the population now suffers from it. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, macrocytic anemia and depression. It is a multifactorial disease associated with numerous nutritional deficiencies as well as reproductive issues and increased risk to thyroid disease, kidney failure and cancer. Here, we propose that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup®, is the most important causal factor in this epidemic. Fish exposed to glyphosate develop digestive problems that are reminiscent of celiac disease. Celiac disease is associated with imbalances in gut bacteria that can be fully explained by the known effects of glyphosate on gut bacteria. Characteristics of celiac disease point to impairment in many cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved with detoxifying environmental toxins, activating vitamin D3, catabolizing vitamin A, and maintaining bile acid production and sulfate supplies to the gut. Glyphosate is known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Deficiencies in iron, cobalt, molybdenum, copper and other rare metals associated with celiac disease can be attributed to glyphosate&#39;s strong ability to chelate these elements. Deficiencies in tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine and selenomethionine associated with celiac disease match glyphosate&#39;s known depletion of these amino acids. Celiac disease patients have an increased risk to non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma, which has also been implicated in glyphosate exposure. Reproductive issues associated with celiac disease, such as infertility, miscarriages, and birth defects, can also be explained by glyphosate. Glyphosate residues in wheat and other crops are likely increasing recently due to the growing practice of crop desiccation just prior to the harvest. We argue that the practice of “ripening” sugar cane with glyphosate may explain the recent surge in kidney failure among agricultural workers in Central America. We conclude with a plea to governments to reconsider policies regarding the safety of glyphosate residues in foods.</p>
