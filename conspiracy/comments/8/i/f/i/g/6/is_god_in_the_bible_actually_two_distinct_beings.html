        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-05-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Apollo_Frog.html">Apollo_Frog</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Deucalion legend as told by the Bibliotheca has some similarity to other deluge myths such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the story of Noah&#39;s Ark. The difference being that the Bible only states one God, but all other &quot;myths&quot; have two distinct beings.</p>

<p>In the Bible when God is mentioned it is the word Elohim. Elohim is a grammatically plural noun for &quot;gods&quot; or &quot;deity&quot; in Biblical Hebrew. In Modern Hebrew, it is often referred to in the singular despite the -im ending that denotes plural masculine nouns in Hebrew.</p>

<p>Thetan Prometheus advised his son Deucalion to build a chest. All other men perished except for a few who escaped to high mountains. The mountains in Thessaly were parted, and all the world beyond the Isthmus and Peloponnese was overwhelmed. Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha, after floating in the chest for nine days and nights, landed on Parnassus. An older version of the story told by Hellanicus has Deucalion&#39;s &quot;ark&quot; landing on Mount Othrys in Thessaly. Another account has him landing on a peak, probably Phouka, in Argolis, later called Nemea. When the rains ceased, he sacrificed to Zeus.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,</p>

<p>2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.</p>

<p>3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.</p>

<p>4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.</p>

<p>5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</p>

<p>6 And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.</p>

<p>7 And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.</p>

<p>&quot;There [in Achaea, i.e. Greece] is a land encircled by lofty mountains, rich in sheep and in pasture, where Prometheus, son of Iapetus, begat goodly Deucalion, who first founded cities and reared temples to the immortal gods, and first ruled over men. This land the neighbours who dwell around call Haemonia</p>

<p>The flood in the time of Deucalion was caused by the anger of Zeus, ignited by the hubris of the Pelasgians. So Zeus decided to put an end to the Bronze Age. According to this story, Lycaon, the king of Arcadia, had sacrificed a boy to Zeus, who was appalled by this savage offering. Zeus unleashed a deluge, so that the rivers ran in torrents and the sea flooded the coastal plain, engulfed the foothills with spray, and washed everything clean. Deucalion, with the aid of his father Prometheus, was saved from this deluge by building a chest.[10] Like the Biblical Noah and the Mesopotamian counterpart Utnapishtim, he uses his device to survive the deluge with his wife, Pyrrha.</p>

<p>The fullest accounts are provided in Ovid&#39;s Metamorphoses (8 AD) and in the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus. Deucalion, who reigned over the region of Phthia, had been forewarned of the flood by his father, Prometheus. Deucalion was to build a chest and provision it carefully (no animals are rescued in this version of the Flood myth), so that when the waters receded after nine days, he and his wife Pyrrha, daughter of Epimetheus, were the one surviving pair of humans. Their chest touched solid ground on Mount Parnassus, or many other possible locations.</p>

<p>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.
The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.</p>

<p>And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.</p>

<p>Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark
17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.</p>

<p>18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons&#39; wives with thee.
19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.</p>

<p>22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.</p>

<p>And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;</p>

<p>15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,
16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons&#39; wives with thee.</p>

<p>20 And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</p>

<p>21 And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man&#39;s sake; for the imagination of man&#39;s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</p>

<p>22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease</p>

<p>Tablet I contains a creation myth about the Sumerian gods Anu, Enlil, and Enki, gods of sky, wind, and water, “when gods were in the ways of men” according to its incipit. Following the Cleromancy (casting of lots), sky is ruled by Anu, earth by Enlil, and the freshwater sea by Enki. Enlil assigned junior divines[6] to do farm labor and maintain the rivers and canals, but after forty years the lesser gods or dingirs rebelled and refused to do strenuous labor. Instead of punishing the rebels, Enki, who is also the kind, wise counselor of the gods, suggested that humans be created to do the work. The mother goddess Mami is assigned the task of creating humans by shaping clay figurines mixed with the flesh and blood of the slain god Geshtu-E, “a god who had intelligence” (his name means “ear” or “wisdom”).[7] All the gods in turn spit upon the clay. After 10 months, a specially-made womb breaks open and humans are born. Tablet I continues with legends about overpopulation and plagues. Atrahasis is mentioned at the end of Tablet I.</p>

<p>Tablet II begins with more overpopulation of humans and the god Enlil sending first famine and drought at formulaic intervals of 1200 years to reduce the population. In this epic Enlil is depicted as a cruel, capricious god while Enki is depicted as a kind, helpful god, perhaps because priests of Enki were writing and copying the story. Tablet II is mostly damaged, but ends with Enlil&#39;s decision to destroy humankind with a flood and Enki bound by an oath to keep the plan secret.</p>

<p>Tablet III of the Atrahasis Epic contains the flood story. This is the part that was adapted in tablet XI of the Epic of Gilgamesh. Tablet III of Atrahasis tells how the god Enki warns the hero Atrahasis (“Extremely Wise”) of Shuruppak, speaking through a reed wall (suggestive of an oracle) to dismantle his house (perhaps to provide a construction site) and build a boat to escape the flood planned by the god Enlil to destroy humankind. The boat is to have a roof “like Apsu” (a subterranean, fresh water realm presided over by the god Enki), upper and lower decks, and to be sealed with bitumen. Atrahasis boards the boat with his family and animals and seals the door. The storm and flood begin. Even the gods are afraid. In tablet III iv, lines 7-9 the words &quot;river&quot; and &quot;riverbank&quot; are used, which probably mean the Euphrates River, because Atrahasis is listed in WB-62 as a ruler of Shuruppak which was on the Euphrates River.</p>

<p>After seven days the flood ends and Atrahasis offers sacrifices to the gods. </p>

<p>Enlil is furious with Enki for violating his oath. But Enki denies violating his oath and argues: “I made sure life was preserved.” Enki and Enlil agree on other means for controlling the human population.</p>

<p>Utnapishtim[1] (Akkadian: 𒌓𒍣) is a character in the Epic of Gilgamesh who is tasked by Enki (Ea) to abandon his worldly possessions and create a giant ship to be called The Preserver of Life. He was also tasked with bringing his wife, family, and relatives along with the craftsmen of his village, baby animals, and grains.[2] The oncoming flood would wipe out all animals and humans that were not on the ship, a concept that was mirrored by the biblical story of Noah&#39;s Ark. After twelve days on the water, Utnapishtim opened the hatch of his ship to look around and saw the slopes of Mount Nisir, where he rested his ship for seven days. On the seventh day, he sent a dove out to see if the water had receded, and the dove could find nothing but water, so it returned. Then he sent out a swallow, and just as before, it returned, having found nothing. Finally, Utnapishtim sent out a raven, and the raven saw that the waters had receded, so it circled around, but did not return. Utnapishtim then set all the animals free, and made a sacrifice to the gods. The gods came, and because he had preserved the seed of man while remaining loyal and trusting of his gods, Utnapishtim and his wife were given immortality, as well as a place among the heavenly gods.</p>

<p>In the epic, overcome with the death of his friend Enkidu, the hero Gilgamesh sets out on a series of journeys to search for his ancestor Utnapishtim (Xisouthros) who lives at the mouth of the rivers and has been given eternal life. Utnapishtim counsels Gilgamesh to abandon his search for immortality but tells him about a plant that can make him young again. Gilgamesh obtains the plant from the bottom of the sea in Dilmun (often considered to be current-day Bahrain) but a serpent steals it, and Gilgamesh returns home to the city of Uruk, having abandoned hope of either immortality or renewed youth.</p>

<p>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.</p>

<p>2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.</p>

<p>5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.</p>

<p>6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</p>

<p>7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p>

<p>8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</p>

<p>Greek mythology describes three floods, the flood of Ogyges, the flood of Deucalion, and the flood of Dardanus. Two of the Greek Ages of Man concluded with a flood: The Ogygian Deluge ended the Silver Age, and the flood of Deucalion ended the First Bronze Age. In addition to these floods, Greek mythology says the world was also periodically destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years, for that is the number of years which have elapsed since the time of which I am speaking; and during all of this time and through so many changes, there has never been any considerable accumulation of the soil coming down from the mountains, as in other places, but the earth has fallen away all round and sunk out of sight. The consequence is, that in comparison of what then was, there are remaining only the bones of the wasted body, as they may be called, as in the case of small islands, all the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and the mere skeleton of the land being left.&quot; Plato’s Critias</p>

    <div class="md"><p>. The Bible says that there is one God above the gods. King of the gods, but it mentions many gods in the plural form of elohim.</p>

<p>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked?</p>

<p>persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all ...</p>

<p>I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes</p>

<p>Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever &quot;--</p>

<p>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,</p>

<p>When the morning stars {e} sang together, and all the {f} sons of God shouted for joy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enki/Prometheus, Zeus/Enlil. Every religion on earth can easily be compared to Greek mythology. The only god that seems to be either missing, or barely mentioned is Cronus/Saturn. Seems as if Cronus, and Ouranos (Uranus, Sky), in a lot of ancient religions, almost became the same deity. In the Greek mythology a lot more detail was put in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve had this conversation before. </p>

<p>Baal = LORD</p>

<p>But the LORD they are referring to is the LORD of this world not the LORD of everything who&#39;s name is Yahawah. </p>

<p>The same context is understood when the word is Gentile is used two diffrent ways in the Bible</p>

<p>Gentile (1) = Gentile who is of another nation and NOT of Israel.</p>

<p>Gentile (2) = Israelite who follows the customs of other nations because they don&#39;t know they are Israelite&#39;s via diaspora. </p>

<p>The context of the scripture you pulled was talking about the LORD but we see it is clearly used differently in other parts of the Bible. </p>

<p>1 Kings 18:18-21 King James Version (KJV)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father&#39;s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim.</p>

<p>19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel&#39;s table.</p>

<p>20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</p>

<p>21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? <strong>if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.</strong> And the people answered him not a word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we clearly see that majority of the time the phrase BAAL is used it is referring to any God that is not Yahawah. We can also conclude that the word LORD is used in the Bible almost 8000 times instead of the word Baal. </p>

<p>Clearly showing us that there was a difference between the two. </p>

<p>Again, as I posted above, the word Baal does mean lord but it unanimously follows the conditions that it is used only when speaking about a FALSE GOD that is not the God of Israel but of other religions and belief systems. Thus, Rothschild knows they worship the devil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. You said,</p>

<p>the word Baal does mean lord but it unanimously follows the conditions that it is used only when speaking about a FALSE GOD that is not the God of Israel but of other religions and belief systems.</p>

<p>Then you said, </p>

<p>The context of the scripture you pulled was talking about the LORD</p>

<p>the KJV OT: Lord usually translates adonai, which is the equivalent of ruler or master (as in English today). LORD usually translates Yahweh (Jehovah), the sacred covenant name of God. God usually translates elohim. </p>

<p>Therefore Lord, or baali.Lord can be a word for any person that we obey. Doesn&#39;t have to be a god. A man, or king can be Baal. Elohim when used means God in the plural form. </p>

<p>This is correct, although I do not follow the Yiddish Hebrew of Esau. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore Lord, or baali.Lord can be a word for any person that we obey. Doesn&#39;t have to be a god. A man, or king can be Baal. Elohim when used means God in the plural form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the one instance that the word is used this way under the phrase Baali, it is talking about Israel being an unfaithful wife. So now that we have context, if we read from 2:1 and downward we start to understand the real reason why Yahawah referred to himself as Baal. It is because that is who the children of Israel were praising instead of God, calling on the names of Baalim instead of Yahawah. This is understood one precept down from the precept you posted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hos 2:17</p>

<p>For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, God means Power. It is the reason why Israel in the ancient Hebrew is translated to Yahsharala, which means PRINCES OF POWER, we agree on this. Elohim is used to express the existence of the angels not that there are multiple God&#39;s. For even the son of man himself said that there is only one God who is Yahawah. There are multiple gods but when we see the lowercase form we see that it means the princes of power aka Israel on earth and when they die they go back to being Elohim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multiple times mentions other gods. King of kings , or the greek ruler of rulers would be the human counter part to Lord of lords, or another way of saying it god of gods.</p>

<p>Potentate-monarch or ruler, especially an autocratic one</p>

<p>relating to a ruler who has absolute power.
&quot;the constitutional reforms threatened his autocratic power&quot;</p>

<p>taking no account of other people&#39;s wishes or opinions; domineering.</p>

<p>Revelation 17:14  (KJV)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a bad break down on your part.</p>

<p>Chapter six of 1st Timothy is talking about being humble and how the wisdom of God outranks the riches of this world.</p>

<p>Here let&#39;s look at it with more context</p>

<blockquote>
<p>12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</p>

<p>13 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</p>

<p>14 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>15 Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the Yahawashi is the Lord of Lords and Kings of Kings but it is under the commandment of Yahawah the only true God according to the Bible. </p>

<p>Again, all other God&#39;s are false according to the Bible even though it makes mention of them, it is worship of the flesh/matrix. That is why Satanists in our time worship themselves I.E. the flesh. So yes a rock or a picture could be a God (IDOL) but in terms of the Bible, these things are not the God of all God&#39;s they are all false Gods. They are not real. This is critically needed to understand the wisdom of the Bible because someone could potentially say, &quot;This religion has X God and I worship it&quot; at the same time they are lying to themselves because it is not real according to the understanding of the Bible. It is Matrix worship. </p>

<p><strong>Psalm 96:5 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gold can be a God, water can be a God in a land where there are heavy droughts. This is why we must fully understand the reference Kings of Kings and LORDs of LORD&#39;s. Even Yahawashi himself has said that he is not greater than the only true living God which is Yahawah.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 19:17 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yahawah himself even hints at dead gods when we look at the very first commandment.</p>

<p><strong>Exodus 20:3 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 Thou shalt have <strong>no other gods</strong> before me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it is not the point that there are many gods, it is the point that Yahawah is the only true living God. </p>

<p>Get it?</p>

<p>So any worship of any other God of any kind is essentially Satan worship according to the Bible. Those in Power worship Baal (Satan) and it is proven not only in their words but actions in how they rule.</p>

<p>For if they worshiped Yahawah prophecy would end. But is in Edom&#39;s heart to worship Satan because that is what God cursed them with in Genesis 3:15 which matches with Revelation 12. </p>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 7:6 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.</p>

<p><strong>Isaiah 40:15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.</p>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 32:8</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many more precepts that detail this. There is but one nation that God is looking out for. The sons of Edom know this, that is why they parade around as so called Jewish. They are not the Jews but the offspring of the twin brother of Jacob. </p>

<p>As for the following scripture:</p>

<p>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.</p>

<p>2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.</p>

<p>5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.</p>

<p>6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</p>

<p>7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p>

<p>8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</p>

<p>It is dedicated to Jacob (Yasharala) not to the nations. For the nations did something very bad to God&#39;s people long ago when Edom decided to make an oath with the nations. Therefore during judgement day, the truth shall be revealed and the other 17 nations will be recompensed.</p>

<p><strong>Obadiah 1:15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will even attempt to fight Yahawashi (Jesus) when the time comes for that prophecy to be fulfilled. </p>

<p><strong>Revelation 19:19</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 And I saw the beast, <strong>and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</strong></p>

<p>You see, the elite know the prophecies that will take place, they think they can fight it and they have known for a long time. </p>

<p>You said, </p>

<p>If they are brothers from their father Adam that would make them both Jewish. Technically , that would mean good Jews, and bad Jews.

<p>You have to understand that not just the Bible, but most all religions are basically the same. The same gods, the king of the gods, the &quot;fallen&quot; ones, the great flood, the return of a Messiah, etc. I am a true believer of the Bible. You may not think so, but the Bible is a lot of Jewish propaganda added on top of already previously established religions. Why? It is true. There were gods, etc. In the ancient past, and we were created by them, but all the Jewish propaganda is irrelevant when you start to look at how similar the Bible is to all the other &quot;myths&quot;. </p>

<p>14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</p>

<p>15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Genesis 25:25-26 KJV</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</p>

<p>26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau&#39;s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Revelation 12:9 (Entire Chapter About the Woman (Israel) and the Serpent (Edom)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2 Esdras 6:9</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are are the end of the world for a reason. These things are happening for a reason. Sure we can try and tip-toe around the idea but the truth shall remain... </p>

<p>The nation of Edom is the only nation in the entire Bible that God refers to in <strong>HATE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to understand that not just the Bible, but most all religions are basically the same. The same gods, the king of the gods, the &quot;fallen&quot; ones, the great flood, the return of a Messiah, etc. I am a true believer of the Bible. You may not think so, but the Bible is a lot of Jewish propaganda added on top of already previously established religions. Why? It is true. There were gods, etc. In the ancient past, and we were created by them, but all the Jewish propaganda is irrelevant when you start to look at how similar the Bible is to all the other &quot;myths&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t found a book yet that has predicted the outcome of our entire existence the way the Bible does. It does it so well that people literally think that our world leaders are following it to employ the new world order. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have a programming that is of divine power that we cannot escape. </p>

<p>In other words, everyone is doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing. </p>

<p>Cursed above all cattle, and beast of the field, not human. On the belly shall thought go, also not human.</p>

<p>Here the Bible says the seed of the woman, and the seed of the serpent are different. </p>

<p>between thy seed and her seed;</p>

<p>That means Eve , and the serpents seed are not connected.</p>

<p>15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</p>

<p>Here it specifically states that Adam new his wife and conceived Cain.</p>

<p>And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.</p>

<p>It also specifically states that they are brothers.</p>

<p>And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother&#39;s keeper?</p>

<p>10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother&#39;s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</p>

<p>11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother&#39;s blood from thy hand;</p>

<p>The same as when Adam new Eve and conceived Cain it repeats this when Everyone has Seth.</p>

<p>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</p>

<p>26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>We also know by the scriptures that the serpent is an earth born/made creature similar to a beast of the field, not a god.</p>

<p>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made</p>

<p>And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field</p>

<p>Specifically referencing cattle, and beasts of the field, not another human like creature.</p>

<p>It is blasphemous to believe that Eve conceived with the serpent!
If the fruit from the tree is sexual experience, then why is also the tree of Life/Immortality also a tree that you eat the fruit of? </p>

<p>And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</p>

<p>It specifically states take forth. his hand and take from the tree of Life.</p>

<p>23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</p>

<p>24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

<p>These &quot;trees&quot; of knowledge, and Life are therefore real objects that are protected, not ideas.</p>

<p>The woman is not Eve but Israel. This is how it connects to Israel for the messiah is the Bride Groom to Israel. The seed was Jacob who became Israel. </p>

<p>Remember? The LORD divorced his people that is why we went through the transatlantic slave trade. </p>

<p><strong>Jeremiah 3:8 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>8 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly showing that the woman is God&#39;s chosen people.</p>

<p>Matthew 25 goes into full detail that the messiah is the bridegroom awaiting to marry his bride (Israel). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It also specifically states that they are brothers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was thousands of years before Esau and Jacob. This was the first time, time before, when God destroyed the earth the first time. </p>

<p>They were reincarnated later as Jacob and Esau, which is our time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also know by the scriptures that the serpent is an earth born/made creature similar to a beast of the field, not a god.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No the serpent is a metaphor for a person. The Serpent is the spirit of rebellion against God. It was not an actual serpent but a cunning entity created deliberately to trick the world. I.E. Chaos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is blasphemous to believe that Eve conceived with the serpent! If the fruit from the tree is sexual experience, then why is also the tree of Life/Immortality also a tree that you eat the fruit of?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said this. The serpent was a spirit. Thus it had been through influence that he had entered Cain. This is why God protected Cain and placed the mark on him because prophecy must be fulfilled. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The woman in genesis is Eve. She isnt named until genesis 3:20. She is called woman, and then named Eve. Never reference as a bride of any sort. </p>

<p>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</p>

<p>2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</p>

<p>3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</p>

<p>4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</p>

<p>5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</p>

<p>6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</p>

<p>12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</p>

<p>13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</p>

<p>14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</p>

<p>15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</p>

<p>16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; </p>

<p>20 And Adam called his wife&#39;s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</p>

<p>21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</p>

<p>22 And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</p>

<p>Therefore the woman reference in Genesis is Eve. She is the first woman. She is named in Genesis 3:20. </p>

<p>The serpent in Genesis is used as the Hebrew word nahash. Which literally means snake. So we have a talking snake like creature. Everytime serpent, or nahash is used in the Bible it reference a snake, not a spirit. Spirit is the breath of life. Holy breath, or the holy word.</p>

<p>The woman in genesis is Eve. She isnt named until genesis 3:20. She is called woman, and then named Eve. Never reference as a bride of any sort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to look deeper.</p>

<p>The <strong>Woman</strong> is referring to Jacob and Esau being at odds until the very end of the world. In which Edom will finally be revealed as the serpent, the devil who is also Satan. </p>

<p><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:3 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, <strong>and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The son who will be revealed as the devil, the deceiver on earth are the children of Edom. The entire world will have this awakening at once. Thus world war 3 will begin.</p>

<p>This is why the serpent is hunting the woman in Revelation 12.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 12 KJV</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>12 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; <strong>a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</strong></p>

<p>2 <strong>And she being with child cried,</strong> travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</p>

<p>3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; <strong>and behold a great red dragon,</strong> having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</p>

<p>4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and <strong>the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The woman is Israel and the child is the prophecy that Jacob will be given the earth again by the will of God. Thus it is Edom&#39;s part to exterminate Jacob before this can happen in order to retain power on the earth. Of course we know that this is futile for both sides are controlled by God. Hence we see the clear reason why the so called white man is the example of the height of power in society all over the world, while the so called black is the example of the low.</p>

<p><strong>When Jacob did not follow the laws this is what happened as a curse by God:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:44 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: <strong>he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>When Jacob wakes up and realizes who he is this will happen:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:13 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 <strong>And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail;</strong> and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the serpent not being used in the context of men it is.</p>

<p><strong>Job 26:13</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Habakkuk 2:4 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:13</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consider the work of God: <strong>for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These metaphorical understandings. These are precepts talking about the seed of one particular nation. </p>

<p>You see down here with the rest of us, Edomites don&#39;t know they resonate with the devil. So everyone just gets a mixture of all type the things. The problem heavily conflates when one is actually tasked to do the work of God and understand the Bible. That is when the clear indication of if one is of Israel or not can be acknowledged. The Edomite leaders know very well who they are, they don&#39;t hide it. That&#39;s why in all the rich Edomite areas, you&#39;ll find heavy Satanic devil worship. Now can Edom come out and say openly they worship Satan behind closed doors? No.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp73zbYwaqw">Donald Trump Says he doesn&#39;t ask God&#39;s Forgiveness</a></p>

<p>The higher up, the more they denounce following God and the more they admit to following Satan.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBFuEo0Jzd8&amp;amp;t=1s">Freemason Admits That Lucifer is the SAME as Jesus Christ!</a></p>

<p>Edom, can&#39;t worship God. It&#39;s not possible even the other nations were given a little spirit to do so but Esau is the only nation in the Bible that is referred in HATE.</p>

<p><strong>Romans 9:13 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Genesis 36:8</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it this way. Two completely different beings similar to the Greek Prometheus, and Zeus, or Enki, and Enlil, these are two distinct beings that represent God, or elohim gods. Prometheus created the human race, so he is God,Zeus is king of the gods so he is also God. Primitive man  wouldn&#39;t have been able to distinguish between the two. Example God is revealed as some pretty insane things at times right? Wheels within wheels, flaming bushes, fire , or light ,etc. But wait here in genesis God walked around in the garden talking with man. Sounds pretty human like walking around talking in a personel garden. Like when the Bible says LORD God, it is saying YHWH elohim, or God of the Gods. One God sends the flood the other God saves man, one God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son, and the other God says wait no don&#39;t , etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Baal means Lord, or Master. Baal-im is the plural form. Lord, or Masters. LORD in the Bible is usually YHWH, and God is usually the plural elohim.  We can agree on this right? Therefore to me it should be translated. Adonai (אֲדֹנָי‬, lit. &quot;My Lords&quot;) is the plural form of adon (&quot;Lord&quot;) along with the first-person singular pronoun enclitic. As with Elohim, Adonai&#39;s grammatical form is usually explained as a plural of majesty. In the Hebrew Bible, it is nearly always used to refer to God (approximately 450 occurrences). Either way it is plural.</p>

<p>18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father&#39;s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim.</p>

<p>you have forsaken the commandments of the adonia/Lord/gods, and has followed Masters.</p>

<p>21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</p>

<p>if the adonia/Lords/gods be elohim/gods, but if your master be elohim/gods </p>

<p>Only when it is pronounced LORD all capital that the translation is YHWH. That doesn&#39;t happen here. Adonia is the plural of adon, elohim is plural cause of the -im, and baal-im is the plural of baal.<br/>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Baal means Lord, or Master. Baal-im is the plural form. Lord, or Masters. LORD in the Bible is usually YHWH, and God is usually the plural elohim. We can agree on this right? Therefore to me it should be translated. Adonai (אֲדֹנָי‬, lit. &quot;My Lords&quot;) is the plural form of adon (&quot;Lord&quot;) along with the first-person singular pronoun enclitic. As with Elohim, Adonai&#39;s grammatical form is usually explained as a plural of majesty. In the Hebrew Bible, it is nearly always used to refer to God (approximately 450 occurrences). Either way it is plural.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We cannot, because there is but one God. Elohim simply refers to the powers. Satan is an angel on the LORD&#39;s left hand side while Yahawashi (Jesus) is the angel on his right. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if the adonia/Lords/gods be elohim/gods, but if your master(human) be the elohim/gods then follow him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is correct but for the wrong reasons. It is because all God&#39;s are false God&#39;s but Yahawah within the understanding of the Bible. Thus worshiping the spiritual demon Satan will only result in worshiping the matrix, I.E. the flesh. They could have worshiped a rock and it would have been referred to as Baal.</p>

<p>In other words he told the children of Israel if you worship the spirit of God then do so but if you worship the matrix created by him then do that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s saying that the children of Israel (not the other 17 nations) will stop worshiping Baal and begin to worship Yahawah and Yahawashi. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Psalm 110 these should all most likely be plural. Basically the Gods said unto my gods. Anyway it says Lord said unto my Lord both with only the Last capitalized. This can&#39;t be referring to the same being either.</p>

<p>110 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>

<p>2 The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</p>

<p>3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.</p>

<p>4 The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>

<p>5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.</p>

<p>6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.</p>

<p>7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.</p>

<p>Talking about Yahawashi (the lamb) who sits at the right hand of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the messiah comes he will destroy all of Israel&#39;s enemies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Israel will be waiting for their salvation and willing once they can see the prophecies are real and that they are protected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yahawah will keep the promise of giving the entire world to the true people of Israel. To prove that it is speaking of Yahawah here is the link to  the strongs for proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve had this conversation before. </p>

<p>Baal = LORD</p>

<p>But the LORD they are referring to is the LORD of this world not the LORD of everything who&#39;s name is Yahawah. </p>

<p>The same context is understood when the word is Gentile is used two diffrent ways in the Bible</p>

<p>Gentile (1) = Gentile who is of another nation and NOT of Israel.</p>

<p>Gentile (2) = Israelite who follows the customs of other nations because they don&#39;t know they are Israelite&#39;s via diaspora. </p>

<p>The context of the scripture you pulled was talking about the LORD but we see it is clearly used differently in other parts of the Bible. </p>

<p>1 Kings 18:18-21 King James Version (KJV)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father&#39;s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim.</p>

<p>19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel&#39;s table.</p>

<p>20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</p>

<p>21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? <strong>if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.</strong> And the people answered him not a word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we clearly see that majority of the time the phrase BAAL is used it is referring to any God that is not Yahawah. We can also conclude that the word LORD is used in the Bible almost 8000 times instead of the word Baal. </p>

<p>Clearly showing us that there was a difference between the two. </p>

<p>Again, as I posted above, the word Baal does mean lord but it unanimously follows the conditions that it is used only when speaking about a FALSE GOD that is not the God of Israel but of other religions and belief systems. Thus, Rothschild knows they worship the devil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So before I start, I like to make sure that it is known that I am using the Bible as my form of facts. Because this is based on faith, it will be up to you to decide what is what and if you agree with the holy artifact. Again, that is because of faith. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All humans are God like. If you are a human you are a god. Not just the &quot;Jews&quot;. When the Elohim genetically altered us into humans we became like gods. Minus the immortality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2 Esdras 6:56</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>As for the other people which also come of Adam</strong>, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like vnto spittle, and hast likened the abundance of them vnto a drop that falleth from a vessell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 7:6 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Isaiah 40:15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 32:8</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many more precepts that detail this. There is but one nation that God is looking out for. The sons of Edom know this, that is why they parade around as so called Jewish. They are not the Jews but the offspring of the twin brother of Jacob. </p>

<p>As for the following scripture:</p>

<p>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.</p>

<p>2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.</p>

<p>5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.</p>

<p>6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</p>

<p>7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p>

<p>8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</p>

<p>It is dedicated to Jacob (Yasharala) not to the nations. For the nations did something very bad to God&#39;s people long ago when Edom decided to make an oath with the nations. Therefore during judgement day, the truth shall be revealed and the other 17 nations will be recompensed.</p>

<p><strong>Obadiah 1:15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will even attempt to fight Yahawashi (Jesus) when the time comes for that prophecy to be fulfilled. </p>

<p><strong>Revelation 19:19</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 And I saw the beast, <strong>and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, the elite know the prophecies that will take place, they think they can fight it and they have known for a long time. </p>

<p>That is the reason for the following to videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The woman in genesis is Eve. She isnt named until genesis 3:20. She is called woman, and then named Eve. Never reference as a bride of any sort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to look deeper.</p>

<p>The <strong>Woman</strong> is referring to Jacob and Esau being at odds until the very end of the world. In which Edom will finally be revealed as the serpent, the devil who is also Satan. </p>

<p><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:3 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, <strong>and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The son who will be revealed as the devil, the deceiver on earth are the children of Edom. The entire world will have this awakening at once. Thus world war 3 will begin.</p>

<p>This is why the serpent is hunting the woman in Revelation 12.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 12 KJV</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>12 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; <strong>a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</strong></p>

<p>2 <strong>And she being with child cried,</strong> travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</p>

<p>3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; <strong>and behold a great red dragon,</strong> having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</p>

<p>4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and <strong>the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The woman is Israel and the child is the prophecy that Jacob will be given the earth again by the will of God. Thus it is Edom&#39;s part to exterminate Jacob before this can happen in order to retain power on the earth. Of course we know that this is futile for both sides are controlled by God. Hence we see the clear reason why the so called white man is the example of the height of power in society all over the world, while the so called black is the example of the low.</p>

<p><strong>When Jacob did not follow the laws this is what happened as a curse by God:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:44 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: <strong>he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>When Jacob wakes up and realizes who he is this will happen:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:13 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 <strong>And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail;</strong> and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the serpent not being used in the context of men it is.</p>

<p><strong>Job 26:13</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Habakkuk 2:4 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:13</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consider the work of God: <strong>for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These metaphorical understandings. These are precepts talking about the seed of one particular nation. </p>

<p>You see down here with the rest of us, Edomites don&#39;t know they resonate with the devil. So everyone just gets a mixture of all type the things. The problem heavily conflates when one is actually tasked to do the work of God and understand the Bible. That is when the clear indication of if one is of Israel or not can be acknowledged. The Edomite leaders know very well who they are, they don&#39;t hide it. That&#39;s why in all the rich Edomite areas, you&#39;ll find heavy Satanic devil worship. Now can Edom come out and say openly they worship Satan behind closed doors? No.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp73zbYwaqw">Donald Trump Says he doesn&#39;t ask God&#39;s Forgiveness</a></p>

<p>The higher up, the more they denounce following God and the more they admit to following Satan.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBFuEo0Jzd8&amp;amp;t=1s">Freemason Admits That Lucifer is the SAME as Jesus Christ!</a></p>

<p>Edom, can&#39;t worship God. It&#39;s not possible even the other nations were given a little spirit to do so but Esau is the only nation in the Bible that is referred in HATE.</p>

<p><strong>Romans 9:13 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Genesis 36:8</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.” </p>
