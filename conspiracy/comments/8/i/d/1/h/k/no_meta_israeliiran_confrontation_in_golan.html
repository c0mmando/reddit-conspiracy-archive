<hr/>

<p>I would like to start an open source investigation on the recent events that happened early in the morning of Thursday, May 10 (local time) in the Golan Heights between Israeli and Iranian forces in or around the Golan Heights. As near as I can tell, the Israelis are claiming the Iranian Quds forces fired 20 rockets on their position in the Golan Heights, and that they, the Israelis, have responded with cruise missiles and air strikes. The Syrian state news agency is claiming Israel initiated the first attack. <em>(These details are constantly changing, so some of this may be wrong. This is just the initial reporting.)</em></p>

<p>For this [No Meta], I&#39;d like to see if we can gather as many sources as we can, and map out a timeline of events, including the timing of the US withdrawing from the Iran deal. I know many of us have our various suspicions as to how this went down, yet I&#39;d like us to focus on what details and evidence we know, and how we know it (source, raw video, etc.)</p>

<p>To start with some sources, Zero Hedge has <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-09/explosions-reported-israel-syria-border-israel-activates-emergency-sirens">a good article</a> that is sourced and being updated. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iranian-forces-fire-rockets-at-israeli-military-in-first-direct-attack-ever-israeli-army-says/2018/05/09/62e3a526-52f7-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html">WaPo&#39;s article</a> is also worth reading to see how the Beltway is portraying this. </p>

<p>There is no open source discussion if zero hedge is involved.</p>

<p>This is getting into meta territory, so I&#39;d appreciate if we can discuss it here. </p>

<p>How do you think we could have an open source investigation by a priori deciding which sources are &quot;propaganda&quot; and which aren&#39;t? At the very least, even propaganda can have value in seeing what narratives the various factions are trying to promote. </p>

<p>Dismissing a source as propaganda without demonstrating why the information itself is incorrect is intellectually lazy. Try harder. </p>

<p>Please follow your own &quot;meta&quot; rules. There&#39;s nothing lazy about discussing propaganda in a (wink wink) open source investigation. Why not start from scratch? Using right wing propaganda is not open sourcing an investigation. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to try hard to show zero hedge is right wing propaganda- zero hedge does that for us all. </p>

<p>Zero Hedge aggregates content from a number of different sites, some of it good, some less so IMO. If you want me to answer your loaded question, I&#39;ll need to know what you mean by &quot;propaganda,&quot; specifically. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I did start from scratch, and then I posted two links to start the investigation. If you actually read the ZH article, you&#39;d see that it links to quite a few different sources. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You keep making this assertion. Open sourcing means we can bring together and share all types of different sources. You think intelligences agencies and contractors dismiss sources a priori and just ignore them altogether? Even if it is propaganda, it&#39;s more data points. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, you do. You&#39;re the one making a positive claim, so the burden of proof remains on you. So far you&#39;re only &quot;evidence&quot; is a fly-by-night site who won&#39;t even put their name behind what they put out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the false or dubious claims Zero Hedge has indulged in together with those websites include:</p>

<p>promoting forged documents from 4chan targeting then-French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron;</p>

<p>pushing conspiracy theories that the white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville, VA, consisted of paid actors and that the organizer was actually a liberal spy;</p>

<p>suggesting that the Clintons murdered a former Haitian government official;</p>

<p>claiming former Attorney General Loretta Lynch was “busted” for secretly using an alias to communicate with DOJ officials, despite her action being both precedented in government and already public knowledge.</p>

<p>saying anti-Trump protesters were bused into cities after the 2016 election.</p>

<p>claiming that the Defense Department was organizing a “national blackout” drill on the day anti-fascist group antifa was supposedly planning to hold a violent protest (it wasn’t);</p>

<p>pushing a conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was secretly behind a Hawaii federal judge’s ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s Muslim ban;</p>

<p>claiming that 4chan had made up what is now known as the “pee tape” portion of the Trump dossier; and</p>

<p>suggesting that a Bernie Sanders activist had been murdered in some kind of coverup.</p>

<p>Additionally, Zero Hedge has pushed multiple false stories from fake news website YourNewsWire and from fake news website True Pundit. It also pushed the conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate, and repeatedly promoted conspiracy theories surrounding slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich.</p>

<p>everything i saw today started with israel firing artillery at the outskirts of damascus. the rockets on the golan were in retaliation directed at the artillery that launched the attack, then israel justified the cruise missiles and bombings saying they were retaliating.</p>

<p>Israel was the aggressor from the very fucking beginning and have been attacking syria/ iranians for years inside of syria.</p>

<p>Israel is scum. Media is scum. You should follow r/syriancivilwar it is a very complex situation but u can learn very quick on there. </p>

<p>The Syrian government has basically ended the civil war. All rebels are surrending. So at thay same time Trump pulls out of the deal and Israel begins attacking. Interesting time I would say.</p>

<p>Reminder: The sites <em>supposedly</em> struck by the impotent rockets that Israel <em>claims</em> were fired by Iranian forces were <strong><em>not in Israel</em></strong>, but in the Golan Heights, which continues to be internationally recognized as part of <strong><em>Syria</em></strong>, though it has been Occupied and colonized by the Zionist Regime since the Six-Day War in 1967.</p>

<p>No clairvoyance required. Anyone who has been watching this scenario evolve and unfold could have (and should have) foreseen it.</p>

<p><strong><em>What happens next?</em></strong> Likely False Flag Stage 2: &quot;Iranians&quot; <em>(wink wink)</em> will likely attack United States assets - either on <em>(illegal)</em> US bases in Syria, or possibly against US ships in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf or the Gulf of Oman <em>(think USS Liberty, 1967)</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Difference:</strong> No one was killed or injured in the False Flag attack on the Golan Heights - but when US assets are hit, expect casualties. Why? Because the Zionist bastards know that if the blood of our boys is spilled, the US public will be st00pid enough to go into <em>Full Jingoist Retard Mode</em>: Logic and reason will be &quot;Trumped&quot; by emotion and ego... the enraged Peasants would not only support an all-out military assault on those <em>&quot;rag-headded heathans&quot;</em> in Iran and Syria, <strong><em>they would demand it</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, another less likely possibility <em>(god forbid)</em> would be an &quot;Iranian Terrorist Attack&quot; <em>(wink wink)</em> on civilian infrastructure on US soil - think of 9-11. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s hope I&#39;m wrong this time.</p>

<p>IMO the smartest thing Iran, Syria and Russia can do right now is <strong><em>not respond</em></strong>, except purely defensively against direct attacks, and <em>only</em> over Syrian (or Iranian) airspace. Any retaliation over Israeli or Israel-occupied territories would have them fall into the Zionist trap.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Russia, Iran and Syria need to <strong><em>stay calm</em></strong>, keep cool heads and use minimal hostile rhetoric. They need to coolly tell the world exactly what Israel and its Zionist lackeys in the US are up to, and WE need to do all WE can to help them get that message out (God knows the Zionist-controlled MSM will be parroting the lies of the Zionist hawks).</p>

<p>The only way that those Israel is attacking can win this game is <strong><em>not to play</em></strong>. That would expose Israel&#39;s dirty hand better than any other option. A lack of belligerent response will either force Israel to de-escalate, <strong><em>or</em></strong> force them into hitting U.S. targets with a major False Flag event -- and the latter, if exposed, would be the undoing of the Zionist Monster and its stranglehold over Western governments.</p>

<p>Good luck, and may God bless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually israel doesn&#39;t only want to take land but wants to be the ruling state in the world on top of the U. S
That&#39;s why israel wants to destroy the U. S</p>

<p>It&#39;s known for a fact that there are three periods</p>

<p>Britannica
Americana
Judiaca</p>

<p>Britannica a day would pass within a year
Americana a day would pass as a month
And Judiaca a week would pass as a day</p>

<p>Judiaca is when israel becomes the ruling state in the world
Altho it&#39;s very sad imagine the amount of corruption it&#39;s way way worse than any of the two periods and america has done alot of corruption and damage already</p>

<p>just imagine israel a country which follows the talmud which qualifies anyone non jewish as a goy or a lesser being
It&#39;s said that it&#39;s time would be bad enough that god would take away blessing from everything including time itself that&#39;s why time is shortening
And the reason for that is they are cursed so once they become a ruling state they curse everything else with it</p>

<p>That&#39;s why WW3 is important to israel once it plays victim and attacks iran and topples iran
Aside and destroy muslims worldwide
The Judiaca era would start i think</p>

<p>Watch this channel on youtube called Seek Daily </p>

<p>It will help (muslims are trying to explain what&#39;s going on with the world) </p>

<p>I would like to think so as well.  However, too many people still don’t connect the dots between government manipulation and the MSM, and they are therefore generally ignorant of the manipulation the MSM has upon how they think.  A lot of people may not trust the government, but then they’ll turn on the tv, swallow everything some MSM pundits tell them to think, and then wonder why it is they’re letting the government and the deep state off the hook for crimes they commit.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, but not too many if any MSM sources have given any of those truths too much airtime - so a lot of people still consider the absolutely overwhelming amount of valid 911 truth showing it to be an inside job perpetrated by the US deep state/government/Israel/Saudi Arabia to be “fringe information that may or may not be true.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The internet and Social media has been a great source of enlightenment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  It is because of the internet that so many have been woken up.  This is, of course, why TPTB want to shut it tf down.</p>

<p>Fuck them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but at our core, we remain the same gullible, reactionary creatures that we always were</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, although a great deal of us are gullible and reactionary, I’d say that a good portion of the reason we’re like that is not so much because it’s somehow inherent in us, but because we’ve been indoctrinated through covert manipulated from birth <em>to</em> be that way.</p>

<p>This fucker was definitely a big part of the problem (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44I3pMouCnM">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s">2</a>), but knowing your enemy helps combat the manipulation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Correct and agreed.  Those of us that have some information should therefore disseminate it as much and as often as possible so as to contribute to that critical mass awakening.</p>

<p>That was the spin that Netanyahu put on the meeting. The Kremlin has not yet commented.</p>

<p>Putin has always been something of a wild-card in this game. He is certainly no Boy Scout, but he is not stupid, and is no doubt wise to the games that the Zionists are playing here. He has been a victim of their False Flag ploys himself (Skripal poisoning incident) and has called out several other F.F.&#39;s regarding the alleged CW attacks in Syria.</p>

<p>I feel sure that Putin does <em>not</em> want direct confrontation with Israel or its &quot;Body Guard&quot; (the US), let alone WW3, and I suspect he is going to play his cards close to the vest, and allow Netanyahu and his Zionist Minions enough rope to hang themselves.</p>

<p>He seems to have a talent for keeping a cool head and avoiding rash decisions and bellicose rhetoric, and so far, it has served him well. I hope he will advise the leaders of Iran and Syria to do likewise.</p>

<p>No clairvoyance required. Anyone who has been watching this scenario evolve and unfold could have (and should have) foreseen it.</p>

<p><strong><em>What happens next?</em></strong> Likely False Flag Stage 2: &quot;Iranians&quot; <em>(wink wink)</em> will likely attack United States assets - either on <em>(illegal)</em> US bases in Syria, or possibly against US ships in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf or the Gulf of Oman <em>(think USS Liberty, 1967)</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Difference:</strong> No one was killed or injured in the False Flag attack on the Golan Heights - but when US assets are hit, expect casualties. Why? Because the Zionist bastards know that if the blood of our boys is spilled, the US public will be st00pid enough to go into <em>Full Jingoist Retard Mode</em>: Logic and reason will be &quot;Trumped&quot; by emotion and ego... the enraged Peasants would not only support an all-out military assault on those <em>&quot;rag-headded heathans&quot;</em> in Iran and Syria, <strong><em>they would demand it</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, another less likely possibility <em>(god forbid)</em> would be an &quot;Iranian Terrorist Attack&quot; <em>(wink wink)</em> on civilian infrastructure on US soil - think of 9-11. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s hope I&#39;m wrong this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the late hours of May 9 2018, Israel struck an Iranian base in Kisweh, Damascus province and fired artillery and mortars at Syrian Army positions in al-Ba’ath City in Quneitra province. This escalated into a large exchange of rockets and artillery fire. This map shows the provinces where military targets were struck in both countries.</p>

<p>Confirmed Israeli strikes have hit al-Hader town in the UNDOF observer zone on the border between Israel and Syria. An Israeli missile also targeted an area southeast of Damascus, though it was shot down by Syrian Air Defense. Quneitra province, home to al-Ba’ath City, was also struck by Israeli mortars and tank shells.</p>

<p>May 2018 Israeli-Syrian Clashes</p>

<p>In turn, the Syrian Army ( *Israel claims they were Iranian forces, <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5256495,00.html">Iran denied it</a>) fired (multiple volleys of at least 20 MLRS rockets at four Israeli Defense Forces sites in the Golan Heights, Hazafon district. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted “several” of the rockets according to the IDF. Israel claimed the rockets were fired by Iran’s Quds Force (Jerusalem Brigade).</p>

<p>Israel responded to this attack in the early morning of May 10 by firing a barrage of missiles into Syria’s Quneitra province. Missiles also targeted Syrian military sites in Kiswah and Khan Arnabeh. Syrian anti-aircraft guns responded intensely.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
IsraelSyria1
Map of targets struck by varying Israeli munitions. This map should not be regarded as comprehensive or complete, as the situation is evolving rapidly.
At 3:00 AM Syrian time, another massive round of Israeli cruise missiles struck the 10th Division base, 4th Division base, the Republican Guard command base in Qasioun, military bases in Kiswah, and Douma. Syrian Army artillery responded by shelling Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. There are also reports that Syrian air defenses downed an Israeli cruise missile over Homs province. Three people in Syria have been killed, and two wounded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need some context here- Golan Heights is not part of Israel, as the media wants you to believe.  It&#39;s legally part of Syria.  Even the US admits that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States considers the Golan Heights to be Syrian territory held under Israeli occupation subject to negotiation and Israeli withdrawal. The United States considers the application of Israeli law to the Golan Heights to be a violation of international law, both the Fourth Geneva Convention&#39;s prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force and United Nations Security Council Resolution 242.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_497">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_497</a></p>

<p>We should also recognize that one of the drivers for this landgrab is energy resources accessible from the Golan Heights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the early 1990s, the Israel National Oil Company (INOC) was granted shaft-sinking permits in the Golan Heights. It estimated a recovery potential of two million barrels of oil, equivalent at the time to $24 million. During the Yitzhak Rabin administration (1992–1995), the permits were suspended as efforts were undertaken to restart peace negotiations between Israel and Syria. In 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu granted preliminary approval to INOC to proceed with oil exploration drilling in the Golan.[177][178][179] INOC began undergoing a process of privatization in 1997, overseen by then-Director of the Government Companies Authority (GCA), Tzipi Livni. During that time, it was decided that INOC&#39;s drilling permits would be returned to the state.[180][181] In 2012, National Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau approved exploratory drilling for oil and natural gas in the Golan.[182] The following year, the Petroleum Council of Israel&#39;s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources secretly awarded a drilling license covering half the area of the Golan Heights to a local subsidiary of New Jersey-based Genie Energy Ltd. headed by Effi Eitam</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points. </p>

<p>Genie Energy, the company you mention who received the drilling license, has some interesting members on their <a href="https://genieoilgas.com/about-us/strategic-advisory-board/">Strategic Advisory Board</a>, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dick Cheney, nuff said</li>
<li>Marry Landrieu, former US Senator </li>
<li>Rupert Murdoch, FOX News owner</li>
<li>Bill Richardson, former New Mexico Governor and DNC chair</li>
<li>Jacob Rothschild, yes <em>that</em> Jacob Rothschild</li>
<li>Larry Summers, Treasury Secretary under Clinton</li>
<li>James Woolsey, former CIA Director under Clinton</li>
</ul>

<p>If you told someone on the default subs that there was a conspiracy involving these people, they&#39;d call you paranoid. Even as someone who well-versed in recent geopolitical history, this cast of characters seems like it&#39;s straight out of conspiracy fan fic. But here they are, all part of a company that would make hundreds of millions if not billions from extracting the Golan Heights oil. </p>

<p>to add to that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An influential group is now lobbying Israel’s government to take advantage of the chaos in Syria and demand international recognition of its control of 1,200 square kilometres (460 square miles) on the Golan. The group includes Zvi Hauser, a former cabinet secretary to the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has urged that Israel should demand this as a compensation for having to tolerate the nuclear agreement with Iran.</p>

<p>here&#39;s where it gets more interesting when it comes to the grand chessboard:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Washington wants to force a political reconciliation between Netanyahu and Turkey’s Erdogan, including a deal in which Turkey would become a major buyer of Israeli offshore gas, making major purchase agreements from Leviathan. For Washington that would reduce Turkish dependency, today more than 60%, on imports of Russian gas. In return Israel would agree to sell Turkey advanced Israeli military equipment with Washington approval.</p>

<p>First Leviathan. In late 2010 Israel announced discovery of a massive “super-giant” gas field offshore in what it declares is its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). It’s located in what geologists call the Levant or Levantine Basin. The find is some 84 miles west of the Haifa port and three miles deep. They named it Leviathan after the Biblical sea monster. Three Israeli energy companies, led by Delek Energy, in cooperation with the Houston Texas Noble Energy announced initial estimates that the field contained 16 trillion cubic feet of gas—making it the world’s biggest deep-water gas find in a decade. For the first time since creation of the Israeli state in 1948, the country would be self-sufficient in energy and even in a position to become a major gas exporter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turkey is a primary nexus for Russian LNG into western europe.  As the atlanticists are working to westernize their NATO ally, we risk losing them to Russia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turkey is expected to consume about 15.75 billion cubic metres per annum (556 billion cubic feet per annum), the rest of the gas is planned be brought to the Greek–Turkish border to be exported by connecting pipelines to Europe.[13] However, there are concerns that there is not enough capacity to transport this amount from the Greek–Turkish border further to Europe.[14] According to the European Commissioner for Energy Maroš Šefčovič the proposed pipeline exceeds demands of possible customers.[15] The planned follow-on projects to bring Russian gas from TurkStream into Europe include the Tesla Pipeline, to run from Greece to Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary, ending at the Baumgarten gas hub in Austria;[16] and Eastring, planned to carry gas north via Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. Early 2016, Gazprom signed a Memorandum of Understanding with DEPA SA for natural gas deliveries to Europe via Interconnector Turkey–Greece–Italy,[17] a southern route to run from Greece to Italy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if erdogan doesn&#39;t play ball, and allows the russian pipelines- you can expect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergenekon_(organization">ergenekon</a>) and the gulenists to show him the door. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks- i need to put a bit more organizational thought into a post.  it&#39;s a pretty complex topic with a bunch of moving parts, but Turkey is essential to the geostrategic interests of the east and west, and a major thoroughfare on the world island (silk road).  Just collecting the information right now and will let you know when I post something in the next month.</p>

<p>As Germany is banning arms sails to Turkey, Turkey is being armed to the teeth by both the UK and Russia right now, and Erdogan is meeting with Theresa May in London this week</p>

<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/28/theresa-may-arrives-turkey-post-brexit-trade-talks/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/28/theresa-may-arrives-turkey-post-brexit-trade-talks/</a></p>

<p>meanwhile the US is threatening to STOP selling weapons to Erdogan (not over human rights abuses, but because they&#39;re buying weapons from Russia)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TURKISH President Recep Erdogan has warned he will “retaliate” if Donald Trump bans the sale of weapons over Ankara’s decision to buy arms from Russia in a deepening row between the two major NATO allies, with the US taking an increasingly robust stance in the conflict. </p>

<p>If the Act was passed, it would see all sales of US defence weaponry to Turkey halted, pending a report on the relationship between the two nations.</p>

<p>Turkish officials have been angered by the plans because they had been negotiating the purchase of Patriot missiles and more than 100 Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Jets with America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/956168/turkey-usa-donald-trump-russia-weapons-arms-deal">https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/956168/turkey-usa-donald-trump-russia-weapons-arms-deal</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s what Brzezinsky said about Turkey in The Grand Chessboard:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turkey stabilizes the Black Sea region, controls access from it to the Mediterranean Sea, balances Russia in the Caucasus, still offers an antidote to Muslim fundamentalism, and serves as the southern anchor for NATO. A destabilized Turkey would be likely to unleash more violence in the southern Balkans, while facilitating the reimposition of Russian control over the newly independent states of the Caucasus. </p>

<p>Turkey, a postimperial state still in the process of redefining its identity, is pulled in three directions: the modernists would like to see it become a European state and thus look to the west; the Islamists lean in the direction of the Middle East and a Muslim community and thus look to the south; and the historically minded 
nationalists see in the Turkic peoples of the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia a new mission for a regionally dominant Turkey and thus look eastward. Each of these perspectives posits a different strategic axis, and the clash between them introduces for the first time since the Kemalist revolution a measure of uncertainty 
regarding Turkey&#39;s regional role. </p>

<p>Moreover, Turkey itself could become at least a partial victim of the region&#39;s ethnic conflicts. Although its population of about 65 million is predominantly Turkish, with about 80 percent Turkic stock (though including a variety of Circassians, Albanians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, and Arabs), as much as 20 percent or perhaps even 
more are Kurdish. Concentrated in the country&#39;s eastern regions, the Turkish Kurds have increasingly been drawn into the struggle for national independence waged by the Iraqi and Iranian Kurds. Any internal tensions within Turkey regarding the country&#39;s overall direction would doubtless encourage the Kurds to press even more violently for a separate national status</p>

<p>Something about Iran positioning to attack Israel from &quot;Gaza, Lebanon in Syria&quot; by establishing bases in southern Syria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need some context here- Golan Heights is not part of Israel, as the media wants you to believe.  It&#39;s legally part of Syria.  Even the US admits that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States considers the Golan Heights to be Syrian territory held under Israeli occupation subject to negotiation and Israeli withdrawal. The United States considers the application of Israeli law to the Golan Heights to be a violation of international law, both the Fourth Geneva Convention&#39;s prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force and United Nations Security Council Resolution 242.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_497">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_497</a></p>

<p>We should also recognize that one of the drivers for this landgrab is energy resources accessible from the Golan Heights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the early 1990s, the Israel National Oil Company (INOC) was granted shaft-sinking permits in the Golan Heights. It estimated a recovery potential of two million barrels of oil, equivalent at the time to $24 million. During the Yitzhak Rabin administration (1992–1995), the permits were suspended as efforts were undertaken to restart peace negotiations between Israel and Syria. In 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu granted preliminary approval to INOC to proceed with oil exploration drilling in the Golan.[177][178][179] INOC began undergoing a process of privatization in 1997, overseen by then-Director of the Government Companies Authority (GCA), Tzipi Livni. During that time, it was decided that INOC&#39;s drilling permits would be returned to the state.[180][181] In 2012, National Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau approved exploratory drilling for oil and natural gas in the Golan.[182] The following year, the Petroleum Council of Israel&#39;s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources secretly awarded a drilling license covering half the area of the Golan Heights to a local subsidiary of New Jersey-based Genie Energy Ltd. headed by Effi Eitam</p>
