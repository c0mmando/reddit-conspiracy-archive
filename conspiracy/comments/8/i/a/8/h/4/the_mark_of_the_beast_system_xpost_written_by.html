       People are often dissuaded from reading the bible because they think its ideas are old and out of touch. I say they are not reading it right. You have to read it for the implication and its extensions instead of literally. This is basically what rabbis and all religious scholars do, painstakingly comb through each passage of the bible, looking for hidden meanings and implications. People think that these political "religious nuts" are unknowingly/knowingly following the bible, when its the other way around. The bible foretells all major events, you just have to know how to connect the events here on earth with the bibles parables.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the revelation, mark of the beast, what exactly are they trying to say? I think I've figured it out, or at least this is my interpretation from my experience with this sadistic system. We are already in the end times and 5g cell towers are the enablers of this "mark of the beast system." They can easily discern between different individuals according to their genetic frequency (dna), which means those who actually have the "mark of the beast" will be exempted, free from the invisible (but physically real) attack beam. While those who are dissenters or speak out against their satanist masters will be constantly annoyed and tortured by this system (targeted individuals). This will go on until either the people successfully revolt and remove them OR God intervenes some other way.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this system will do is basically torture the dissenter into submission, without anyone but the victim ever knowing (invisible attack). It will also constantly police peoples thoughts and alert command center controllers of dissent. The command center can then decide what body part to excite to elicit the appropriate response (twitch right bicep to anger, twitch left to calm down). There are infinite other things this system can do to the body such as make you feel like your drowning and even pre-program dreams. These are all things I have personally experienced, read my past posts. People think this is crazy and impossible but when you learn that every body part and thought has a certain frequency signature (#), then realizing that you can scan for and identify these frequencies,tune into them with precision and manipulate function, is not outrageous. After all, the basis of all bodily functions are ELECTRICAL impulses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, the internet is as fast as can be with 4G, yet there is this sudden push to 5G and a first ever government rollout throughout the United States. I believe they held off on this "nationalized broadband" rollout until they got the system to exactly where they want it with testing and upgrades. Now that they are satisfied with the setup, they will nationalize 5G broadband system under the guise of "bringing free WIFI to America!" While in reality it will be the worst thing to ever happen to the American people. I also think that bitcoin may play a role as how can you deactivate someones paper money? With bitcoin, your wallet and money is all digital, so if you are part of the dissenters, they may disable your wallet for say a week as punishment. Eventually you will relent, and obey. I believe that now is the most important time to stop this system because once its up and running, it will be a done deal.

       <p>
        Spending my friday? It took &lt;4 minutes to spot the fact that you identified yourself as that username while elsewhere pretending that username was a different person. Why did I take the 4 minutes? because your dragon post was either really creative (albeit inherently contradictory) shitposting or the ramblings of someone losing their grip on sanity and I was curious which was the case.
       </p>

       There is no way for you to say that you didn't present yourself as a different person than the u/willgofurther account in this thread. You aren't being persecuted. I need no 'affiliation' to call out someone's bullshit.
       <br/>
       Why did you lie? Why are you trying to defend, or divert attention from, that lie by accusing me of nefarious intentions? Why are you entitled to lie and not be called out on the lie?

       Do you selectively read what you want and ignore the rest? If you actually read the dragon post, you would see that it was written by someone else. First line indicates that. Second, if I were trying to impersonate another person then A) Why would I link back to my main account through a comment!? B) Why would I link back to my main account through my channel description? As far as posting titles indicating
       <a href="/u/willgofurther">

       is my neighbor, obviously i'm not going to mention it being me so my post won't be immediately censored. And i'm glad you brought up the fact that I can be banned for whatever reason, which I believe is an attack on my freedom of speech. Reddit has become an accepted form communication, banning me from the conspiracy forum of all forums because you just feel like it is grounds for legal action.

       Given your already demonstrated willingness to masquerade with different identities, "If you actually read the dragon post, you would see that it was written by someone else." means nothing. Additionally, the author is indicated by name, not username, and there is nothing to declare that the username is not you. Additionally, again, it is in no required for you to be the author of that post; you shared and clearly support it, therefore the following actions proceed the same.

       you already asked this. that you aren't a consistent liar doesn't make you not a liar. I quoted you, from title and comment, where you very clearly refer to u/willgofuther as another individual. You have not contested that because you can't.

       Which brings us right back around to my initial statement; that you are knowingly and intentionally misrepresenting yourself on thei NYC_subway account as being a different person than the willgofurther account. You can not try to argue that you didn't do that with the weak and already addressed arguments above, and then flat out admit and try to justify your lies mere sentences later. You can not have your cake and eat it to.

       Nope. You are wrong entirely. Reddit is not the government. You have not been fined or imprisoned as a result of your speech. You have not been doxxed or threatened as a way to suppress your speech. You commented on a privately run website with clearly listed rules. you violated those rules and received the appropriate and well-known consequences. This is in no way shape or form a violation of Freedom of Speech nor is it any grounds for legal action... but hey, don't let me stop you from drafting up some looney-bin, inherently contradictory, ignorance-riddled draft of 'legal action' and trying to pursue it against Reddit or any of the subs.

       Let me ask you this, what will I have gained from doing this workaround? Am I profiting in anyway? No. Am I hurting someone in anyway? No. Am I being manipulative? Depends on if you believe the original ban was fair. I feel like not only was it not, but that it was deliberately orchestrated. My ban reason was posting off topic. I had only posted 2 posts by that point and both were 100% conspiracy related. I got banned because I am saying things that are super hurtful to the establishment. Is that okay with you? That someone whose life is so heavily monitored and controlled finally finds an outlet to discuss the various things happening to them and is instantly shutdown. Reddit doesn't have to be the government, it still has to abide by our constitutional rights. As far as analogies go, reddit could be compared to a store you visit. Maybe even more than a store since it has the added responsibility of storing data indefinitely. Is it legal for a store owner to ban you just because you had an off-topic discussion?

       rules it is unconstitutional to merely block a twitter user). The user wasn't banned from all of Twitter but was instead blocked by trump. I'd say that is pretty similar to my situation. I wish what I was telling you was paranoia, but unfortunately, it's not. The government is able to know down to the details, what your future holds. If you know someone is going to be the one to overthrow the current satanic rule, then you attack and surveil that person with all you got.

      <p>
       The headline of your linked article; right from the hump it is clear that the article and judges ruling pertain to the unconstitutionality of Trump, as sitting President, blocking users NOT in any way declaring it illegal for Twitter to ban users as they please, as they do.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But on Wednesday, one of Mr. Trump’s Twitter habits — his practice of blocking critics on the service, preventing them from engaging with his account — was declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in Manhattan.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Excerpt #1 specifying that the ruling pertains to Trumps actions in blocking Twitter users from his account NOT Twiiter banning users from the service.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, addressing a novel issue about how the Constitution applies to social media platforms and public officials, found that
        <strong>
         the president’s Twitter feed is a public forum.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       [Emphasis mine] Excerpt #2
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If the principle undergirding Wednesday’s ruling in Federal District Court stands, it is likely to have implications far beyond Mr. Trump’s feed and its 52 million followers... Public officials throughout the country, from local politicians to governors and members of Congress, regularly use social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to interact with the public about government business.“
        <br/>
        "This ruling should put them on notice, and if they censor critics from social media accounts used for official purposes, they run the risk that someone will sue them and win,”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Excerpt #3 again clarifying that the issue is with individuals in public office, whose Twitter accounts - when used as a an aspect of communication for their position - qualify as a public forum NOT that Twitter itself is a constitutionally guaranteed forum nor does it prohibit Twitter from banning users from the service as they see fit.

       No its not similar AT ALL.
      </p>
      <p>
       it was rules unconstitutional BECAUSE Trump is the sitting president and his use of his Twitter account as a means of communicating policy and other information pertaining to his position; that is what makes Trumps (and opens the potential for other governmental officials to face the same) Twitter account a public forum bound by consitutionality as opposed to any other non-governmental figure who might have an account on Twitter and would remain free to block who they like. Sub Reddits are in no way equivalent to Trumps Twitter account nor would they be viewed as constitutionally protected forums by this standard since they are not run by governmental officials acting in official capacity nor do they claim to be. I already quoted from the article where it clarifies this, but you have hypocritically chosen to read what you want and ignore the rest:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This ruling should put them on notice, and if they censor critics from social media accounts used for official purposes, they run the risk that someone will sue them and win
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiffs had argued that Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed is an official government account and that blocking users from following it is a violation of their First Amendment rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their complaint argued that Mr. Trump’s feed amounted to a “digital town hall” where not only did the president and his aides communicate information but members of the public — by replying to Mr. Trump’s tweets and others who responded to him — exchanged views with one another. By blocking particular people from viewing or replying to message chains because they had expressed views he did not like, it argued, Mr. Trump had violated their First Amendment rights.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then here where it indicates the difference between a private account which would not be held to this standard vs the public forum that Trumps Twitter qualifies as due to his position and the usage of his Twitter in official capacity,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The ruling also rejected the government’s claim that Mr. Trump operates the account merely in a personal capacity, concluding that he “uses the account to take actions that can be taken only by the president as president.”
       </p>

       If you have access to enough of the nodes worldwide, which I presume deep state does, you can possibly shut down someone’s wallet. Wouldn’t matter what you have on paper when the account has already been modified online.

       No one KNOWS if there is or is not a God... all we have is our beliefs. Atheism is a belief system as much as any religion, founded on assumptions, observations and guess-work. Nothing scientific, nothing concrete - so take your opinion and go work on it a bit, it needs to ferment a bit more.

       Religion never [cut living people open to "study"]() - they did it because they were "heretics of the faith". At least religion didn't PRETEND it was for "the betterment of all mankind", like science does.

       Religion has been around a lot longer than science and more people have been murdered in the name of god than all science experiments combined. You are seriously stupid if you think not a single person was harmed for god. I seem to remember people being beheaded for...what exactly? Oh, let's not forget suicide bombers. May not be YOUR god but god none the less.

       No. Nothing points to a god, we don't need god to explain anything anymore (god of the gaps). We know our origins (evolution), the origins of Earth, of the Universe (big bang) and its patterns (physics laws).

       You BELIEVE there is no evidence of God, perhaps there is none in your life, I do not know and cannot make it happen. You BELIEVE based on what you see.

       I believe based on my life experiences, those you cannot see or understand.

       The onus is all on you. We've searched the universe, biology, history, physics and math. There is no sign of god. Just like there is no sign that the universe is gonna end in the next 10 seconds............... what a surprise! It didn't end! Same amount of evidence as god, so what does that tell you? Yes! That
       <strong>
        god is irrelevant

       And your ignorance is making you a sheep. Fight the ignorance, which is impossible in religion since it relies on people's ignorance (god of the gaps - how can you explain humans, how can u explain earth, how can u explain blood, how can u explain the universe and so on are examples of people pulling the god of the gaps when they have no knowledge on the subject - and faith, which is belief in the impossible/unreasonable).

       But they all rely on evidence and not on beliefs. Otherwise we wouldn't have cars, internet, electricity and such. We also wouldn't know our origens (evolution) or that earth is not flat since questioning goes agaisnt religions (logic goes agaisnt faith).

       Atheism is a religion "bro" - its a set of beliefs based on the evidence of your eyes, which you cannot force onto, explain, share or prove to anyone else. Burden of proof lies on the person trying to change someones opinion - including upon atheists trying to convert theists. If you can't recognize that, you are really disconnected from what it means to have a conversation with someone who has different thoughts than you... thought that is the typical liberal scientific fundamentalist socialist/communist mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not your fault you are equally as intolerant and ignorant as any priest or zealot, but now that you know - you have to make a choice - to be more accepting of other people's beliefs if you want them to respect yours - or you can continue being an aggressive troll that no one will bother listening to.

       Thanks for making me feel even better about my dislike of atheists! Cya round!

       To say that
       <strong>
        knowing
       </strong>
       that the earth is not flat is a belief is very ridiculous. Atheism is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a religion since there's no faith, no belief. Just reality. If you doubt your own reality then you should seek a therapist real fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really lack some knowledge about reality. It's scary dude. Read some real stuff instead of mythologies. Don't take them seriously lmao.

       To say you know that there is no god is a fundamental lie - to others and to yourself, that's all there is to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a belief system, one that believes there is no god.

       You lack the basic humility to admit what you do not

       Well at least you can admit your beliefs are based on your experiences! Now you can understand how I have my beliefs based on my experiences! Hooray we are getting somewhere!
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you fall right back into being wrong. I actually don't subscribe to any religion... or any specific mythology - in fact I find the truth of human religions likely lies in human history/action and astrotheology - and most of the events ascribed to God are nothing more than people telling stories, telling tricks or embellishing.

       that. Your brain can be easily tricked. You can literally hallucinate while sober (sleep paralysis) and actually think it was real. Placebo effect is amazingly effective too.

       So, instead of assuming absurdities and taking ridiculous leaps with no logic at all, why not keep it real and rational? The god of the gaps is used by every generation, and it always fails. Just give up and assume that you are nothing but some animals lost in a planet on a ordinary galaxy completely irrelevant to reality itself. And that's not sad, it's beautiful.

       it was a FACT. All generations have increasing numbers of atheists and non-religious. The statistics show that in the future religious people will be minority.

       About god: I don't have to prove it doesn't exist, since it doesn't. You or god have to show up and prove it's actually there somewhere. Until then, it remains together with Big Foot, Zeus, Talking donkeys and Unicorns - on 'myths' category.

       Stories and myths have metaphors. Its another level of understanding and appreciation. People remember stories and metaphors. People had to write what "God said". So we obviously didn't remember what he said as well as we remember the metaphorical stories. The existence of holy books shows these stories are global, human metaphors. If you cant find anything important in that then reread my two comments and assume, as a thought experiment, that they are a truer explanation for religion than simple minded bullshit and lies

       Not another level but another way of passing knowledge. But the thing is: we don't live in caves anymore nor we burn people that say god is not real. We don't need beliefs and mythologies and metaphors to explain mundanes and actual
       <strong>
        real
       </strong>
       things. We don't need the bible nor god to know what is good, moral and ethic. If anything, the belief in god makes it harder and worse (see that religions have done more HARM than good, but humanity is finally leaving this virus behind).

       You see the public, large scale harm that religions do. But everyone that makes this point glosses over the private, small scale improvements in people's lives. It's a cliche but there's the criminal who finds Jesus in jail and tries to redeem himself to the society he's violated. You personally may not need religion, in your life, right now. But that's not true of everyone.

       One thing is learning, another is believing in ridiculous stories and myths. If you read a religious book without thinking "oh there are demons outta get me, and if I don't pray god will send me to hell where I'll suffer for all eternity" or "damn muslims must die" or even something like "bbbbut jesus might think abortion is wrong so everyone should not have the right to make a choice because
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       religion says so" then it's fine. But that's not the case for 99% of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, living your life based on a lie is worse and morally condemnable. Religions are the root of all evil, without religion there would be no conflict in the middle east, no Crusades, no laws fucking up our progress (stem cells, abortion, drugs) and no Dark Age.

       Stupid people are going to act stupid. There are stupid people that believe in religions hook line and sinker. There are stupid people that don't believe in religions. You'd get your point across if you'd be more tolerant and less condemning of these people's ignorance. Most people are trying the best with what they have. Some just don't have the intellectual tools to get the job done. If they were never taught how to live in modern, technological times why get so angry? It's like asking your dog to do your taxes then getting pissed he can't. These people are manipulable, yes. Ignorant of science, yes. But they're still people. You can reach them with your ideas if you actually want to teach instead of lecture.

       Right,..and what happend there? The Catholics came in, persecuted and martyerd Christians, burned them to death, brought in idols, and pegan rituals, and took over. The mixtures of Church and state which is no more then the devils way of control and infiltrating everything. Put blame where blame is due.

       Oh yes, it's the devils fault. god is loving and beautiful that he destroyed our civilizations countless times. But the devil, the one that rebeled against this fucker is the one to be blame. You know what? In all this garbage worthless mythology, ALMIGHT LUCIFER OUR LOVED AND ONE TRUE GOD is the only who who's worth fighting for. Fuck your god. Fuck your ignorance. Read a book that doesn't contain people being born of a virgin, talking donkeys or angels and gods and all that kind of bullshit. Crap, god is.

       No, those are the guide bars that mark the beginning, middle, and end of the barcode. They are not sixes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they were, you're ignoring all the other numbers in between. The most you could say was that barcodes all start with a six, have a six in the middle, and end with a six. That would mean you might have, say, 6868566320486. And that is not 666. But that's irrelevant, because, as I said,

       They are mutually exclusive. You just don't understand bar codes. The numbers in the bar codes are not made up of two elements as you seem to think (two thin bars), but four elements (two bars and two spaces, which can each be wide or thin).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sixes are made up as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       On the left-hand side of the middle guide bar: a thin space, a thin bar, a thin space, and a wide bar
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       (depending on parity) a wide space, a thin bar, a thin space, and a thin bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the right-hand side of the middle guide bar: a thin bar, a thin space, a thin bar, and a wide space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end guide bars are made up of three elements only, and they're the same on both halves of the code: a thin bar, a thin space, and a thin bar. The middle guide bar is four elements: a thin space, a thin bar, a thin space, and a thin bar.

       At first, your ignorance of barcodes was understandable. Now, however, you're just being stupid. The guide bars are not sixes and do not register as sixes. Your position amounts to looking at an eight and saying "if we ignore the top part of the eight, it's a six".
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they were sixes, you're not being true to your source material. Revelation doesn't say the number of the beast is any number with three sixes in it, it says it is 666. You're wilfully ignoring both Revelation and how bar codes work, and in the process demonstrating how all you care about here is perpetuating a fiction.

       This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.
They are talking Gematria. 6+6+6=18, 1+8=9. 9 is the Ego in satanism, the mark of the beast for Christians and the biggest reason things are the way they are when you look around. 9 adds nothing, when you add it to any number you get what you started with. 
Example 3+9=12, 1+2=3.

       That is a bunch of bullshit. There is no figurative translation, just random interpretation. By your logic this could be referring to things we can't fathom far in the future, just like people in the distant past interpreted these words as referring to events in their time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you REALLY read the Bible you would know it says essentially that no man knows when these things will happen, so there are no clues to decipher or trails to follow. We are not meant to know when, and that part is stated outright. The fact is that Revelations isn't even accepted by all religions as being part of the Bible in the first place.
