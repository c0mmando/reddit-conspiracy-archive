        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a question for all you theorist and people who like to think. Why is religion not taught at schools? If our history, timeline, and science is based off of a religion why wouldn’t you teach it? I understand that it’s partly a matter of not wanting to change tradition, but if it’s such a huge part of all of that why not teach it. Not only is science a big part of religion but our entire government system uses religion. So my question is do you think we should teach not so much religious points but the history behind it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got taught rise of hitler, great depression for both gcse and a level. It was crazy. There was only really two exams boards then so the choice wasn&#39;t huge. Certainly after year 9 there was basically zero history before 1900. Which, funnily enough, means that the crimes pre 1900 are not studied in the same detail as a US president building a lot of dams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should probably specify that in your post. </p>

<p>As far as religion is concerned, in most European countries that teach it, the people want rid of it. It&#39;s definitely the case here in Ireland.</p>

<p>Spirituality should be personal and individual to each family and not about chanting group prayers in a classroom.</p>

<p>However i would be in favour of teaching kids the history and philosophy of religion and spirituality.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you are talking about telling the story about all the major religions and the role they  played.  </p>

<p>One reason that was never allowed in U.S. Schools is because students were once forced to adhere to Christian only religious acts and practices at school, prayers and scripture reading were part of each school day.  </p>

<p>The Christians do not want any child told about any other religion.
Therefore our schools became religious free zones and that is better than the earlier requirement that they preach one religion at every student.</p>

<p>No, In the countries mentioned, I am talking about classes in actual religious doctrine. I was schooled in the system. 1 hour of Catholic BS twice a week and it was compulsory. Absolute madness.</p>

<p>I would personally prefer religion only be studied in the education system, as part of history or philosophy. Actual Practice of religion should be in a private setting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taxes. Depth of lessons.</p>

<p>What are we going to teach? Do we teach that religions exist? Do we teach the point of religions? Do we acknowledge the history of specific religions? The societal impacts? The books of the religions? The leaders?</p>

<p>Who&#39;s paying for this? Am I, a theoretical christian, going to be forced to pay so that my kid can learn about the jewish religion?</p>

<p>What about the political correctness involved? Will we remove certain facts to sanitize history? What will the state deem necessary knowledge that my child will be tested on, in regards to religion?</p>

<p>You throw a lot of assumptions into this question, so I&#39;m just throwing you simple questions to consider for this discussion.</p>

<p>What are the specific benefits of teaching religion in public schools?
What are the specific details you wish to teach in public schools regarding religion?
Mandatory or Elective?
What cannot be covered and can be covered?
What are the possible risks teaching religion in schools?
Who will pay for these new lessons?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Teaching different religions gives your child the chance to make what they believe in their decisions. If a parent pushes a certain religion on their children the children will start to rebel, I did. The schools should teach the history and just the basics of that religion. What’s so terrible about letting your child be able to learn and choose what they believe in? It’s all part of self discovery as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the government&#39;s call. If parents want their children to follow a doctrine, teaching other doctrines in the public school they are forced to go to goes against the parents wishes.</p>

<p>Your anecdotal experience does nothing for this argument, as your experience with the religion you rebelled against was heavily influenced on your exposure to it and your relation with your family.</p>

<p>What history? The good history? The bad history? The ancient history? The recent history? The basics? Which basics? Which branch, which translation?</p>

<p>For a devout religious person who believes their child is doomed if they don&#39;t follow their religion, why would I want these things available in school? Why would a government want these things available in school?</p>

<p>I understand that you want a world where kids are more exposed and have more options, and that&#39;s cool, but from my understanding, public school is about building necessary skills and gaining necessary knowledge for our society. Private schools and colleges give you specific skills and specific topics of exposure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I attended private school up until college. Roman catholic if you’re curious. 
One semester in our senior “religion” class was on World Religions. </p>

<p>Pretty eye opening experience if you’d ask me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can only speak for European schools. We have way too big mandatory curriculums as of yet. So religion is optional and would probably for me be rock bottom on the list of classes that should be mandatory. I&#39;d say stuff like computer science, statistics or debating (all of which aren&#39;t currently mandatory in my country) are actually needed skills in every day society and therefore way more important. </p>

<p>However I would much rather see things being removed from the curriculum. Lately I&#39;ve been reading alot of research on education and suddenly started to understand how right Rousseau was on the corruption of our youth. Schools are slowly becoming factories and children are drilled to become outstanding citizens. Honestly, I think it&#39;s fucked that we force children to learn for such long hours at such a young age.</p>

<p>I know you had a slightly different topic in mind, but I just really felt like ranting.</p>
