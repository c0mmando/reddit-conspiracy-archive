       Are microwaves bad for our health? If they are, is there a conspiracy to hide it from us? Seriously wondering, I've had a few friends and family get rid of their microwave and refuse to eat microwaved food. What do you believe?

       I knew someone in Seattle who didn’t own one. Made his concern known to me when he visited. He asked me to let him know if i was going to microwave something and he would actually go outside. I respected his wishes, but your post reminded me of this.

         In this review, we have found that microwave effects
were established at all biological levels, from microbial cells to animals as well as the human system.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The study revealed that microwave could athermally
induce different physiological effects.

        <p>
         The studies on the mechanism of microwave bio-in-

agents in inducing genetic changes in biosystem.

       Which kinda deems OP's point moot. Microwaving your food isn't harmful. But no shit exposure to microwaves directly will harm you, the same way overexposure to X-Rays will. Coincidentally had an argument about this literally today with my gf(she believes in a lot of wacko unscientific stuff).

       not true at all, different wavelengths have different energy levels.....meaning different effects. There's also ionizing vs nonionizing radiation.

       because that's not the point you made. You equivocated the two, when they would have very different effects ("There's also ionizing vs nonionizing radiation").
      </p>
      <p>
       But now you just say both are harmful...so which is it?

       I meant it in a layman's terms that overexposure to both of these that are used fairly frequently and most of us have come across can be harmful in case of overexposure. Why would I even bring up ionising and non-ionising radiation or the mechanism by which they do the harm in this thread? Anyways hope that clears things up.

       You know what else kills the nutrients? Over boiling and overheating. If the microwave heats it too much the nutrients will be destroyed just as much as they'd be if it was heated over a flame. Gosh how stupid are some people on this sub? It almost feels like you guys desperately want there to be a conspiracy that exists where there's none.

       Holy fuck did you ever take a science class? And how bad is your reading comprehension? Overheating can happen in normal flame heating too which is what I said you dumbass. You know what percentage of your body is carbon?  I won't tell you. Google it. You know carbon is a core element in pretty much ALL organic life? Carbon causes cancer...my fucking sides.

       The BLACK BURNT carbon bullshit in the burnt food is CARCINOGENIC.  I should've been more specific bc I didn't say "carbon is cancerous." I said burnt food is cancerous. The carbon I was speaking of specifically is black carbon (burnt toast &amp; graphite) is carcinogenic because it is a roughly flat molecule.Go do some research yourself.

       You literally said it creates carbon. It does not create carbon. Carbon is already present in food. And it can be burnt in a microwave as well as over a flame. What was your point again? Lol. You're literally proving nowhere that microwaves are harmful.

       Lol you should really read the links yourself sweetie. The first link doesn't provide any control group so the observations are insignificant as there is no other result to compare to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 2nd link in the intro section of the study-
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Every cooking method can destroy vitamins and other nutrients in food.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And the method used in the experiment is terrible. It involves heating food pellets (which we are given no information on the contents of) are heated at 320 degree Celsius. Microwaves heat up to an average of 100 degrees. So it's a demonstration of extreme burning of food in microwave. No shit there would be side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you expose food to direct hot flame do you think it's gonna stay healthy? Lol. Pathetic.

       I think all bets are off when the temperature approaches boiling point. At that point properties of heating via microwaves versus thermally are different.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to warm up food in microwave is fine in my opinion (you might have to run the oven at 50% duty or so to allow for thermal relaxation and to prevent 100C hot spots).
      </p>
      <p>
       To bake or cook in a microwave is just silly and asking for trouble. It is meant for warming up food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you can nuke a cup of water to boiling point, and keep heating it without it turning into steam. Then when you take the cup out and stir or perturb the boiling water, it can suddenly all turn into steam, giving you severe burns.

       Depends on your definition of microwaved food.  If you mean ready meals, then I agree.  But veg, fish, chicken, eggs, cakes etc can all be prepared from scratch, cooked in the microwave and be just as tasty.

       It's not a great study and it's 15 years old to boot.
       <br/>
       Or I guess it could be
       <em>
        big microwave
       </em>
       covering up a massive conspiracy to kill people prematurely...yeah, that makes sense

       Sometimes there is no contrived conspiracy there is just routinary  complacency and commerce.

       The study I showed the conclusions of is pretty straight forward and somewhat relevant to the general query of the OP.
The link is there for the curious.

       It is not a gavel slamming case closed nor did I make that claim.

       The cumulative effect of so many sources of low level radiations surrounding us all of our daily lives is not known.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't use those ovens because I enjoy enough casual low level radiation in my day and like to get the most nutrition from the food I eat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny story.
When the cable guy was installing my internet years ago he had a signal reader for wifi. It displayed all the neighbors incoming signals. I turned on my microwave the signal spiked madly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I then asked my neighbor to run her microwave and across the driveway through our walls he picked up the signal clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her microwave was reaching my couch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't want one anymore.

       The conclusions in the study you posted are straightforward sure, in that if you cook living things it is not good for that thing.
       <br/>
       In terms of relevance to OP's concerns...the only relevance is that it's a study about microwaves.
       <br/>
       As to getting nutrients from food - please explain how you think microwaving something destroys more nutrients?

       You know what, I give up. By all means watch out for those deadly microwaves if it makes you feel better.

       I will poat this as a reply to your comment as well. I have studied electromagnetism in depth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Radio waves, radiation and microwaves are lower frequency light waves, they are of the same thing. An electrimagnetic wave in which the electric field and magnetic field propogate perpendicular to each other. There is very little, if any, harm from  waves in the ~2.4Ghz spectrum, it is the same as some wifi routers. Additionally microwaves are heavily shielded and do not leak radiation much/at all. If your microwave ever interferes with your wifi throw it out, it is leaking radiation something is broken.

       Look I dont claim to know how electromagnetic waves effect the human body, this post is about microwave ovens though. I am simply stating they shield the absolute fuck out of the radiation from microwave ovens, if they didnt your 2.4Ghz wifi wouldnt work, so no conspiracy about fucking microwave ovens.

       Thermal radiation is already vibrating everything at about a billion times more intensely, so the "saturation" you are talking about is not even visible in comparison.

       The voting pattern is strange on this, big microwave? They are comfy. I haven't completely formed an opinion onw was or the other yet but leaning towards not pushing start. Personally I've cut way way way back on using then the last 5-10 years but then again I've gotten older and wiser.

       As an ee, do you realize the front of micowave ovens is shielded incredibly poorly? Every single microwave oven I've measured leaded profusely. Were you aware the federal limits on allowable leakage is strikingly high. They're allowed to let up 50 Watts pass through a square meter (2in near the screen)---though generally when there's food in it 10 Watt/m/m, which over extended period is still enough to get cataracts.

       I had heard this as well, but never been to Russia.  I used to think it was the beep at the end that emitted the radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Colloquially, I had a friend who did some work with an appliance repair man.  He explained how he saw a microwave work without the plastic cover over the front door.  Apparently, something like the frequency of the waves are too big to get through the mesh that the plastic covers on the door,,,or something like that.  I may be just spouting off, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does seem probable, though, that heating foods up really high could, depending on the food, release or create some nasty chemicals that, if one ate of enough of, could be bad for one's health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presently doesn't stop me from nuking bacon in there from time to time, though.

       It's not hard to abuse. Bring food close to boiling temperature and there can potentially be some harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they are shielded very poorly. You might get cataracts if you stand right in front of a microwave, or very near it for extended time.

       Yep, I won't use em. I did some research a while back and found an article in English that said microwaves were totally okay and another in Russian that said there were major health concerns. (This was years ago, but I'll post links if I find them.) And a Russian friend of mine says they were banned in Soviet times for health reasons. IIRC they essentially destroy most nutrition of the food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that many (most?) US restaurants use microwaves to warm their pre-prepared meals. One more reason to prepare your own.

       Consumer Reports stated no microwave you can buy screens all the escaping microwave radiation. They ALL LEAK. Here's how I checked mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a large parabolic stainless steel salad mixing bowl. Place a cup of water in your microwave. Turn it on. Now angle the salad bowl so it aims at the door like a satellite dish, toward the heating water. Angle the bowl up and down, left and right.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my case the reflected microwave radiation
       <em>
        destroyed the machine, it flat failed, died!
       </em>
       That's the radiation your brain is getting while you fiddle with the creamer standing in front of it.

       Microwaves are just molecule stimulators. The magnetrons emit electromagnetic frequencies that resonate with water making the molecules excited, as they bounce around they release heat.

       My family had a device that would allow us to wirelessly send a signal from the satellite tv receiver in our living room, to the tv in our kitchen. That way you could watch in the kitchen without having to buy a new receiver. But every time someone would turn on the microwave, the signal would be disrupted. And you would get static until the microwave went off. So the microwaves definitely emit something.

       Microwaved food is disgusting, that's why. I only use mine for defrosting bacon and cooking frozen vegetables for my kid, who is a picky eater and that is the only way we can get her to eat a vegetable now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally get where you are coming from though. I can't remember if it was a thought I naturally had or if it was based off of something I read, but many years ago when microwaving food was I believe way more common, I wondered if the people who ate a lot of microwaved food would get cancer at a higher rate.

       Oooh, here's another fun fact about microwaves I know... I heard that in the original gulf war, the Iraqi's used to bury microwaves in the sand out in the desert door up, and rig them to work with the door open, and during raids turn them on to attract bombs. Something about the radiation looking like a large target to the electronic equipment guiding the bombs. So in effect they would trade a $100 microwave for a million dollar bomb. Of course I have no way of knowing if that is true or not.

       Been wanting to do so experiments with microwaved water. Take two equal quantities of water. Microwave one to boiling and let cool and heat the other to boiling and let cool. Water plants with both. Or just microwave one and leave the other, and then water plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       In theory the water should be the same, but who knows the world is a mysterious thing. Do we really KNOW for sure the microwave doesn't do something to the water to make it deleterious? Easily testable someday.

       Look I dont claim to know how electromagnetic waves effect the human body, this post is about microwave ovens though. I am simply stating they shield the absolute fuck out of the radiation from microwave ovens, if they didnt your 2.4Ghz wifi wouldnt work, so no conspiracy about fucking microwave ovens.
