       I think first term Obama was popular, second wasn't. I think that fits the wiki timeline you linked. Was thinking presidents rather than terms. Trump wasn't popular vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly the popular vote is probably also rigged at federal anyway, especially at presidential level. Pointless to keep score.
      </p>
      <p>
       I brought it up simply to make the point, even the official record explicitly states our votes didn't cont for winning an election.

       I'm with you on that. But since we're essentially a gerrymandered republic people who live in bum fuck Egypt get more voice because somehow that's fair. Because it's not fair that big cities get to tell country folk what to do. I was under the impression that a person is a person and a vote would count for a vote. Trump likes to pretend like illegal votes gave Hillary the popular vote but that a load of shit. Everyone who lives in California, New York and Illinois knows those electoral votes are going to a Democrat. If it counted vote for vote he would've gotten slammed much harder.

       Not sure what you mean by our votes havenât officially counted many times? The only thing that comes to mind is absentee ballets which are only counted if theyâll make a difference
      </p>
      <p>
       IE: 150 people vote in person and 50 more people vote via absentee
      </p>
      <p>
       Candidate A receive 125 votes and candidate B receives 25 votes...
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if every absentee vote was for candidate B, it would still only bring him to 75 votes so the absentee ballets wouldnât be counted since they wouldnât change the outcome anyways......

       Point is government is picking who governs, instead of the people. That's not democracy. It's not even a representative republic. It's subtle tyranny.

       Different discussion. I'll oblige though.

       I think people will see the beginnings of ecological collapse, freak out, riot. Small chance people will cause enough civil unrest to change things and take controll before they are catastrophic.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all likelihood. States will kill tones of people, and allow many more to die. Then "the people" left, those who have always had power, will be "the people" left. And by default be "the people" in control of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will probably be some nomadic exiles, "terrorists," some how existing independent of government control. This will be the foundation of the resistance force.

       Okay but you do understand the point of the electoral college right? The United States is a ridiculously huge country to hold together and without the electoral college every election would basically be decided by a handful of metropolitan areas, and would disenfranchise a huge amount of the country..
      </p>
      <p>
       And a professor explained it really well to me, think of the World Series, to win the World Series you have to win 4 out of a possible 7 games..... a popular vote system would be like playing all 7 games and at the end it would be who ever scored the most runs total, where an electoral system is more like how the World Series work, it doesnât matter who scored the most runs it matters who won 4 games....
      </p>
      <p>
       Im coming off a night shift and pretty tired so I hope Iâm getting the idea across but honestly at the end of the day the electoral college is a necessary evil to ensure the entire country has a voice, and loser of the popular vote has only won the presidency 5 times in our nations history so I wouldnât say itâs a horribly flawed system

       But first. So baseball is effectively won by time, or runs at the right time, not runs. That makes no sense either. Who ever gets more runs is obviously the best team. Thanks prof. Thank god life isn't baseball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. You're concerned about people being left out. Yet want to have a handful "electors" to "represent" us. I'd take an entire cities bias over just 270 peoples'. An entire city can't be completely bought and corrupted. 270 "electors," yea that's easily doable. Plenty of people with 270 million lying around as basically spare change. "Electors" are disenfranchising a lot more people, promise. Don't give me the "their experts" nonsense either.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say only 5 times in history. 2 of those are very close together, and very recent, both with rampant allegations of some form of voter fraud. Resulting in presidency of arguably two of the worst nefarious, corrupt, and negligent presidents in US history.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a horribly flawed system. Tying to disguise total shenanigans with, "Oh, uh, well, It's really complicated. You probably couldn't understand. Trust us though. We're experts. We know what's best for every one."

       First, I'm not directing my post at you, this remark is for all of us to read and think about...
      </p>
      <p>
       Locally: That all depends on where one lives. If one travels around the US, that person can see were major projects were never finished and abandoned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Federally: Being a Federalist is tricky business and today's Federalist are made up of corporate-privateer factions. So they don't all play well together and from time to time work against each other. They play both the R's and D's, and throw money and municipalities to ensure their safety from protestors who question their corporate interest.

       After Bush was "elected" in 2000, it was discovered that there were many voting precincts that had more votes tallied for Bush than there were registered voters within the precinct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physically impossible, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't matter,  though.   Those hacked votes "counted", alright.  No consequences came from the obvious and provable rigging of the 2000 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Greatest Democracy Money Can Buy
       </strong>
       is a book by Greg Palast,  an investigative reporter that completely exposed the entire operation AND players of the rigged 2000 election. Highly recommended for those not aware of what occurred in 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the rigging being exposed and made "public knowledge", most people have no idea of what actually occurred. Despite being established fact and plain as day,  our leadership saw fit to NOT address the easily-hacked voting machine problem at all...
      </p>
      <p>
       Our votes don't count for shit.
