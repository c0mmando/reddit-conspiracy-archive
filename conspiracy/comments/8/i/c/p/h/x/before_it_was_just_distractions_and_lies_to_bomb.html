<p>If you&#39;re still working under the delusion that western world corporate oligarchs aren&#39;t trying to consolidate more power at the expense of anyone whether innocent or not, you would expect that.  If one understands that TPTB have never been interested in anything but world domination of the worst kind, then you&#39;d expect exactly what&#39;s going on, unfortunately.</p>
