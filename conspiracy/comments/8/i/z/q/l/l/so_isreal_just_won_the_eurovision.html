        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Eurovision has been an undeniable sham for a few years now. Ever since a large amount of Eastern european countries got added votes were given more as &quot;Hey were cool man&quot; points rather than as actual votes. But now we have Russia, Isreal and a lot of non EU countries in there too. Its starting to feel like a more politically charged event over a song competition. </p>

<p>And now this year Isreal comes First, Despite the msm reporting on some of the recent atrocities, and people being a little less blind to things. Their performance was also pretty poor,though that my fall on personal opinion.<br/>
So what do we think boys n girls? Has this been some sort of self promotion in public eye? Are they trying to bring people from the EU into isreal for something in 2019? Is there anything we can take away from this as a conspiracy community?</p>

<p>As a final note its worth noting that i don&#39;t care about Eurovision, and Ireland&#39;s song was pretty shite this year so no, not just being bitter. </p>

<p>You are clearly not a eurovision expert, lol (yes, I do feel a minimum of shame in saying that I am). The funny part of this statement is that in fact the opposite is true. If anything, eurovision has got depoliticized over the last few years (bar the year when Ukraine sent in a political song that somehow got accepted and won both jury and fan vote). Where Russia used to give Ukraine 12 points, Greece and Cyprus gave eachother 12 points, the Netherlands and Belgium gave each other 12 points and vice versa, now it has gotten more unpredictable.</p>

<p>First you claim eurovision is political, and now you are mad that people didn&#39;t take any atrocities performed by the country of Israel into account, which has nothing to do with the cute girl that won with a pretty catchy song. Do you want it to be political or not?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there anything we can take away from this as a conspiracy community?</p>

<p>That there is a special conspiracy that makes evil Israelians really good at writing catchy popsongs?</p>

<p>With all due respect, Ireland was shite. Not as shite as in recent years, but still shite. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d call you bitter, but you sure don&#39;t have a very good understanding of Eurovision politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair a part of this is seeing how far some of the more extreme in the community go. Note my wording when asking for opinions for that. </p>

<p>There is absolutely some shame in that, but if you&#39;re willing to put that brand on yourself im more inclined to believe you to be fair.  My following has been pretty loose but maybe i misidentified the issue. </p>

<p>There were definitely better acts, while im not saying it was totally politically based its certainly not who i thought would win based on performance.

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand that I watch eurovision for literally everything but the songs. If you like music, don&#39;t watch eurovision. Most of the time it&#39;s literal ear abuse. I love the politics involved, I love the celebration of the gay scene and general inclusiveness around it. I enjoy seeing how terrible some acts are. I engage in a very cruel form of schadenfreude, to me eurovision is simply amazing. </p>

<p>In recent years I have seen better songs win (Conchita Wurst and mostly last years winner, Salvador Sobral comes to mind), however I have also seen some abysmal songs win or come close to winning. (May i kindly remind you that this song was the closest Ireland had come to winning in recent years <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgrlG6hQbNM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgrlG6hQbNM</a>) </p>

</blockquote>

<p>My friend, I don&#39;t disagree with you, if it were up to me Italy would have probably won the last 5 editions bar last year, but the people who vote want a certain type of catchy popsongs or melodramatic ballads. It also helps if you have a nice background story. Also even though we might agree, taste is not an absolute thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to completely misunderstand my position on the matter. Apparently you believe that I am naïve? There is a reason why Russia was still allowed to participate after they brutally invaded territory of another participating country. There is a reason why Israel is allowed to participate regardless of the Palestine question and the reason is quite simple. Politics are forbidden at the eurovision and the boss of the nations are the broadcasters and not the respective governments. I am willing to entertain a lot of conspiracies surrounding Israel but this is where I draw the line. Anyone who knows as much about eurovision as I do, knew that there realistically were three songs this year that had a chance (Cyprus, Israel and Norway). Sweden and Austria overperformed, Norway underperformed, Israel and Cyprus performed excactly as every expert and therefore also the bookmakers had predicted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eurovision is rubbish. It was probably legit at the start. Today, it&#39;s corrupt. It&#39;s meant to push an ideology forward. Last year&#39;s winner was a trans bearded woman, this year is an israeli. I bet you next year will be an illegal black and/or muslim migrant who got one european country&#39;s citizenship. The MSM will then echo that propaganda that these migrants are a blessing for Europe, that they are hard workers, that we should be thankful for having them, and that we will never get enough of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Monday 14th May (barely 24 hours after the results of this contest) marks the 70th anniversary of Israel&#39;s creation. </p>

<p>Coupled with the fact that Israel is currently engaged in conflict with Iran via Syria, it&#39;s not surprising that the Eurovision juries overturned the popular vote and proclaimed Israel the winner instead. </p>

<p>Not the first time the supposedly apolitical Song Contest has been rigged for very political reasons, and it won&#39;t be the last.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it has nothing to do with the European Union. Eurovision has been held since 1951, the EBU has existed since 1950.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Rome, which laid the foundations of the European Economic Community with its initial 6 member states wasn&#39;t signed until 1957.</p>

<p>The EU as known by its modern name was founded in 1993 with the Maastricht treaty.</p>
