    <div class="md"><p>He wouldn&#39;t know. He&#39;s not a 33rd degree, and anyone who is wouldn&#39;t admit to it if you actually think about it. Also you should know there are rites with more than 33rd degrees, though not officially recognized by conventional Masonry, the Egyptian Rite for example, and other orders who are more steeped in the occult. Freemasonry, craft / symbolic / speculative and even philosophical Masonry (e.g. the upper degrees of the Scottish Rite) is pretty light-weight in comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Borrowing from a friend: </p>

<p>The world is an awful place, and there’s not much that we can do about that on the macro scale. What we can do, however, is give men the opportunity to change and improve themselves using moral tools and teachings centered around love of God and love of one another in order to better implement the moral values they already had. By doing this, a man not only changes himself, but the world immediately around him - and sometimes reaching even further than that. So, we can’t change the world on a macro scale, but we can change it many, many times on a micro scale. Masonry is an organized effort to save the world through love, one man at a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. So I take it Freemasonry has had a generally positive impact on your life thus far. What degree are you currently?</p>

<p>Also feel free to do another AMA in <a href="/r/OccultConspiracy">/r/OccultConspiracy</a>, a subreddit I currently moderate. It&#39;s an all-inclusive sub welcoming all points of view, whether supportive or in opposition to the occult, from research into esotericism and secret societies to speculation about the impact of the two on our civilization. A number of our subscribers are conspiracy theorists, as well as practicing occultists, Masons and members of other orders, as well as those who are openly critical of each. All are welcome to share their perspective so long as the conversation remains civil and free of personal or ad hominem attacks. I welcome you and anyone here to join the conversation and share your views as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest though, I&#39;m not in a position to actually conduct an AMA on the subject.  I  know my stuff, but if I were to go down that route, I&#39;d have to consult Grand Lodge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone&#39;s entitled to their opinions, and you&#39;re bound to find those who are going to be more critical. That&#39;s to be expected, though you might be surprised how many are generally supportive, or more objective like myself. If someone says something out of bounds, you can&#39;t really take it personally. It&#39;s the Internet after all, so there&#39;s that, and you can&#39;t really help the fact some people are going to be misinformed or prone to jumping to conclusions.

    <div class="md"><p>Lucifer is the god of freemasonry. Most low level masons are fooled to believe he is a benevolent deity. While that is partially true since It&#39;s not quite the same thing as the Lucifer from Christianity, what the high level masons worship is indeed an evil deity.</p>

<p>Read what Albert Pike had to say about the low level freemasons and Lucifer.</p>

<p>The Apocalypse is, to those who receive the nineteenth Degree, the Apothesis of that Sublime Faith which aspires to God alone, and despises all the pomps and works of Lucifer. LUCIFER, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, for traditions are full of sensual or selfish Souls ? Doubt it not!  Divine Revelations and Inspirations: and Inspiration is not of one Age nor of one Creed. Plato and Philo, also, were inspired.  The Apocalypse, indeed, is a book as obscure as the Sohar.  It is written hieroglyphically with numbers and images; and the Apostle often appeals to the intelligence of the Initiated.  “Let him who hath knowledge, understand! let him who understands, calculate!” he often says, after an allegory or the mention  of a number. Saint John, the favorite Apostle, and the Depositary  of all the Secrets of the Saviour, therefore did not write to be understood by the multitude.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what Pike <em>actually</em> wrote. You can cherry-pick your quotes to suit your personal narrative, but it&#39;s disingenuous.</p>

<p>Pike is stating that a Mason must follow God, <em>not</em> Lucifer. He says that Lucifer having the name of &quot;Lucifer&quot; is misleading, because he&#39;s no light-bearer; he&#39;s the opposite. Pike goes on to say that Lucifer blinds men to the Truth.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t actually know what you&#39;re talking about, and if you can&#39;t be bothered to read up on the subject and inform yourself, you probably shouldn&#39;t offer advice on the matter. What you&#39;re doing is intellectually lazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To elaborate on the subject of Lucifer, objectively: 
that of the current you adhere to, that of your initiatory order (if applicable) and personal religious or occult beliefs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to conclude the they (Lucifer and Satan) are two sides of same coin, a dualistic godform, Lucifer/Sophia/Baphomet representing benevolent elements of knowledge and Enlightenment, Satan/Shaitan/Set/Typhon being components of malevolent darkness and retribution. </p>

<p>More on Lucifer:</p>

<p>From Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa&#39;s &#39;<a href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agripp2d.htm">Three Books of Occult Philosophy&#39; (Book II)</a> 
&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sun is called Phæbus, Diespiter [Dispater], Apollo, Titan, Pean [Paian], Phanes, Horus, Osiris, as it is in that Oracle,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sun, Osyris [Osiris], Dionysus gay,</p>

<p>Apollo, Horus, King ruling the day</p>

<p>Who changeth times, who giveth winds and rain,</p>

<p>The King of Stars, and the immortall flame. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is called also Arcitenens, burning fiery, golden flaming, radiating, of a fiery hair, of a golden hair, the eye of the world, Lucifer, seeing all things, ruling all things, the creator of light, the King of Stars, the great Lord, good, fortunate, honest, pure, prudent, intelligent, wise, shining over the whole world, governing, and vivifying all bodies that have a soul, the prince of the world keeping all the Stars under himself, the light of all the Stars, darkening, burning, overcoming their vertue by his approach, yet by his light and splendor giving light and splendor to all things: in the night he is called Dionysius, but in the day Apollo, as if driving away evill things. Therefore the Athenians called him Alexicacon, and Homer Vlion, i.e. the driver away of evil things. He is also called Phæbus from his beauty and brightness, and Vulcan from his fiery violence, because the force thereof consists of many fires. He is also called the Sun, because he contains the light of all the Stars: hence he is called by the Assyrians êàãà Adad, which signifies only, and by the Hebrews ùîù Schemesch, which signifies proper. </p>

<p>From Albert Pike&#39;s &#39;<a href="https://www.resist.com/Onlinebooks/Pike-MoralsAndDogma.pdf">Morals and Dogma&#39;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh reversed; for Satan is not a black god, but the negation of God. The Devil is the personification of Atheism or Idolatry.</p>

<p>For the Initiates, this is not a Person, but a Force, created for good, but which may serve for evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or Free Will.</p>

<p>They represent this Force, which presides over the physical generation, [i.e., sex] under the mythologic and horned form of the God PAN; thence came the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the Light-bearer or Phosphor, of which the poets have made the false Lucifer of the legend.</p>

<p>Gold, to the eyes of the Initiates, is Light condensed.</p>

<p>From Kenneth Grant&#39;s &#39;<a href="http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/magick_revival.pdf">Magical Revival</a>&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Crowley, speaking for The Beast 666, declares that &quot;Aiwaz solar-phallic-hermetic Lucifer - is His (i.e. the Beast&#39;s) own Holy Guardian Angel, and The Devil, Satan, or Hadit, of our particular unit of the Starry Universe. This serpent, Satan, is not the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil; He bade Know Thyself and taught Initiation. He is The Devil of the Book of Thoth, and his emblem is Baphomet, the Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane perfection. The number of his Atu (Key) is XV, which is Yod He, 3 the Monogram of the Eternal, the Father one which the Mother, the Virgin Seed one with all-containing Space. He is therefore Life, and Love. But moreoever his letter is Ayin, the Eye; he is Light, and his Zodiacal image is Capricornus, that leaping goat whose attribute is Liberty.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Crowley&#39;s &#39;<a href="https://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/aba3">Magick: Liber ABA (Book 4) (Magick in Theory and Practice)</a>&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers to 
imply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unity would 
be a God. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Devil&quot; is, historically, the God of any people that one personally 
dislikes. This has led to so much confusion of thought that THE BEAST 666 has 
preferred to let names stand as they are, and to proclaim simply that AIWAZ ót the 
solar-phallic-hermetic &quot;Lucifer&quot; is His own Holy Guardian Angel, and &quot;The Devil&quot; 
SATAN or HADIT of our particular unit of the Starry Universe. This serpent, 
SATAN, is not the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing 
Good and Evil; He bade &quot;Know Thyself!&quot; and taught Initiation. He is &quot;the Devil&quot; of 
the Book of Thoth, and His emblem is BAPHOMET, the Androgyne who is the 
hieroglyph of arcane perfection. The number of His Atu is XV, which is Yod He, the 
Monogram of the Eternal, the Father one with the Mother, the Virgin Seed one with 
all-containing Space. He is therefore Life, and Love. But moreover his letter is 
Ayin, the Eye; he is Light, and his Zodiacal image is Capricornus, that leaping goat 
whose attribute is Liberty. (Note that the &quot;Jehovah&quot; of the Hebrews is 
etymologically connected with these. The classical example of such antinomy, one 
which has led to such disastrous misunderstandings, is that between NU and HAD, 
North and South, Jesus and John. The subject is too abstruse and complicated to 
be discussed in detail here. The student should consult the writings of Sir R. Payne 
Knight, General Forlong, Gerald Massey, Fabre d&#39;Olivet; etc. etc., for the data on 
which these considerations are ultimately based.). </p>

<p>From Rudolph Steiner&#39;s <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/58360220/Phosphorus-The-Shadowing-Forth-of-Lucifer">&#39;Luzifer-Gnosis</a>&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The significant symbol of wisdom given to us by research is Lucifer, the bringer of light. Everybody is searching for perception, wisdom is a child of Lucifer. The Chaldean astrologers, the Egyptian priests, the Indian Brahmans; they are all children of Lucifer. Already the first man became a child of Lucifer when the serpent taught him good and evil. What they got to know by perception was the sacred cosmic mystery. In front of it they kneeled in devotion. It was the light that showed their souls to their destiny. In devotion they received wisdom which became faith, religion. What Lucifer had brought to them, shined godlike in front of their psychic eyes. Owing to Lucifer they had God. It means to disunite heart and mind if God is considered as Lucifer&#39;s enemy. Our educated don&#39;t raise the perception of the mind to religious devotion, they paralyze the enthusiasm of the heart.</p>

<p>For those who are searching for the light of the spirit Lucifer shall be a messenger. He won&#39;t talk about a faith that is alien to perception. He won&#39;t flatter into the hearts to avoid the guardian of science: he shall respect him. He won&#39;t preach piety and divine bliss but will show ways for the knowledge to change into divine sensation, into the devotion of the cosmic spirit. Lucifer knows that the radiant sun may only rise in the heart of the individual; but he also knows that only the paths of perception lead up to the mountain where the sun appears in his divine radiation. Lucifer is no devil leading the searching Faust to hell; he shall be an awaker of those who believe in knowledge who want to change into the gold of divine wisdom.</p>
