        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If Stephen Paddock was a millionaire and had spent time in several different hotel rooms scouting different venues to massacre, then why would he settle for a shitty bump stock? A man with access to money and the kind of weapons he brought with him could have surely coughed up the $200 ATF license fee for a minigun, rocket launcher, .50 Cal, or really any array of better massacre machines than a relatively puny AR that was not even a true full auto.</p>

<p>Bringing those kinds of concealable, below-the-radar types of guns to a rampage knowing that he would die at the scene makes no sense. Bringing those guns to a clandestine arms deal would make perfect sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a lot of news stories that he had traveled the region booking rooms near other venues before Mandalay Bay. These other rooms were reported to be at a closer vantage point (again, why a .223 from such a great distance?) and with larger crowds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, that was a good article.</p>

<p>The reason I asked is because if we have undeniable proof that he booked multiple other rooms overlooking large outdoor concerts, then I think that makes it much less likely that this was an arms deal gone wrong. It makes me think that there was a premeditated plan to shoot at concertgoers from a skyscraper window. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree. That detail threw me for a loop when I had heard about it. Of course, there is always the possibility that is by design. No idea how true that story is. It is the ‚Äúnews‚Äù after all.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm the arms deal scenario it would be a convenient cover story for why he was checking in. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm in town for the concert. I‚Äôm with XYZ band or media outlet and all of these heavy bags are some of the equipment for the show.‚Äù</p>

<p>I also figure that if ISIS had planned the patsy scheme, they could very well be the ones choosing the hotels with the vulnerable targets nearby, not Paddock. Something like Lollapalooza is way bigger than the country festival, so if Paddock was going for body count, then Route 89 would be small potatoes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is something I questioned as well. </p>

<p>I own an AR. It fires a .223 with ~22 grains of powder. </p>

<p>IMO the reason why the weapon is so popular is simply because it&#39;s cheap. Not because it&#39;s effective. </p>

<p>If you have no resources and want to do something like this then an AR or similar will most likely be <em>all</em> you can get, not that you seek it out, rather it&#39;s the easiest and cheapest weapon to obtain. And the rounds are very accessible and cheap as well. </p>

<p>If you had time and money, why not get a 50 cal? Or like OP said the ATF license for a fully automatic? Or even build a bomb? Shit, why not get into the 30 range? </p>

<p>There is a reason why there were over 600 injured and only 59 killed in Las Vegas. Because he used a fucking .22 rifle to shoot people. At best a .22 would be good for a rabbit, squirrel or other &quot;varmint&quot; type animal. But not good for larger game. </p>

<p>The whole thing is very odd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Granted, the .223 intermediate grade bullet has a lot of strong points. It flies flat, makes a serious wound, and there‚Äôs mountains of it available everywhere. </p>

<p>Most of the other advantages come up if you are in a combat field of operations, such as being lightweight and low recoil. None of those characteristics are necessary for a bipod stabilized high vantage slaughter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no proof anyone was even shot, only reports which no one should believe.  No bullets were recovered from the target zone.  No visual evidence of bullet impacts.</p>

<p>The corpse in the room probably wasn&#39;t even Paddock but a cadaver from the morgue.  It&#39;s a staged hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there was that most likely fake MSM footage from the next day of the &#39;Wolverine&#39; trailer park dude walking unaided out the hospital with two rifle bullets lodged in in lower sine.</p>

<p>the MSM bimbo was a frumpy dark haired creature, very unlike the typical MSM blond elfish female anchor, more like some TLA dudette.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree. That detail threw me for a loop when I had heard about it. Of course, there is always the possibility that is by design. No idea how true that story is. It is the ‚Äúnews‚Äù after all.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm the arms deal scenario it would be a convenient cover story for why he was checking in. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm in town for the concert. I‚Äôm with XYZ band or media outlet and all of these heavy bags are some of the equipment for the show.‚Äù</p>

<p>I also figure that if ISIS had planned the patsy scheme, they could very well be the ones choosing the hotels with the vulnerable targets nearby, not Paddock. Something like Lollapalooza is way bigger than the country festival, so if Paddock was going for body count, then Route 89 would be small potatoes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Irregardless of all the main talking points. You&#39;ve gotta give him a bit of respect for selecting a country music festival. In fact, who could blame him after having that shit blasted across the road at 120db for hours on end. He had the patience of a saint to hold out till as late in the evening as he did.</p>
