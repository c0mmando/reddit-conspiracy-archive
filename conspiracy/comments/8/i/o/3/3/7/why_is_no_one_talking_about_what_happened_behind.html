    <div class="md"><p>Physics. When a projectile moves through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, you hear it because of the sonic boom, and see it because the air it passes through gets so hot from compression that it turns the air into plasma. This guy <a href="http://amp.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/01/16/shooting_star_trail_meteor_leaves_a_bright_trail_behind_it.html">explains it best</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”As a meteoroid (the actual solid chunk of material) blasts through the atmosphere, it violently compresses the air, heating it up hugely (note this isn’t due to friction, but compression; like when a bicycle pump heats up after as you use it). The heat is so intense it ionizes the gases, stripping electrons from their parent atoms. As the electrons slowly recombine with the atoms, they emit light—this is how neon signs glow, as well as giant star-forming nebulae in space.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Within this past year we have described Kim as having a bully mindset – a lust for power, feeling unstoppable. Our list of expected next steps did not include a peaceful reunification of Korea, but rather included draconian steps such as an assassination of Kim or military invasion of N Korea by either the US or Russia or China. The alternative was an endless spitting contest, with Kim continuing to grind down the citizens of N Korea – a long reign by an intractable dictator. What happened to afford this dramatic change? </p>

<p>Around the time of the Winter Olympics, when Kim’s sister represented N Korea and discussions with S Korea’s Moon occurred, there was a change in Kim’s war like stance. It was known that Kim’s nuclear testing ground – Mantap Mountain – was already destabilized but this did not preclude Kim from testing his nukes elsewhere or drilling tunnels into other parts of the mountain. This was not the trigger changing Kim’s personality. Nor was it the increased sanctions or Trump’s stance, as dictators do not give up their power that easily. </p>

<p>Highly Service-to-Self souls, given to being dictators who seek complete control and who have complete distain for the safety and wellbeing of others, do not tolerate loss.  We have mentioned that Xi of China is not being given the credit he deserves for stepping into the N Korea mess. He went beyond sanctions and told Kim flat out that China would invade and remove him from power unless his antics and nuclear proliferation stopped. In a war with China, Kim would lose. Faced with the humiliation of a loss on so many fronts, the soul incarnated within Kim took flight, leaving an empty body. A walk-in occurred. </p>

<p>Walk-ins can achieve dramatic change, such as occurred en masse during the Arab Spring, was predicted by Ruth Montgomery to occur during one of the US Presidencies, and did occur within Obama for much of his career, the soul of Lincoln being resident. Walk-ins can be temporary if the original soul dithers and wants to come back, but in Kim’s case the Council of Worlds arranged for Kim’s soul to instantly start a new incarnation elsewhere, so he cannot return. The walk-in soul is very old and wise, carefully selected for such a momentous mission. The future bodes well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things. One, SK&#39;s first dictator daughter has been impeached for being in a shamanist cult.</p>

<p>Second, Moon, her remplacement, is a very socialist guy that always had the dream of bringing back both Korea&#39;s. He did lots of charity stuff, all around nice guy. </p>

<p>The Korea problem is much less complex than it looks like from the outside for Koreans. But what always added another layer of issues was the US insistence in staying in the region.</p>

<p>This is what I don&#39;t know, why it worked with trump. Why Kim agreed to leave US troops in SK? How bad is it over there or did trump do something good? That&#39;s where the real question is. Reunification was always possible. Reunification with the US staying is quite different. It&#39;s basically the entire reason why we have two Korea&#39;s since the 50s</p>
