        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some of you are aware of recent developments consisting of Stormy Daniel&#39;s alleged involvement in Keith Raniere&#39;s &quot;sex cult.&quot; If not, long story short is that Stormy has a tattoo on her hip obscuring a scar that, when overlayed with the sex cult brand, is nearly a direct match to Keith Raniere&#39;s signature branding. At first she denied the scar&#39;s existence, saying the allegations were photoshopped. Then she backtracked and admitted that it is a real scar and indicated that the tattoo was supposed to obscure the &quot;scar.&quot;</p>

<p>Whether or not the brand is actually there is less important. What IS imporant is understanding how Keith Raniere&#39;s human trafficking network operated and comparing it to Stormy Daniels&#39;s comportment.</p>

<p>Raniere was by no means as &quot;ethical&quot; or &quot;genius&quot; or &quot;superior&quot; as his followers painted him to be. Nonetheless, he was able to rake in millions of dollars in &quot;investments&quot; into his &quot;schools.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://frankreport.com/2018/04/16/rainbow-cultural-garden-needs-to-be-shut-down-now-before-more-children-are-harmed/">https://frankreport.com/2018/04/16/rainbow-cultural-garden-needs-to-be-shut-down-now-before-more-children-are-harmed/</a></p>

<p>Such is the case at this Miami &quot;school&quot; wherein Raniere&#39;s followers blindly accepted his philosophy and paid $120,000 a year to teach babies multiple languages simultaneously. That is whats called a &quot;cover.&quot; What looks like payment for schooling is really payment for Keith Raniere&#39;s compromise operations. Raniere only speaks 1 language anyway and isnt qualified to run a daycare nor teach.</p>

<p>By running a number of &quot;schools&quot; and &quot;teaching courses&quot; wherein he indoctrinates susceptible minds, he can raise illegaly trafficked kids to be WEAPONS. (Some say the Parkland kids were a similar occurrence but that&#39;s another story; also in Miami.) Raniere can teach young girls how to set up low-light cameras and seduce older men, thereby compromising them. Think Harvey Weinstein, another frequenter of Miami and Hollywood debauchery.</p>

<p>Now, the supposed journalist who broke the NXIVM ring is unequivocally convinced that all of NXIVM&#39;s members have been identified on the grounds that &quot;the membership wasn&#39;t secret&quot; and therefore &quot;stormy daniels is not a NXIVM member.&quot; Honestly this is the poorest logical defense i&#39;ve seen from a &quot;journalist&quot; who appears to have been VERY involved in Keith&#39;s inner circle. I smell a cover up. Have a read:</p>

<p><a href="https://artvoice.com/2018/05/09/stormy-daniels-is-not-branded-by-nxivm-sex-slave-cult/">https://artvoice.com/2018/05/09/stormy-daniels-is-not-branded-by-nxivm-sex-slave-cult/</a></p>

<p>This article is painfully equivocative. Keith Raniere was not running a &quot;sex cult&quot; per se. It was a cult insofar as its lead by a centralized authority figure and they do weird things, but it is in actual fact a COMPROMISE NETWORK. Investors pay $120,000 dollars to get a job done, ie compromise someone with underage filmed sex.</p>

<p>&quot;Where does STDaniels fit into this?&quot;</p>

<p>Stormy Daniels represents a paradigmatic compromise asset. Shes got gr8 tits, is somewhat competent, and films herself having sex for a living. She could entrap any man she wants. IF she were to be involved in NXIVM&#39;s operations, she wouldnt need to take courses. She already knows the ropes.</p>

<p>Another thing she&#39;s familiar with is &quot;pizza.&quot; Many of you remember John Podesta&#39;s emails about &quot;pizza&quot; and &quot;hotdogs&quot; and &quot;walnut sauce&quot; etc. I&#39;ll link you to a similar occurence.</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/images/qbL6cK">https://goo.gl/images/qbL6cK</a></p>

<p>&quot;Rainbow pizza&quot; that she&#39;s &quot;allowed&quot; to have, but other people are not. &quot;Pizza&quot; is a code word for underage children in the human trafficing underworld. So let&#39;s re-interpret &quot;rainbow pizza&quot; as instead &quot;rainbow children.&quot;</p>

<p>Who has rainbow children? Convicted sex trafficker and pedophile Keith Raniere does, at his Rainbow Cultural Gardens &quot;school&quot; in Miami.</p>

<p>She also tweeted in 2010 something to the effect of &quot;I think i&#39;m about to be initiated into a gang.. or maybe it&#39;s a cult.&quot;</p>

<p>Its appearing more likely that Stormy Daniels is a compromise operative of some sort. Which is PRECISELY why her lawyer&#39;s method of obtaining Trump&#39;s bank info is being probed. Almost any high-importance operative has a very specific lawyer who is part of their intelligence operations. Attorney-client privelege goes a long way in legal defense. Not only that, but attorneys can use the cover of &quot;the law&quot; to uncover and disclose information about a target, such is the case with her lawyer&#39;s leaking of Trump&#39;s bank records.</p>

<p>So in short, Stormy Daniels has a scar that resembles the NXIVM brand that is obscured by her tattoo purposely. Additionally, she likes (and is &quot;allowed&quot; to have) &quot;rainbow pizza&quot; and was initiated into a &quot;cult.&quot; Stormy Daniels is also the perfect compromise asset since she films herself having sex with men for a living. Under the cover of being a pornstar (or &quot;model,&quot; as she puts it) she can compromise men like Donald Trump and then report back to her lawyer or NXIVM or whoever. Which is exactly what she did. And is why Trump paid hush money.</p>

<p>As the days go by, it&#39;s becoming more and more apparent that STDaniels is a compromise asset seeing as Trump is just that: compromised. There has to be a good reason why the media is painting this pornstar out to be an angel that was supposedly predated upon by Trump.</p>

<p>Whether or not STDaniels is part of NXIVM is almost irrelevant. What is relevant is her apparent ability to compromise wealthy men, which is what NXIVM and Weinstein were doing.</p>

<p>Those Miami boys play dirty. Watch out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh i guess the &quot;im joining a cult&quot; tweet doesnt support the discussion of her potentially being in a cult. Or the fact that she likes &quot;rainbow pizza&quot; (rainbow children) that other people aren&#39;t allowed to have does</p>

<p>In case you havent noticed, very rarely will you find what YOU are looking for: direct evidence of &quot;x&quot; conspiracy.</p>

<p>This is a discussion of circumstantial evidence concering Stormy Daniels and her compromise operations. If that isnt clear to you then oh well.</p>

<p>Too often people like you come here looking for the answer that will solve all their questions. You dont critically think, you want someone else to do it for you.  People like me give you the tools to come to a conclusion of critical thought rather than just giving you one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are mistaken
Cheese Pizza is a term in and of itself
Its not reducible to two separate things
Cheese Pizza, or CP is child pornhography. You are correct on that front.
&quot;Pepperoni pizza&quot; or &quot;sausage pizza&quot; are up to your discretion</p>

<p>Pizza IS in fact used as a code word. Theres plenty of info available online to that effect. The wikileaks email detailing $60,000 in &quot;pizza and hotdogs&quot; being flown to chicago, home of mossad man Rahm Emmanuel, is one such case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently posted about Rainbow Cultural Garden and absolutely agree there is likely more going on there. My point was that the Stormy Daniels &quot;connection&quot; seems to be taking over the discussion of the otherwise verifiable allegations surrounding NXIVM and their various charity works. I&#39;m not above discussing her connection, but there isn&#39;t anything here that shows even an ancillary connection to NXIVM in particular. </p>

<p>100% agreed that Rainbow Cultural Garden is suspicious however. I just think the Stormy angle reads more like disinformation to muddy the waters, though I recognize the potential that I&#39;m incorrect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, i think the scar and NXIVM could be disinformation. That&#39;s why i said its not entirely relevant. But its worth discussing nonetheless because what it implies is that she could be a compromise operative.</p>

<p>Im approaching the stormy daniels angle from the perspective that her goal was to compromise trump and she therefore COULD be connected to a group that uses sex for compromise, like NXIVM.</p>

<p>It might be the case that shes JUST a pornstar and weasled $130,000 out of Trump. But she&#39;s a pornstar, she&#39;d make enemies if she did that to everyone.</p>

<p>I think that when she made the cult tweet in 2010, she had been approached by SOME group who can make use of someone who films themselves having sex
Like NXIVM or Jeff Epstein</p>

<p>And she ordered &quot;pizza&quot; with trump in the hotel where he was compromised. Could pizza be code for children? I don&#39;t know. BUT apprently Stormy&#39;s particular brand of &quot;rainbow pizza&quot; is one that people arent &quot;allowed&quot; to have. And people arent allowed to have children.
Its very loosely connected and hardly even circumstantial but its straight from the horse&#39;s mouth</p>

<p>I appreciate your openness and willingess to discuss. Its hard to come by. Maybe this would do better on the chans</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of accusations based on a scar. </p>

<p>Yet no real connections so far. Also if she is apart of a sex cult and Trump rawdogs her we got to wonder if Trump knows more about the cult or is involved in some way. </p>

<p>They film it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you can&#39;t read, right?
I said it&#39;s not a cult, its a compromise network. SHE said she&#39;s being initiated into a cult, or gang.</p>

<p>Which is exactly how one would describe a sex compromise network</p>

<p>Raniere was by no means as &quot;ethical&quot; or &quot;genius&quot; or &quot;superior&quot; as his followers painted him to be. Nonetheless, he was able to rake in millions of dollars in &quot;investments&quot; into his &quot;schools.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Raniere is a freelancer who started up a type of sex cult/mind control organization on his own. The real big fish with truly elite level connections are still behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Nexium has to go down because they aren&#39;t part of &quot;the big club&quot; and also because they operated too openly and drew too much attention to themselves.</p>

<p>This whole Stormy Daniels thing is just a sideshow and a convenient distraction. The media is eating it up because the story is good for ratings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats another problem and requires an entirely separate discussion. Trump appears to be involved, Miami is his stomping ground.</p>

<p>He has said before that he shares in interest in &quot;younger women&quot; with jeffrey epstein</p>

<p>And stormy daniels in an interview indicated that she and Trump ordered &quot;tiny pizza,&quot; ie tiny children</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed the point. This isnt a defense of trump. Not everything is as binary as you think.</p>

<p>You commented on a post a few days ago about Trump being compromised by Israel</p>

<p>What do you think jeff epstein, harvey weinstein, and keith raniere do when their clients have sex with underage children?</p>

<p>They film it</p>

<p>And guess whos on film?</p>

<p>the same guy who ordered &quot;tiny pizzas&quot; (tiny children) in a hotel room with stormy daniels who also likes &quot;pizza&quot; </p>
