        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Do you guys ever think that the reasons Jews (mostly European decent) are over represented in academia and industry is because of their high IQ. On average Ashkenazi Jews have an IQ of 110-120. Wouldn&#39;t it be more logical to assume that people born with a IQ in the top 15% would naturally take occupations that require high IQ? Rather then some collective Jewish conspiracy. The Ashkenazi are mostly secular and do not practice Judaism and often convert to a church of their marriage and more then 55-70% marry non Jews. In reality your IQ limits you to what job one can take, which is something teachers and parents don&#39;t like to say. Most European have an IQ of 97-102, latinos (those of Spanish and Native American blood) 85-90, African Americans 80-85. To take up a job such as doctors, lawyers, engineer require on average those with a IQ of 108-110.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. But a new thesis on genetics point out that 55-65% of one IQ comes from genes. Other Jewish groups around the world have the same IQ as their host country. Ashkenazi have always been persecuted and forced by the church to do banking , because lending with interest was illegal or Christians. So some theories that skills to learn how to adapt to persecution and a tradition of dong high IQ jobs for the European establishment , have mutated their genes to a point were less useful traits like low IQ, is shunned out by More useful high IQ genes, passed down generation to generation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews looking back from 1700-1800s were backwards and poor, usually living in ghettos, they were seen by the upper classes as not only poor but even worse. This conspiracy that they are controllers of money has no real economic premise, Muslim and Christians hold more assets then Jews. They have never once in history had a significant role in government up until now, with small but sizeable political forces in the US mainly. Up until 1835 Jews were forbidden to get involved in government in the United Kingdom, only with the Jewish relief act 1835 did they come to government with one Jewish MP who wasn&#39;t religious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds just like the difference between &quot;white trash&quot; and our entrenched aristocratic class.  But if these Jews are so smart and superior, how did they let themselves get so poor?  Maybe being &quot;smart&quot; by that measurement has little to do with success.  </p>

<p>Just like back then, our real struggle isn&#39;t against our peers, no matter what color they are.  It&#39;s against the ruling class that uses terrorism, division, and geopolitical diversions to keep themselves and their families on top while the common man suffers.  Unfortunately, &quot;jews&quot; are a disproportionally large part of this group than others, but it isn&#39;t a &quot;jewish&quot; problem.  There&#39;s just as many and more white European/American  assholes running this as there are the ones who call themselves jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their were laws that stoped Jews from living and working with others, only in the 1800s did these laws disappeared. The were manly presents who worked and lived among themselves. I agree the elite are destroying to keep in power, and most of these are Elite let&#39;s say are &quot;smart&quot;. Jews do make up a good chunk- but not even 40%- not matter what religion, race a elitist is their goal is always self survival. My problem is that too many always look at the Jews as poster boys for elitist behaviour even though, a large portion of Jews around the world are extremely poor, an example would be the USA, there 5 million Jews there, one million of them have a net worth of $25,000 or less between a family of 4-7.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand how genetics work... </p>

<p>Evolution is a series of random mutations. If a mutation helps that given organism have more kids than non mutated organisms, or even to the point of out competing non mutants over resources, then the population with that mutation becomes dominant. </p>

<p>Doing intellectual work does not make your body to mutate to be more productive at it... that is lamarckism and has been thoroughly debunked. Now there can be epigenetic adaptations to certain conditions but these are already in existence and triggered by environmental conditions. </p>

<p>It is hard to know why Jews have been so successful in  finance, science, and mathematics. A culture of literacy and scholarship certainly plays a role. Also given that they were an ostracized group who as a result did not intermarry non-asheknazi Jews, it is possible that a series of founder mutations that given jews a propensity for intellectual pusuits became dominant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more worried about the Babylonian debt slavery system that&#39;s being imposed upon the world via IMF/World Bank/Central Bank cabals.  There is an effort to destroy and destabilize nations so they are forced to borrow vast sums of money that can never be repaid, all so nations lose their sovereignty and resource rights.  Entire countries are being pillaged.  </p>

<p>Citizens are also being encouraged to assume vast debt for simple things such as a house or home.  These debts control people such that they cannot speak out or step out of line or else they lose their employment and thus the roof over their head.  They are forced to work through debt.</p>

<p>Also, the cover up over Nibiru and the coming Poleshift cataclysms.  Many people believe it is their money funding the chemtrail global dimming agenda.  If people aren&#39;t given a proper warning, this could result in a genocide and a vast reduction in the human population.</p>

<p>As for scientific/technological advancement -- I believe there is more suppression and denial of technology on our planet which could better mankind and lift people out of poverty and sickness, i.e. Watercone solar water distillation.  Sickness is business, as they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reasoning on the economic issues, are pure speculation and those institutions are Their to try save economies from the unpredictable way in which Modern capitalism works, with it heavy reliance on debt, up and downs and bubbles. It&#39;s basic economics. Borrowing is highly unethical and a burden of people- but that doesn&#39;t mean from a economic perspective that it doesn&#39;t work. All of modern industry and tech, has been fuelled by borrowing now and paying back later, it creates a almost endless wave of cash, that can be used for invest and innovation.  People now day don&#39;t know how to handle money, and borrow to much or have unrealistic visions of fiscal life. But that&#39;s capitalism it&#39;s always heading to its death by the very innovations that it creates. Also this Nibiru thing is crazy and I don&#39;t want to write a paragraph on it. Also the chemical business is crazy, the sort of thing a guy with a paper sign on the side of the road yelling while selling pencils out of a cup would propagate. I agree that certain methods and technologies are being kept under the carpet for political and profit- but  it&#39;s enviable it becomes materialised but a lot slower then supposed to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jewish culture puts a lot of emphasis on education. They also have a lot of support networks like Hillel that helps get Jewish kids in school.</p>

<p>As a result, Jewish students are heavily over-represented in universities. They represent less than 2% of the US population but make up like 25% of the student body in some schools.</p>

<p>Ashkenazi are just white people from the Ukraine, Poland, Russia, who identify as Jewish. Most Jewish people in the US are Ashkenazi.</p>

<p>Because these dudes believe that they have a genetic link to mythical Judaism, they&#39;re really big on trying to prove it scientifically. Along the way, these dumbasses started believing that they were genetically smarter than everyone else because they score high on IQ tests.</p>

<p>Smart people will tell you that IQ is not a good determiner for intellect but these guys ignore that because they like the results.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that they&#39;re any smarter than anyone else. It&#39;s that the education system is kind of rigged to allow for cultural nepotism. Anyone who criticizes it is called anti-semitic but there&#39;s obviously a bias.</p>

<p>Asian &amp; Jewish cultures excel because their cultures emphasize education and they have the ability to succeed academically and professionally. It also helps when you have a well funded student lobby group on your side.</p>
