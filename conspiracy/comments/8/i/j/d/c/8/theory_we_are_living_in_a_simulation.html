        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am about 100% sure you have heard this and thought it was complete bull-crap. But, I have gathered some proof that this may be real. First things first. What do you feel when you stand up when sitting down for a really long time? You may feel dizzy, weak but most importantly you see Darkness. A feeling you can&#39;t really describe but we have came up with a term. Lightheaded, what does that mean? That means gravity pulls our blood to pool in the veins. Which triggers our brain to feel &quot;Lightheaded&quot; but what if it kept going? What if your brain didn&#39;t pull us back in from that tunnel vision you see? Well of course you would pass out. But, what if you stayed passed out..forever.. Nothing stops working you just sit in darkness for eternity...Where would you go? Nowhere. But are you sure its just darkness? If you look at a bright object for a long time and close your eyes, you will see shapes. The reason behind this is that it increases the pressure within the eyeball and this pressure activates ganglion cells in the retina in the same way as light does. So, if light does that doesn&#39;t it make it a living object? Go ahead rub your eyes or look into light and close your eyes. You will see all kinds of things. What are those things? Nobody has really asked or.. Really just found out. Its different for everyone. Back to my passing out sentence if you did pass out forever, you would see those shapes for eternity. And although people have came back to life all there stories differ, depending on what they believe in. Meaning probably nobody has ever &quot;died&quot; and came back to life. But the shapes might be what just holds us into that virtual reality. Yes that might sound insane but nobody has ever passed out for eternity. Those shapes may have something to do with the Simulation itself, &quot;a glitch in the matrix&quot; if you will.</p>

<p>15 minutes ago I was talking about how we&#39;re all slaves born into bondage, in a prison we can&#39;t taste, touch, or see...

<p>If thaqt is the reality you think for yourself, that is the reality you will live.</p>

<p>Would you be willing to try something new?</p>

<p>If so, set aside one day soon where you spend your time thinking about how wonderful this world is. All of the wonders of technology, your ability to walk down the street and buy whatever stuff you want, the beauty of nature, etc etc.</p>

<p>See if you still feel like a slave after a day of thinking good thoughts, of being grateful.</p>

<p>You have no way of validating this claim, for many reasons.  You have no way of measuring intelligence completely and no way of validating that whatever measurement scheme you come up with actually does what it says.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a simulation, but a natural progression within the harmonics of the universe. Time doesn&#39;t exist within the infinite. Sure, there can be artificial life created through supercomputers... through future biological computers too, replicating, simulating Earth and life seamlessly.. but it doesn&#39;t harness the essence of existence like true consciousness does. Nothing can because it comes from within. The kingdom of God is within you. It takes alot of trust to allow other consciousness/ thinkers/ life to exist. It&#39;s to learn and grow, though.. pass time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying this life is a simulation is a cop out and what those in power want you to fall back on. Bullshit. This is real, as real as it gets. If they can convince weak minded people that this is just a fake manipulation of consciousness then they have already won the war without a bullet ever being fired. Careful what you say, more careful of what you listen to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the point of keeping humans in a simulation?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have the much blood? We are bony and are not very edible. </p>

<p>Other animals would make for better batteries and reproduce faster.</p>

<p>Using other animals would require less programming, skies, worlds, planets, deep thought, why simulate all of these productions with people when you could use lesser animals. </p>

<p>Maybe our brains are processors? But why give so much autonomy when it isn&#39;t required. Why give us bodies when we could be bouncing balls of sludge, with the ability to fly, dive, and do other wondrous activities. </p>

<p>Unless you redefine simulation.  </p>
