       Submission Statement:
      </p>
      <p>
       Q Is Just A Psyop Conspiracy Theory. (A Conspiracy Theory Inside Another Conspiracy Theory)
      </p>
      <p>
       Nathan at Lift The Veil says he has intel indicating that Q is a psyop. What is Q? Q is an anonymous poster who has been revealing details about the shadow government who has been promising that the bad guys are going to face justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first heard about Q from an Alex Jones clip. Red flag number one. There was a sort of pigman on that show putting out a lot of fake enthusiasm about Q. Red flag number two.  All these people were so excited about all the “sealed indictments” all over YouTube. Q was always saying “trust the plan”. Okay - sounded like a way to keep the sheep from straying too far from the plantation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I heard Q said “Elon Musk is a patriot”. I know that for years Elon Musk has been full of crap and he oozes sulfur and he’s always parading around a woman who doesn’t look like quite like a woman so I knew that wasn’t True.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was hard to see all the people puffing their Q hopium but we’ve all been there. We’ve all wanted to believe a lie that was more pleasant than the Truth. It takes so much courage to face the Truth but it’s the Truth that brings life and freedom. Maybe Nathan’s intel is wrong but Q has obviously been BS for some time. Nathan handles this so delicately that I’m impressed. He’s right, it’s just another step on the journey. We’ll get through this.

       Whoa!
      </p>
      <p>
       When Nathan had 3 subscribers and three videos up he posted to r/conspiracy late one night - his San Bernadino breakdown. It was gag worthy and some of the most painful mindless blather but I thought he was just really new and nervous. We went back and forth a bit but I just figured he was a nerd so I dug and yep his IMDB popped up.

       The bad guys are not facing justice in the US.    Mueller is one of the bad guys.   The swamp will not be drained.    Trump is also a liar.  The Q phenomenon was disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Different parts of the swamp are at war,   obviously.    They want us to take one side or the other.    Both sides are the bad guys.

       I agree with this now. At first, I really liked some of the things they were saying. Seemed like they were legitimately working to teach people about conspiracies using a really intriguing questioning method. Then they went full partisan insanity and making unsubstantiated claims about elites being arrested that appear to have been proven false since then.

       It's hard to deny that he nailed the North Korea situation. He has been hinting at the Trump administration's plan since November and said very clearly on March 8th that peace would be achieved on the Korean peninsula. That's a pretty bold claim which has been wrong for 70 years, and suddenly it seems to be falling into place.

       The strong backlash against it, like you see in this post, give it more credibility IMO. Mention Q anywhere around here and watch the downvotes pour in.

       This is how I realized Islam is the correct religion. Everywhere I went, I said "sharia is a good thing," and the backlash I received was so overwhelming that it proved to me that it must be good, if the shills were working that hard to stop me.

       That's like watching an advertisement on TV and saying "I like that product, so it's not really advertising." It doesn't work that way. You approving of the message doesn't change whether or not it's a psychological operation. It's clearly a coordinated campaign of some kind, it is a psychological operation no matter what the truth is to it.

       Independent political commentators who have made a name for themselves in this social sphere. Both are writers, both have youtube channels. They seem to have left-leaning opinions on politics, but both are also against the Democratic Party's anti-progressive corruption and bullshit. Basically, I would say that they're a megaphone for voices who like Bernie Sanders but hate the Democrats.

       I've not followed Q's posts, but he'd have us believe that Trump is working against the deep state.  Well, if that's the case, why wouldn't he just level with all the American people about it?  Is he trying to convince the deep state people that he's on their side?  I think the main problem with the deep state is the secrecy and lies. They do their own thing for their own reasons.  We can't trust anything the government or media says.  Even if Trump orchestrated some kind of secret coup within the deep state so that we have new leadership, would we even know it?   And would it even matter if the new guys operate with the same kind of cloak and dagger secrecy as the old guys?   What even is the point?

       I've been saying this Q shit is an intelligence agency psyop for quite some time. It provides false hope to his followers, and injects a partisan/pro trump bias. Some of the goofiest shit I've ever seen, hopefully it's been exposed.

       How do we know the whistleblower isnt a psyop?  Reddit founder Alexis O was a consultant for Stratfor.  You can read his emails on Wikileaks.  Now you can watch Alexis on the hit Home Box Office tv show “Being Serena” where he puts a snoo sticker on his apple macbook.  Reddit is a psyop.  You have no clue if behind any username there is an actual human.

       The problem with a source driven community
       <em>
        when it comes to conspiracy
       </em>
       is that you no longer have any room for productive
       <em>
        conspiracy theory and research
       </em>
       because sources are driven by source holders and the source holders are likely some of the people conspiracy theorists are highly suspicious about. Sources can be manipulated before being published. And much of the time, sources are withheld completely, either by the conspirators, or for financial/legal reasons. So it doesn't make sense at all for a conspiracy sub to be "source driven". That would be pointless.

       There arent any. I was checking out Qs first posts a couple days ago and the dude got his start by predicting Hillary would be arrested in October 2017. So that didnt happen. Hes also said that Obama lawyered up. Hes talked about Hillary and Huma countless times and always suggests something big was about to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q has left over 1300 long comments and hes basically talked about everything a huge Trump supporter would think or care about. Hes left cryptic questions about everything from North Korea to Epstein island, to Weiners laptop, etc. So if literally anything happens at this point, his followers can say "woaaaah Q mentioned this 3 months ago. Future proves past bro!"
      </p>
      <p>
       So thats all it takes. I've been following this for months now and I find the whole thing fascinating. It seems that a lot of people drawn to the movement are older and seemingly lonely. I was surprised that the Q livestream on YouTube had so many people over 40. Some are 60-70. All of them are happy to spend up to 12 hours a day talking about Q posts and anything else good for Trump in the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is why cults are a thing. Once people find a sense of community, they are able to do serious mental gymnastics to protect that community.

       Boomers! They deserve to be mocked and ridiculed for believing in something that's so blatantly obvious to be utter bs.

       Q gives a vague statement, Boomers immediately jump to some weird conclusions. They see an analog clock and immediately go "omg it's in q shape".
      </p>

       Most of the things Q has ever said can mean bunch of random shit, but they fucking cling and present it as some enlightened knowledge.

       Yup this is a sophisticated online propaganda operation and has worked to perfection. They have Trump supporters backing policies and actions they were vehemently opposed to a year ago.Their whole movement has basically been Co-opted into an establishment wall street/neoconservative agenda and they are still yelling "trust the plan" to anybody that dares to have independent thoughts.

       No room for discussion, just outright dismissal because a youtuber who makes money selling tshirts to "conspiracy theorists" gets an email admitting to said random youtuber that Q is fake.

       Like Kachina dolls there are nested psyops.

       If you are playing the game, you have to doubt your every step.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this what they want you to know, or would they rather you didn't know? Do the people that tell you what you want to hear actually want to mislead you? Who is the good guy and who is the bad guy?

       If you start down the trail with your hopes and wishes ahead of your doubts and hesitations, you may be sidelined.

       But everything that crops up reflects something. Like a dazzling reflection when the sun is half set on a complex lake and shoreline, you have to guess where the shore begins and the water stops.

       Shill debunks other shill to get traffic. Shillception. Real whistleblowers don't operate under convenient YouTube videos titled "WHISTLEBLOWER" "INSIDER" "EX-" "FORMER". They get buried and you never hear about them. If you hear about a whistleblower it is because someone wants you to.

       I like how all these YouTube operators/intelligence agents that are "exposing Q" all followed him until his message didn't fit their narrative anymore, and they all come out to claim it's fake. Yet the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency links and "donate" links all seem to be legitimate on these guys channels?!? Click bait? Pay for play? Who's really playing with the minds of hopeful Americans here, just to cash in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ohh wait...didn't Q post saying people would come forward to make a profit from this in someway...nahhh that would be a catch 22 and actually prove his prediction's true, which would negate this whole thread.

       The moment I heard of Q and read his material, it was painfully obvious he was a LARP or hypothetically a pysop of one sort or another. I'm not sure I trust the guy in OP's video either. He could be a LARP himself. Just saying: Don't believe everything you read or hear on the Internet.

       Ohh man, some channel on YouTube with a poorly edited video, telling you Q is fake because a "whistleblower"knows better, is much more convincing then the next rando psychologically weak guy with a poor sourced comment about how Q is fake, because a "whistleblower" said it. All the proof I needed. 😏

       Maybe people should be posting this link to investigate the veracity of this blowers comments, and maybe prove this person actually even has access to a proverbial "whistle" to begin blowing.

       If you believed early on, but gave up because you couldn't hack the suspense, can you still feel self righteous about your comments bashing people who still do? Weren't you just one of those people? Lol be a real patriot, a real American, and lift someone up who's faith is being tested, in whatever he might believe.

       You are the concerted effort. See you concentrating and putting effort into denying it. You’re on a conspiracy sub to deny conspiracies. Seems sketchy. We don’t even put  this much effort into denying flat earth (probs a bad call on our part, but makes people like you so easy to spot!)

       Nah, the deniers are shills being paid to prevent real users of the sub from investigating.  It’s all there plain as day to anyone who wants to see for themselves. Imo the Chinese island photo from AF1 was the giveaway for me.

       Q predicted NK peace, some dudes dads assassination, and more.

      <p>
       Q group are the patriots who never stopped questioning JFKs assassination. While we all went along like sheep they kept fighting and waited for the right time, that time is now. They got greedy and it got too big. Some people with a conscience got caught up in it. WL leaked it all, we figured it out so well they had to shut us down. And now they’re trying to suppress us.

       If it is a psyop, which I suspect, it's well done and clearly Trump himself has to be involved.  For instance, remember his "top tippy top" condition remark?  I often wonder if Q is just "hope porn" and if the stage will ever be set for the arrests and exposure we yearn for.

       Psyop or not a Psyop?  Does it really matter?
Look how it has brought people together.
Look how it has brought us to using our brains to think and to not believe what they just tell us.
Look how it has informed the public to all the corruption around us.
Look how it made us go digging for truth and to share it with others.
You see, there is some good in everything.

       I have been saying "Q" is Assange. It was proven that Assange was Pro GOP in this election, it was proven that Assange/Wikileaks servers were in Moscow and there are coincidences that I think show something with him is tied to "Q".
