        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is gonna be slightly long winded but here goes. Normally I like to think my shit is pretty concise but I’m on holiday in a country where weed is legal and I have some time before dinner.. so I’d like to offer this disclaimer before I begin my rambling. 
Still with me?
Ok, let’s go.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of power in names. Any single on of you reading this - if you commented on this post and I replied using your real name - you’d lose your shit. You’d most likely report me to the mods, police or some other authority, right? Some of you would go a step further and PM me demanding to know <em>how the fuck you got my name you sonofabitch</em>
You’d be peeved, and rightly so. Your screename afford you a cover of anonymity that enables an honesty you’d most likely be unable to express using your real one.  It’s the reason a lot of us reddit I imagine, it’s certainly mine. In this fashion, the  disassociation from the “You” your friends and family know, ironically allows “You” to be more “You” than you’re able to be normally.
Names have power. You didn’t choose it, but it encapsulates your essence nonetheless. When someone refers to you by your name, there’s a certain <em>something</em> you feel when you hear it. It’s difficult to ignore. How often have you snapped your head in a public space only to realise you’d only heard something that<em>sounded</em> like your name? When people think of you, the idea of you - what you look like, the things you do, your values - it’s all underpinned by your name: the word you’re referred to as.</p>

<p>My point is this: we need to stop calling these fucking pedophiles - “Elites”.  Their most defining feature isn’t their status. It’s not their wealth. It’s not their position at the top of a system that they created. </p>

<p>It’s the fact that for millennia, they’ve systemically  abducted, raped and killed children.</p>

<p>Ive always found it a struggle when I’m referring to <strong>them</strong>. <em>Elite</em> sounds like your a fan - but I appreciate “Consortium of Bloodline families comprised of European Royalty and Banking ,Vatican and Roman, Industrious-Techno” doesn’t exactly roll of the tongue. But there’s no need for us to elevate these pedophiles any higher than the positions they occupy in their own satanic minds. 
Your name is what you are. We can get all esoteric and argue that </p>

<p><em>no in fact we aren’t actually our names any more than our bodies, were all one unified spirit existing in separate flesh vehicles</em></p>

<p>But in this realm of existence at least, words have power. And there’s fewer words more powerful to each of us than the word people use to refer to us. That’s really all a name is when you break it down. With that single word, all manner of associations come along for the ride. I’m merely proposing we circumvent the associations and cut straight to the chase. </p>

<p>I’ve started already in my comments today and will be continuing on from this point. “Elite” is too good a word to use on a  “Pedophile”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I refer to them as &quot;Elites&quot; because they are, as you say, at the top of the social pyramid they have created. They are Elite actors within the context of our society. Elite doesn&#39;t mean they are respected or good or right, it just means that economically and socially, they sit at the top of the power structure. In fact, I think in the US the term &quot;Elites&quot; is becoming more and more derogatory as time goes on.</p>

<p>But call them whatever you feel is best. For example, I no longer call the media the MSM, I call them the Corporate Propaganda Media, because I think it&#39;s the Truth. Start using your own name and perhaps it will catch on. For now tho, I say we keep dirtying the word Elite. </p>

<p>Sorry, but it is never, ever right to molest a child. Someone as young as 13 can&#39;t give informed consent. It&#39;s fucking degenerate and wrong to assume so.</p>

<p>Are you being purposely reductive to promote your own child fucking agenda?</p>

<p>-The Children Welfare Act chapter 34 forbids any act of &quot;fornication&quot; with children (here defined as anyone under 18 years of age)[48] with prefectures and districts specifying further details in (largely similar) &quot;obscenity ordinances&quot; 
 like adding exemptions for sex in the context of a sincere romantic relationship (typically determined by parental approval).</p>

<p>-It has been stated that there are two territories of Japan that have their own local age of consent laws — Marcus Islands and Okinotori Islands — with an age of consent of 13. These islands are small and unpopulated.</p>
