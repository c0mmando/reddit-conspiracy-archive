       Blacks, hispanics, etc. - we all lose when we think in these limited terms.  Being black or hispanic or something else doesn't necessitate compliance with a corrupt hierarchy.  So if these groups, or any particular group thinks in those terms, they're just setting themselves up like the Egyptian Scots in trying to build yet another hierarchy to fall.  We need to stop that shit.

       I used to teach actually, so I know some of the in's and out's of how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kid with 2 involved parents in their life were miles ahead of the kid with no involved parents in their life just on
       <strong>
        day one of kindergarten
       </strong>
       . You can guess which races had more parental involvement than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also went to private and public schools and private schools by far give you a better education, because they have to in order to stay in business. If parents aren't happy with the job they are doing, the pull the kid out of the school.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kids from richer school districts will also almost always beat the pants off of kids from poorer school districts too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like no child left behind and forcing teachers to pass kids to the next grade are disservices to the kids. And increased class sizes and cyber school are awful for learning.

       don't lie, except for China who plays with their numbers. That's a lot of catching up to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are making under $50k, I don't think you should have kids unless you are willing to be poor or to live on government assistance.

       and
       <a href="https://hailtoyou.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fertility19802013_b.png">
        Hispanics have a much higher fertility rate than Whites and Asians.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens is:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         An umarried person, usually from a poor background, gets pregnant at a young age before they have the means to take care of a kid.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They have to drop out of school or miss school. This delays their graduation, which makes it harder for them to find any real job.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They obviously can't afford this kid, so they have to get government assistance.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They get comfortable living off the government and realize the more kids they have = the more money they get. And as long as there's a Dem in there, the money keeps coming.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Even if they try to change their ways, they are fighting a losing battle. College is expensive and because we have a much larger supply of workers than what the demand is, they end up competing for minimum wage jobs against people who already have degrees and work/internship experience, and they usually lose.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At this point, they might as well stay on government assistance.
        </p>
       </li>

       President Trump would have won 0 states if only Hispanic or Black votes counted in the 2016 election, while he would have won 42+ states if only Whites voted:

       He won't be for a few reasons. The propaganda going around the U.S. that anyone that's not white who is a conservative has something wrong with them is one thing. The second is that the rate that the demographic is shifting at  makes assimilation impossible. You can't replace 20% of your population in a few decades and expect to do anything except basically import another nation. Hispanics that are replacing whites come in such large numbers that they largely encounter so many others in the same position that they don't  experience the same cultural aspect of immigration that would normally happen under a slow, controlled, low-population immigration. It's true that anyone can come to a different country and truly assimilate into it's culture but only if they experience that culture. The areas that are experiencing massive demographics shifts are doing so in such mass numbers that they experience what is essentially just an enclave of their old countries instead of the new one.

       And every night they go to sleep laughing at us because darn, that theft of the 2016 election has probably worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they rightfully believe it is because they convinced so many to hate people of a different color, religion, sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time they aren't even bothering to build up a big fear case against Iran.  They will simply go and do. That is how successful the manipulation and propaganda has been.

       all you say is true.  but all you say is a list of things that we can all easily improve upon, that "they" cannot stop.  for instance, we can just decide not to react like programmed/triggered robots.  each of your points can be dealt with.

       our collective ignorance is in not realizing that certain organizational patterns corrupt.  we deal with this single design problem and we greatly minimize its effect.

       A problem I notice with both the older generations and the "millennial" is neither care about the truth. All that matters is that "their opinion wins" and everything else gets slandered with random logical fallacy. Which is essentially what Plato's Republic cast as it's cornerstone, 23 centuries ago. "Certain organizational patterns corrupt" indeed!

       this is one of the devices preventing action.  but look where it's gotten us?  so that's out as a general concern, imo.  people just want it to end at this point.  they've blown their wad.

       actually this would be the best thing to get of the currency hegemony they've set up.  so i wish they would do that and bring people to the conditions that enable creative thought under pressure - the very thing they have no D for.

       Well, the way we have been losing is letting what seemed like miniscule rights and freedoms disappear through regulations and recess laws that "were for our bennefitt".  O more. Trump is using the same tactics daily to return power to the citizens. It is amazing how much he has undone in under two years that has acumilated for at least 20. We read ad learn to understnd the constitution and bill of rights... Yes, things they do NOT DO IN PUBLIC EDUCATION anymore. We do jot let others walk on us or steal our rights while congress is out on Christmas vacation. This may not be the entire answer, but its a beginning.

       How we can lose is by being divided by social engineering using racism, sexism, and trying to make people stupid, and propaganda. We can lose if they try a biological warfare. They are winning in poisoning our food and drinks with GMO foods and water not being clean. Water with sodium fluoride and medications in our water. Forced vaccinations.

       Your right. There are probiotics and prebiotics to resist against the Splenda (sucralose) and Aspastame and other toxic sweeteners. The GMOs, the toxins in soft drinks, and toxins in flavored water, is killing the good bacteria and good gut flora. So people are trying to find a way to repopulating the good bacteria to stop the gut problems people are having all over America and the parts of the world with using GMO. Monsanto is slowly killing us but we are trying to go for non-GMO foods, boycott Ritz crackers and boycott Mountain Dew for usage of genetically modified ingredients. We can find ways to get our health back in order without being forced to always take medications. Type 1 Diabetics cannot go on candida diets as they are required to have some kind of glucose so another way to do this is coconut oil and trying to go to more natural sugars instead of processed sugar, and as well as natural fruit glucose. There are ways diabetics can survive and get rid of candida. We can defeat the good bacteria killing GMOs and toxins in our foods and drinks.

       we actually don't need anything from anyone.  there's nothing to be given us.  we have to give ourselves capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       first step is self-sufficiency and getting away from gov rule.  basically remove yourself from the systems they've set up.  wish it weren't that way, but the people in charge are fucking idiots or satanists.  so that means exchange networks that don't involve currency and are built around a more balanced paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       every single war nowadays is a currency war.
      </p>
      <p>
       every time a person tries to spin a new independent currency they get shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       so the first step is to bypass currency entirely.  how this looks?  i dunno.  i think it's probably organic.  i think we're dealing with personal networks.  and at least we know this - that the controllers can't scale (because they're fucking hierarchical and thus rare) their "common" touch.

       Your vision of an egalitarian society plays right into their hands. You are a racial and sexual communist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at who is being deplatformed from every major payment outlet and social media platform. (hint: it's not people that you describe, because you guys don't scare the globalists, not one bit). The only people who scare the globalists are fascists, racial nationalists and advocates of patriarchy.
