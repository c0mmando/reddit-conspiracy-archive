    <div class="md"><p>Yea. I just made my way through most of it. Im not going to say its a lie, but it is clearly russian propaganda. Just like CNN and FOX. I happen to live im the US and i dont think Russia or China has my best interests in mind. The read you just posted is a very hard pill for me to swallow. </p>

<p>I do believe it happened, switzerland controlling the west. Allowing coporations to take over. The history being taught in secret societies in elits schools. But i dont beleive russia has the answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough answer, but what the Russian General says is consistent with my understanding of how the world works.  There is Egyptian symbology all over the world.  The Washington Monument is an Egyptian obelisk, and there is Egyptian symbols on the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.  These are just a few examples.  </p>

<p>The Russian General claims that it is the Egyptian Priesthood that controls everything.  </p>

<p>I think that Russia does not have the solution on its own.  The solution involves the American, Russian, and Chinese people (and others) waking up and working together to rid the planet of these evil people.  They rule because we give them our consent by not fighting them.  We have finally begun to fight.   </p>

<p>Furthermore, the high level elite &quot;Jews&quot; (like Rothschild and others) are not even Jewish, whether racially or religiously. They are Khazars, who are most likely a mixture of Luciferian/Sabbatean-Frankists (Occult). They are considered Hofjuden. </p>

<p>I think it would be ignorant to do so, yes. TPTB are made of many different groups of people. Khazar Hofjuden are used by the Vatican, Jesuits, Black Nobility, Sovereign Military of Malta, European Royalty (to name a few), and are rewarded handsomely for it, being shields and front man money changers. Have been for a very long time. </p>

It needs some updating, and I really need to stop procrastinating in doing it. </p>

<p>If you go to YT, and search for: &quot;Venetian black nobility&quot;, you can find a few people talking about it. I highly recommend Jordan Maxwell&#39;s presentations. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>A dark priest class that survived and took the reigns of power after the Great Deluge. Egyptian priesthood is pretty close, but, it implies too much, imo. I think everything we know/have been talked about Egypt is a lie (ie. there was no Exodus from Egypt nor were there slaves - a lie created by the Babylonians). The two bloodlines of Cain and Abel, hint on this. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Putin is a tough cookie to crack (by design). A huge part of me thinks, he is a true Romanov. Which is why he has so much power and backing. If that is true, I&#39;m not sure if he is friend or foe, to humanity, tbh. </p>

<p>My thinking is that the people I am against are against Putin, and they fear Trump and Putin working together.  This logic is not definitive, but I think it is a reasonable indication.  Besides, I tend to stay positive about all of this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that. I agree that Israel is pretty fucked and much of the media does appear to be controlled by Jews.</p>

<p>More to the point, I&#39;m friends with a few Jews and they really do stick together more than other groups, which I think contributes to the fears that they are all part of some &quot;cabal&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say things like the Freemasons are Christianity&#39;s answer to the camaraderie Jews seem to have, and that joining a &quot;clique&quot; might be good for many of us.</p>

<p>At the same time, I&#39;m pretty sure classifying these &quot;shadowy cabals&quot; as Jewish would be a mistake, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that&#39;s what they want us to do, because it masks their true identity, which has little to do with Judaism. </p>

<p>I agree. However, the Nefarious part is any group of people that unites under the guise of an ancestry, religion, philosophy, ideology for the sake of bettering themselves, to the detriment of all others that they see as lesser cattle, regardless of where or how these sorts of groups manifest themselves. I think we can also agree on that, and that these kinds of groups exist in various forms around the world: Military Industrial Complex, Religious Fanatics, CFR/Bilderberg, NWO, Bohemian Grove, etc</p>

<p>That&#39;s the question, is it really a history of bigotry, or is it a history of Jewish actions that have caused movements against them? That&#39;s what I&#39;m currently studying.</p>

<p>For example, you can see what happened in Russia under the Bolsheviks/Marxists and make some major connections there, which also correlate to similar scenarios throughout history </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Its not bigotry, its free thinking. I am allowed to, and free to study the history of any people, Jewish, Black, Chinese, Germans, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims and find some horrible bullshit in each group, I can then call this bullshit out, and discuss it with others, and none of that makes me a bigot.</p>

<p>It sounds like you have fallen for the post modernist brainwashing that scams people into imprisoning themselves in this bullshit ideology that any criticism of any group of people is bigotry. </p>

<p>If you escape from that mental prison, then you will no longer be a slave.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I am a free thinker. You are suing &quot;bigotry&quot; to try tim imprison me in limits. Calling someone a bigot creates this weapon of fear, fear to question something that might make someone be seen as a bigot.</p>

<p>I refuse to be imprisoned by your labels, am free to criticize everything and anything, which makes me a free thinker</p>

<p>It&#39;s utterly fascinating, and quite funny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually, that break down is wrong, you can just google the first 5 claims that user says are proven wrong, to see that the post is wrong.</p>

<p>For example the first one covered is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>250 AD - Carthage - expulsion</p>

<p>Right off the bat we have something which I&#39;m going to assume it completely made-up, simply Googling it give me nothing, and the only source I can find says this:</p>

<p>CARTHAGE, ancient city in North Africa near the modern Tunis; founded in the 9th century B.C.E. by Phoenicians. There is no evidence of Jews in Carthage during the Punic period (before 146 B.C.E.); on the other hand, a number of modern scholars maintain that the expansion of the Phoenicians from Tyre and Sidon owed something of its impetus to the collaboration of Hebrews from the Palestinian hinterland. Substantial Jewish settlement is known only from the time of the Roman Empire. Its existence is shown from inscriptions (mainly on tombstones) and from literary sources, especially those of the Church Fathers. The majority of Jewish inscriptions from Carthage (discovered in a cemetery excavated near the city) show that the language of its Jews was Latin, although a few inscriptions are in Hebrew. The *menorah is common, and some of the tombs are decorated with wall paintings. The city is also mentioned in the Talmud. Of particular interest is the paradoxical statement: &quot;From Tyre to Carthage the nations know Israel and their Father who is in heaven, but from Tyre westward and from Carthage eastward the nations know neither&quot; (Men. 110a). &quot;Africans&quot; (Carthaginians) are also described as disputing with Israelites the title to the ownership of Ereẓ Israel. The Septuagint translates &quot;Tarshish&quot; by Karhadon (= Carthage). The Jews of Carthage and its surroundings were most probably originally emigrants whose number grew, particularly after the disasters in Ereẓ Israel (in 70 and 132–5) and in Egypt (in 115–117). Some scholars maintain that in the Mediterranean area there was intensive proselytizing activity among the Phoenician populace, who felt particularly close to Judaism and who attached themselves to Judaism after their political decline. By this means the Phoenicians preserved their Semitic identity and were not assimilated by the Roman-Hellenistic culture which they hated. This view, though interesting, is highly problematical. Nevertheless, the possibility of successful Jewish proselytizing there cannot be dismissed. With the spread of Christianity the status of the Jews began progressively to deteriorate. The hatred of the Christians stemmed partly from the influence exercised by the Jewish religion in Carthage and the surrounding area, where there were many Judaizing sects and proselytes. Tertullian and Augustine give a few details about the Jews in Carthage, whose situation particularly deteriorated in the days of Justinian when the regulations issued against heretics affected them also. As a result synagogues were seized and converted into churches and many Jews fled. It is possible that in that period, under the influence of the exiled Jews, a number of North African pagan tribes became converted. The Moslem conquest ended the importance of Carthage and the center of Jewish life in the area passed to *Kairouan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, some quick research shows that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jews have lived in Rome for over 2,000 years [...] They may even have established a community there as early as the second pre-Christian century, for in the year 139 B.C. the pretor Hispanus issued a decree expelling all Jews who were not Italian citizens&quot; Jewish Encyclopaedia So we can pretty much discount there role there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12816-rome#1005">http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12816-rome#1005</a></p>

<p>Particularly this part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They may evenhave established a community there as early as the second pre-Christian century, for in the year 139 B.C. the pretor Hispanus issued a decree expelling all Jews who were not Italian citizens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When he covers the second one:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>415 AD - Alexandria - expulsion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Correct, this did happen. Cyril of Alaxandria, who was the Patriarch at that time, used a mob to drive out the Alexandrian Jews that were living in that quarter of the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then goes on to justify it was because &quot;anti-semitisim&quot; this coming from a jew posting in r/judaism. So take it all with a grain of salt, since there is going to bias of course.</p>

<p>We also have the Jews Genociding The Amalekites, Perrizites, Hivites, Caananites, and Jebusites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, he&#39;s not wrong, cause they&#39;re still Jewish? &quot;Some&quot; would be contradictory to disproportionate. If you dig a little, you&#39;ll hypothesize as well that, wow it sure is suspicious, that this particular state has perpetuated this agenda of control, fear, violence, censorship and robbery of the free world culturally and economically for a long time, and fell on many false promises, caused many wars, but yet are still slaughtering innocent Palestinian people in the name of religion no one bats an eye, but an interracial shooting involving law enforcement in anytown USA can fuel multiple city movements and protests....and criticism worldwide. I read another post the other day I can&#39;t quite remember where, that said essentially, &quot;if you ever wanna know who controls you, criticize them openly and see who brings upon punishment&quot;. Yet we as Americans can travel to Europe/Middle East abroad, and be persecuted in diff forms, maybe even have violence acted out against us cause we&#39;re Americans or Christians by assumption, I don&#39;t see anybody standing up with a fist in the air for us, but I guess that&#39;s ok right!? We&#39;re considered the enemy just because we&#39;re American, no matter what the argument is, so I can make this argument for any ethnicity, culture, so on, fact of the matter is. Where there is smoke, there is fire, and if it hasn&#39;t stopped in hundreds of years, generation after generation, are we still being anti semetic, or are we just pointing out consistencies and habitual behavior?</p>

<p>If American white/Christian males can be grouped into categories like this to fit the lefts mirror imaged, fake racist narrative, why is it always &quot;anti semetic&quot; to point out the tendencies in the Jewish faith/culture/political state? Sounds like someone is oppressing others unfavored observations actually by trying to play the white knight card. </p>

<p>Only if we would actually call people out on their behaviors, instead of running from retribution and being overly politically correct just to save face, then we could weed out the bad &quot;Jews&quot; or bad Americans or bad Muslims...etc etc. Sometimes coming to the table with your issues about what you observe is the ONLY way to get results. Let your trash man keep flipping over your trash can everyday and say nothing because you don&#39;t want to offend him, and you will live in a state of mental oppression forever, tell him to F&#39;n stop and you&#39;ll have set a boundary that if crossed again, shows intent, and intent takes motive. Motive can be proven to be more than happenstance.</p>

<p>Your comment has allowed me, to level up and finally say what I know a lot of others want to say as well on here. I&#39;ll wait for the ban hammer...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I&#39;ve recently discovered with that distinction is the the Jewish state insists there is no difference. The state of Israel is the equivalent of Judaism according to them, so criticism of the state is antisemitic by their own definition. And then the whole thing with the goyim (everyone who is not Jewish) being the slaves of the Jews, but the goyim just don&#39;t know it yet?</p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t how all Jews think, but if you support and defend a state that does, what&#39;s the difference? Recent polls state 81% of Israelis support shooting Palestinian protesters. That&#39;s a pretty high approval rating for genocide.</p>

<p>The difficult thing for me is that our family hosted an exchange student from Israel when I was in 2nd grade. He was another brother to me. And I know back then he was afraid to join the IDF as required. He opened a windsurf shop after his service, so I think maybe his views on military didn&#39;t change with service. I don&#39;t really know.</p>

<p>But again, if we assume the Israeli civilian media is the same as the US, then it can&#39;t be trusted and we can&#39;t make informed opinions about what they really think.</p>

<p>But I know war crimes when I see them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because half of what you say is stupid exaggeration and the other group is done by a group clearly other than just &quot;Jews&quot;, namely a very specific subgroup of Israeli: national conservatives, e.g. Likud, and even more aggressively a large subgroup of Orthodox Jews, which are the people mostly occupying Palestine territory.</p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s the arbitrary nature whereby people are distinguished: the fact that most people of power are white men is further diminished to jews, but never further than that. The &quot;Jews&quot; is suddenly this massive indivisible structure, unlike other collections of people. The hatred for Soros, where other non-Jewish billionaires play a much bigger role and do so in a much more secretive manner like Mercers, Koch is not an issue. It&#39;s all so obvious, suspicion is always reserved for whom Nazis wouldn&#39;t consider white (that&#39;s more for places like this, in the wider web there&#39;s a ton of hatred due to Muslims&#39; antisemitism). It&#39;s also rarely brought the main empowerment of Israel lobbying in the US comes from Christians, especially evangelicals. These cooky people are extremely similar to the worst in Israel, with their end of time beliefs etc.</p>

<p>The end result is that the antisemitism seeps through most discussions. Normal people are immediately turned off since you lot aren&#39;t nearly as subtle as you think you are, and as a consequence Israel gets a free pass.</p>

<p>Are you denying it too? Are you denying that white T-count and Fertility rate is dropping the west, but not anywhere esle? Are you denying tgat whites have gone from 25% of the world population to just 7%? Are you denying that by 2045, whites will become minority in America, and by 2100, all western countries will have a white minority? Are you denying tgat there is pro-miscegeneation propaganda that indoctrinates whites?</p>

<p>All those things are happening and are classified as signs of a genocide by the UN. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your assessment. It is the globalist plan to intermix everyone. We know this from the Kalergi plan.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is, you are missing something. Africa doesn&#39;t have any significant miscegeneation. Asia too.</p>

<p>So the races respective to these continents will be safe. But whites of European descent are not. </p>

<p>Well, i don&#39;t believe it&#39;s personal to whites. The globalists just want a low IQ divided population, without borders or identity.</p>

<p>Wrong</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I already answered this. I said they want a low IQ divided population. A divided population is easy to control. </p></li>
<li><p>Im assuming you know about <a href="https://youtu.be/J4KNnRBUhGo">race and IQ? </a></p></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to explain why East Asian do not make good slaves. They have a high IQ and lack genetic markers for empathy. The meme about Asians being souless is in many ways true.</p>

<p>Now, what is the globalist doing about this? Well... </p>

<ol>
<li><p>the east asian population in the west is kept low (6% in the USA)</p></li>
<li><p>Affirmative action hinders their achievements</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Im saying your discrediting the intellect of others. The death of the whites isnt the end of civilisation as we know it, and the next generation would still be half white. So...
I wont lie im running off of 4hrs of sleep and trying to cram for exams. My mind is in other places so i may not be making as much sense as i want to be. 
I just can&#39;t help but feel that your viewpoint is closed to the bigger picture of the world and how it works. I understand what you&#39;re saying, and even feel it has merit in some regards but in others it seems a bit....barebones lets say. </p>

<p>But i am curious, what do you personally think could be a solution to the issue? 
I&#39;m Irish so i cant talk about American politics that well, but i can say that our opens border policy is damaging the country as a whole. We need something like Australia where you need money, a plan, and the looming threat of deportation if you fuck up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just keep stating the truth and facts. Calling you &quot;antisemitic&quot; is a last ditch effort for their  defense is all. Blobama spent eight long years calling everyone who didn&#39;t agree with his policies &quot;racists&quot; also. Now, after a few years, those die hard dems are realizing his ideals were utter shit for (legal) American citizens. Yep, a manchurian person educated in constitutional law was doing his best to strip you of those very rights and freedoms guaranteed by them. Red pilling continues.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>English has a confused all assumption. There might be a proper name for this, but I don&#39;t know it.</p>

<p>For example, consider the phrase &#39;tables are red.&#39; Does this mean all tables are red? Or does it mean that there exists tables that are red? Now try it with more controversial subjects. Muslims are terrorists. Trump banned Muslims from immigrating to the US. Jews were behind 911. Jews killed Jesus.</p>

<p>Demagogues take advantage of this confusion. It&#39;s sufficiently vague to backtrack in either direction later. Or both depending on which news channel you&#39;re on. Similarly it&#39;s easy to attack people who say phrases like these. Omg how could you say that about Jews? </p>

<p>What&#39;s worse is that the more precise language just sounds awful. My friend was murdered by a person that happens to be black. There exists a sufficient number of Muslims that are raping Swedish women to qualify the situation as a serious problem. So instead people tend to fall back to less precise language that leaves them open to attacks like omg how could you be so antisemitic? </p>

<p>Tbh, what I find amazing is the lack of self accountability. I keep coming back to this forum, amazed that everyone is pointing fingers at something they can&#39;t see and not looking in their own bedrooms for the &quot;problems&quot; they wallow in.</p>

<p>I wish I lacked self awareness at a child-like level. Ignorance must truly be bliss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure Jews control a lot of things, media governments, financial industries but to say they rule everything is not true. They are part of a cabal that wants to own everything but they are also in the midst of other cabals doing the same, some that may be bigger and some that may be slightly smaller. They may a times have similar objectives but they all are vying for the supreme spot. To truly influence the world you need cooperation from other sphere&#39;s (Asia, Russia, EU) each of these sphere&#39;s have multiple cabals with similar influences and objectives. The conspiracy is when these powerful forces combine to keep humanity in a prisoner planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I for one would like to thank and bless Israel, our lone ally. Thank you Israel:</p>

<p>For extorting from me and my fellow Americans $4,000,000,000.00 a year for the last 4 decades, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For taking our most sophisticated weapons technology and stealing it for yourself without paying the American patent holders, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For taking that high-tech military technology and selling it to our enemies, such as the Russians and Chinese, thus further endangering us, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using that weaponry in a sustained attack against a United States ship, the USS Liberty, in an attempt to sink her, thus preventing US servicemen from revealing to the rest of the world information concerning the war crimes they witnessed you commit against Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai Desert during the Six Day War, as well as for the purposes of dragging the US into yet another one of your murderous adventures, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For killing 35 and wounding 170 American sailors aboard the USS Liberty, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For bribing the United States government into covering it up, preventing any justice from being done for the benefit of the families of the lost sailors – as well as the American People, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For sending your agents into Egypt and blowing up American buildings for the purpose of blaming the Arabs in an event known as the Lavon Affair, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For sending your agents into Libya during the Reagan administration, and broadcasting radio messages in Arabic that were designed to sound like “terrorist cell planning” so that the US would initiate military strikes against Khadafi in an event known as Operation Trojan Horse, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For withholding information from us concerning the planned attacks against the US Marine barracks in Lebanon, attacks you knew about through your moles in the Islamic world and about which you deliberately refused to warn us in order to further your interests against the Arabs, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For employing Jonathon Pollard, an American serviceman paid to spy for Israel in order to steal even more of our National Security secrets for your parasitic purposes, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For breaking every agreement you have made with your Arab neighbors, stealing their land, displacing, murdering, and treating them like the animals you see them as, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents within the first Bush administration to involve us in the first Gulf War, causing the deaths of American men and women, and exposing our servicemen to whatever bio-weapons were and are responsible which have led to Gulf War Syndrome, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For your role in the September 11 attacks in this country, and for blackmailing and bribing the US government into deporting back to Israel the 100 or more intelligence agents that were arrested after the attacks, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For suppressing the information from the American people of your involvement in the September 11 attacks and sending us in the wrong direction in search of answers, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using one of your agents in the US Army Weapons Lab to steal anthrax and distribute it into our mail system, terrorizing US citizens and killing several in order to blame the Arabs, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents in the US Government, namely, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Perle, Abrams, and the rest into initiating this war in the Middle East so that you could bring to heel all the enemies you have made during the last 50 years, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents in the media to lie to us on a minute by minute basis about the war, lying to us as to how “just” this cause is, and what the real reasons behind it are, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents in the Christian Evangelical community, such as Falwell, Graham, Swaggert, Robertson and the rest who praise you as God’s chosen people and further keep Americans in the dark about who you really are what you have done, and what you are truly about, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For bringing idiots like Limbaugh, Liddy, Hannity, Beck, O’Reilly and Savage to the forefront as paid liars who will support you and further lead Americans astray, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For making America your attack dog, and for sending her sons and daughters to fight and die in all your future wars, we bless thee. For using your influence in the media to hide the real statistics about the war, the dead and wounded on both sides, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using us in such a way that not only further inflames the Arab world against us, but as well has succeeded in our alienating ourselves against those nations with whom we have been friendly for over a century, we bless thee.</p>

<p>And finally, for using your influence in our media and academia to flood our minds with pornography and lies, as well as inculcating in us a hatred for our history, religion, and culture, for dividing our nation between races and sexes, and for releasing into our society all of your plagues and filth that have left us a rotted out corpse of a once great nation, oh Israel, our friend,</p>

<p>We bless thee!</p>

<p>2) There were incredibly rich jews who left Europe during WW2 &amp; they didn&#39;t give a rats ass about leaving other less fortunate jews behind.</p>

<p>3) Global banking/war financier families are old money like the Rothschilds, Kuhns, Morgans, Rockefellers etc are bloodsucking off the backs of the world citizenry &amp; need to be put on notice. Publicly identify them &amp; lay on the heat.......it&#39;s not just the average guy who happens to be jewish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phrasing and how you put it.</p>

<p>Hm, to give an example.  My mother hates working with Chinese people.  She is in pharmaceuticals.  So her view is their shit is shit.  Research and whatnot.  Also the stories make it easy to be racist honestly.  A lot of lying and competition.</p>

<p>She can tell me that.  I mean I&#39;m her 34 year old son.  Sure.  Don&#39;t bring that shit up in front of others though, right?  She doesn&#39;t, smart!</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to bring facts first though.  Only so much news I can retain.  So sure, hey did you hear about this?  And about this?</p>

<p>Also she doesn&#39;t hate every Chinese person, I know that.  Just the shitty ones.  She&#39;s just wary now.  I mean we had that shit hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> of their research papers or something, whatever.</p>

<p>So yet again you have to phrase it correctly.  And be correct.</p>

<p>Obviously we all know not every Jewish person or Chinese person is horrible.  Or every black or white.  It comes down to how you present it and who you present it to.  We all make assumptions, every redditor is fat.  The guy walking at 2 am is drunk.</p>

<p>No idea where I went with this.  You just need to somehow bring up shit and know your audience.  Still no idea on numerous conversations with some people.  Why are you asking me how to get marijuana out of your system, I literally am moving shit, this is not normal.  Guessing he did not get it out in time as I did not have a downstairs neighbor back then after a few days.  Hah.</p>

<p>Yea, you already edited but was drinking and typed this.  Oh well.  I fail.  You can hate all notjidfshill.  It&#39;s fine in this case.  Hah.</p>

<p>Sorry for rant.  Just phrase it well and don&#39;t sound like you hate all of &lt;insert something&gt;.  Unless you&#39;re with actual friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could just as easily blame &quot;white men&quot;, because it&#39;s men who did everything you describe.</p>

<p>The reason the Jewish people who have power today have that power is because they worked harder and were smarter than everyone they competed against.  You don&#39;t see all of the other jewsih people who didn&#39;t work hard and therefore didn&#39;t rise to prominence, and you are ignore all the other people who worked hard and did rise to prominence but aren&#39;t jewish.</p>

<p>The real problem you have is that you are confused about how things work.  Corporations are controlled by the board of directors who represent the shareholders.  There are a lot of jewish people in executive positions, but this is because jewish people are pushed and push themselves to be successful.  Asian people are moving into these same positions because they are similarly pushing themselves to strive for the top.  They push themselves to stand out and excel.</p>

<p>Other ethnicities don&#39;t value success as much.  They value having a good time, comradery, conformity, etc.  Those things aren&#39;t valuable in today&#39;s economy, and it shows in the wealth statistics.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Jews do not control the media or the banks or anything else.  The CEO of Netflix isn&#39;t Jewish, neither is Jeff Bezos the CEO of Amazon.  The CEO of Time Warner isn&#39;t jewish, nor is the CEO of JP Morgan.  Warner Buffet isn&#39;t jewish, Bill Gates isn&#39;t jewish.  The CEO of Disney is jewish but do you think the Marvel movies would be less popular if he wasn&#39;t?  and 33% of Disney is owned by index mutual funds.</p>

<p>The largest owner of almost every major US corporation is the Vanguard Group, which has that status because it runs the largest index mutual funds.  Vanguard&#39;s ownership stake in those companies is literally controlled by a computer that buys and sells to match the company&#39;s position in the index.    The CEO of Vanguard could be a sofa and it wouldn&#39;t make a different.  </p>

<p>The reason you are antisemitic is because you focus on the fact that some people are jewish, ignore all the counterexamples of people who aren&#39;t, and also ignore all of the other characterisitcs, like high IQ, pursuit of advanced degrees, college education etc.</p>

<p>Be honest-how many hours of homework did you do every night in high school?  Was it 3?  6?   Because the jewish kids and the asian kids and the kids of parent who care are doing that much.  And jewish kids are forced by their parents to learn hebrew, just like asian kids are forced by their parents to learn a second language.  Those second languages are complex and completely different from english. </p>

<p>What second languages did you learn outside of school?  Did you learn to play an instrument?  Did your parents shout and yell at you if you skipped a music practice?  If you got a low score on a test?</p>

<p>Did your parents tell you not to waste time with team sports because your success depends on everyone else?  Are you beginning to understand why so many jewish and asian kids play tennis?</p>

<p>Or are you one of those kids who did a team sport every season with middling success, maybe did 30 mins to an hour of homework every night, never learned a musical instrument beyond playing some stupid pop song or a couple of riffs on the guitar?  Do you spend a lot of your weekend nights out with the boys drinking and having a good time?  Maybe go to church on sunday and non your head like a good like drone when the pastor or priest tells you you&#39;re a good christian?</p>

<p>Franklly, the reason there are some many jewish and soon asian people on top is because on the average whitely is a overfed, lazy, ignorant moron.</p>

<p>&quot;Gentiles fight wars&quot;  It&#39;s a volunteer military, dumbass, why would you sign up?  If you want to be in the military, why wouldn&#39;t you get the grades to go to West Point or Annapolis and become an officer?  Oh right, because the jewish and asian kids who like the military are out-competing you for those slots.</p>

<p>Gentiles don&#39;t fight the wars, the dummies do.  The army doesn&#39;t put its top minds in the infantry as enlisted men.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot going on with Judaism, Jews, and Israel (three separate concepts, although there are some topics on which they converge). Bear with me on this.</p>

<p>1) <strong>The state of Israel</strong> is largely secular, &quot;ethnic&quot; Jewish rather than spiritually Jewish.</p>

<p>2) But the state of Israel harbours <strong>the Jewish theocracy.</strong> The theocracy is (predictably) obsessed with the prophets of the Old Testament/Torah, because Judaism still awaits the Messiah Emmanuel.</p>

<p>The theocracy stirs up panic and paranoia among <strong>the diaspora Jews</strong> scattered throughout the world, because the theocracy wants them to emigrate to Israel. The Jewish people being assembled in their ancestral homeland is a key part of Jewish eschatology (&quot;end-of-the-world-ology&quot;).</p>

<p>The state of Israel likes to keep its people on a war footing, because of the state of Israel&#39;s creeping occupation of surrounding territory. Palestine is the most obvious example of this. gradual annexation.</p>

<p>So, there&#39;s a conceptual overlap between the state of Israel and the Jewish theocracy to which it is home. Your average Jew is caught in the middle of this war-and-persecution war (literal war and a war in terms of non-stop quick-fire propaganda too).</p>

<p>But at the most mundane level, most Jews don&#39;t conspire so much as help each other out. Is it really a conspiracy if a Jew chooses to shop with a Jewish shopkeeper, hires a Jewish accountant, and hires a Jewish window-cleaner? Most other ethnicities behave in analogous ways. But Jews, culturally, are very very good at this, which is precisely how diaspora Jews have survived centuries of persecution. If you like, &quot;clannish&quot; behaviour has been &quot;naturally selected&quot; (n.b., this is a metaphor, there is no genetic basis for this tendency to stick close to each other AFAIK).</p>

<p>That&#39;s about as simple as I can get it. Three separate entities, which occasionally have coinciding interests, the third of which (disapora Jewishness) isn&#39;t really a coherent entity at all and gets jostled about relentlessly by the others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fascinatingly complex, and once you perceive the three layers at work the whole enigma starts to make a bit more sense. Not much more sense, but a bit more sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your assessment. It is the globalist plan to intermix everyone. We know this from the Kalergi plan.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is, you are missing something. Africa doesn&#39;t have any significant miscegeneation. Asia too.</p>

<p>So the races respective to these continents will be safe. But whites of European descent are not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What you fail to realise though is that there cant be white genocide without other genocide too. &quot;Diluting&quot; white people also means diluting black. Meaning that eventually race wont BE as prominent, because everyones a mix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So shouldn&#39;t we care for preserving real diversity, rather than everyone just becoming a brown mumbo jumbo?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless you actually believe they are trying to kill us off in which case i cant help you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, i don&#39;t believe it&#39;s personal to whites. The globalists just want a low IQ divided population, without borders or identity.</p>

<p>Whites just happened to be in their way. Whites don&#39;t make good slaves. </p>
