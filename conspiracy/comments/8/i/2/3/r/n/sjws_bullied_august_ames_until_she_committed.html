       August Ames tweeted a warning to a colleague that the actor she was booked to work with used to do gay porn so she should be careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was immediately viciously attacked on Twitter as being homophobic, threatening her, telling people not to work with her anymore and she ended up committing suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mission accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less than a month later, there was an HIV breakout that shut the industry down for a week while everyone is retested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out, it was an actor who used to shoot gay porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is almost always an actor who used to shoot gay porn or else it was an actress who’s boyfriend shoots gay porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a fact. Facts can’t be homophobic.
      </p>
      <p>
       August Ames was right to warn her friend and she was bullied to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       SJW ideology is dangerous.

       It's an ideology that masquerades as social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a discussion of level headed individuals. They do not care about how you feel. They are demanding 100 percent compliance and nothing less.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you give in to their demands (whatever they may be in that given moment) you are kneecapping yourself and your own views.
      </p>
      <p>
       They see an apology or your forced compliance as a sign they need to keep pushing. There is no give and take.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only take. Take and destroy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The individuals that do not share their views have been frightened into silence or forced into hushed compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could be be bullied to death if you step out of line.

       Yes, this is more about power and control than social justice. This is why anyone who apologizes to SJWs gets shit on even harder. "not enough." "too little too late" etc.

       Candace Owens also had, until a few months ago, a site up that was fully functional where you could put all the personal details of someone who "bullied" you online to be looked up by anyone who wanted to know about you.  Be careful who you worship.

       This such dumbass take. Even within leftist circles there are tons of people who think identity politics isn't real and serves a distraction from the class struggle. To think that some people on tumblr control the entire left is just astoundingly ignorant on how the left actually operates.

       I would say uneducated. He's paid and bullied his way through life. It takes a different kind of intelligence than normally thought of. Maybe cunning is a better word for him. I can't stand the guy, personally, but I can see he has an amazing ability to bullshit his way through things.

       SJ is simply Marxism rebranded for the 21st century.  The goals of SJ are clearly enumerated in the Communist Manifesto.  The social justice frenzy is no different from Communist revolutionary frenzies in other countries, or even the French Revolution from which Communism sprang.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who benefits?  Immediately, the ultra-rich such as Soros who believe they have a moral obligation to bring about social change (or maybe they are just greedy fucks).  But in the end, the guillotines will sing for their blood as as well because communism can have no other end.
      </p>

       Communism is the entropy to our civilization's negentropic.  It is a nihilistic philosophy which achieved only the equality of the grave.   This is social justice.

       Leftists are actually extremely divided on concept of class struggle and identity politics, and the most visceral, intense, and yes, hatefilled discussion on the left is usually authoritarian communists fighting against what you folks would refer to as SJW's. I'd recommend watching
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas">
        this video
       </a>
       as it gives pretty explanation of intra-left divisions.

       Generally I agree with you except that SJWs are largely authoritarian as well.  There is a lot of interfactional dispute among the left and sometimes it gets violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your last question, it is because MOST communists believe in some sort of administrative bureau to allocate resources, guide work, and defend the Communist experiment against internal and external threats.  This is a State, regardless of what they call it.  Any State, regardless of its claimed ideological principles, is by default (and must be) a bourgeoisie class.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem here is that a Communist administrative bureau has no limits.  No checks and balances.  No boundaries.  It does not respect human rights.  Why would it?  You need to allocate the basic needs of humans and direct their work, and all those messy "checks and balances" really get in the way of efficient and effective administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you get is a new bourgeoisie with totally unlimited power.  The people running it have an unlimited capacity to gain personal wealth, and they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people actually understood Marxism, they would understand that in fact it is a prescription for anarchy.  However, most communists do not understand this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, Mussolini was a militant socialist before he became a socialist.  If you read his writings, the idea that birthed modern fascism was that the best way to achieve socialism is to throw out the class warfare stuff and just use government.  If you understand this, then it becomes clear that authoritarian communists are really just fascists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual communism eliminates the State and is therefore not fascism.  But there aren't many anarcho-communists out there.

       They were threatening her livelihood. Telling producers to not book her and agents to not promote her. That’s how a lot of the industry works. You can effectively get black listed over SJW offenses.
      </p>

       And the producers or the agencies may believe that you didn’t do anything wrong but they run the risk of getting attacked for representing her or booking her.

       Yeah no, it wasn't going to seriously hurt her career. All that mattered was whether dudes would have continued paying to watch her fuck and there's like no overlap between those dudes and the losers who were bullying her on Twitter. She had mental health issues is all. Also your submission statement is flimsy as fuck. It's clear there's no conspiracy here and you just wanted to take a shot at SJWs.

       I think the connection is retarded but he's absolutely right about SJWs. Only a fucking idiot would think SJWs aren't dangerous as fuck. What people said was just "internet nonsense" a couple of years ago is full blown in people's real lives now. And it propagates militantly and by virue signaling. People literally want you to suffer and die due to political opinions.

       Sounds more like the porn company needed more regulations in check to make sure their actors got frequent STI screenings. This could of happened with a straight actor too, this is just some shit attempt to "red pill" short sighted people.

       Statistics show that homosexuals are at MUCH higher risk of HIV infection. Not only that, you need to look into POZ culture in California, you know, where the majority of porn is filmed.

       Oh I'm well aware that homosexuals have a higher risk of infection. So just because it's more likely that the performer was gay you are gonna take that as a fact and make up a conspiracy? I think we all know who's really ignorant here.

       What? There's several if you took a few seconds to actually look instead of trying to be snarky. Honestly, posts and people like you get old, coming in acting like they know anything. When you show such snark you prove to everyone that you wish you knew more, don't be afraid to ask others that just may know better than you.

       Not sure why you got the downvotes, but yes, I totally see that.  In the US too.  NPR/PBS does the same thing, although they pull a "long con" for smarter people, more through omission of parts of stories (or of entire stories) rather than the shock method that CNN does.  It's because people who wish to control others are attracted to the apparatus that allows for control of the narrative/control of others: ergo: the "news" and government/teaching.   Exciting times.  I somewhat expect the urgency of power-grabbing to increase.  Check out "fate of empires" (pdf) by Sir John Glub.

       I'm sorry I was just a bit angry, everyone on this fucking sub is turning everything into a bi partisan argument which is exactly why the people in power ever put it into place. You need to look outside of that paradigm, our government is trying to fuck us no matter who is wearing the strap on. I tend to agree with Democrats more often these days because they are not as caustic/racist but both sides are fucking dumb.

       I tend to see the democrats as more racist but I think this speaks to your point about everything being a bipartisan argument. To me if you want to require higher test scores from Asians and let minorities have preferential treatment you are being racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I bet if we sat down and really talked it over we'd find that we agree on far more than we disagree. This is why divide and conquer is so powerful. You make enemies of people with common interests.

       This shit is turned into r/conservative so much. Like they’re connecting SJW with Soros and then that’s it. It’s a conspiracy because SJWs are from Soros and this involves SJWs, so according to them it belongs here. Literally anything can get tied to some conspiracy if you try hard enough. This post serves zero purpose for what this sub is actually about and is purely a political post bashing SJWs. Even if SJWs were created by Soros or whatever, what purpose does this post serve? It’s literally here so you conservatives can jerk each other off posting long winded bashed against a group you hate.

       Oi, mate... I can definitely see your point of view, and agree with you; but on the other hand, the sub or category of "conspiracy" can encompass pretty much anything.  So I also think its fair game to talk about the conscious/unconscious "conspiracy" of SJW's that wish to control the behavior of others.   I just wanted to both validate and temper your opinion.

       SJW mentality serves TPTB, in one aspect, by demonizing masculinity and having a non-zero effect on reduction of males that would potentially resist complete removal of individual rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also adds to the stream of gender-confused and emotionally distressed humans who will seek the comfort of Big Pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       SJW movement is certainly conspiracy related.

       I mean I disagree, despite the fact that people like Soros may have helped start them.  I think things like MeToo and similar "SJW" stuff took off and got popular because they're responses to the long-established sexism/racism/whatever that's present in like every industry in America.  They're certainly not perfect "movements" and have their extreme members that blindly white-knight every single thing possible, such as the August Ames situation, but I think at its core much of it is a direct counter to a lot of the institutionalized prejudices that have been going on forever.  That said, things like the August Ames situation show how people take it way too far, which happens for everything.  I really don't think SJW stuff is meant to neuter men, but some members demonize essentially just being a white male so I can see where that perspective comes from.

       is that it's become a center hub in a right wing conspiracy that seemingly reaches all the way from Moscow to the White House.

      <p>
       There's literally paid propagandists, bots, and white supremacists, roaming around Reddit trying to secretly push a narrative that is meant to divided straight white males from other groups and encourage oppression of these other groups, in the goal of supporting the Republican Party as well as Vladimir Putin, and yet people on this sub who claim to be "woke" completely fall for it.

       Thanks for proving that you fell to DNC propaganda! Just a tip, some of us are intelligent enough to realize that the GOP
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the DNC are
       <em>
        both

       corrupt. 😂

      <p>
       Problem is, the government and societal leaders have only really been pushing leftwing rhetoric. The fact that we want it to stop doesn't mean we have
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       trust in the GOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming in here talking about being "woke" then defaulting to day 1 SJW rhetoric was extremely sloppy. You may have had more luck if you didn't repeat mainstream media buzzwords. 😉

       So you can stop reposting the same comment that there’s no source. It happened. I witnessed first hand. They were shut down for a week. Everyone retested. I haven’t really searched the industry sites so I don’t know if it was reported. Week and a half to two weeks ago.

       Anti-SJW hysteria is the real conspiracy. Find a couple of tweets or screenshots from tumblr from some looney and act like its a huge problem. This cancer has infested right wing circles because its low hanging fruit and an easy way to set up strawmen against people who disagree with you.

       No he didn't the only fact in it is that she killed herself and that some losers bullied her on twitter. Google search shows nothing about the industry getting shut down because of aids being spread through an actor that stars in gay porn.

       being an sjw is promoted in the msm and is wrong to be against. Considering it's a fucked up way of thinking being promoted as "right" I'd say it's a conspiracy. Anyone who is a sjw or promotes that toxic behavior is a bad human being.

       That link doesn't talk about the "HIV outbreak" following her death. Where's that source?
      </p>
      <p>
       It does say any actor would have had to pass STI screenings. Are you saying the male actor in question was positive and still passed?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it highly unlikely that a positive star would not be on meds and have undetectable status. No transmission has ever been documented from an undetectable status patient to a negative partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how and when did this "outbreak" occur?

       A potential outbreak is very, very different than an actual outbreak, which is the claim made by OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's highly unlikely that this person was not put on treatment as soon as they tested positive, especially if they were going to continue working. Most on treatment are undetectable, which means the odds of transmission are so low that in years of study it hasn't happened yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you suppose the likelihood is that an adult film star would know they are positive, decline treatment, continue working without disclosing, then infect several others who would also decline treatment and continue working?

       Could be but this incident isn’t isolated.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few weeks back there was a false rape allegation that fired everyone up. The #metoo crowd jumped in early to automatically believe the actress claiming she was raped until the producer released the full unedited video showing the girl was told 3x what the scene involved on camera and she agreed and then the entire shoot showing she was playful, laughing and flirting and fully participating in the shoot.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it didn’t stop the SJW from demanding that the producer be banned from the industry and the actor accused of rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Producers are now adding security cameras to film the shoots because false allegations are becoming a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or a Twitter joke was made that Elon Musk hid a dead hooker in the trunk of the car he sent to space that turned into an outrage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or another joke that MILFs are annoying that a 22 year old actress with no kids got offended over on behalf of MILFs everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s getting ridiculous.

       Have connections to the adult industry.  I agree.  The whole SJW ideology has been slowly creeping into the porn industry and you can see it all the time in tweets some of the newer, full SJW performers, put out.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're doing more damage to their own industry and fans than they realize.  But I don't think this is a conspiracy.  I think this is the product of SJW indoctrination in the American education system.  These girls are pretty much hardcore SJWs by the time they leave high school/go to college/worship celebrities and media and then they come to the porn industry and try to push the ideology they've been indoctrinated into onto the industry without realizing the damage they're doing to producers and fans, aka their source of income.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can be SJW all they like as civilians, but they're having a hard time understanding that they are in the sex industry to begin with and need to understand when and where being SJW makes sense and where it doesn't apply/causes more harm than good.

       I don't think the article actually mentioned anything about that. It's pretty easy to find if you search for HIV outbreak in porn industry. Don't want to link it here because it's a fucking dailymail article.

       And there are tons here who just get a rush out of taking the piss on SJWs the same way most of reddit will shit on Trump or how the trump supporters will shit on the left. It's the same shit on every side. No one cares about what's true.

       Do you know how incredibly hard it is to break into the industry as a male actor without starting in gay porn?  There's no way that ratio close to even, and warning that someone you're planning to work with came up that way isn't much of a warning.

       I don't disagree with your point about trying to force gray issues to be black and white, but the story starts in a bad place.  There had to be some other reason she suspected he was infected, it's not like they don't test gay porn actors too...

       There seems to be confusion regarding testing.  It alone does nothing to viruses.  Medical experts recommend a test after possible exposure and a follow up test months later, but that assumes no more possible exposures.  If a guy is promiscuous with guys and girls he can spread the virus to multiple people before failing a test.  Fake identities are common in the porn world and shoots can take place all over the world with no testing or regulation whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another factor not discussed in polite company is the rise in acts once rejected as gross and dangerous.  You've got multiple guys taking turns on a woman's anus and rectum.  This is really high risk behavior.

       you're aware that shooting gay porn doesn't mean you have contracted HIV, there's plenty of gay and bi people around and a minuscule percentage have HIV.
      </p>
      <p>
       why would someone be concerned that someone they are sleeping with has had a same sex experience?
      </p>
      <p>
       are you concerned when you get with a new partner that they may have slept with someone that may at some point have had same sex relations?

       do you warn your friends when they meet a girl that the girl could be carrying HIV or some other STD? if not why not? or do you keep your spreading of lies purely for those that have had same sex encounters?
      </p>
      <p>
       how is it not homophobic to spread around that someone should be concerned where the implication is that they have HIV just because they have partaken in homosexual acts? do you have gonorrhoea, Chlamydia or hepatitis just because you've slept with someone?

       August Ames wasn't tarring anyone. She was warning a coworker about the potential risk of contracting HIV

        which is a potential death sentence.

       Cool, thanks. Fair warning, not that this is news to you probably, but putting in the work to just have this in the bulk of your original post would have probably saved you a few dozen repetitive comments. And keep in mind that there's still no evidence this noted to be "potential" case by your own link is even connected to the person Ames was talking about, in which case, there's no there there.

       Not trying to start a fight, but honestly, any of the "everyones" you mentioned (myself included) would probably say that it's up to the accuser to provide the necessary evidence - that's on you. Being asked to prove a negative over a positive isn't very popular in this sub.

       Is everyone here totally unaware of the HIV/AIDS hoax threads that have been getting posted once every month on this sub for the past 10 years- containing several videos, official lab documents, and interviews (dozens of professors, one of which is a chemistry nobel winner who invented PCR testing- Kary Mullis, and the other is the lead virologist Peter Duesberg), all of which state that it's just a fear-inducing scam?

       Not trying to start a fight, but honestly, any of the "everyones" you mentioned (myself included) would probably say that it's up to the accuser to provide the necessary evidence - that's on you. Being asked to prove a negative over a positive isn't very popular in this sub.

       And like I said you can't warm that so robe may have HIV, it's a baseless accusation and slanderous.

       So, is it OK for me to spread around that you're a pedophile? I have no evidence that you are, but you might be because at some point you've been around children, it's only right that people you come in to contact with you are aware if the risk you pose to their kids.

       Even if ONE was HIV positive it's very much a potential outbreak considering the volume of unprotected sex involved.

       A potential outbreak is very, very different than an actual outbreak, which is the claim made by OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's highly unlikely that this person was not put on treatment as soon as they tested positive, especially if they were going to continue working. Most on treatment are undetectable, which means the odds of transmission are so low that in years of study it hasn't happened yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you suppose the likelihood is that an adult film star would know they are positive, decline treatment, continue working without disclosing, then infect several others who would also decline treatment and continue working?
