       That really depends. A dictatorship isn't so bad either if it's a good dictator. Democracy isn't so bad if the people are selfless and educated.

       "Conspiracy" doesn't mean "not true". Conspiracies are real. People really do conspire with other people to do harmful or illegal things. This community is about discussing those people and their secret plans. Due to them being secret, we might not know all of the facts, but that doesn't mean that the things we discuss aren't actually true. There's even a convenient

       I find genealogical conspiracy theories interesting, partly because as a genealogist part of me feels skeptical of some of the validity (for example the conspiracy that all of the U.S. presidents except for Martin Van Buren are descended from medieval English royalty) because of what I know about genealogy, in this case, if you can trace your roots back just far enough you can enter something I've heard called the "royal channel," where even people without power or influence turn out to have royal ancestors, although some people's royal ancestry is obviously more recent than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I've also heard now of the RH negative blood type aspect of the theory and I find that really interesting. Since so many people have medieval royal ancestors and don't know about it, I am less compelled to give weight to that part of the theories, but I don't know what to do with the blood type aspect because that is a rarer situation.

       There seems to be a higher occurance than the norm of rh negative blood among U.S. presidents and the British royal family, some people point to it as an indication of a bloodline connection between the presidents and the royals.

       There were many Civilizations before the Great Deluge, and one could say far more advanced than us now (humans are millions of years old - you've been on this ride before, in one form or another).
      </p>
      <p>
       They were wiped out (for the most part), and now, a surviving dark priest class took the reigns of power, and they rule to this day via the Black Nobility, Jesuits, Sovereign Military Order of Malta, and the Vatican (to name a few known). Tri-Sovereign States. All Roads truly lead back to Sumeria (in this "Age" - at least).

       Was looking into this the other day. The floods after the Younger dryas 11,000 years ago are in so many cultures. I’m certain there were advanced civilisations before hand, but why cover it up ? That city underwater in Egypt is clearly there, yet people just accept water levels rise. But no one seems to see the obvious. It rose 11.000 years ago. Not after, so clearly that was there before hand.

       I've never actually watched that movie, but that's just because I guessed that it was dramatized bullshit. What's their explanation on the assassination? Do they touch on the CIA at all or do they try to say Oswald used magic bullets or something?

       It hinges everything on it being a CIA/Cuban conspiracy, unfortunately for theorists there is as much reliable evidence in the movie as there is in my right shoe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the biggest highlights of what is made up for the movie:
      </p>
      <p>
       The way they portray David Ferrie (played really well by Joe Pesci) is a complete fabrication that would, in all likelyhood, have gotten Stone and the company sued for libel because it's that wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       X (Donald Sutherland in another good showing) is completely made up for the film, based on a colonel who worked on the movie. Garrison never met an 'X' and he is based on a fictional account that people thought was true, but was revealed as a hoax in '72.
      </p>
      <p>
       Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon, yet again another strong performance) is also completely made up. Based on another witness who didn't know anything until he was hypnotised while under the influence of sodium pentaphol and barbiturates, which is the best way to get a lead if you're short on evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people get swept up in it because it's acted well and is convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong - it's a great movie and I highly recommend it. But leave it as that, a movie that entertains and creates a provoking narrative.

       Well I saw nothing. But it’s too far fetched stuff even for this sub. What it was, I have no idea but suffice to say someone who worked for the police and fire services in “an alternative role” told me to get the hell out of there.

       I really don’t want to go into the story. I don’t know what to make of it myself and I was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say that I was helped by a women who worked for the police and fire services. She worked with ley lines. Apparently they go “live”. Create negative vibes and cause certain areas to have more fires, more suicide and more murders than other places. They services take it quite seriously apparently. For instance Las Vegas police out more patrols out on a full moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my part, I can only rely on what I was told I couldn’t see. But I can say what I experienced was quite scary, even though I saw nothing.  But I was left drained in every sense.

       I’m with you on this one. It’s intriguing because average Joe’s like us have no way of proving it either way, and yet it would be massively important if it were a hoax. If history is largely fake then what is there that is true?

       I purchased a German bible made in 1632. I don't know if that's old enough for you but I can certainly page through it anytime I want and it is pretty damn authentic. To the point where when I acquired it I posted about it on different places to ask people how to properly care for it and book experts lost their shit when they saw the pages I took pictures of and other details I shared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I didn't know what I bought was so rare. I just thought it was really cool. The Smithsonian Institute asked if they could scan it and the German Federal Archives offered to purchase it from me because the edition I had has about 30 known copies in existence.

       I believe it is a Luther bible because one rare book merchant told me that part of what made this edition special is there was a lot of different wars going on in the Holy Roman Empire at that time. The Kingdom of Germany being the biggest seat of power at the time. He had said that because of the wars things we find common now, like books, were only for the rich then and even then during times of war luxuries weren't made in mass because people were focused on bread and war so not many were made. He also pointed to the different pages that reference Martin Luther.

       I had it independently verified. I bought it as a Christmas gift for a dear friend who is religious. I posted on whether I should buy cotton gloves or page turners and such for them to page through it. After posting I received an overwhemling response... more than anything I've nearly gotten before. It just spread... book collectors, buyers, antique dealers all jumped on me when it went viral because I didn't really understand that I had purchased something so rare and valuable. You might have noticed I used the words "the edition I
       <strong>
        had
       </strong>
       " above because I had a real struggle after buying it and learning of its value. In spirit I bought it as a Christmas gift but I couldn't believe how much it was worth so I had a real moral struggle on what to do with it. I decided the right thing to do was to gift it to my friend anyway because that was my true intention and I knew I would feel guilty if I kept it for my own personal profit or gain. This was a four years ago but if you are interested I posted pictures a lot of places as I was seeking advice and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1uou63/purchased_340_year_old_book_unsure_of_how_to/cekb3xp/">
        here are some I put on Reddit

       Thanks, I really love it. I wish I could have kept it for myself but I just felt it wouldn't be right since I bought it as a gift and I had no idea about its true value.

       Almost everytime I go visit my friend I ask her if she'll pull it out for me to look at again and she is always so pleased to do so. She keeps it in a special box to keep the moisture out and I carefully pull it out and page through it looking at all the different illustrated pages.

       I really don't feel like going back 4 years to find some shit for some random dude on reddit who thinks I'm making shit up. Fine... think I made it all up. I really don't a shit. I bought a cool bible for some friends, I gave it to them and it was all an awesome experience. If that's not enough for you go read some flat earth shit.

       That is intentionally misleading. Yes it may have been initially found then (at a time where archaeology was getting a large amount of funding) but more is still discovered.

       Well it’s funny beacuse the Egyptian government won’t allow anyone to excavate more. Which might have something with the fact that the interpretation of the artifacts we do have is not open to question - even in the face of the mountains of questions we still have.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you talk about history not being based on orginal sources, that is typically referring to medievil European history. Church documents are almost always based on second hand accounts even though they appear old and orginal. European history is basically heresay.
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of thing has no archealogical record so that’s almost completely irrelevant. We’re talking about historical events which have nothing to do with Egyptian papyrus.

       I am. As far as I am concerned, the bible is a hoax, one probably devised around 1850. Look up the story about how they 'discovered' the Codex Sinaiticus. Amusing stuff.

       I agree. I have found that those who do not put forth the effort to seek truth don't care. Particularly people I will try to drop truth bombs on offline will respond," oh that's weird" and continue on as if a paradigm shift shouldn't have just occurred with their world view.

       I guess the thing I've been stuck on most lately is the fact that the issue of mass incarceration in the USA was deliberately manufactured to profit by manufacturing slaves. The thirteenth amendment that ended slavery actually made an exception for convicted criminals. We still have slaves, we just call them "prisoners with jobs". We have so many prisoners today, more per capita than other similar nations, and a key contributor for that is the profit motive around the prison industry and the slave labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of this, we also know that the "war on drugs" was created specifically to target racial minorities and political dissidents, a member of the Nixon administration who was involved admitted it. The goal was to vilify them in the media and destroy their communities. So they target Black people for discrimination, make them political prisoners, willfully destroy their lives, AND ALSO enslave them for profit.

       Well South America moving 1300 miles to the east for many people is one. It’s one of those things that when you see it it hits you.

       But no data available. Because history simply changes, and the data with history changes with it as it it always was there. You won’t have heard of ribbon seals. Yet the data is there for them now. It’s unlikely you’ll have heard of rainbow trees yet they are there. Or the Great Wall of India yet we know who built them now.

       For many of us on the Mandela effect forum we are harassed and shilled like crazy. Far more than here and many new outlets. Search engines etc cover it up so that it is now a funny interesting side show rather than what it is. Ie history inexplicably changes.  Even the laws of physics can change. It’s quite a thing.

       It hasn’t effected who did it and why. It effected the LBJ interview when he mentioned a conspiracy. He now mentions foreign powers where as he didn’t before. (Haven’t checked recently so not sure if it’s changed again).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find interesting is that it’s effected the shot to the head bit not the outcome of that shot. Before you could see more matter on the trunk of the car. And now it looks strange that the cop was covered in matter. Before the shot was obvious how the cop got covered.

       Alternative history.
       <br/>
       The current scientific consensus is that homo sapiens (humans anatomically identical to modern humans) emerged about 300,000 years ago, were hunter gatherers for about 290,000 of those years, and then decided about 8-10,000 years ago (and those are recent date revisions) decided to create civilization. The alternative history theory poses that civilization has risen and fallen potentially multiple times between the emergence of homo sapien 300,000 years ago and the earliest records of human civilization currently accepted 8-10,000 years ago. It suggests that Atlantis was a real place, much of what we consider "mythology" actually occurred etc. And more recently proposes ideas like phantom time theory (that the church added ~1000 years to the Georgian calender to legitimise Christianity).

       For me it would be all the conspiracies about the Bohemian Grove.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been a guest there multiple times and gone all around the place. I even went inside the famous owl. It’s all just stage equipment like a soundboard and lighting shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely see where the conspiracies come from because it is a highly elite club. Only thing is the whole idea of the place is to get away from everything. A place where men can be men, get drunk, and talk without worrying about who hears it because that’s a rule of being a member.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also interesting side note, women are allowed but can’t spend the night and have to leave by 9pm.

       The Port Arthur massacre and how it was used to disarm the nation. There's some amazing info out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hobart to Port Arthur is about 10 minutes by helicopter. It took 6 hours for a response team.
      </p>
      <p>
       The local police were called away investigating some white powder as it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who were murdered mostly hopped off a ferry tour and were in the gift shop when they were killed. It turns out there was a bus load of American tourists who were meant to be on that exact ferry but their bus was delayed and they missed their booking, meaning they'd have to go on the next one so they weren't killed. President Clinton was in Australia at the exact time and was scheduled to discuss gun crime etc with the Australian's.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so much and so many problems with the official version that I struggle. Again, it takes me about an hour to drive in a big, slow camper van from Hobart to the shooting site. A police squad could probably drive it in half that, maybe more? A helicopter about 10 minutes. It took them SIX hours to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite the rabbit hole

       The theory that the agency/NSA teamed up to create bitcoin. The basic nuts and bolts of the theory is the ultimate goal is to push everyone to paperless transactions, IE remove fiat currency for greater control over the populous; tax issues and surveillance purposes.

       Almost everytime I go visit my friend I ask her if she'll pull it out for me to look at again and she is always so pleased to do so. She keeps it in a special box to keep the moisture out and I carefully pull it out and page through it looking at all the different illustrated pages.
