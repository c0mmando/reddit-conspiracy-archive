I thought it was already common knowledge that it was there but it kept giving out bits of how this place was an inspiration to a lot of movies and it had &quot;very real secrets&quot; and all that. Anyone know anything about this? </p>

My only take is that, technology didn&#39;t come so fast until that Rosewell incident. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was definitely more notorious in the 90s. Mainly because the government refused to acknowledge its existence. </p>

<p>It gets really interesting as the government was behind a lot of the conspiracy theories. I don&#39;t remember what it was called but there was a documentary with a ex-air force guy who&#39;s job was disinformation. He talks about &#39;leaking&#39; info to these popular conspiracy nuts. </p>

<p>Initially when the public became aware of the base the military was worried. Then some articles came out talking about aliens. They did everything they could to push the aliens narrative. If it was aliens it wasn&#39;t secret research. It also discredited any accurate information UFO people may have. </p>

<p>This gets really interesting when you consider the air force recently began acknowledging UFOs are real. You probably saw one of the news clips of the fighter jet trailing a UFO. Odds are that UFO is USAF aircraft they don&#39;t want to be associated with. We&#39;re supposed to believe SR-71 was the best thing to come out of Area 51. Yet they&#39;ve been working on spaceplanes and next generation stealth tech since the 80s. </p>

<p>One tech that got minor publicity was aerospace metals that changes with magnetic fields. So you could in theory make micro surface changes to alter the boundary layer effect as well as electromagnetic signals reflecting from the surface. This would be something I&#39;d imagine is on that new &#39;UFO&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lived in Vegas in &#39;70-72. Dad sold many cars to pilots who flew workers out there for week long stays. Never reallywas a &quot;secret&quot;, everybody in Las Vegas (1 million maybe)  knew it existed. Still is being used. In fact the government aquired land rights a few years ago past the ridge tops so people cannot even observe the lake bed anymore. That means its been undr constant construction for at least 50 years. I would imagine you can build one hell of an underground research facility in 50 years witha blank government checkbook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it did.</p>

<p>Though it was known about much earlier than the 90&#39;s. </p>

<p>Growing up I had a book that was printed in the 70&#39;s that talked about Area 51. It had an photo of the place that was taken from the air.</p>

<p>Though it had not developed the same mythology it has today. There were rumors and allegations but Lazar and Lear kind of kicked of the modern day stories. When they were able to film hovering craft over the base at night. </p>

<p>There is still a lot of strangeness surrounding the base. People say that it&#39;s no longer holding the most important research. Just concider that they keep increasing the area size and I <em>think</em> they extended the airstrip by a lot a few years ago.</p>
