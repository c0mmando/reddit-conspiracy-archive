Not defending people just because they have an R or a D next to their name. Trump&#39;s had both.

<p>Sorry that I bring these arguments to this sub, but I&#39;ve been banned from T_D and politics is a circle jerk. I&#39;ve actually had good discussions here and I don&#39;t see how these posts bother people. You don&#39;t like it? Scroll to the next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Msm, media at large. Not this sub sure, because the suggestion that one man runs the show is ridiculous. 
However its sort of playing on America&#39;s image of being a powerful country and to run It is to be the most powerful man in the world. 
I&#39;m irish, i dont come from America, and i certainly dont think trump, obama, bush or any of them have ever been the most powerful men in the world, these days its almost satirical to say as most people realise they hold little power overall. 
Not ignorance man, just MsM buzzwords. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>your argument here would be sound <em>if</em> this were merely a politics only sub. That is in fact not the case. If the issue presented by a user does not serve as legitimate possible grounds for conspiracy, then it does not belong in <em>this</em> sub.

<p>Yawn...get over yourself. From how you keep mouthing off about commenters wanting censorship just because <em>you haven&#39;t seem them on this sub</em>, maybe you should start another sub and gather all your buddies that you <em>have</em> seen so you can all have a circle jerk.</p>

<p>Every forum has guidelines. If someone posted about gardening on this sub the post would be removed. That&#39;s not censorship. Perhaps suggest something constructive that would actually help this sub from being inundated by political news rather than conspiracies. </p>

<p>the serial killer thing was just in response to this, to say I&#39;m not out here supporting war <em>or serial killers</em> just as a little extra flair</p>

<p>Also I would fully support some more conversation around the stock to figure that all out but the posts I cited are just bitching about politics, nothing more</p>

<p>Also I looked up lockheed and marting <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lockheed+martin+stock&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHZL_enUS730US730&amp;amp;oq=lockhe&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.2281j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">stock</a> for the year and it seems to have been steady climbing and then dropped back down and then went back up and then dropped down and is now went up a little.</p>

<p>It seems under Trump in general they&#39;ve climbed but recently they fallen, unless you are only looking 2 weeks back to now</p>

<p> FOREIGN POLICY</p>

<p>Issued on: May 8, 2018</p>

<p>￼ALL NEWS</p>

<p>Diplomatic Reception Room
2:13 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  My fellow Americans:  Today, I want to update the world on our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror.  It exports dangerous missiles, fuels conflicts across the Middle East, and supports terrorist proxies and militias such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al Qaeda.
Over the years, Iran and its proxies have bombed American embassies and military installations, murdered hundreds of American servicemembers, and kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured American citizens.  The Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people.
No action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them.
In 2015, the previous administration joined with other nations in a deal regarding Iran’s nuclear program.  This agreement was known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.
In theory, the so-called “Iran deal” was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime.  In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout.
The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regime’s nuclear activity, and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world.
In other words, at the point when the United States had maximum leverage, this disastrous deal gave this regime — and it’s a regime of great terror — many billions of dollars, some of it in actual cash — a great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States.
A constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time, but it wasn’t.  At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.
Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie.  Last week, Israel published intelligence documents long concealed by Iran, conclusively showing the Iranian regime and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons.
The fact is this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.  It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.
In the years since the deal was reached, Iran’s military budget has grown by almost 40 percent, while its economy is doing very badly.  After the sanctions were lifted, the dictatorship used its new funds to build nuclear-capable missiles, support terrorism, and cause havoc throughout the Middle East and beyond.
The agreement was so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.  The deal’s sunset provisions are totally unacceptable.  If I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.  Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs.
Making matters worse, the deal’s inspection provisions lack adequate mechanisms to prevent, detect, and punish cheating, and don’t even have the unqualified right to inspect many important locations, including military facilities.
Not only does the deal fail to halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but it also fails to address the regime’s development of ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads.
Finally, the deal does nothing to constrain Iran’s destabilizing activities, including its support for terrorism.  Since the agreement, Iran’s bloody ambitions have grown only more brazen.
In light of these glaring flaws, I announced last October that the Iran deal must either be renegotiated or terminated.
Three months later, on January 12th, I repeated these conditions.  I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement.
Over the past few months, we have engaged extensively with our allies and partners around the world, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.  We have also consulted with our friends from across the Middle East.  We are unified in our understanding of the threat and in our conviction that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon.
After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.
The Iran deal is defective at its core.  If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen.  In just a short period of time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.
Therefore, I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum to begin reinstating U.S. nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime.  We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction.  Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.
America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail.  We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.  And we will not allow a regime that chants “Death to America” to gain access to the most deadly weapons on Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The money that we send Iran every year is to &quot;continue&quot; allowing the Iranian deep state to &quot;continue &quot; building nuclear facilities.(That is how the Iran is deal is connected to the bombed arsenal-) answer your specific question You need money to make nuclear bombs. The military and Trump are taking that money away from the Iran deal.  Iran doesn&#39;t get any more money from us by Trump breaking up the deal Hussein made. Therefore, they cannot set up shop in their country or any other country to make more nuclear facilities because they will have no money to build them. Got it?. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t comment here frequently, although I read at least a few threads per day on purpose.</p>

<p>When I do comment, it&#39;s mostly to try to combat naked anti-Semitism that has little to do with the topic at hand (although that seems to have gotten better of late).</p>

<p>Otherwise it&#39;s when I have a specific piece of information to share or someone seems to be particularly off point.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that there are shills for various ideologies and viewpoints/governments here. I do doubt that they&#39;re nearly as frequent as accused, though, and that works into government-sponsored disinformation--if you inject just enough vitriol/disinformation, it starts a cycle that catches &#39;regular&#39; users and that feeds itself.</p>

<p>Also inb4 the &quot;criticism of Israel isn&#39;t antisemitism&quot; comments. Of course criticizing Israel isnt inherently antisemitic but when the &quot;critics&quot; are invoking the Protocols of the Elders of Zionism, supporting folks calling for the final solution (Pattrick Little), asking about &quot;the Jewish Question&quot;, and advocating genocide, it becomes hard to believe their criticisms of Israel are legitimate critiques and not just cover for their bigotry.</p>

<p>Good thing there&#39;s rules against such hate speech.</p>

<p>Oh wait, the hate is allowed you say? </p>

<p>So a propaganda platform is spreading hate and its allowed?</p>

<p>No, this has been a concerted effort to push rule breaking narratives because it, get this, protects Israel by deflecting from Bibis new push for an Iran war. </p>

<p>But wait, I thought the going theory around here was that the IDF was behind all of the pro Israel posts and downvoting the anti-Israel stuff. If the argument is also that they are behind all of the anti-Israel stuff as well, then you would have to believe that the only people talking about Israel, Jews, etc are IDF. That seems absurd at its face does it not? Were all of the folks in Charlottesville secretly working for the IDF as well? At some point this argument just becomes well...not to be rude about it...but kind of absurd.</p>

<p>Its a bit like the &quot;everyone who doesnt agree with me is a shill!&quot; argument. Unless you have some evidence to back it up, it&#39;s kind of a hard one to believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re ignoring context - Bibi speaks and the protectors  deny, deny, deny!</p>

<p>I think youre wrongly under the impression that every Israeli and every Jew is supporting Netanyahu. You realize that&#39;s not how this works right? Its a bit like believing every American supports Trump...</p>

<p>Correlation does not prove causation. For example, I have an awesome chair in my back yard, and since buying it I have not seen a <strong>single</strong> Bengal tiger in my back yard. Anyone who cant recognize the correlation between my purchase of my awesome chair, and the lack of tigers in my yard is purposely ignoring it.</p>

In the meantime Hillary tripped over a small step and that is massivly upvoted and has hundreds of comments.</p>

<p>Trump being tricked by the Israelis into back out of a deal which kept a country from creating nuclear weapons and then there is a coincidental bump to the stocks of oil and defense companies the same day he pulls out of the deal? Yea that is a fucking conspiracy. </p>

<p>That isnt even to mention trump&#39;s sketchy &quot;fixer&quot; lawyer taking $200,000 from AT&amp;T for &quot;Administration insights&quot; which is awfully coincidental when you consider that their proposed merger with Time Warner is undergoing anti trust review by a federal judge in that time. </p>
