       The guy either means well, or he's a charlatan. He got a pretty good following with his "Zeitgeist" movement, but in hindsight, it just seemed like some new-agey nonsense, repackaged as a futuristic, "scientific" utopia combine with a sort of neo-marxism.

       The Zeigeist took a massive shit on Christianity, but in actuality their proof was hardly proof, rather than rhetoric. There's plenty of evidence that Jesus existed, and the teachings he taught have more to do with Enlightenment, Mystical Awakening, and Ego death than it does with being imprisoned by a religion

       Christianity, like pretty much every religion on Earth, is a system of enslavement.  This is the case whether Jesus is a fictional figure or not.  The evidence for this is so overwhelming that anyone who doesn't know this is the case is simply ignorant - willfully or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is a global force controlling human enslavement on planet Earth, and many are still as a result stuck under the delusion and enslavement of religion, there is quite a lot of information available still relating to this truth (for those who are willing to look for it).

       Wrong. If you look at the esoteric core mystical teachings, it is about Enlightenment and freedom from the system and from religions. The same fuckers that killed Jesus, took over Christianity and turned into a Bureaucratic Hierarchy of systematic enslavement via watered down dogmatism.

       Cool, you linked Bramley which I read. I certainly do think Aliens are legit and there are false gods and earth is prison of the soul, but that hardly takes away from the existence and teaching of Enlightened Beings.

       Translation:  What Christianity
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have initially begun as WAYYYY BACK IN THE DAY
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       have had a core of real truth in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are being ignorant (willfully or otherwise - as I said above) of the extent to which that initial germ of possible validity Christianity might have begun with got utterly undermined and destroyed.  In other words, these “esoteric core mystical teachings” you speak of are A) available absolutely independent of anything Christianity offers (i.e. one can get all of those teachings and more elsewhere), and B) the information Christianity has in it of those “core esoteric values” is so obscurely hidden in a monstrous nest of confusing fables at this point that, again, one would be
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       better suited to find their truth elsewhere in some other manner where one doesn’t have to dig through all manner of confusing and often undermining loopholes and dead ends to get it.

      <p>
       There are actually a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of very intelligent scholars that put forth quite valid reasoning in questioning the validity of that figure’s existence…so I don’t know where you’re getting your information from.

      <p>
       Correct.  That’s part of the very point of the link I provided.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        that hardly takes away from the existence and teaching of Enlightened Beings.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Correct.  Jesus was so far from the most enlightened being on this planet that one would be far better suited to derive their life teachings elsewhere, however.  As the famed Eastern mystic philosopher Swami Vivekananda said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The greatest...[humans (gender neutralized)]…in the world have passed away unknown. The Buddhas and the Christs that we know are but second-rate heroes in comparison with the greatest...[humans]...of whom the world knows nothing. Hundreds of these unknown heroes have lived in every country working silently. Silently they live and silently they pass away; and in time their thoughts find expression in Buddhas or Christs, and it is these latter that become known to us.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Jesus is just one pebble in a beach of enlightened masters that have existed.  One, again, would be better served moving toward teachings that are not as fraught with loopholes, dead ends, and other undermining messages inserted by figures who wanted to bring the teachings down (and to a large extent greatly succeeded).

       You saw them because, as I imagine you at this point know, they actually exist.  This third dimensional perspective most of us have been limited to on this planet is but the tiniest sliver of reality; the smallest slice of what actually exists.  We live in a sea of sentient, multidimensional existences all around us.

       Christianity might not have

       as a joke, but it has most definitely been turned into one to such an extent that one would be wise to not spend too much time giving it too much credence.

       You can take one of his teachings,about Love and Loving God, just that alone practiced, produces Oneness, bliss, ego death, and awakening, and is a core tenant in many mystical branches of thought.

       Considering there are a lot of books and reports of people being mystically transformed, ego death, illumination, and awakening by following the teaching of Jesus (producing a form of soul realization and Spiritual Evolution) it most certainly is better than any religion that does not produce anything of the sort.

       Perhaps.  I would say that if this is the case, it is such because various religions are simply being left behind by people discovering truths on their own and independent of any doctrinal religious perspectives.  Western religions are therefore having to play catch up in an attempt to gather up their floundering discipleship, so I wouldn’t doubt that the ecclesiastical higher ups might be allowing some of the deeper truths hidden within the doctrinal teachings to begin allowed out.

       the deceit is discovered.  Does it hurt?  Oh hell yeah.  Of course it hurts.  Of course there’s negativity and significant hardship.  However, it is only in uncovering the deceit that you have any chance of improving, getting better, and evolving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with Christianity and the US.  It only
       <em>
        seemed
       </em>
       “better” in the past.  That’s because the citizenry were largely ignorant of the fact that it was all pretty much decrepit and corrupt.  The internet didn’t exist then, so those two corrupt systems were able to carry on their horrible deceit without having to be worried about being found out too much.
      </p>

       Nowadays, however?  More and more people are discovering not only how horrible both are, but how horrible both have

       been.

       It’s definitely hurtful and painful to find out that you’ve been living in a lie, and the transition might be really rough and ugly, but this road is ultimately the very road one must go on if they hope to improve and get better.

      <p>
       We are in a transition right now - so things seem far worse today than they were in days past.  However, be sure that it’s this transition that’s necessary to allow the species to wake up, grow up, and evolve to something better and more developed.

       I’m very familiar with this study.  In a covert and subtle way, it is basically an argument that says “You can’t be left to your own devices, humanity.  You need us [“us” being TPTB].  If you let us control you, you will live well - just like these mice did.  If you advocate and move toward more independence, however, you will be ruined.  Look at what happened to the poor little mice, after all.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting, however, how these mice, when left to their own devices in an environment not manipulated by any powerful force above them do quite well in nature.  In the case of these laboratory mice, the force above them is the experimenters.  In the case of humans (human mice), the force above them/us is TPTB above the civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       The study’s final message (ultimately flawed, but so subtle that most won’t catch it) says “trust big brother, citizen.  TRUST big brother.  You can do nothing for yourself.  You will be ruined if left to your own devices.”

        This response is an example of “moving the goal post”, as - just as my above comment explicitly stated - it’s “Christianity and the US” that was being specifically reference, not “a list of religious countries”. Additionally, you’re confusing correlation and causation, as the reasons why people move aren’t necessarily because of any country’s religion in and of itself.

       Europe, U.S., and many other countries are considered Christian and have the tenets of Christianity built into their culture/society, so most definitely there is correlation.

That has nothing to do with the fact that what you just described here can be accurately related to pretty much any Abrahamic religion, so whatever point you attempt to make about Islam, Christianity, Judaism, or whoever whatever is a trivial truth - which has been my very point from the beginning.

       Also, The comparative religion portion [1/4] of his first performance piece "Zeitgeist: the movie" (which wasnt suppose to be a movie mind you) was only there to show the absurdity of taking the bible as the real word of God, since we know, factually, that the bible has been reorganized and retranslated by no less that 12 different authors. It's a biblical, historical, archaeological, and literary fact that this has occurred. That part of the film was so widely disseminated because it butthurt all the religious people who watched it.

       Are some of the minor facts mentioned not 100% correct or perfectly accurate? Yes. Has Peter Joseph mentioned that like, a billion times? Also yes. Is every single line of dialogue in that film sourced? Yes.

       Stefan Molyneux and his buddy Mike Cernovich are both Unapologetic Zionist.   He obviously never spend time in corporate America if he thinks IQ is the biggest factor (and not favoritism and nepotism disguised as a meritocracy).

        "And then they will kill you."
       </em>
       A remarkable quote from said interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know every thought experiment that includes building a showcase city that brings to life all the five ideas Peter is talking of - for the whole world to see so that they want that, too - ends in the system of old bombing that city into the ground for some made up reason. Every plan to better the world ends in the old guard slitting your throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And their subjects sitting idly by and accepting the lie that it was just. Maybe thats a way to untie this knot - maybe approaching the subjects and making them understand that they dont have to follow the exploiters any more. Even better if you can convince people to not join/leave the military.

       For the Ottomans, sure its horrible. But the fact of the matter is, war happens, so if you call "fighting back" horrible, well then you have to rethink things perhaps.

        Same with Christianity and the US. It only seemed “better” in the past. That’s because the citizenry were largely ignorant of the fact that it was all pretty much decrepit and corrupt. The internet didn’t exist then, so those two corrupt systems were able to carry on their horrible deceit without having to be worried about being found out too much.

       Decrepit and corrupt, has always existed. Regardless, 9 times out of 10, allowing anyone to chose from a list of religious countries to live in, most people will choose those that are Christian, Buddhist, Yogi/Mystic

       It actually was better "then" in various respects. The Black neighborhoods in the 60's/70's which were Christian, had higher dual parent households and less crime. More families were together and there was less CIA/NWO meddling. Feminism was a CIA psy op, the Crack and Gnaster Rap was also a CIA psy op, and Post Modern Cultural programmers created various movements to make society more broken and degenerate

       Not sure what you're talking about here, but it definitely does hurt when people come to this sub and realize everything they have been fed via Gov, School, TV and so forth is a lie. Many often then become Nihilists and break down. This is were Mystical systems of Spiritual Paths come in and teach people transcendence, Love, Enlightenment, about beings like Christ, Buddha, and many others, and this helps to enter into a period of awakening, instead of living in this sort of black hole Nihilism where nothing is true, everything is a lie, and nothing has meaning anymore.

       Oh I agree. The Awakening will be a Spiritual/Consciousness one. I douby we will see the fruits of that in our lifetimes though. I'm sure there will still be a World War against Islam, another WW against A.I., various dark periods, colonization to other worlds, before we even come close to how we know it can be

        I’m very familiar with this study. In a covert and subtle way, it is basically an argument that says “You can’t be left to your own devices, humanity. You need us [“us” being TPTB]. If you let us control you, you will live well - just like these mice did. If you advocate and move toward more independence, however, you will be ruined. Look at what happened to the poor little mice, after all.”

       I dont think its that at all. I think its more a "this is what happens when the population gets too big with limited resources." Many aspects of which we are currently witnessing in our society.

       Not really. I've had these talks with professors and some have agreed with my take. You can boil it down to someone walking into a restaurant who sits down and gets a "Choose Your Religion" menu. You can then pick and choose the one you want based on the ingredients. And basically, Christianity hs less GMO's and MSG than the other two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I support any system that leads to awakening, love, unity, enlightenment, and illumination. Any system that doesn't do that, is a brainwashing cult that imprisons the member, including denominations of Christianity that do this as well

        You mistakenly blame human nature for the influence of an external covert element you’re simply not accounting for.

      <p>
       But you don't know. Out of all those who follow the teachings around the world, you don't know who is awakened from this method and who isn't so its a moot point. Fortunately we have from various cultures very in depth teachings about how practicing love alone can awaken the soul/illumination/enlightenment lending further credence to Jesus teachings.

        Hardly.

      <p>
       Wrong, different paths exist for different kinds of people. A rigid intellectual who does not know faith and is more scientific minded, will perhaps enjoy more a Yoga systematic approach or a buddhist one pointed concentration approach whereas someone who is more intuitive and loving will find the Jesus approach more tenable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's fine and you should be okay with this. Instead you are trying to fight against something that already is in place.

       It has done much good, but it has also done so much wrong that it would seem prudent for any intelligent people to understand that another system would likely be far, far better still than it.
