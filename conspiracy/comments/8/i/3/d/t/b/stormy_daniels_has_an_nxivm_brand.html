<p>Sounds like she’s saying the scar is photoshopped. Why wouldn’t she just say it was a surgery scar to begin with instead of initially calling out ‘photoshop’ and then waiting 3 hours to say it was from surgery. Seems strange to me....</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;ve borne / seen scars before. Cool.</p>

<p>Yes, I know people who&#39;ve had surgeries. Some scars were fucked up, some were not, some left strange patterns that you wouldn&#39;t expect due to complications or executed planning. I don&#39;t pretend to know all permutations of what scars due to what surgeries due to what complications can emerge, though, and neither should you or anyone else who doesn&#39;t have the background knowledge to provide, which is why saying something like, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No surgeon butchers an incision like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems silly to me. What knowledge do you have that I don&#39;t that lets you know beyond doubt that 1) it was butchered at all and 2) that no surgeon could have done something like this in the regular scope of their practice?</p>

<p>Ya&#39;ll can question all you want, but making absolutist statements when you know you don&#39;t have the background knowledge to back it up just makes you look like... well, a moron. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is this the most upvoted comment?  </p>

<p>On a conspiracy board showing a very suspicious link between an already proven satanic sex cult, and a porn star that is aggressively trying to slander/defame the president, with huge support from the media. </p>

<p>This satanic cult was helped run by a big time Hollywood actress, already convicted.  Think about that!  The recent Hollywood weirdness all goes along the same lines. </p>

<p>I laid out all the points needed to connect the dots. There is very likely some type of conspiracy here, or at least enough to generate a discussion if this is real or not. </p>

<p>But you ignore all that and post “defending” herself doesn’t mean she is guilty? no kidding!  It’s the evidence that makes her seem guilty.</p>

<p>She claims under oath that they had an affair.  Trump has denied the affair, but he hasn&#39;t done so under oath, and he has a history of changing his story constantly to fit the new cycle.  </p>

<p>Literally the only question that is open is whether the admitted payment is some kind of campaign finance violation.  And that&#39;s a legal question for court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s <em>you</em> who believes in the devil?  Do you really actually believe that?  IF you do really believe that there is Satan walking the earth and that there are cults that worship him, then why aren&#39;t you doing something about it?  </p>

<p>Remember that guy who shot up the Comet Pizza place?  In the video he made driving over to the place, he made it clear that he believed kids where being trafficked there for sex and he was going to do something about it.  Now it was a crazy thing to believe, but he honestly believed it and acted in a righteous and honest way on that basis.  He saw a terrible evil, and took action.  If he was right, he would have been a national hero.  There was no chance he would have been right, of course, because it&#39;s a crazy thing to believe.</p>

<p>In your case, you believe the devil is real and that these events and peopel you see are serving him by doing terrible things, but you are doing nothing about it.  That actually makes you <em>worse</em>.  Because you are choosing to enable it.</p>

<p>If you believe this, why don&#39;t you take a train ride up to NYC and do something about it?</p>

<p>Even if your &quot;proof&quot; really did show branding, which is <em>very</em> questionable, it would indicate she was a victim of a satanic cult that was charged with sex trafficking and blackmail.  </p>

<p>So this woman is the victim of (1) a smear campaign and lawsuits by the leader of the country, and (2) was possibly a victim of a powerful satanic sex cult. You&#39;re portraying her as the bad guy, and this is the best you could come up.   </p>

<p>And despite your claim to want to &quot;generate a discussion&quot; you seem quite displeased that it didn&#39;t go the way you wanted, despite your priming and attempts to tell people how to think. </p>

<p>And sorry, but the only way I&#39;d believe that is if you were to provide photos for proof (which would be awesome if you could do that). Otherwise, you&#39;re just a random redditor using unprovable anecdotal evidence to rebuke a conspiracy theory. Doesn&#39;t go very far with me without evidence.</p>

<p>My wife would never allow that and I would never post something personal like that on the internet anyways.  I still change accounts yearly(ish) because I don&#39;t like having so many details about my life and family on reddit all on one account.  You can literally google it and see how different people have different scars from different types of surgeries.  I think someone is posting a link to a google search of them actually if you don&#39;t want to search.</p>

<p>The surgery was having a hunk of her stomach removed, and also removing scar tissue from a previous surgery.  It was bariatic surgery.  She was 340ish and is now 145lbs.  She will not let anyone see her stomach area until after we can do a surgery to remove the excess skin.  Which sounds gross, but she actually shrunk up pretty good in my opinion, but she is not going to have a good body image of herself until after.  I believe the initial cut was just a line (for the main tool) but they had to make it bigger when they took out the part of the stomach they took off is what she said.  I looked at it like ten minutes ago actually, it isn&#39;t exactly a &quot;K&quot; like I had thought.  It is actually more like an &quot;X&quot;, but the top left line on the X healed much better than the rest so it kind of looks like an upside down &quot;Y&quot; now if that makes sense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was very interesting to watch how it worked via youtube vids we saw.  It was the Sleeve Gastrectomy procedure.  Basically reducing the size of the stomach significantly by cutting part of it off.  She had tried the Lap Band previously before we met, so that was the scar tissue they removed as well as the lap band itself.  Would not recommend the lap band to anyone just because of how it treated her, but that&#39;s anecdotal too obviously.</p>

I&#39;m saying you can question / postulate all you want, but if you start making absolute statements or saying that something doesn&#39;t make sense, you&#39;d better have data to back that shit up. It&#39;s the absolute statements that I find grating, not the general questioning.</p>

<p>I.e, I&#39;m not gonna walk by a bakery, see a pie displayed in the window, and tell the bakers that there&#39;s way too much sugar in said pie, unless I have either 1) tasted that pie myself, or 2) had some personal knowledge about the exact, specific recipe that went into baking that pie, or 3) baked the pie myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t question it. Of course you can question whatever you want. But there&#39;s a difference between asking questions and making absolutist statements, because the latter requires a base of knowledge to draw from. I&#39;m saying that making absolutist statements about something you don&#39;t have any personal experience or education in doesn&#39;t lead your statements to bear too much weight, because it seems like you&#39;re assuming you have more knowledge than you have.

<p>What bodies? And what are the biases of your sources?</p>

<p>I would also like to reiterate...</p>

<p>MUELLER took down an Italian MOB BOSS! He was deemed untouchable, because no one would prosecute him. The only Mueller gives a shit about is the law. Not only that he is a Vietnam WAR HERO, has PURPLE HEART, and actually got shot. He joined the Marines in honor of a friend from college that killed in Vietnam. He left private practoce, to work homicide cases in DC, during the 80s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judging by the placement of the scar, the closest excuse for a surgery scar would be from an appendectomy. </p>

<p>Now for the catches. appendectomy scars are a single straight incision and they tend to be placed a few inches higher than where that scar is at. That thing looks more like a surface level scar than one from a surgery, which are usually more indented... but people all tend to heal a bit differently so that is nothing to really go on.</p>

<p>Now having a scar there (even if it is a brand) doesn&#39;t MEAN she is/was a part of that NXIVM cult, but it certainly looks suspect with all the varying examples of those brand and how similar it looks to some of them. </p>

<p>If anyone knows of a different type of surgery scar that looks like that in that spot please let me know. I am more than willing to change my mind about this as it is pretty easy to google different surgery scars to compare. I know that they will tend to avoid cross section scars that size unless they have to, but I can&#39;t imagine why a surgeon would need to open her up that much. Lack of imagination on my part is not evidence, so by all means if anyone has an example that looks similar to this please share, and i am more than willing to admit I am wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every surgery is different there may have been some small complication that required cutting the original incision differently. My knee surgery scars look like little X&#39;s instead of just a little slit because he needed to put something bigger in my knee than proginally planned to repair it.</p>

<p>Theres not enough to go either way. People will have too much confirmation bias here. If you think shes part of the cult or whatever you&#39;ll believe that. If you dont you&#39;ll believe its a surgery scar. </p>

<p>The tat could be to cover a surgery scar or to cover a brand. Or just because she liked it.</p>

<p>All plausible. None more than the other </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that a number of knee surgeries have x shaped incisions for inserting a camera, but those sorts of scopes tend to be a lot smaller than the size of that scar on her. You could jam a usb webcam in that K mark on her abdomen. </p>

<p>That said I HAVE found another example of K shaped scars since posting this. They are usually higher up, but they are done when a person gets open heart surgery for tubes to vacuum out the blood that would pool in the a chest cavity, but they are usually accompanied by scars all over the chest because the nature of open chest surgery.</p>

<p>I am not committed to any specific line of thinking on this, I am just exploring the surgery scar angle.  I think it looks like a brand to me, but that doesn&#39;t actually mean anything beyond that. Having a brand that looks like that there doesn&#39;t mean she is in  NXIVM, but I also can see why people might jump to associate the two. The first doesn&#39;t specifically imply the latter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah critical thinkers all lining up to support you. Especially with you defending yourself from accusations of bigotry by...posting a bunch of lines from the racist playbook. Israel hate, crime statistics, freeze peaches, ignorance of Europe.  All of these are your calling cards and you&#39;re somehow using your tendency to parrot racist dogma by posting racist dogma. I think you might not have the slightest clue what you&#39;re talking about but I hope you continue. You&#39;re like a guinea pig for propaganda victims.</p>

<p>I am sorry that you posting racist Nazi propaganda as proof of you not being a Nazi is so painfully ignorant. If you had the ability to discern how sad a defense posting the racist shit you keep at your fingertips is, you wouldn&#39;t be a Nazi. But here we are. I hope that your village of poor African Nazis does well and I am happy that they have such a powerful chef serving their meals. Good luck to you in the new ethnostate. I am sure with your combination of cooking skills and racist as fuck beliefs your Hauptmann will be happy to overtook your skin color. </p>

<p>A Swedish peer-reviewed study[1] (in English for you!) from 2014 reported that over 60% of all violent assault (outdoor) rapes in Stockholm during 2008 were committed by non-citizens that often did not even speak the language:</p>

<p>Quote about the perpetrators:</p>

<p>They were male, often older than victims, some above 50 years old, ethnic diverse, more than 2/3 non-Swedish citizen (in some cases the protocol was filed with the help of an interpreter), and often non-fixed residence; a few were accused of other offences.</p>

<p>Quote about the victims:</p>

<p>Police trial protocols from 2008 to 2009 indicates that the victims are in majority female, two thirds aged 15-30, often single, did not know the suspect 24 h before the event (more than 2/3),</p>

<p>You have yet to specifically attack any of my claims.</p>

<p>Because you cant, they are fact and your only defense is to play dumb .</p>

<p>You are really gonna call me a nazi for this one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn&#39;t help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn&#39;t help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. They had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn&#39;t remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day. Sometimes I stood there thunderstruck. I didn&#39;t know what to be more amazed at: the agility of their tongues or their virtuosity at lying. Gradually I began to hate them.</p>

<p>Giving into hatred is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. I have no ill will toward anyone, no matter what they do for a living. Im not throwing Daniels or any other sex worker under the bus, but that being said, western society (right and left) have a serious issue with elevating people like Daniels over the hooker down on the corner or the girl shaking it on the pole at the seedy club across town. </p>

<p>They&#39;re all doing the same thing: selling their body in some sense for money. Just because Daniel makes more $$$ doesn&#39;t mean she is of a higher moral character. If money earned went hand in hand with favorable character that would make Trump and the rest of the global elite saints.</p>

<li>those who did the branding and fucked those who got branded</li>

<p>What followed was a “violent assault,” according to Lost Tycoon. Donald held back Ivana’s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants.</p>

<p>“Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified… It is a violent assault,” Hurt writes. “According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, ‘he raped me.’”</p>

<p>Following the incident, Ivana ran upstairs, hid behind a locked door, and remained there “crying for the rest of night.” When she returned to the master bedroom in the morning, he was there.</p>

<p>“As she looks in horror at the ripped-out hair scattered all over the bed, he glares at her and asks with menacing casualness: ‘Does it hurt?’” Hurt writes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one said it&#39;s unheard of for a woman to lie about a man for money in a divorce. You&#39;re just using a strawman. In Trump​&#39;s case, we have a well known liar with strings of sexual accusations, whose wife got a divorce from him base on cruel treatments, and after paying her off she still maintained she called it rape during the deposition and felt violated during their sexual encounter. Trump, a sue-happy bully, dared not sue the author for the story or release any document to show that he wasn&#39;t a rapist. </p>

<p>What followed was a “violent assault,” according to Lost Tycoon. Donald held back Ivana’s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants.</p>

<p>“Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified… It is a violent assault,” Hurt writes. “According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, ‘he raped me.’”</p>

<p>Following the incident, Ivana ran upstairs, hid behind a locked door, and remained there “crying for the rest of night.” When she returned to the master bedroom in the morning, he was there.</p>

<p>“As she looks in horror at the ripped-out hair scattered all over the bed, he glares at her and asks with menacing casualness: ‘Does it hurt?’” Hurt writes.</p>

<p>Keyword <em>allegedly</em>. The accusations are bout 40 years old, they didn&#39;t pursue charges, and 0 convictions. Guilty until proven innocent?</p>

<p>He banged a pornstar and she signed an NDA, we can&#39;t let this guy get the nuclear codes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, how far did you have to dig for that gossipmag piece? </p>

<p>According to your piece:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That arrangement ended when a (Mar-a-Lago) member’s young daughter complained to her wealthy father: while relaxing at Mar-a-Lago, she’d been approached and invited out to Epstein’s house.</p>

<p>The girl said that she had gone and that Epstein had tried to get her to undress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I guess girls with rich fathers who pay the membership fees don&#39;t need to be afraid of Epstein raping her at Mar-a-Lago, but then years after this reported episode, Trump​said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. &quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39; Trump booms from a speakerphone. &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;</p>

<p>The accusations are 40 years and keep on counting, it&#39;s been going on for a long time:</p>

<p>I suppose if we live in 2015, we should all believe the women lied and Cosby is innocent because there weren&#39;t a conviction yet. No need to look at pattern of behaviors and how so many women, unrelated and unknown to each other, claim the same thing.</p>

<p>He banged a porn star, had his &quot;lawyer&quot; paid her to shut up, possibly using illegal means, and lied about it. According to him, his lawyer just up and paid a porn star for him without this guy ever knowing anything. Who knows, maybe he has dementia and can&#39;t remember he actually had sex with her. Maybe we should have a doctor check him out, oh wait he recited his own medical report to his previous doctor, according to said doctor, and his new doctor at the White House is an alcoholic who peddle drugs. That&#39;s the person with the &quot;nuclear code&quot;, a dirty old man who&#39;s a pathological liar or a dementia ridden dirty old man.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, those sketches are real accurate. So far, the people who have shown to have given accurate information are Stormy and her lawyer. Trump​ has lied the entire time. </p>

<p>Honestly can&#39;t tell when Trump had sex with her. Before or after the cult. So any connection to a cult there would be dubious at best.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got me there. I&#39;ve always thought that was weird, but can&#39;t assume a person&#39;s guilt purely because they were on a flight with Epstein.</p>

It&#39;s covering a <em>massive</em> surgery scar. There are also multiple tweets of hers from several years ago, before she had the scar, referencing her surgery, and others referencing the tattoo as covering up a scar from surgery. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a brand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judging by the placement of the scar, the closest excuse for a surgery scar would be from an appendectomy. </p>

<p>Now for the catches. appendectomy scars are a single straight incision and they tend to be placed a few inches higher than where that scar is at. That thing looks more like a surface level scar than one from a surgery, which are usually more indented... but people all tend to heal a bit differently so that is nothing to really go on.</p>

<p>Now having a scar there (even if it is a brand) doesn&#39;t MEAN she is/was a part of that NXIVM cult, but it certainly looks suspect with all the varying examples of those brand and how similar it looks to some of them. </p>

<p>If anyone knows of a different type of surgery scar that looks like that in that spot please let me know. I am more than willing to change my mind about this as it is pretty easy to google different surgery scars to compare. I know that they will tend to avoid cross section scars that size unless they have to, but I can&#39;t imagine why a surgeon would need to open her up that much. Lack of imagination on my part is not evidence, so by all means if anyone has an example that looks similar to this please share, and i am more than willing to admit I am wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/masterblasterbeef is wrong and obviously has a lot of issues.</p>

<p>Giving into hatred is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. I have no ill will toward anyone, no matter what they do for a living. Im not throwing Daniels or any other sex worker under the bus, but that being said, western society (right and left) have a serious issue with elevating people like Daniels over the hooker down on the corner or the girl shaking it on the pole at the seedy club across town. </p>

<p>They&#39;re all doing the same thing: selling their body in some sense for money. Just because Daniel makes more $$$ doesn&#39;t mean she is of a higher moral character. If money earned went hand in hand with favorable character that would make Trump and the rest of the global elite saints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a surgeon, but married to one: she took one look at that and said that A) whoever did a surgery that resulted in that needs to immediately lose their license, B) that closing that up would be RIDICULOUSLY difficult, especially in such a small radius, an C) that IF this is a surgical scar, it healed in about the worst way possible.  Scars that come from being sewn back together will typically be flat and have an area in the middle that will be very slightly recessed and smooth to the touch; in addition, the symmetry of this one would only REALLY be possible if it essentially DID NOT MOVE for an extended period of time after the incision.  </p>
