        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So Zinc is really important and I mentioned in the previous post, deficiency of it is responsible for a host of problems, especially metabolism, digestion, and even skin problems and hair loss.</p>

<p>The problem I saw in my previous thread is that people are not sure if they are deficient and how much they should take.</p>

<p>I found Liquid Zinc Assay. It&#39;s a liquid you put in your mouth for 15 seconds and then swallow to see how deficient you are in Zinc. If you barely taste anything you&#39;re really deficient. If it&#39;s bitter and gross, you&#39;re not deficient. Two other results are in the middle.</p>

<p>Plus the Zinc Assay absorbs directly from the stomach, bypassing the small intestine. That way you only absorb 10-20 mg each day instead of the high amount from pills. I feel it&#39;s easier to avoid over supplementation when you take it. But that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>

<p>This is the product on Amazon: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Assay-Premier-Research-Labs/dp/B007SOV1YA/ref=lp_8428406011_1_3_a_it?srs=8428406011&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1525839308&amp;amp;sr=8-3">https://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Assay-Premier-Research-Labs/dp/B007SOV1YA/ref=lp_8428406011_1_3_a_it?srs=8428406011&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1525839308&amp;amp;sr=8-3</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s like $15 and so far I&#39;ve noticed it get more gross tasting after a few days. I do feel better as well. Just figured I could give you guys an option on zinc because I haven&#39;t really found a means of testing zinc even with blood tests and inflammation seems to make it hard to absorb it properly through the small intestine, meaning the dose you need may end up being completely different than what you take because you might absorb as little as 10%.</p>

<p>I find it very odd that out of all the medical professionals I went to (10), none have pointed me towards this product. None have even noticed the importance of zinc. I remember I had like 20 blood tests done and none were for zinc, even though zinc is as important as iron for the body.</p>

<p>I know this sounds gross, but my feces became really acidic when I was deficient. I also had an extremely bloated abdomen. I don&#39;t know if it will work for you, but I figured I&#39;d present you this option because I know how fucking hard it is to be sick and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong! Even after getting ultrasounds and allergy tests done!!!!!!</p>

<p>I remember when my hair was falling out, the endocrinologist was like...&quot;Cut your hair, it will get more nutrients&quot;. :/ </p>

<p>Sometimes I learned that to get better in this country with this healthcare, you have to take matters into your own hands.</p>

<p>Oh for iron, I also take lactoferrin with a regular iron pill and it helps with absorption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just zinc, you still need other cofactors...if anything becomes depleted it has to be balanced and it&#39;s very difficult to know what the real issue. Suppliments can be hard because taking to much of one can unbalance another...causing a whole new deficiency. And it&#39;s way better to get it from food then supplement because it&#39;s better used by the body this way, if you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? No I only take 20 mg of zinc a day now. I used to take zinc pills like optizinc: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Source-Naturals-OptiZinc-120-Tablets/dp/B00020I7Q2/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1525883474&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=optizinc">https://www.amazon.com/Source-Naturals-OptiZinc-120-Tablets/dp/B00020I7Q2/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1525883474&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=optizinc</a></p>

<p>But I was taking like 270 mg! I know it was stupid, but I just wanted to fix my deficiency so bad. I had diarrhea all the time! When I overdosed however, I started getting hypothyroidism symptoms. It was a nightmare. So glad I moved to something that is low dose.</p>

<p>I&#39;d take high zinc doses over short term to help fight colds, but yes symptoms like you describe (stomach upset) and dehydration were so unpleasant that I never even got close to something like 200mg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>supplementing with a trace mineral formula may not be a bad idea. We get a lot of it in the diet. Another mineral not mentioned that is sometimes not there in ideal amounts is Boron. </p>

<p>I had deficiencies in manganese and iron.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen a B complex that had sufficient Biotin for my needs. I take 800 mcg over 3 times a week (about every other day) as a maintenance dose; I used to take 2500 mcg for some months at that frequency as a booster dose. </p>

<p>I supplement with zinc once in a while but I&#39;m careful not to exceed a daily average of 15-20mg (on avg, over a week). I rotate the trace metals I take and try to take them with my morning coffee. (Metals have an added nice property of alkalizing that acidic beverage.)</p>

<p>Another good combo is ascorbates of trace metals:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>200 mg to 300 mg per day would be optimal in my opinion. Temporary higher doses are fine for most people when fighting colds. Some people may have kidneys that are very sensitive to high vit C intake; so those people should probably take less than 300mg a day, and spread the dose over multiple meals. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have such sensitivities, and take about 200 to 500 mg a day. (and when fighting off a cold, that same dose per major meal rather than per day). Some people think this just makes expensive urine though, and claim daily 200 mg is just fine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do affiliate marketing for a living. His link is not a referral link dude. He is not getting a commission from that link.</p>

<p>An Amazon affiliate link will have the exact parameter &quot;tag=something-20&quot; in the URL.</p>

<p>Go to any article on BestReviews and click any link over to Amazon. Look at the URL. You will see something appended near the end like tag=bestprodtag50956-20</p>

<p>That extra tag= parameter makes it a referral link. The ref= parameter is tracked internally by Amazon to see how you found the product(eg. recommended carousel, search results, direct linked, etc). Nobody earns any extra commission from any ref= parameters. </p>

<p>You can believe whatever you want but I&#39;ve been doing this for long enough to be absolutely certain OP&#39;s link is not earning him any money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what part of the country you are in but I go to an Amish doc that practices Iridology in KY. It sounds like you would be interested in the things he preaches. It is insane how many things he has taken care of in just my family. Auto Immune diseases, 90% artery blockages, thyroid issues, eczema, etc... All were done through 100% natural means. Grandfather had the 90% blockage. The stuff he took from Dr Rueben worked so well that his cardiologist now goes to him. Even though the cardiologist goes to Dr Rueben, could never tell a patient to go to him, recommend what he gets, or really even discuss it with his patients, which is just crazy. And anything Rueben prescribes, has to say &quot;Not For Human Consumption&quot; from when the FDA raided him. If he wasn&#39;t tied to a religious community, he would have been shut down years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His name is Reuben. Just Google Dr Reuben Kentucky and he will come up. There is no electricity so they don&#39;t have phones, computers, etc... You just show up and wait in line. He is one of, I think, 2 or 3 people left in the world who practice Iridology so he gets busy, especially for the Amish community. Usually, we show up around 6 am on Saturdays and it doesn&#39;t take that long. It is free to see him. The things he prescribes will cost money though. You can get however much you want or none. I usually get 6 months worth of stuff. It is amazing the things he sees in your eyes. My fave is when he told my Grandfather that he had so much salt built up in his body that he had a white ring around his eye. If you knew my GF, he would put ketchup on absolutely everything he ate so the salt was spot on. Anyway, he has helped a lot of people in my fam so I am always trying to promote him.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve literally had doctors claim a lump was a Lymph node when there is not any Lymph node close to that area on any human anatomy diagram.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had doctors use try to use bare hands and attempt to use already used scissors on a bloody, wet bandage that was being replaced on my hand(couldn&#39;t do it myself, too awkward of a spot).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had doctors try and prescribe me anti-biotics for an &#39;infection&#39; on my finger. I had simply asked if my finger looked like it was healing well after I had cut the end of it off a month or so prior. It was fully healed and looking pretty good but was a little bulgy on the scar - slightly red because new skin had formed. Looked at it for less than a SECOND and then said yup need anti-biotics. I got them(free) and put them in the fridge for a rainy day.. No, my finger was not infected and proceeded to heal normally without them.</p>

<p>Fuck doctors. I&#39;ve yet to meet any that actually take their job seriously, or know how to treat ailments or injuries with the appropriate care and applied knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think as you do. But the reality I always end up facing the facts, namely that in general, if you are eating a healthy diet and don&#39;t have some sort of unusual genetic demands... plenty of leafy greens, adequate carbs (yes, you do need carbs paleotards), some healthy fats and moderate protein from meat, you are probably not deficient in any of the major nutrients.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I do. I would consume grass-fed whey protein. I would consume 5-8 servings of vegetables ether frozen or fresh. I would even consume 16 ounces of spinach a week. I would consume literally 10 lbs of purple sweet potatoes in 2 weeks, and I can&#39;t even mention how much money I spent on organic pasta, pears, pineapples, organic apples, citrus, organic dates, brasil nuts, cashews, I even bought $32 almond butter...None of that helped me!</p>

<p>Why because when you are deficient in certain nutrients...GENIUS...you can&#39;t process macros let alone micro nutrients!</p>

<p>Phosphorus deficiency keeps you from absorbing fat soluble nutrients. Zinc deficiency, same thing, except it also keeps you from processing amino acids. </p>

<p>The thing is, and that&#39;s something that many people don&#39;t understand, is that severe malnutrition, something that I experienced, is not cured by just &#39;eating healthy&#39;. You can eat all the fucking smoothie bowls and buy the most organic everything. When the core nutrient deficiencies are no resolved, you might as well be eating junk food because your body is barely absorbing anything.</p>

<p>You have no fucking clue what I went through, especially in my youth. So don&#39;t come in here stating just eating your veggies&#39; will help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you supplement only zinc, this is going to cause an imbalance with copper. I supplemented zinc at 25mg a day for a while for no real reason, and ended up with some mild spoon nails, which went away after I ended supplementation. </p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t think most people suffer from zinc deficiency, unless they are eating a very shitty diet or they have some unusual genetic features that cause it. To me it sounds like the latter is the case for you. I can&#39;t imagine deficiency if you really were eating a healthy diet, which would have enough zinc.</p>

<p>Nutrition and supplements are interesting, but honestly a lot of these online nutrition sites post nothing but doomporn to make it out like everybody is dying and deficient in everything. Every symptom under the sun is listed. It&#39;s just another meme to part you from your money, kind of like all that prepper shit on alt media sites. </p>

<p>Also zinc is supposedly a water soluble nutrient, so I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s any reliable way to measure deficiency, since any test would just end up measuring your recent intake, unless I am mistaken?</p>

<p>Actually...if you did a simple google search, you would know a whopping 33% of people have zinc deficiency because inflammation causes the gut to not absorb it properly.</p>

<p>Also if you read the thread, the liquid zinc assay is an actual test to see deficiency. But hey just come on the thread and say things. That&#39;s cool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried all that. It didn&#39;t work and oysters were too expensive. I know that zinc over-supplementation affects the thyroid and copper and zinc. That&#39;s why this liquid is easier for me as I only get a recommended amount and nothing more.</p>
