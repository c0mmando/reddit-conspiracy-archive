It’s called moving the goal post, if you prove she wasn’t in some sex cult, they’ll say that doesn’t prove she got hush money, and if you can prove she got hush money, they’ll claim it didn’t come from trump, and if you prove it cake from trump, they’ll claim it didn’t break any law so it’s fine..... it’s literally just a never ending game of deflection and making increasingly absurd claims...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this is interesting. I had dismissed initial reports as the first few pictures I saw were blurry and inconclusive. The photo linked  in the thread <a href="https://npreddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8i3dtb/stormy_daniels_has_an_nxivm_brand">here</a> provided by <a href="/u/JulianAsausage">/u/JulianAsausage</a> is somewhat more convincing, similar to the NXIVM brand however still not a 100% match. The fact she changed her story from it being surgery scar to being nonexistent is enough to raise a red flag and indicate deception. Although I&#39;m not sure this even really matters in the grand scheme of things, or if it would directly relate to Trump objectively or even hypothetically (note: I am not a Trump supporter or habitual basher), so it&#39;s hard to put this into proper context even if she was found to be involved with NXIVM without more information, which I would be interested to read if and when it comes to light.</p>

<p>The examples of NXIVM branding scars I saw showed a wide variance in what letters appeared and the arrangement of the letters. They all appeared similar, but there are different versions. Even if she was DEFINITELY part of the group and that visible scar really is from having been branded, you shouldn&#39;t necessarily expect the scar to be a 100% perfect match for other examples. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Copying my comment from a different thread</p>

<p>So if Stomy is part of a sex cult then that means someone gave Donnie her to use. So Donald is a a part of this sex cult.</p>

<p>Who hooked Donnie up with girls from sex cults? Maybe he&#39;s always been apart of sexual abuse cabals under his many fake names.</p>

<p>So Trump has molested his daughter and is banging sex cult girls. Knows Clintons and Epsteins. Think maybe Trump and Stormy sex was a satanic ritual of some kind?</p>
