       To my conspiracy theorist friends, how do you think the elite plan to lower the population?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious they're working a soft kill program, via cancer enzymes in vaccines, ineffective pharmaceuticals that cause more harm than good, and sterilization chemicals in our food and hygiene products, but it's obvious that they're planning a hard kill soon (at least to me).  What do you think they're planning?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm tossed up.  Seems like the evidence is pointing to either a disease/pandemic.  That or a War of the World style attack using advanced technology but blamed on aliens.  They've been working the alien attack angle for a while, with the fake moon landing, fake leaked area 51 documents, etc.  (Alien attack being a good way to create a world government, as even people who hate each other are easily united with a common enemy)
      </p>
      <p>
       I know many of my friends believe there really are aliens, and I'm not saying it's impossible, but I lean towards the beings that have been contacted as spirits or demons (considering most of the communication has come from channeling).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else got a theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       PS, if you are an actual conspiracy theorist, will you PLEASE UPVOTE ME to help balance out the massive amount of downvotes I will receive from the anti-conspiracy shills?

       Actually..  3) How many items in your house? Deterioration of most plastics and furniture create carcinogens. Degassing is serious business. Open the god damn windows in your house weekly. And never ever ever open a tote thats been closed for a long period of time with plastics or other materials that have built up toxic fumes in it.

       Interesting. Never thought about it but yeah I have reusable shopping bags ('tote bag') and it usually has plastic bags in it.. when you open it, it stinks of plastic really strongly. Imma hold my breath from now on haha.

       Number 7 seems reasonable in places. First World countries seem to be heading in that direction. The third world is moving in the opposite direction,  but they are already easy to control.

       I don't see why people wanting to have less kids is seen as a bad thing. Once society has stable resources, shelter, etc. and is largely conflict-free, there is no need for so many children. When people have vices and entertainment, sex is less necessary as one as well. This all leads to a natural decline in birthrate and a stabilization of population.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not inherently a bad thing; in many cases it can be a good thing.

       They've already taken care of that with the insane cost of college these days. Most of my friends and I have said the cost of the second kid completely depends on what college costs are like, because we don't want to have our kids working full-time jobs while in college and having their GPA suffer or being slaves to student loans.

       The bees thing always cracks me up. That's one conspiracy that seemed to get passed this sub. One type of bee native to Hawaii was struggling, that's all. Yes if Bees suddenly vanished the results would be catastrophic but it's no different from any other creature. With this topic however there are a lot of virtue signallers who love to scream "save the bees" and if you try and tell them the facts the wont hear it which is bizarre.

       But they are not in any danger. No animal hunts mice like the domestic cat. If all domestic cats vanished we would be over run with vermin within weeks. In fact the domestic cat in terms of kills is the deadliest hunter on earth. Cats are not in danger. Neither are Bees, being bothered about cats going extinct is the same as Bees as neither are facing issues.

       Upvoted. Good thread. Not sure which is most likely be I do think depopulation is the name of the game. The new Avengers movie was so bizarre. It was like watching their agenda play out. Regarding Blue Beam, it seems that so many people are aware of it now and are really pushing back against the alien narrative. My concern with that is they have to “win” so if Blue Beam is executed I think it’ll be absolutely devastating.

       Hah no worries, someone asked me who I thought was gonna bite it the other day and I said Iron Man so I wouldn't be super surprised, I really gotta see it over the next couple days though so I can get in on some conversations about the movie.

       Agreed.  I think whatever forces are writing these scripts have probably taken note of the pushback against the alien agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny though, it really seems they shot themselves in the foot by choosing Tom DeLonge to "lead" their brand of false disclosure.  Perhaps they thought his voice would resonate with the Millennial generation, but it seems to have not worked out exactly as they planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrast that with getting a public media entertainment figure like NDT or Bill Nye to spearhead the movement, and the results would've likely been entirely different.

       To add though, it would seem TPTB aren't really all that serious about the alien agenda and are throwing out complete shite to the masses (i.e Tom DeLonge and his team of alleged government insiders with no verification any of them worked for the US Government).

       It makes total sense, just not within the context it has been presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Blue Beam report, which incorporates 4 major stages, was never the true story.  As is such with information like this, 75% of it is bullshite, and 25% of it is either true or half-truths.
      </p>

       Do I, personally, believe that billionaires who want to control the world would use their money and power to fool the masses?  Absolutely.  Likewise, do I believe the purported Blue Beam stage of "allowing demons to travel via coaxial cables?"  No, I personally don't.

       - the user that commented below is right- Thanos was just in it for the putang. No misguided, but noble quest to eradicate suffering by bringing balance to the universe- through genocide.

       Knowledge is power friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       William Cooper offers a lengthy analysis of the state of global events, presenting information, which he claims is secretly held by governments. Cooper argues that numerous secret societies exist, which were organized into a single massive society c. 1953; that a Secret Government, which controls everything, was established shortly after World War II; that the government seeks to eliminate population through various means and that extra-terrestrial intelligent life exists and often visits earth. In addition, Cooper offers auto-biographical information and proffers a plethora of putative facts regarding the massive and systematic disinformation campaign waged upon the public by those in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The text is comprised of materials from a variety of source; much of the contents are facsimile reproductions of disparate documents including letters, articles from newspapers and magazines, declassified government documents, legal proceedings, public documents and photographs. In addition, the text contains several, lengthy articles written at various times by Cooper; many of these articles were originally printed elsewhere, and some of them are addresses delivered to various groups. All of these various materials are presented with additional up-to-date commentary by Cooper. The arrangement of the text is confused, however, and much of the material presented appears largely or wholly irrelevant to the text's principle themes. The bulk of Cooper's textual theses are found in Chapters 2 and 12, while Chapters 5 and 9 supply tangential information. Most of the remaining chapters present documents that are largely unrelated or unimportant. The foreword presents autobiographical information about Cooper and is probably the most lucid segment of the text.
      </p>
      <p>
       In brief, Cooper's thesis appears to be that shortly after World War II, the United States government established a Secret Government, which persists until the present time. The Secret Government is the actual controlling power of global politics and has the single goal of establishing a global, totalitarian socialist state—a modified version of Nazi Germany's Fascism. Since time immemorial, various secret societies have existed; they are all based upon the worship of the Biblical Lucifer, and the members of these societies seek personal knowledge or illumination—hence they are collectively referred to as the Illuminati. After World War II, all of the disparate secret societies were brought together in a single organizational structure known as the Bilderberg Group. The exact nature of the relationship between the Bilderberg Group and the Secret Government is difficult and obscure; the fact, however, is that both groups have similar goals and strategies and both groups are heavily infiltrated by members of the other group. In most of the text, Cooper seems to suggest that the two groups are, in fact, the same organization. Finally, the existence of UFOs and alien life forms was established shortly after World War II. Realizing that such knowledge would cause widespread panic the government decided to keep it secret. Vast networks of bases and entire organizations of personnel were subsequently organized to contain the alien situation, and political treaties were signed with alien nations. Today, the Secret Government seeks to dominate the alien presence and carry out its secret program of world domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       In brief, the text is incredible, the many allegations undocumented, and the constant vituperation of public officials is offensive. For example, Cooper denigrates Pope John Paul II as a Nazi poison-gas salesman, who helped engineer HIV and deliberately distributed the virus in vaccinations. All of this is confounded by a confused textual development and seriously hampered by the haphazard compilation of the book. Finally, the total lack of credible supporting documentation or other evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that the book is a hate-inspired and inflammatory work of ignorable fiction, designed to arouse fear and spread hatred.

       The depopulation idea always seemed weird to me. If you were a farmer, would you slaughter half your cattle when you could profit off of them? If someone is in power and in a corporate position, they make their money, their safety net, through the labors of others. So why would the want to depopulate? It'd be one thing if we were running out of space, but I'm sure those in charge could easily force others into more compact spaces if they need to, as long as they can keep their profit margins

       Even if they were to automate everything I believe for a lot people in power a good amount of their satisfaction comes from having control over others. It probably wouldn't be as enjoyable for them if they had no one to control or considerably less than before. And that's not to say if it was life or death over resources that they wouldn't cull anyone

       Good input. You really shut me down with that epic reply, here, have an upvote. Perfect balance of wit and snark. Also good use of the term "everyone", at least now anybody else reading this knows that yours is indeed the correct position to take unless they too wish to be deemed an insane outcast.

       10-20x the frequency, not strength.  This is
       <em>
        even worse

       10-20x the frequency means we're getting radiated 10-20x more per second.

       5G being higher frequency has very poor penetration, that's why there will be so many base stations. So it could actually be less harmful than existing tech? But we might have more exposure...
      </p>
      <p>
       We didn't really have much good information on how radiation from cell phones and towers affects us afaik. There was a study published not long ago (preliminary reports first came out in 2016) which exposed rats to high levels of 2G &amp; 3G for a couple of years and the male rats had a higher incidence of tumours. But they weren't sure why and couldn't extrapolate that to humans. If you check any of the clickbait 5G panic stories on you'll eventually figure out that they're basing the fear porn on this from what I've seen.

       Alpha radiation is very damaging, but it has next to no penetration. That's why you can't eat in areas that might have alpha radiation, because if you ingest some, it will mess you up big time, but it won't make it through your skin otherwise.

       "Ingest some" sounds like ionizing radiation, not microwaves. I don't doubt that microwaves are harmful but there's a difference between environment pollution and "ingesting 5G radiation".

       I'm no longer convinced it's intentional. I think we've just fucked up too many times during the 20th century with all these emerging technologies that are too nuanced and complex for our current level of intellect to handle properly. I mean we can't even use non-recycled steel in lab equipment because the background radiation's now too high thanks to nuclear testing, it has to be sourced from ships before the 1950s.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite are fully aware of the "we're fucked" situation the world's truly in. I'm beginning to believe they're simply trying to live in what little time civilization has left in total hedonism and comfort for themselves.

       Maybe, but the prudent thing to do would be to prep for that and then watch and wait. Trying to implement that now using technology that wouldn't survive long after a total civilization collapse means their hegemonic control would only exist as long as that tech does. These elites aren't dumb. They strategize 3, 4, 5 steps ahead into the future while making themselves look like they're bumbling with steps 1 and 2 just like everyone else.

       True. But people are impatient. If you're a super rich, economically and politically influential, sociopathic elite who has decided to capitalise on a cataclysm by seizing control of the entire world... you'd probably do what you could to subtly or even overtly hasten that cataclysm

       That's where the blatant disregard for toxic/carcinogenic properties mass produced goods come in, I bet. If they know we're all fucked, no reason to make products "safe" for consumption, might as well feed the people poison to start them dying before the shit really hits the fan.

       Ehh...I think they are trying multiple methods and waiting to see when its time to release a a “super flu” to decimate the population to a manageable level.  I think they haven’t done it yet until they come up with a solution for many manufacturing and technological processes that cannot currently be automated, they desperately want to make sure they have no reliance upon us.

      <p>
       There are different kinds of saturated fats, each having different effects on our body.  Which kind do you think are "good for health"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any research to back that up?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example stearic acid is a saturated fat that has not been found to have negative health effects.  This isn't the case though for other types of saturated fats.
      </p>

       Conclusions Higher dietary intakes of major SFAs are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Owing to similar associations and high correlations among individual SFAs, dietary recommendations for the prevention of coronary heart disease should continue to focus on replacing total saturated fat with more healthy sources of energy.

       Not the one i was thinking about but it has similar findings.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Saturated fats are not associated with all cause mortality, CVD, CHD, ischemic stroke, or type 2 diabetes, but the evidence is heterogeneous with methodological limitations. Trans fats are associated with all cause mortality, total CHD, and CHD mortality, probably because of higher levels of intake of industrial trans fats than ruminant trans fats.

      <p>
       The resulting article published in 1967 concluded there was "no doubt" that reducing cholesterol and saturated fat was the only dietary intervention needed to prevent heart disease. The researchers overstated the consistency of the literature on fat and cholesterol, while downplaying studies on sugar, according to the analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       They overstated one source and downplayed another.  This doesn't imply that cholesterol or saturated fats are healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Saturated fatty acids raise total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, but individual fatty acids within this group, have different effects (3--5). Myristic and palmitic acids have the greatest effect and are abundant in diets rich in dairy products and meat. Stearic acid has not been shown to elevate blood cholesterol and is rapidly converted to oleic acid in vivo. The most effective replacement for saturated fatty acids in terms of coronary heart disease outcome are polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially linoleic acid. This finding is supported by the results of several large randomized clinical trials, in which replacement of saturated and trans fatty acids by polyunsaturated vegetable oils lowered coronary
heart disease risk (6)."

       Your study replaced both saturated and trans fat. It's the trans fat that are incredibly bad. They are banned in my country.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Harvard study did more than this, they selected data that was true to their goal and ignored entire  countries of data, like France that had some of the highest cholesterol levels in Europe but some of the lowest heart attack risk. It was literally a paid study by sugar and nothing in it was true. We built an entire industry on that single fake study.

       It’s more than just obesity. Excess sugar (and it does not take all that much) causes yeast to proliferate in the intestines leading to many of the chronic illnesses Americans experience. Alcohol consumption thrown in makes it worse. Same goes for antibiotics. When your gut flora gets wonky, it leads to things like depression (because the body can no longer convert l-tryptophan to 5-HTP, a serotonin precursor), IBS, h. Pylori and C. Diff infections, wide spread chronic inflammation (leads to way higher risk of heart disease), food sensitivities due to increased intestinal permeability, and many other chronic illnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our gut flora is messed up as an entire country. Western society has way less biodiversity in probiotics compared to the rest of the world and gut flora has a big impact on what benefits you can get out of the food you consume (Americans on average have less than 1% of the probiotic strain that is needed to break fiber down into key omega fatty acids). Probiotics also affect mood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are some researchers with federal grants working on increasing probiotic diversity in kids diagnosed with Autism. They are seeing a 25% reduction in symptoms after treating kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, I still can’t cut back my sugar intake as much as I should for any sustained period of time. :/

       I don't think a war with Iran is going to be a walk in the park. It's no Iraq or Afghanistan, the population is religiously homogeneous and it won't be easy to apply divide and conquer. They're also more advanced technologically and produce their own cars, jets, and guided missiles.

       Well we don't know what other countries will get involved.  If its just U.S vs Iran that's one thing.  But if Israel joins then I'm sure a few other countries would back Iran just because.  Maybe Russia backs Iran then we have another problem and ask other countries to join us.   Its a lot of what if questions until it actually happens.

       Maybe the death of baby boomers starts kicking in or something to that effect? They are way past their time to retire and get our of the way due to ego and greed. It might actually be a good thing for those of us passed over and forgotten in the lost generation.

       I imagine big cities will draw people to them by distributing food or medicine or vaccines or what have you. Big cities will thrive on the basis that they will have strength in numbers, and likely a functional police or military control grid keeping things relatively safe. Meanwhile, outside the cities will be mass starvation and gang rule, raiding, looting, scavenging, lawlessness, cannibalism. This will function as a filtration mechanism funneling people into the security of the cities while massively cutting the population outside the cities.

       This is effective but it seems like it would be too random and too devastating. I think they want to target certain types of people to get rid of. They need some of us around afterwards to be their slaves and run their machines and whatnot.

       Bombs. Nothing kill faster than bombs. But bombs are messy.

       I once heard there are bombs that kill biological entities while leaving buildings intact. I believe if those bombs existed they would have used them already.

       In fact the history of the biological warfare can be traced way back to 600 BC when the Assyrians supposedly used a

       </a>
       as a weapon.

      <p>
       The bomb I used to hear about as a kid was some variation of the neutron bomb, that "vaporizes people without destroying cities". Later Ive discovered that - actually - the neutron bomb is just an atomic bomb that is tuned to spread more lethal radiation.

       Well said.

       I'm convinced they want all the remaining population to be in megacities for control purposes, so whatever they do has to effectively take care of the rural folk, not only to get rid of their resistance, but also to be able to take their land.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lean towards pestilence, famine, and war for those reasons. But then again, that's exactly what is foretold anyway, so I guess I'm not bringing anything new to the table.

       I don't really think that there is a lot that the average person can do to prepare for WW3 or even a pandemic. If you are not willing to even prep a little bit for a disaster (lay in a month or twos worth of non-perishable food and water etc.) then, you are going to have to depend on the government if there is no food in the stores. You could start a vegetable garden. It is a good hobby and you eat better.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the pandemic, just to be aware that one may come may save, but again you would need some supplies to keep your family safe from contact.

       If there were a conspiracy to reduce the population of the planet, the best thing, the most effective thing, would be to increase the living conditions of people. Birth Rate declines as income rises. Helping people become wealthier, have better access to medical care, better education is a certain route to lower birth rates.

       I think it's mostly in place already. There are prisons and hospitals. You go to one of them when you can't work. You manipulate which one people go to by adjusting insurance allowances. Everyone is already doing something illegal, so it's easy enough to imprison any number of people you need to.

       It don't think it would be a hard kill as that would effect them as well, wouldn't be a general population culling.  The elites would (likely) look to remove specific global demographic.  Large scale wars would kill indiscriminate.  Nuking a city kills the well off as well as the "dregs".  Not really an option.
       <br/>
       Kind of a combination of the (good comments) below.
       <br/>
       EBT:  There is no government checking account for food stamps.  The program is run by very large financial institutions.  This applies to both federal, state and local programs.   If you subscribe (as I do) that society is only 3 meals from anarchy, all it takes is a prolonged IT outage of that programs.  40 million people with no access to food with none stored.  Inner cities would begin to rip themselves apart in a day or two.  This would also significantly impact supply lines making the problem exponentially worse as time went on.  You think the Walmart guy/gal making $10/hour is going to try and maintain some order?
      </p>
      <p>
       Technology(example): An implant is developed that increases the intelligence of an individual exponentially.  It costs $3,000,000 cash.  You can let your mind run wild on this one, the societal damage would lead to all sorts societal disasters.  Again, targeted demographic.  In a few years, anyone that didn't have the means to participate would most likely eat themselves alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as a general culling.  The most efficient way (not my idea, can't remember book) wouldn't be a plague type virus, my guess it would be a genetically targeted sterility virus.  Say, every female with brown eyes becomes sterile.  That would wipe out a huge amount of the population including the eradication of most third would countries in a (wrong word i'm sure) "orderly" fashion over a decade or two.
       <br/>
       Power grid is the obvious low hanging fruit, but that would be localized to specific areas/countries.

       People don't seem to get that suffering is a huge part of what they want. Sure they want to reduce the population but us suffering is key. I have always said this can't be for money, because we would print it, it's not for oil because we would take it and it's not for land because again we would take it. So then what is all this violence and confusion for? Energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The years leading up to the 2012 Olympics people were certain something was going down. From the Illuminati symbolism in the actual stadium to the pyramid (the shard) that was erected to the mascots with cameras for eyes and even the streets all around the stadium have biblical roots. Something was going to happen but it never did. Except something did happen, they created fear and confusion. They didn't stifle the conspiracies they played to them, they had anti air missiles on roof tops around London ffs. Then they held massive parties in the streets around the stadium for the duration of the games. Energy. There are powers at work that we can't even begin to comprehend, and that maybe don't even exist. I fully believe that the elite believe in God, but they worship Satan. That's why all of this seems really fucked up and confusing like pedogate, it's satanic rituals and satanic ritualistic sacrifices are based in pain and suffering first and death last, see Crowley.

       I mean as in power like god, who they believe exists but might not. If they are Satanists they are Christians because they believe in Satan, God created Satan and that's where god is. God wouldn't intervene either because why would he? We are the angels that fell with Satan, we made our choice but we have one last chance, ignorance. That's what being born into sin means, the sin happened but now we sit as the jury in the greatest trail of all time, god vs Satan. God gives us nothing, Satan offers money and power in this life here and now. You can see why choices are made. This is of course religiously speaking.

       So you are saying that this world is entirely ruled by satan, as we fell in here because our sins. If God won't intervene means that doesn't matter how "good" or faithful to God you are, nothing good shall happen to you until the day of your death, because it's when the trial ends. It's curious that only satan is able to demonstrate it's existence, to offer and to rule; meanwhile we should believe in God that lacks presence, offers or ruling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in this theory we should only aim to die faster because subjectively speaking as humanity, the only God in this world is Satan?
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory looks very pessimistic and I rather not believe in such things. There should be another explanation.

       I'm not saying anything. I'm going off what the original story was in terms of God and creation. I also never asserted that it doesn't matter if we do good or bad and it's disturbing you took that from it. We are born evil but with a choice. Now let me ask you something, is it better to be born good and just live a good person or is it better to make mistakes and learn and choose to be good simply for the sake of it? Not for gain like evil but for nothing, the purest form of giving. If you choose evil then get settled, you are staying. Want out? Live a good life.

       I don't consider it disturbing, only logical to extrapolate that if Satan is the God in this world his will will prevail (therefore evil), as God won't intervene, rule or offer anything. I didn't say it would be different as in bad in the after life, but that the only logical reasoning for this world and this life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that if God gives Satan free will, considering he's an exceptional being (as in powerful, over humanity), this is asymmetrical and doesn't archive harmony, because Satan possess a force that even controls or manipulate humanity according to some christian traditions, breaking the holy covenant of free will (possession and activities you suggested might be against people will). To me, God presence should be only equivalent, or otherwise existence in here is actually nothing more than an uncomfortable sentence, the definition of hell, and then what good should we expect if this is exactly was God intended (punishment)? What would be the purpose of the truth, besides the certainty of a life of suffering?
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't say you taking your own life, but people wishing to die sooner, not longer, because who would want to stay anyway?

       And you think all of this because you have limited knowledge of Christianity. It seems like you are the pessemistic one, you are talking so defeated. Life is such a tiny aspect of existence and that's the point. If you look at eternity and think I have to suffer for 75 years and get an eternity of bliss as a reward for not being a bastard I think it's a pretty good pay off. You were dead long before you were alive and you managed that no problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I don't mourn death, I'm happy the person I love is at peace. Death is not sad it is relief, the end of your shift and now you can swipe out and be happy, or miserable if you do the wrong thing and I don't mean the law i mean what is wrong and right to YOU.

       It's the pessimistic reasoning obtained from your own comments. If you carefully go back into your comments you'll find the satanic ritualistic sacrifices, satanic practices harming millions, satanic elite, the Gods lack of intervention and Satans rule of this world. Basically Satan powerful force is the only perceived force and none of God, because God won't intervene.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not a single word in your comments claiming anything else, and I went for it in case your forgot to say about God in this world and I found none. Don't blame me for your own conclusion that this life is a sentence and world is a prison ruled by satan.

       Right but suffering is the point of life. You are either very young or very uneducated. There's not a single word in my comments claiming what? What am I claiming? I'm answering your questions as best I can bring as I'm not fucking religious. You are the one asking the questions here it's not my problem you dont like the answers. Earlier you responded "this sounds too pessemistic and I'd rather not believe that" so because something doesn't gel with your ideas it must be wrong? What a shallow existence you must lead. You clearly have issues beyond this and I hope you get better.

       I'm trying to prove that you are an ignorant in religious matters, that you don't know anything about you are talking about and only spread more ignorance and fear mongering through "satanic panic" and other shallow reasoning like your posting history openly shows. When I point it out you attack me with ad-hominems, which expose the nature of your character. This kind of thought is the cancer for those who really try to expose what is going on in this world.

       You are into pedogate you imbecile I can't see your posts and comments and it's all conspiracies and shit. You engaged me, I mentioned something I was into years ago and you jumped down my neck making ridiculous statements. If I am a fear monger so are you. So my theories are totally wrong and yours are right? Also you called me ignorant, a personal attack. My ideas are not based in fear I encourage people to be happy and help each other despite the world being a shit hole, that's called being real. Just because your myopic view on life is different to my open minded view doesn't make you right, it just means you don't have the eyes to see. You obviously are a bit nuts because you believe you are a targetted, what was that you said about promoting fear? This is super low hanging fruit you are no making this difficult at all. Try again.

At least I can actually hold a discussion with someone and being from with them from the start, you clearly have a screw loose and you are up and down like a yo yo. Seriously grow up pal, I gave you my opinions on a religion I have studied for years, you couldn't handle it. You didn't like the answers so you renjected it, yeah real truth seeker here guys. There is also no fear mongering in my post history, if there is quote me? I can say this with confidence because all you could possibly do is miss quote me and take out of context and when you do that you'll be exposed for the liar you are. What Truth seeker dismisses answers they don't like? Hilarious. Truth seekers don't dismiss inconvenient truths. You are obviously a very scared and alone individual. Seek help.

       Your small knowledge about religion is reflected on your reactions. You probably studied religion on alex jones Youtube channel, that would explain your the unintelligent inclination for conservative religious conspiracy theories. Of course I post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       about real life stuff, with sources and probable cause, not about the topics that a brainwashed person would spit out of fantastic assumptions that only exist in the twisted imagination of a person that isn't particularly happy or comfortable or far from any good mental state. Yet you claim that I'm the one with a screw loose! Talk about irony. I'd be expecting the sources that support your theories from a stormfront conspiracy forum or maybe another fairytale book. If you think you have it easy I guess you don't have much insight, as your entire posting history and logic is a house of cards one vibration away from free fall.

       The only liar here is you, this is why you are overly defensive because you know very well the bullshit facade. This is why it hurts you so much after barely getting questioned or asking about the topics you supposedly dominate, but fail to actually provide a meaningful answer.

       Well if nothing happens you won't need to shop for a while. There is certainly something in the air though. Something is coming and the last time I said this Grenfell tower burned. I actually stopped watching TV refuse to digest anything Royal and have zero knowledge of the world cup which tbh is bliss but it means I don't catch the things I used to. I once did a full breakdown of the Olympics years ago but it was purged.

       I've been researching the 5g network conspiracy. The conspiracy is that, since the 5g waves are very similar to microwaves, they'll have near the same effect. Therefore, when modern society switches to 5g completely, there will eventually be mass deaths due to the radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hardly even spoken about, so I don't know how legitimate this concern is.

       Similar to alpha radiation - not damaging normally because of short range and penetration, but when ingested an alpha-emitter will tear you up. Walking by a 5G transmitter will fry you, same as an unshielded microwave would

       You are going to get a lot of downvotes from conspiracy theorists who think these ideas don't hold water. The elites don't need to cull the population, it wouldn't benefit them. They have everything they could possibly want because they have so many poor people at their control.

       I think the alien script will be used to unify everyone, so attacking aliens wouldn't work unless there were two purported groups, which seem unnecessarily complicated.

       Disease seems likely, as does civil war/massive violent unrest. Easy enough to do, sadly enough.

       Nukes seem like they'd be easiest, but if you believe the population maps then they want to keep the big cities, not clear them out.

       The thing is, they can't really get "big kill" events "authorized"
      </p>
      <p>
       They still play by divine creators rules and if they plan something in regards to killing off mass population percentages, they get shut down fast either by creation itself or through white hats or other good people. This is intentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       God would never let discriminate full scale killing take place, it has to be "authorized" by individuals at a soul level or a group or collective consciousness
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why they've resorted to soft kill methods. To get us sick, squeeze us of money, and get us depressed so we buy shit cheap food and more toxic bullshit to further dull the senses. There's so many avenues that in reality we are all killing ourselves off slowly without them even really having to do much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their big kill events can be theoretical and extensive in nature, but their actual happenings or motivations of pulling events are severely compromised and impacted by our friends in the skies and our brothers and sisters on the ground.

       Just to get on topic, if they want to reduce the population, they'll start a global war as per usual. Reduces population and increases ingenuity. The end result is also likely to give more power to a global government. League of Nations  - United Nations - Post WW3 United World Government.

       I like where your heads at. I agree on the "aliens" being spirits/demons, because I firmly believe that we will evolve
       <em>
        spiritually
       </em>
       before we evolve
       <em>
        technologically
       </em>
       . What do you think of specific channelings? Like the Ra material, or Seth? Both of which I have learned tremendously important lessons but also feel that their material is dripping with misinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think some of the hard kills will come in the form of starvation from war and diseases. GMO kill-seeds will be involved in many places, and the blame will be put on resource distribution, not satanic science, as an excuse to build more global government infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think alien attack is the very last card they pull before they take off their sheep masks and reveal themselves as wolves. At least 40+ years down the road.

       It’s probably both. Weaken the majority population substantially through silent wars, then mop up the resistance the old fashioned way.

       Leaving aside the fact that spirits and demons don't exist (and that physics tells us that we're unlikely to ever see aliens in spaceships visiting us), why do you think the "elite" want to lower the population? What's the point?

       We are killing ourselves gladly for the elites already. We're so stupid they're probably laughing saying "gee this is too easy, those fools"
      </p>
      <p>
       But if they had to step in it would probably be with a widespread health virus that kills people quick. That way, the elites aren't at that much of a risk because they could afford the medications and precautions needed. The wealthy can survive whereas the normal person who has a 9-5 and is barely getting by is more vulnerable

       I think they've put a lot of things into action. War is an obvious one, so is psychological warfare. Not to downplay mental illness, but I believe some of it is part of this plan to get us to do ourselves, making it kind of easier to fulfill the agenda. They can get you to feel like nothing real easily. Obviously I don't have any sources on this, I'm just sort of speaking my mind here.. but it couldn't be any more obvious in my opinion.

       True. But people are impatient. If you're a super rich, economically and politically influential, sociopathic elite who has decided to capitalise on a cataclysm by seizing control of the entire world... you'd probably do what you could to subtly or even overtly hasten that cataclysm

       Good point. Combine that with all of the data harvested from the NSA and social media and you could probably make some pretty good assumptions about who the most useful slaves would be.
