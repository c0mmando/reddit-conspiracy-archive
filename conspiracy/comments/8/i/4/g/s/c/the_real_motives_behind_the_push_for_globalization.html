        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many people think the push for globalization and especially increased immigration is meant as a way to influence votes and swing elections. While this might be a secondary effect, it isn’t the primary reason for increased immigration efforts, and the real reason is closely related to globalization in general.</p>

<p>Why is China taking over the world? Why is India a growing power? These countries have especially one thing that America doesn’t - a cheap labor force.</p>

<p>However, while immigration and especially illegal immigration can contribute to that goal, it would be hard to bring enough people in to make a real difference. And even if there were enough immigrants, America still has a certain standard of living which means manpower as a whole is more expensive.</p>

<p>But what if globalists really could do away with the middle class, gut the economy, and do away with American culture? What the globalists really need is a large population of poor people to do the dirty work of running a globalist exporting powerhouse. They need the cost of living to go down, and for the cost of providing that living to go down. If Americans could live on $30 a month, then these globalist corporate overlords could produce goods with cheap labor and then export them to more prosperous countries to sell.</p>

<p>Remember, these globalists can live anywhere they like, so it’s no problem for them if America isn’t a prosperous country. The American middle class and the American standard of living is cutting into their profits, limiting the amount of profitable enterprises which can be based here.</p>

<p>If they have their way, the middle class will disappear and all of the money once going to the everyday Americans will instead be funneled into the pockets of the elites. They’re nearly finished, as you can see by looking at the wealth disparity between the richest and poorest. Unfortunately, their greed has no end and they’d rather keep taking more and more until regular Americans are living on a few bucks a week.</p>

<p>If America has a monthly salary of 30 bucks what do you think has happened to the rest of the global economy? </p>

<p>&quot;Globalists&quot; aren&#39;t destroying the middle class this is right wing paranoia condensed and distilled into pure fear mongering. </p>

<p>That must be why the wealthiest 1% added more wealth last year than the other 99% combined? I mean what do you base these theories on? Statistics from where exactly? Your ass? </p>

<p>The middle class is being destroyed by stagnation of wages and ever increasing inflation however the middle class isn&#39;t just going to evaporate. </p>

<p>They initially thought that plain old Marxism would work on the west, but it only works when there&#39;s an underclass to exploit. Since the west didn&#39;t have a large enough underclass to overthrow the government, they needed to insert an underclass into the west through immigration.</p>

<p>What does that even mean? Assuming the US is/near top economy, why would it make sense to spend capital to build up a much lower nation, just to the point where the US is currently?</p>

<p>The opportunity costs would put the US always ahead of attempting to “catch up” a struggling nation. It’s like trying to catch a kid in poverty up to the wealth levels of Paris Hilton (although great analogy on how stupidity can ruin wealth). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Between robotic manufacture, 3-d printing, AI, and intensive urban agro, an advanced society can exist without a cheap labor pool.</p>

<p>Immigration is about gene pools, not labor. Immigration is an attempt to &quot;re-balance&quot; global populations, so that the most &quot;technologically advanced&quot; humans - who tend to lose reproductive capacity - will gradually breed with more &quot;primal organic&quot; humans who still have the capacity. This promotes a well known genetic phenomenon of &quot;hybrid strength&quot;.</p>

<p>Turns out that building a civilization based on the technology we now possess (much of it not even publicly admitted) has the bad side-effect of driving the species into biological infertility and ultimate extinction. Immigration can delay the process. Test-tube babies are probably the future if we make it that far.</p>
