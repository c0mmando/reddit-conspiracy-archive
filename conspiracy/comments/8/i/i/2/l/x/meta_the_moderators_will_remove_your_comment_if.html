    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Those positions are given to them by the organisation that gives political positions to their “opponents” on the other side of the debate. That’s what the Council on Foreign Relations was designed to do. They do it so well that despite the decades of deceit, some people actually still believe that the things they’re saying are genuine. </p>

<p>They’re helped by their fellow members in the media like Dan Rathers and Wolf Blitzer. All to make you believe that what the talking heads tell you is genuine.</p>

<p>You know the old adage - “no matter who you vote for nothing ever changes” - that should be the CFR’s corporate motto. I mean really it’s 2018 for chrissake, they need to just cut the shit </p>

<p>Some things do change. It wasn&#39;t Republicans that spearheaded medical marijuana and eventually legalized it in a couple of states to combat the drug war. That was Democrats and Independents. Republicans would outlaw marijuana even medically and gays still couldn&#39;t have the basic ability to marry someone they love. Religion would be more prevalent.</p>

<p>While your council of foreign relations does sound like a convenient boogeyman. It stands to reason that a group like would always be created to discuss, foreign relations.</p>

<p>The whole &quot;they&quot; thing is really not conducive to discussion. </p>

<p>War happens when the political process breaks down and is no longer able to solve discrepancies. Take illegal immigration for instance. Within 30 years, Whites will be the minority in their own country. It&#39;s highly unlikely we are going to be able to correct this through the political process and a lot more likely that we are going to have to solve this with physical action. </p>

<p>Yes, though the Native Americans and Hawaiians can stay put. </p>

<p>For Hispanics - Deportations. Most of them speak Spanish anyway and it won&#39;t be a huge problem. </p>

<p>For Blacks:</p>

<p>1) Sterilizations</p>

<p>2) Paid deportations. We can even work out something with Mexico, Canada or another country I&#39;m sure if they&#39;d like to go there.</p>

<p>3) Possibly some kind of area near the border of Mexico where they can perish or prosper on their own. </p>

<p>Weird how they left that out of the constitution. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have it all on me, but <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lupQTyH">the intent was pretty clear</a> and the acts like the 1965 Immigration Act betrayed it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>America was also to be a male only country as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Male dominated? Naturally. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a full believer in both sexes having roles in society and the family being a model for the state.</p>

<p>Men work and bring home the money. Women have kids and take care of the family. Instead, women started working, birth rates declined, wages stagnated, job competition doubled and now kids get raised by total strangers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s pretty clear you are not worthy of any history. It will be destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m highly doubtful that people like you and foreigners/illegals are going to be willing to put your life on the line to fight for a country you either hate or see as a glorified shopping mall when it comes time.</p>

<p>If you believe diveristy is genocide. Let it be. Go to South Africa then. America is like this now and no white supremacist is going to ever change that. They are just violent cucks. Their white wives and daughters want black and brown cock.</p>

<p>They wanted this country to be an all White country and would not be happy with the current set-up. They would be classified as neo-nazi&#39;s today, when in reality they supported doing common sense things.</p>

<p>The 10 Commandments were made 2000 years ago and they still are followed today.</p>

<p>Their opinions aren&#39;t dead, but the media and corporations choose to ignore, hide or ban people who share their feelings. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why this will eventually come to a head the likes of which the world has never seen. The next civil war in the US is going to be about diversity vs homogeneity, socialism vs capitalism, homosexuality vs heterosexuality, religion vs atheism and globalism vs nationalism and it will probably end up in a world war.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not going to be much of a fight. </p>

<p>Illegals/foreigners will go back home, because America is their shopping mall, not their battlefield. They come here to eat McDonalds, not bullets. They can do that back home.</p>

<p>Far left liberals aren&#39;t going to fight, because they hate this country anyway. I could honestly see them joining our side since the antifa types will want to loot and cause their own chaos. </p>

<p>The military/police are also likely to be on our side since they are all very right wing.</p>

<p>Everything I read about the Founding Fathers makes me think they were incredibly intelligent and some of the smartest people ever in history.</p>

<p>Who is there to unite on the left? People like you want this country and it&#39;s history to die because of income disparities and racism accusations. Foreigners and illegals are here to eat McDonalds, not to eat bullets.</p>

<p>Other countries will get involved, on both sides. That&#39;s why this will eventually come to a head the likes of which the world has never seen. The next civil war in the US is going to be about diversity vs homogeneity, socialism vs capitalism, homosexuality vs heterosexuality, religion vs atheism and globalism vs nationalism which will probably result in an all out world war.</p>
