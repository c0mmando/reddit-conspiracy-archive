<blockquote>
<p>Torturing war &quot;prisoners&quot; is a terrible way to gather intelligence/information. Break someone down enough, and they&#39;ll tell you whatever <strong>you want to hear</strong> (regardless of truth/validity).  At the end of the day, it&#39;s lose lose for that &quot;prisoner&quot;, and can do more harm than &quot;good&quot;.  </p>

Stoning people is acceptable in that part of the planet, and in the US you rot in jail for smoking plants. Both are absurd, you have no right to judge.</p>

<p>Do you see torturing and killing them as your duty, since they are violent sociopaths thay value afterlife? Really? </p>

<p>I guess the same logic can be applied to you. Western countries—led by United States —are occupying richest lands in the Middle East, stealing oil and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians in the process. American rockets are destroying hospitals, schools and other vital infrastructure, wiping out whole households in the process. One could easily say, that US Government is run by psychopaths.

<p>Of course not. But let&#39;s not pretend like karmic justice is a bad thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re not sure what the developments from this are yet. MBS allegedly wants to bring his country into the modern era. There many factions vying for power at the moment, a changing of the guard could be advantageous.</p>

<p>Some of the princes had political ambitions, particularly Walid Bin Talal, so it was looting and neutralizing-of-potential-opposition op. One of the terms of their release was that they are never to participate in politics, ever. Some of them excepted the terms, others didn&#39;t (they got moved to another prison.)</p>

<p>MBS is reckless, immature dictator. Extreme, even for Al Saud standards. While he goes on spending sprees buying yachts, paintings and palaces with embezzled money, Saudi people are starving and are eating from dumpsters. Unemployment is rampant, 1 in 3 people in Saudi Arabia is unemployed. He is entangled in Yemen, in unwinnable war that is costing billions. Not to mention, war crimes and genocide he is committing in Yemen.</p>

<p>MBS is hated with passion by Saudi people. Out of all the dictatorships in the Persian Gulf, his throne is on the thinnest ice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for what you said! 🙂</p>

<p>Well, I wasn&#39;t necessarily referring to torture to gain information from our enemies. I was just making a statement. So yes, in certain instances I feel torture is acceptable.</p>

<p>But as far as torturing an enemy to gain information, I am not sure if it works. Like you said, and I&#39;ve heard from others, the enemy might provide inaccurate information. So in that case, if we can&#39;t be 100% certain of the information they will give us, then we shouldn&#39;t use torture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually, torture almost never work as expected and most information that can be obteined with it can be obtained by other means. The information obtained by torture needs to be carafully analyzed so the bias of confirming all that your torturer wants to hear is minimized.<br/>
also, the fact that the person that is being tortured has the information needed should not be a given fact. </p>
