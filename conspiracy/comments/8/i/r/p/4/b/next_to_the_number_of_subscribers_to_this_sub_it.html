      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Torturing war "prisoners" is a terrible way to gather intelligence/information. Break someone down enough, and they'll tell you whatever
        <strong>
         you want to hear
        </strong>
        (regardless of truth/validity).  At the end of the day, it's lose lose for that "prisoner", and can do more harm than "good".

       There are highly effective ways to force someone to give actionable intel that is accurate.  So i appreciate you sharing your opinion - but i wholeheartedly disagree.

       Torture is not done for any other reason other than to inflict pain and suffering on someone you hate.  That is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure we can all imagine a scenario where someone could do something to us that we would justify in our minds torturing them to death.  If you cant imagine such a scenario, you are lying to yourself or you have no imagination.

       I agree.  To fight a monster, you don’t become the monster.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a great way to slowly desensitize your population to accept treating human beings in an awful way, then just move the goal posts slowly over time until they barely notice military/police treating their own citizens similarly, because reasons.

       Exactly.  So when you are dealing with a group of people who think beheading their own kind is an acceptable form of torture you need to respond with equal force.  There are many in this world that value the afterlife more than life - they place no value on life already.  There are not many options when dealing with violent sociopaths.

       So that video of moderate US backed rebels beheading that 14 year old kid b/c they thought he was a spy for the Free Arab Army didnt happen?  k.  Stoning people is still acceptable.  Isam is only so pervasive in muslim countries because they rule with fundamental religious law.  This is reality.  Your service to the country does not make your opinion more relevant.

       Did you miss the part where I said you’re buying into sensational bullshit and shock videos? You’re proving my point. 
Stoning people is acceptable in that part of the planet, and in the US you rot in jail for smoking plants. Both are absurd, you have no right to judge.

       ISIS and Al Qaida are US-created terrorists entities, and are not representative of almost two billion Muslims. All those attacks attributed to IS/AQ  in Europe and US, are facilitated by Western governments, who have a lot to gain from them.

       Do you see torturing and killing them as your duty, since they are violent sociopaths thay value afterlife? Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the same logic can be applied to you. Western countries—led by United States —are occupying richest lands in the Middle East, stealing oil and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians in the process. American rockets are destroying hospitals, schools and other vital infrastructure, wiping out whole households in the process. One could easily say, that US Government is run by psychopaths. Do you see where I'm going with this?

       So? Are we to take actions of Saudi Arabia (a dictatorship propped by US) as an example for how we should behave?

      <p>
       Aside from the general, MBS tortured members of his own family, in order to force them to surrender their wealth to him.

       We're not sure what the developments from this are yet. MBS allegedly wants to bring his country into the modern era. There many factions vying for power at the moment, a changing of the guard could be advantageous.

       IMBS collected 100 billion dollars worth of wealth from princes in Ritz Carlton. Including the fortune of Walid Bin Talal in KSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the princes had political ambitions, particularly Walid Bin Talal, so it was looting and neutralizing-of-potential-opposition op. One of the terms of their release was that they are never to participate in politics, ever. Some of them excepted the terms, others didn't (they got moved to another prison.)
      </p>
      <p>
       MBS is reckless, immature dictator. Extreme, even for Al Saud standards. While he goes on spending sprees buying yachts, paintings and palaces with embezzled money, Saudi people are starving and are eating from dumpsters. Unemployment is rampant, 1 in 3 people in Saudi Arabia is unemployed. He is entangled in Yemen, in unwinnable war that is costing billions. Not to mention, war crimes and genocide he is committing in Yemen.
      </p>
      <p>
       MBS is hated with passion by Saudi people. Out of all the dictatorships in the Persian Gulf, his throne is on the thinnest ice.

       It's a debatable issue. I see you are taking John Fucking McCain's side on it, by the way. I guess you are supporting Trump appointment of Gina Haspel. Guess that really gets under your skin that all the news is against her. Yeah, let's root for the CIA.

       The "hard narrative" to be anti-torture stems from Bush II breaking all laws to okay it. Even before that, humanism and sci-fi stories preached against it. It's old news, bro. You have a losing battle here.

       Torture produces unreliable information. Person being tortured is going to say anything just for torure to stop. There are no exceptions under which physical or psychological torture is acceptable.
      </p>

       People advocating torture should experience torture first hand, and then asked if they still support it.

       Thank you for what you said! 🙂

       Well, I wasn't necessarily referring to torture to gain information from our enemies. I was just making a statement. So yes, in certain instances I feel torture is acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as far as torturing an enemy to gain information, I am not sure if it works. Like you said, and I've heard from others, the enemy might provide inaccurate information. So in that case, if we can't be 100% certain of the information they will give us, then we shouldn't use torture.

       actually, torture almost never work as expected and most information that can be obteined with it can be obtained by other means. The information obtained by torture needs to be carafully analyzed so the bias of confirming all that your torturer wants to hear is minimized.
       <br/>
       also, the fact that the person that is being tortured has the information needed should not be a given fact.

       A free thinkes will think for thenselves about the issue, about ANY ISSUE.

       I don’t even know who or where this “majority” is, but if they don’t like torture THEY CAN, it is you the person that is disturbed because people don’t agree with you
