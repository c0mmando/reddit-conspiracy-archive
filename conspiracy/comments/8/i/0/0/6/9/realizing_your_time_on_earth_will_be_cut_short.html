       Hi all, I've recently fallen into the 'rabbit hole' and have "woken up" as many in the conspiracy world would call it. I'm an active college student who, after learning about this grand conspiracy, has lost all motivation to even continue my studies at university. What does a system-driven education even matter if I'm just going to fall victim to the population control set in place by these globalist psychopaths in the next decade. I used to be Christian but have been an atheist for over seven years. If all of the speculation is correct, we have what, seven, maybe ten years before shit begins to really hit the fan? Some even think a WWIII style occurrence will take place in the next three years. I just feel so lost and distraught right now - almost as if I'm staring death in the face at twenty years old. How did you guys cope? Because I honestly feel like rolling into a ball and never leaving my apartment again.

       It can be overwhelming at first getting into some of that stuff. But the eugenicists and NWO facists aren't the only ones in the game. What about ETs?? What about divine intervention or luck. You aren't as powerless, as they would have you believe. It's better to do something about it than succumb to a feeling of helplessness. If you want to quit school, go ahead. But replace it with something worthwhile that can have a positive impact. Educate others, make films, start a group or hold events... something. If we the masses were as organized as the elites are they wouldn't stand a chance.

       Life won't be cut short.  It won't get as bad here as you think.

       You must realize there are people working against the NWO as well as those trying to usher it in.

       People working towards Tyranny have bad days too,  where nothing works out,  bridges are burned,  and plans crumble.

       Their plans are crumbling right now.   This reality is a crazy freight train and none of the fuckers trying to steer it have as much control over it as they think they do.

       Fair enough, just remain skeptical and don't put too much faith or hope into the Q stuff. I feel as if that could be the entire point of it, rally the truth movement behind a false prophet.

       To expand on this: Q is definitely real, there is more than enough predictive power and Q symbolism from POTUS to determine that. The only question is whether Q's a false prophet or the real deal. IMO Q is the real deal but everyone should decide for themselves. You should at least be aware of Q, because a lot of the truth movement is tied up in Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       And "incoherent ramblings" is definitely a poor way to put it. Q  presents a fairly cohesive narrative. Again, whether or not this narrative is malicious or not, time will tell.

       Use college to learn what you want (or what you want to make you money as fast as possible) and figure out how to make money and stay outside the NWO.

       Also, now that you know, you can mentally gain strength from the knowledge.  Right now it sounds like the Oh Shit phase.  Next phase is the Wait, I Know What They Know phase, and empowerment will come.

       If you really feel bad, you're still young enough to move to a rural location and enjoy nature and freedom and establish self-sufficiency (as an old man, I wish I did this in my 20s rather than enter the city).  This also allows you to raise any off-spring away from bad water, bad food, bad air, bad messenging, etc.

       Kinda self-contradictory there, since the NWO is a financial system and money is their unit of measurement.

       They're counting on you giving up. Why so nihilistic? Many people were born into hard times. I'd rather be alive now than in the dust bowl days in the Great Depression. Count your blessings, start to lift weights (it's excellent for your mental health), and find a purpose in life. Out of all the billions of lives that never came to be it's a waste to squander even one who was.

       THIS!!!! Your faith MATTERS (whatever faith it may be 💕), and you have the FREEDOM to focus on what gives you joy and meaning. For me, that is nature, my cats, my husband. I love falling down the rabbit hole, but when I get to deep, I have to ground myself in the NOW. There is power in your through process. Do not relinquish this control. Be well!

       I am applying your approach to knowledge. It cannot be applied systematically because its not based in probability. You yourself, derive a high degree of certainty from youtube videos... and pop culture reference, and speculative associations and dismiss comprehensive bodies of research advanced over centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       You struggle with the idea that almost no knowledge is certain. To the best of our understanding and collective scholarship and experience people can understand some things to a high degree of certainty, some phenomena to a solid degree of certainty and some phenomena to to some degree of certainty, and most things we kind of have a glimmer of comprehension.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is all driven by a probability derived approach that marries statistical and mathematical analysis to observation. Now every once in a while, we hit another level. So quantum theory is the glimmer of another level. The unified theory of physics if we ever discover it will be a completely other level and will likely supplant things we know with a high degree of certainty... like Newtonian Physcis... although for simple problems newtonian physcis, being a simplification can largely stand in as an adequate approximation of the rules that govern our world.

       Did you stumble upon the fact that the NWO wants to eliminate god in your rabbit hole? They want people to feel insignificant and by the look of society today it seems to be working. Cope with knowing more and more everyday, and try to be the light in a world controlled by darkness.  Also, remember you matter more than you ever could imagine. Losing hope is a win for TBTB

       I focus on the only thing I can change and that is how I feel at any moment.  I focus on being happy and have learned to find joy in most situations. We have no idea what the future will hold but if we can find joy in the now, we will always be ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep with your schooling. Use this gift of time that going to school is to learn how to find joy and make yourself some real friends. College is one other las times in your life when making friends will be a simple thing.

       So I guess you are a Christian again?  Welcome back.

      <p>
       It’s fascinating and validating to see prophecies align before our eyes, but you have to realize that the timeline is really speculative.  Things could slow down for a 100 years or more, then move forward again. The instruction from God is to be busy about His kingdom, keeping our treasures in heaven and full of hope this crazy world will be healed someday.  It’s also demoralizing to witness so much pain and injustice all around us. Our weapons are spiritual:  prayer, hope, love, and joy. And most important —
      </p>
      <p>
       “And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.”
—Hebrews 12

       If the world ends, it'll end.  If it doesn't it won't.  My advice is to just keep doing what you're doing, don't neglect life because you think it's all over soon.  Always proceed with the assumption that nothing is going to happen. But be prepared if it does, at least mentally.

       Dropped out. Acquired access to some remote land. Moved out here and started planting fruit and nut trees and digging garden beds and a root cellar. Spend far too much time on reddit arguing with assholes with authoritarian personality disorders.

       "If all of the speculation is correct, we have what, seven, maybe ten years before shit begins to really hit the fan? "
Or maybe 50-60 years, or maybe never...the last generation was taught that the Cold War was the permanent result of WW2, yet lo and behold now we are in this tucked up mess. Hope is always present, use your good fortune for someone else's good fortune.

       Not gonna lie probably need to learn how to cope with this and/or channel it into something healthy or productive. A constant I have noticed with anyone waking up to the world is an intense saddness that follows you because you realize the reality of the world.

       Find ways to distract yourself - even after years and years of following conspiracies you have to learn that a certain amount of things are out of your individual control and learn how to control the things in your life you're able.
