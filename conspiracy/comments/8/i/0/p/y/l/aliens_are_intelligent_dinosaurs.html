<p>Most dinosaurs were wiped out during the big extinction, when the earth was pounded by a huge rock. Some survived, like the alligators, loch ness monster etc. One set of dinosaurs advanced in intelligence and with 60+ million years of evolution under their belts they turned intelligent.</p>

<p>Ill go extra crazy, because fuck it why not, and say the sphinx is based on reptilian humanoids. The face of the sphinx was redesigned to hide the more prominent reptilian features.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the sphinx was a push. Intelligent dinosaurs is interesting.</p>

<p>There was a documentary in the 80&#39;s (that I saw when it was referenced in another show) and they did a &#39;reconstruction&#39; of what they believed intelligent dinosaurs would look like. Bear in mind these people were academics and not nut-jobs. What was amazing is how closely they resembled &#39;greys&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always wondered why scientists seem to assume they were all &quot;dumb reptiles&quot; and relate them to modern animals like lizards and chickens; knowing they had millions of years to evolve. How smart were the smartest of them? hmmm... And knowing how our brains are designed to rationalize based on our experience and give us an explanation just to put itself to rest. Makes it an interesting thought experiment. Thanks homie</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alligators or crocodiles for example, haven&#39;t evolved for millions of years. They have no need to evolve, they are unstoppable at what they do. What nature has shown us over the millennia though, Is that intelligent design always wins out over brute strength. So while the T-rex may have been the fiercest predator, the raptors were the smartest and worked in groups.</p>

<p>There is nothing within the realm of possibility that says humanoid like reptiles couldn&#39;t have evolved in the same way that chimps/primates became human.</p>

<p>Raptors could walk upright already, they had advanced social groups compared to other dinosaurs and an advanced language. It isn&#39;t a far stretch to think that some raptors became more intelligent...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically same idea. Humans evolved intelligence in like a million years. Our gene pool came out of just a few species.</p>

<p>Dinos had hundreds of millions of years and millions of species. I dunno if you are big on evolution theory, but it isn&#39;t a guaranteed thing. Sentience is a happy accident. Dinos just had way more time and variety to increase the odds exponentially. </p>

<p>Then we move into hollow earth theory. Which I don&#39;t think is hollow like an egg, I think they just dug tunnels or something, similar to our DUMBs. </p>

<p>In fact, there was that one guy, I forget his name atm, but he said they accidentally tunneled in to one of these areas, and a huge fight ensured. Shit I wish I could remember his name. His story was impossible. But he was so genuine to me, and had some material samples...eventually, wheelchair bound mind you lol, he supposedly strangled himself with his own catheter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible that dinosaurs or homosaurus (does that sound like a gay dinosaur?) existed and were wiped out by catastrophe.</p>

<p>Their intelligence wouldn&#39;t have to be on the same level as ours, just imagine early humanoids coming across homosaurus&#39; writings, drawings or scriptures. We were pretty simple back then, a homosaurus wouldn&#39;t have to be Einstein to look more intelligent or even as intelligent as early day human.</p>

<p>Maybe this is my own bias because I think there was a civilisation before ours. Be it primate in origin or &#39;other&#39; I believe this early civilisation made it Mars before being wiped out on Earth (natural event) and on Mars (man made destruction). I also believe that our Gods and religious stories stem from remnants found of that previous civilisation.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe they lived alongside us but died out due to the Earth warming or cooling or even a lack of food. We humans can live anywhere. Can lizards live anywhere?</p>

<p>I also find it very weird that Fish and mammals have dominated the oceans, while Lizards and reptiles (which kick arse in aquatic environments) are rarely seen in the oceans. </p>

<p>Did global warming or a climate shift become too great for large reptiles to continue? </p>
