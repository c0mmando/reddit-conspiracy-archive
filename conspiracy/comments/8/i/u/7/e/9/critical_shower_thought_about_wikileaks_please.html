       ok so bear with me I'm trying to get this all down before it leaves me....
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        wikileaks HAS to controlled by tptb.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       the big giveaway is that it is centralized.  like everything they do. its the whole system in very few hands (assange supposedly)  this is their hallmark.  they want to control everything and always want power (or in this case - information) into fewer and fewer hands.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        what they are most worried about&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  (truth getting out(whistleblowers))
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       think about how many of us truthers their are now....   we should be seeing whistleblowing happening all over the globe at unprecedented rates.   but all we have is assange and maybe Q  who I'm sure are bad actors
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        how would they stop whistleblowing?   (think about how YOU(they) would stop whistleblowers.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       they only way I can think of is to set up a premier whistleblowing organisation and gatekeep the information coming through.   allowing to eliminate people and information at source.
      </p>
      <p>
       if anyone else were to set up a wikileaks it would be shut down IMMEDIATELY  please don't dare to prove me wrong you will be in a world of trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       if another wikileaks were set up, they would immediately flood it with false information.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        on a side note I was thinking that they must already have other contingency plans for this too...
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       for example why give us the internet  and give us a brief age of information..  sure they have all but shut us down already but that was a big risk....    they must have another way too to shut us up so be careful and aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       so solutions ....
      </p>
      <p>
       I only spent 5 mins on this so I'm hoping some others might have ideas going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       what we need is a decentralized way for people to leak.
      </p>
      <p>
       every town and city has a drop box set up by us(outpost)... the truthers.
      </p>
      <p>
       as info comes in to your town... either post it online.  or if its too spicy.   distribute to every other outpost and let others decide if they dare post it. or maybe someone can think of a way to post anonymously.
      </p>
      <p>
       thoughts please.... am I way of the mark?    any thoughst to improve this theory greatly appreciated

       i reckon you have to take it for granted that the comm is going to be intercepted and your sec is in how you encode.  it's a language issue, of sorts.  it's not network dependent.
      </p>
      <p>
       that said, if one wants to create an adhoc mesh net it's as easy as spinning up hostapd.

       Everything Wikileaks had was hacked by Israel during the JCPOA negotiations. Clinton's server was revealed by Israel bc it had talks with Iran on it. Israel thought it would discredit the Iran deal. After that didn't work, they did everything up to the point of just an all out assault on democrats to get a republican to end the deal which trump did. We know Israel worked with Cambridge and that they hacked Congress the white house and both RNC DNC. If it was Russia, they would of leaked both sides to cause chaos, but only democrats were hit. Plus Russia is Iran's ally. Unless Putin Trump Netanyahu made a trilateral agreement, Wikileaks being FSB GRU is silly.

       This is anti-Wikileaks disinfo that is being blasted due to Assange having no internet, allowing rumors to spread more easily without him being able to defend himself. Just like the rumors of him being dead/arrested the last time his internet was cut. Move on.

       No.  You’ve made a lot of assumptions.  Even if somebody swallows a few of them for the sake of the point, you’ve made a huge assumption that there must be tons of whistleblowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let’s go so far as to even assume THAT one is true. Even if They were crawling all over DC, they have spent many more years watching the corruption and watching others who whistle blow go down or get murdered. They’re not like you, where they’re just suddenly realizing shit.  Seth rich was fucking murdered outside his house for going to WikiLeaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slow your assumption roll. You’re just getting started, and you need to sit back and use your powers of observation for a while.

       No.  You’ve made three assumptions.  They may be true, they may not.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can agree it needs to be safe to blow the whistle.  We can also agree it’s not currently safe to.

       First off, the extent to which government, intelligence, and military whistleblowers have been persecuted and prosecuted for revealing corrupt and criminal activities that have been classified or fraudulently covered up in order to keep them from ever becoming known is enough to make anyone that inadvertently uncovers such things to think twice about risking their lives or throwing away any possibility of still having anything like normal one if they were to ever openly expose it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prospects of whistleblowing even under more ordinary circumstances where someone stumbles upon some corporate corruption or deliberate negligence or frauds are equally dim with the possibility of being sued and having to spend a fortune to try and defend themselves and being blacklisted and shunned in terms of what they'll be able to do for a living afterwards no matter how honest, competent and reliable a person they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just what are the odds on it actually having something like a positive outcome if they do? Obviously the closer to the top anyone that's guilty of such things is the less likely they are to ever suffer any consequences for it as we have seen time, and time, again.
      </p>
      <p>
       WikiLeaks has provided a relatively risk-free way for any and all whistleblowers to anonymously pass along and publicise that kind of information. It along with Assange, it's founder, also been constantly under siege both by governments and law-enforcement looking to shut them down for doing so any way they can.

       If it is, it's not because it started out that way but because it's finally been compromised and infiltrated by the US government, just as Assange has been compromised and silenced by the US government putting serious pressure on Ecuador's government.

       I think we'd see some evidence of that if that was true, meanwhile a great deal of embarrassing information has in fact come out about the CIA an NSA in particular as well as the NSA having all of it's hacking tools hacked. These weren't things that either the agencies or the people at the top in the government ever wanted known, nor that many commercial software makers hadn't been informed about numerous potential exploits that put their clients and data at risk. I have a difficult time calling that "gatekeeping". I also don't think that Assange's troubles are a hoax or that the desire to extradite and prosecute him isn't authentic. HRC and many others were very obviously pissed with him both off and on the record, but as you say, we'll have to wait and see.
