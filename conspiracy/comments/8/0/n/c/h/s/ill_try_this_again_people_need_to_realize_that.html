       There are so many subreddits, and so many power-users dedicated to highlighting our differences in skin color, and not in a positive way. They polarize this website just like the political subreddits do. It's not their intention to bring about cultural awareness, nor is it their goal to show the good in all sides. They are simply shaking up the snow globe over and over to keep people bickering about our colors instead of important issues. People WILL NOT come together, and tackle societies REAL problems, so long as we hate each other. Its simple as that. Everyone needs to understand that our rights, as people, are under attack all the time.

       Wholesomeness, at least on this website, is being used as Mass Censorship v0.5. And is YET AGAIN, a polarizing tactic. Not only that, it is the most low-effort content-recycling bullshit to hit this website, ever. Its so easy to repost the same thing over and over to keep traffic up, so long as it's "wholesome" and they will ban anyone in a second, if they pose a threat to this idea. It's far too easy to keep false numbers up if you have 5 subreddits all posting the same thing, fudging the votes and making it to the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing, the move to take away seeing how many downvotes a post has, has allowed posting bots, shills, and vote manipulation to FLOURISH. Bring that shit back, and people will truly see how the front page is a place for SPONSORED content.

       It's hard to tell what is a political subreddit and what isn't anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       todayIlearned - frequently has TIL's against Nazi's and anything saying something good about a black person is getting to the front page
      </p>
      <p>
       r/nba - Swore to keep the politics out, then the Warriors weren't invited to the White Hous.e Anytime a player says something about Trump, it's at the top. I saw someone get a -400 once on a post during a hijacked thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/squaredcircle - Constantly trying to push topics about gay wrestlers. One of the mods, u/ANAL_CAVITIES, told the community to call people cucks who didn't agree with one wrestler having to apologize to all black wrestlers for a comment that happened 2 decades ago. Multiple anti-Trump mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/pics - Constantly has pics with Anti-Trump stuff
      </p>
      <p>
       r/videos - Despite having a no politics policy, they upvoted some anti-nazi post to the top of the sub. When questioned about this, they locked, but not deleted the thread. This ensured it stayed up. Mods then banned and muted anyone who protested.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/technology - All anti-Trump stuff all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/television - Has a "no politics except late night shows" rule. So everyday, whenever one of the usual fools makes a joke, it gets to the front. Since there's a late night show 5 nights out of the week, plus Bad Teeth Tonight, it's 24/7 anti-trump all the time.

       It's hard to police something that has so many people invested, it's like going onto social media during the super bowl and seeing it EVERYWHERE and wondering why. I don't care for sports unless it's a local hockey game, but most people care about it and there's not much I can do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you like Trump, those negative posts are going to pop out at you more than the rest, especially since the subject is being treated like the most popular reality TV show in history. Everyone has to talk about what happened in yesterdays episode, even up here in buttfuck nowhere canada it's the talk of the town. Another key factor is that Reddit doesn't have borders and most countries outside of the US heavily dislike the current US administration, so it makes sense from from what you're seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to change peoples minds you have to plant seeds. Going onto the league of legends board and saying that there shouldn't be gay characters or simply claiming that it's blatant pandering, you should expect to get shit on since you're dropping bombs instead of asking something like 'Why can't they make a new character that's gay instead of rewriting their other characters stories?' Of course they're going to ban you if you openly criticize a percentage of their customers, since it's all about not offending paying customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're having a hard time finding upvoted pro-nazi posts on REDDIT? I'm surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black history is something that many people want to learn about, thus why it's popular, especially since the schooling system likes to gloss it over (and there's also a whole month dedicated to it). If you read about it more you'll find plenty of conspiracy campaigns going in that direction as well, some of them current. I suggest reading more of it with a refreshed perspective instead of defending the nazi's first.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that it's okay people are getting shit on, just pointing out why. If you're constantly being shunned by the majority you might want to investigate the WHY instead of just putting it off as 'because they're liberal anti-trumpers and they don't get it like US'. That's a dangerous way of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all fall too far into our own filter bubbles. Try and disprove your own beliefs as an exercise, it's fun and you always learn something. I'd still be giving scam artists like Steven Greer my money if I stayed in that mindset a few years back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still believe in aliens currently being on earth and whatnot, but that guy took full advantage of my pre-existing beliefs. Finally clicked he was TELLING me what to believe while at the same time I avoided critical videos of people calling him out. I labeled them all as shills and poo-poo'd on anything that Greer told me to stay away from.

       One nitpick I do have however, is that I didn't tell people to call anyone a cuck other than myself, as I really like the idea of massive black erect cocks inserting themselves into my significant other while I watch, and the positive enforcement pleases me.
      </p>

       Finally, as for the anti-Trump mods, I'll get on this immediately! Having people around with different opinions on matters can't possibly be a good thing, and this will be stopped at once. It's bad enough we have a few drunken potato loving terrorists on the team, a WOMAN from Canada (aka Northern Mexico - BUILD THE CEILING!) and ANOTHER (LESBIAN?!?!) WOMAN from across the entire globe on the team. Now that I think about it it's easy to see where all these radical leftist ideas are coming from.

       I tend to agree. Half a million people belong to this sub. It regularly hits
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . This is one of the places on reddit where people discuss the possibility of conspiring and corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of it could be "flame wars" started deliberately, maybe even with bots.

        The gist of what I do is teach computers to do sentiment analysis on social media posts that are of interest to clients, tag them based on their various properties (author, sentiments, keywords, etc), and add them to a giant graph of all social media posts we're interested in, who else has retweeted them or the link, who responded to them, etc. We use this to estimate exposure numbers and influence, and try to isolate the key people in a social graph which are causing an opinion to form. (Ideally, on the order of minutes or hours instead of days or weeks.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Once we isolate key people, we look for people we know are in their upstream -- people that they read posts from, but who themselves are less influential. (This uses the same social media graph built before.) We then either start flame wars with bots to derail the conversations that are influencing influential people (think nonsense reddit posts about conspiracies that sound like Markov chains of nonsense other people have said), or else send off specific tasks for sockpuppets (changing this wording of an idea here; cause an ideological split there; etc).
The goal is to keep opinions we don't want fragmented and from coalescing in to a single voice...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By doing this, it can create an avalanche, stirring up a bunch of shit between users, fragmenting everyone into these small polarized groups. It will continue to perpetuate after the shills and bots leave. I don't think they have to do very much. Just target certain ideas and certain people when necessary.

      <p>
       Juts looking at the front page, and I don't see anything really that is arguably political - as in DEMS DID IT, or REPUBS DID IT.  It;s one of the places where I can go and not have to be worried about having every other post be "TRUMP IS GOD" or "FUCKTRUMP" or "HILLARY4JAIL" or whatever.

       Dude the mods here are very conservative and are not afraid of showing it. They'll threads that are negative of Trump in contest mode.

       One of the mods went to

       I didnt say that the mods didnt have a political bent.  So, if a moderator has ANY politcal thoughts, the sub is automatically political?  I just said I didnt see anything specifically political being listed right now and that thia sub is not being bombarded with the anti/pro trump or anti/pro hillary stuff.

       It is what you make it, just like anything in life.  There are shitty people that go to church there are politicians that are good.  Yin and Yang and all that.  If you are smart, which I assume you are, it will be tough to wade through the minutia, but  by now you should be able to disseminate and eliminate quick enough to just pass all that BS by.

       Wait a minute.  Are you implying that there are people who actually believe Reddit is free, open, and neutral?  It's one of the most visited social media platforms on the planet.

       Plus, all of reddit, even before subreddit were added, was highly liberal.  Because of that, it's always been a target for right wing groups.  Makes for quite the nice little war that just keeps on going back and forth.  In a way, it's a microcosm of America :D

       Are you saying that there was no organic sub growth during the most controversial election in recent history?

      <p>
       Or do you have some proof (or even evidence) that the majority of the traffic increase was, in fact, "shills?"

       What exactly is a shill anyway? A liberal being paid to post liberal talking points? A conservative being paid to post liberal talking points? Someone who is politically disinclined who is paid to post liberal talking points?

       Since shills are anonymous, its obviously pretty difficult to provide hard evidence. But I trust my own eyes and intuition, I saw a sudden difference with all the hallmarks of shilling that have become even more common since then (such as a certain type of mocking, and sudden changes to vote patterns, among others). And the sub has never gone back to being a place where you could have reasonable discourse even when going against the mainstream neolib/neocon narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its fine if you disagree and its pointless to argue about. I gain nothing from convincing you, I'm just explaining my point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an aside, I was a little bored at work and looked at a bit of your history. At the risk of sounding like I'm presuming to know a lot about you (I realize I don't), it sounds like we had a relatively similar experience with relationships, except that my experience happened nearly 6 years ago. It was sort of the catalyst that helped my drop my Marxist indoctrination and that hugely changed my life for the better. It also changed what kind of partner I was looking for, and found. I'm much happier now, and am very thankful for that painful experience. I only say this because your comments remind me a lot of myself back then.

       A better response than I deserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just have a hard time believing there is this large mass of people who are paid to espouse political opinions that they don't necessarily agree with in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, lets say I'm a diehard anti-2nd amendment protester type. If :insertshillorghere: is paying me by the post to spread what I already hold as my opinion, does that make me a shill?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if I'm not being paid and I'm just a very activist anti-gun spokesperson on social media who frequents places that are often associated with shilling and shares their talking points...still a shill?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for relationships...I'm glad you've found something that makes you happy. I dont think I've posted much about mine here but I suppose there's probably a drunk comment or two buried in my history. Co-dependence is a hell of a drug but I've worked hard to pick up the pieces of myself that were shed throughout my relationship over the last few months. I appreciate the reassurance.

      <p>
       If they are paying you to do so, I think it would. And its hard to say how I feel without sounding condescending. I just think that these people have become really,
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       good at influencing public opinion. I think I was a big victim of it, and now that I'm more aware of it, I see it constantly and I even fall prey to it. I guess what I'm saying is that I feel that many of these movements are not actually organic, and that those with power have ulterior motives for pushing many of them. So there are many people who mean well, who support things that are actually not in the best interests of the people, in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think most people who sound like shills are not paid. The actual shills biggest job is to plant narratives and to push them with vote botting. This gets normal people to join them and start doing the work for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I know this is a lot of unproven and mostly unprovable speculation, but its how I honestly feel. And at the risk of sounding like bragging, I've done really well academically (I graduated from a top 10 law school) and now in my work life. So I don't feel too bad about relying on and trusting in my intuition. Of course, I don't talk about these conspiracies with basically anyone in real life. I can't risk it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for relationships, I know how hard it is after being with someone for a long time. I was incredibly jaded and almost started viewing all women negatively. I know you didn't ask for advice, but I would just realize that, if you can set aside your pride, you have nothing to lose. I had by far the best luck when I just approached relative strangers and asked about whatever interested them. My current partner is more traditional and conservative, and I know I'm biased because I have that mindset as well, but it just feels so much healthier and more natural than my previous relationship. We each have our own roles, and it just feels right to play them. Almost like we evolved to be that way. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, despite our disagreements, you seem cool and I genuinely hope things work out for you.

       Absolutely. I've always been of the opinion that if it

       be manipulated, it's completely ignorant and irresponsible to think it

       manipulated. Shit, it would almost be irresponsible for TPTB to

       manipulate it, if it's within their power and serves their interest.

       I noticed it when I posted a comment and expected mass downvotes. When it stayed at 1 I got suspicious and logged out.

       Sure enough, my comment disappeared. I think it can be done at the comment level because I can keep posting and see new ones.

       I don't think making a Reddit a divisiveness generator was an intended outcome.  In the early days it (the posts, the users, the general zeitgeist) was completely different in tone and not very political at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what or who fomented the change. I believe they were owned by Conde Nast at some point, which is an extremely liberal company.

       a place for robust debate. Its a glorified popularity contest and echo chamber. One you understand that and are okay with it, its alright. Gotta use the right tool for the job though, and this ain't it.

       I started to realize this about a month ago. so I created a sub Reddit dedicated to save the world.its amazing the unsavory comments I received.But the strange part is. Some people say exactly the same things to the letter like robots.So it seems some powerful people like to directly influence what we think and say.

       I feel like this could be taken a step further; which is to say media is a polarizing tool. Any time (but I suppose not every?) something is owned, it is purposed. And at this point, reddit is social media.

       The smartest thing that the powers that be have done is make an atmosphere of self-censoring. People hold unquestioned truths about the world that they work hard to teach you from a young age. It's not strange the concept of American Exceptionalism when you consider that half of children recite the pledge on the daily, mass media and television (now the internet) is a cultural filter they control to make some things just unsayable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to document here a few polarizing for reasons that most people have never considered questioning.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Eating animal products. Manipulators have intricately lined the American psyche into the idea that meat is manly and so forth.
Biggest cause of erectile dysfunction yet people will defend the right to shovel meat to the detriment of one's health and those around them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Driving everywhere instead of walking, cycling and public transport. Great evidence even from within the USA, that reducing private motor vehicle use would be of benefit to everyone.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gun ownership. No country on earth is so divided.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fear of socialism and communism even though policies enacting what some European countries are some of the most popular imaginable.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Elon Musk is a case study of what millions of dollars when you spend it on online lobbyists can do.
You end up with cycles of karma farmers perpetuating the sponsored circlejerk to the masses.

       Not saying I don't see colour because that would be ignorant, but people need to treat people as individuals instead of putting people into groups all time. Certain religious idealogies do scare me though, and I can't see the Abrahamic religions ever getting on if I'm being honest. In an ideal world everyone should come together, but we're still too tribal at the moment so it would be a disaster.
