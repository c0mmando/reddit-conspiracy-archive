       Think about it:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bush admin knew the intel was very faulty, knew that certain people had cherry picked pieces of intel to make their case, and yet still did it.  Many people within the admin knew that the case for going into Iraq was just not there.  But they wanted to go for other reasons that no one wanted to admit.  And so they just let it all happen.

       Things may not be as obvious as we like to imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a growing number of people are going back through the archival footage of the 'bombing of Baghdad' and noticing some comical anomalies.

       Technically, I would point out it's not the RESULT of a conspiracy, but IS a conspiracy - they manufactured a false pretense IN ORDER to invade Iraq.  The entire thing, as a whole, is one giant initiative.

       If 9/11 and the Anthrax scare didn't happen,  we probably wouldn't have made it in there. So I argue that it is also the result of conspiracies.

       I don't think it was so much an "intelligence failure" as it was deliberate deception. The Jews and their collaborators who cooked up the laughable "evidence" of WMD's etc. knew it was all nonsense, but that was not their concern.

       They wanted a war and they got one.

      <p>
       When one factors in the blood and treasure this war cost us, to say nothing of the Iraqis it killed, the fraud behind the Iraq war should be the biggest scandal in the history of US politics, dwarfing Teapot Dome, Watergate, the Grant Administration, but instead there is nothing.

       I don't think it was a Conspiracy. If you read The Project for the New American Century it plans out everything we are seeing take place. 
The conspiracy would be that the public was lied to on 9/11 and lied to about the reasons we invaded several ME countries. Everything was planned.

       Yes. They got a man, an Iranian nuclear scientist Codename Curveball, to attest to working in a facility in Iraq that worked with weapons grade nuclear material. He detailed the deliveries into the facility, noting structures that had been altered a few years prior. It was fabricated, start to finish, save for his background as a scientist.

       Cheney was providing intel to Judith Miller a reporter of the NYT's so that he could point to the NYT's articles a verification of their intel.  It's literally the same thing people are saying happened with the Dossier &amp; FISA court.  It was by definition a conspiracy to create and fabricate evidence to get us into war... just like the Nayirah testimony

       It was recent and quickly exposed as untrue.

       Of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's the thing conspiracy theorists should take note: millions of people were against the Iraq war from the beginning, especially in the UK, where it basically damaged Tony Blair's political career. The masses are not always blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       It never made sense to link Iraq to 911, except to play on the xenophobic fear of some in the US against all Muslims after 911, this fear continues today and is most prominent in the alt-right movement. Think about that.

       The fear I am talking about is hard to describe, but everybody knows the children's story of "The Emperor's New Clothes". What kept the entire population from seeing the nakedness of the Emperor?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the story, only that one child was not afraid, so he said it. He was too innocent to know the danger, the guardedness, the strangeness, the disbelief, the horrible doubt people felt after that event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every "grown up" newscaster, politician, general, celebrity, and athlete drank the koolaid, and turned around and handed the cup to us. If you were the one that doubted, there was fear. If you were there that day, that week, those first two years, can you reach back and feel it any more?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's taken nearly two terrible decades for that fear to turn completely to rage.

       Even immediately after 911, there were plenty of people keeping a cool head and opposed bombing Afghanistan or engaging in a war there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media, then and now, was only interested in feeding whatever latest hype.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were part of the protest movement against the Iraq war, you would know the rage started from the beginning when those protests were essentially ignored by the people in power.

       The playbook for the iraq invasion was drafted up by PNAC years before it happened.  Also think about how they had a 16,000+ page document ready to be signed almost immediately after 9/11. The patriot act was fast tracked and had been written far before the attacks.  Not to mention Urban Moving Systems, dancing israelis, who owned the HVAC company doing work in the towers months leading up to the attack, lucky Larry Silverstein and fam, purchase of the twin towers in June 2001 from the NY Port Authority, double insurance taken out on towers by lucky Larry in the rare event of terrorists attack, the 45 degree angle melted steel cuts of the support columns at ground zero, rumsfeld declaring 2.1 trillion missing on 9.10.2001 and the missl..i mean plane that hit the pentagon just happened to destroy the part of the pentagon that held the files to investigate the trillions missing and killed 41 of the 42 internal auditors working on the missing trillions, building 7, bbc reporting attacks 20 minutes ahead of the actual first plane hitting the towers, the sweetheart deep state relationship of israel, Saudi Arabia, and the US still going strong today, the billions made by haliburton for not just weapons manufacturing but also supplying airports with body scanners, all materials from fallen builiding being shipped and destroyed asap by guilianni without even 1 meep about maybe we should investigate the crime scene, whats up with the inverted black cube fountain memorial and the oculus building outside freedom tower......etc etc.. Anyways theres absolutely no conspiracy here at all, random evil sand people made 3 buildings collapse into their own footprint with 2 planes that day in NY, how do we know well the MSM said it was bin laden 45 minutes after 1st tower collapse and a hijackers passport from inside the plane literally in the heart of the jet fuel explosion thankfully somehow floated from on high into the FBIs hands so we can know for sure no conspiracy is involved and it was evil sand people. Now be still little one and remember: "Mission Accomplished" "We Got Him" "Go Shopping"

       Conspiracy - a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter WMDs lol Lying to the america public was against the law in 2001. The Bush administration and many of the highranking members did break the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in 2015, Obama legalized weaponize propaganda to the American public by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes. It was a conspiracy, they realized the legal troubles it could have spelled, and they corrected that error by Obama writing into law that the government can lie to its citizens anytime for any reasons.

       According to the UK ambassador to the US at the time, Christopher Meyer, in his 2005 book,
       <em>
        DC Confidential
       </em>
       , Henry Kissinger gave a "powerful and convincing presentation" justifying the invasion of Iraq during his annual speech at Bohemian Grove in July 2002.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was the beginning, he said, of a new era in international relations. It marked the end of a period inaugurated by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. One of the treaty's principles was the sanctity of national sovereignty: on this basis the modern nation-state had come into being. Now, in certain circumstances, continued Kissinger, action violating a national frontier could be justified. But he set out three conditions: Military action must be brought to a rapid and successful conclusion; the US had to get the diplomacy right; and it had to arrive in Baghdad with a clear plan for the succession to Saddam. In the event, none of Kissinger's conditions was met.

       Yup.  Best evidence that comes to my mind is General Wesley Clark's statements.  10 days after 9/11 a general told Clark wars were planned, 7 countries in 5 years.  A little behind schedule but still on course.
