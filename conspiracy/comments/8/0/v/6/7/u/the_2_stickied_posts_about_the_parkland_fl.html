       There's a lot more to this Parkland shooting hoax than some crisis actor with political aspirations, or some bullshit about the sheriff not prosecuting teen crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we should be talking about is how it appears the Parkland shooting is likely a hoax, or a possible set up by the FBI.  This was Sandy Hook 2.0
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the witnesses interviewed said they had a fake code-red drill in the morning, a practice run basically where students were taught about active shooter response.  Teachers and students reported they were warned officers would fire blanks, people would scream, and there would be fake bodies.  Then Nikolas Cruz just happens to show up later that day in an Uber,  and now they can run a code-red live?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why FBI and law enforcement responded so quick, they were already there set up and ready to go after the morning practice run
      </p>
      <p>
       All witness testimony points to the shooting being just another drill.  Many students said they thought they had just been through another drill, and didn't know it was a real shooting until they saw the news later after school. 
 A student saw Nikolas Cruz exiting the school with a group of students while shots were being fired on the other side of the building.  Other students reported a shooter on each stairwell (2 total in the freshman building - one on each side), trapping them inside and forcing them into classrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Not a shred of actual evidence has been shown that this was anything but a drill, or that Nikolas Cruz did any shooting.  Not a single Facebook, Instagram, or social media account can be found for any of the victims that existed before the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cruz was a kid that no one liked.  He was autistic, had emotional problems, and had no friends. No one is going to miss him.  How he was able to afford a small arsenal on a DollarTree salary has not been revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much to this story I'm considering writing an entire book.  The lack of any real discussion
       <em>
        here
       </em>
       of all places really serves to demonstrates how heavily brigaded this sub has become. 
 I guess this sub's real purpose is to simply quarantine and squash these conspiracies so they don't spread to the sheep

       I agree, this is like Sandy Hook all over again, they completely lost the plot pretty much immediately. It would be awesome if you wrote a book about all of the strange anomalies and problems with the official story. I only woke up to the fact that Sandy Hook was a hoax after Pizzagate broke, I think a lot of people were woken up in a similar fashion as a result of the last election cycle. This kind of bullshit needs to be exposed, the time is now.

       People completely loses there shit when you say something didn't happen was a hoax and used actors to push the narrative. Especially when children are involved. The more they can't prove these things happened the way they say they do the more I stop paying attention altogether to these events.

       Why should we ever pay attention to them? I hate the news. I don't need to hear about every time someone gets killed, day in and day out.  I don't know why people get as obsessed about these events as they are with celebrities and anything else on TV.

       I don't need to know. Sorry about their loss, but I can't do anything about it. It adds nothing to my life knowing about it, but it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a distraction and negativity. I don't need to hear all the negative stories. Anytime someone dies tragically it must be reported on TV, and
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       needs to know about it! God forbid if I am spared from hearing about the latest massacre. Whatever would I do if I don't know about it??
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time I'm exposed to CNN is at a doctor's office, which is thankfully drowned out by my earphones listening to absolutely anything in the world else. I get useful news from other sources, just not from brain-dead talking heads on the Big Brother Screen. The most annoying sound in the world is the way news anchors speak, with their ridiculously fake cadence, and indifference to the carnage they report. Robots would be better, but in fact I'll avoid it altogether.

       But anytime someone dies tragically it is NOT exposed on television. My aunt and uncle died in a plane crash and let me tell you, cnn did not cover it. There are only certain events that cnn headlines, and the way they unfold are not the way a real tragedy unfolds. In particular... people not being rushed to the hospital to be properly treated and possibly save a life.

       I understand. But to further prove my point... why the fuck is there a cop carrying a body like it’s on a battle field?  Why are there no first responders and why, once again, are there no people being rushed by ambulance and helicopter to the nearest hospital. Doctors save lives, right?  This video is BS.

       You also make good points. My buddy made another good point about how only certain school shootings are televised. He said there was one recently in Dallas. Made me think. Only the ones with approved video content and actors are made into national stories. Unplanned shooting leave too many variables to report on.

       Great post.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Shooter was 19 &amp; had over $800k (likely much more...see below) trust fund. What reason has been provided that he would need to live with a legal guardian?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why no mention in national convo of his mother selling her Parkland home in January 2017 for $575k?  Or where the Cruz family then lived from January to her death in November?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cruz's adopted father, owned/ran biz that did $85M (2018 value) annual revenue back in 1988.  A CEO/co-owner of a nearly $100M biz most probably maintains a life insurance policy...that would have paid out $$$ when he suddenly passed in 2004.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cruz's mother appears to have settled a wrongful death lawsuit against dead husband's cardiologist...settling outside of court in 2010 for an undisclosed amount of $$$.
        </p>

       You know what's "funny" is you never see anyone dying in these events. 9/11 not so much, I still remember people jumping out the windows to avoid burning alive. False flags aren't what they used to be.

       Honestly if they want these events to have an impact on public consciousness like they use to, they need to show absolutely horrific shit like people jumping out of skyscrapers. With most people know these events just past people by as nothing more then negative noise.

        There's a lot more to this Parkland shooting hoax than some crisis actor with political aspirations, or some bullshit about the sheriff not prosecuting teen crime.
I agree, yet these those things are quite evidently part of the larger conspiratorial picture.  So what's wrong with discussing them?
       </p>
       <p>
        A student saw Nikolas Cruz exiting the school with a group of students while shots were being fired on the other side of the building. Other students reported a shooter on each stairwell (2 total in the freshman building - one on each side), trapping them inside and forcing them into classrooms.
       </p>

       Could you cite the source of these claims?  I haven't been following too closely this last week.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The lack of any real discussion here of all places really serves to demonstrates how heavily brigaded this sub has become.
The meaningful discussions delving deeper into the conspiracy are abundant if you sort by new posts and don't mind sifting through the noise.

       Excellent post OP.  Everyone needs to watch this video for proof of the fact that it was psyop/drill, and that the students were told there would be a "code red" active shooter drill that day, with "cops firing blanks":

       It's a straight up Hoax like Sandy Hook. Drills the same day, Cops in the dark standing down, BLATANT crisis actor kids practicing lines on camera. The cherry on Top is the censorship, they closed numerous alternative media accounts on Youtube/FB, they are trying to purge all critical view points.

       100% agree OP. It's sad how infiltrated/controlled Reddit has become. This "Shooting" is one of the most obvious hoaxes I have ever seen. This "survivors" just eating up all the media attention is a spectacle to behold. Everyone has their price.

       All of this is bullshit and just a byproduct of a much grander scheme. Open you fking eyes.

       You all need to remember that this is just merely a game.

       The last bastion of your freedom is sitting in your home right now, a gun. These school shootings, and other gun related incidents are just causing mass hysteria among the people to trick them to give up there last bastion of freedom, there guns.

       The goal has always, and will always be to disarm the people. Either they do it by force, or they use means by making ourselves do it.

       Sure this kid was crazy, but what was done to stop his shooting spree, nothing, it was allowed to happen. They are slowly but surely chipping away at our right to bear arms.

So I think OP needs to deliver

       I understand. But to further prove my point... why the fuck is there a cop carrying a body like it’s on a battle field?  Why are there no first responders and why, once again, are there no people being rushed by ambulance and helicopter to the nearest hospital. Doctors save lives, right?  This video is BS.
