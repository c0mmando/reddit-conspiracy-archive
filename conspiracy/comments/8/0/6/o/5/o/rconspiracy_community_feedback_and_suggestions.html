<p>This is a post for feedback and user opinions on the current state of the conspiracy subreddit. </p>

<p>The moderators would appreciate your feedback, suggestions and observations of the sub and how the moderators can help improve the overall quality of the page. We do listen and want honest observations and opinions but please keep your posts civil and on point. </p>

<p>The nature of the subreddit has changed somewhat in recent times, we often see posts that suggest that r/conspiracy has become more politicised than it perhaps once was. </p>

<p>As a result of such posts the moderators want to ask for your own thoughts and observations. </p>

<p>What do you like about the page, what can we improve upon? </p>

<p>The moderator team is human (mostly) and we are not perfect but above all we want to uphold the page&#39;s mission statement and listen to the user base.</p>

<p>As always please be respectful of differing opinions and let&#39;s try to use this post to help the page and the community move forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the problem is that there is a flood of these accounts that do this sort of shit, and then report people for calling them on their shilling.</p>

<p>so unless you guys can do something to deal with the actual shills, you are just going to keep banning legit users who get baited by groups like JIDF and TMOR and try to call them out on their bullshit.</p>

<p>banning people for calling out the shills just makes it easier for them to do their work as you guys end up being their strong men and ban anyone who tries to fight back against it.</p>

<p>its pretty hard to take the mod team seriously when they are banning people trying to call it out, and letting the &quot;shill&quot; continue to do their work.</p>

<p>i mean things need to be more civil around here, but you guys need to to figure out a better procedure to police the accounts doing the shilling, instead of just banning those of us who try to call it out.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see mods limit their stickying and sorting by controversial to <em>very specific</em> scenarios. Like, definitely not on personal posts. I don&#39;t even like it on the &quot;suggest a roundtable&quot; threads because it seems to be applied arbitrarily depending on what was leading the vote at the time of its application.

The point is to avoid the first or top comment from being disproportionately upvoted simply because of it&#39;s placement.

<p>I&#39;m showing you how the voting turned out because you seemed to suggest that Russia Collusion may have won by votes and it was hidden from view. Even if you weren&#39;t inferring that, others may have gotten that as your point and I wanted to show that Russia Collusion lost fairly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and at least for a certain amount of time the roundtable thread was <em>not</em> in contest mode. The leading topic happened to be a volatile, controversial topic in the community. Now, for context, there&#39;s a <em>very visible</em> mod that conspicuously, almost blatantly, takes one side on that issue - that&#39;s just a fact - now say that the leading topic at the time had been more towards their own personal opinion on the topic? Would they have put it on then, or let it ride? The thing is, it doesn&#39;t matter how you feel about the issue in particular, it&#39;s the handling of <em>any</em> controversial issue in that scenario that bothers me. The situation is ripe for personal biases to influence their decision to put on contest mode or not, so just be consistent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what I’m getting from this is that now, it isn’t even okay to hint that someone may be a shill, or involved in a post with the purpose of division and derailment of discussion? Mmkay. </p>

<p>Give me a fucking break. Do you guys actually <em>want</em> to do something about the shills and trolls around here or do we just wanna keep protecting them and acting like we haven’t been completely invaded by inorganic individuals trying to deter truth and shit all over any constructive discussion. </p>

<p>I mean really. I’m a pretty well known user here, I rarely get downvoted, except when I pop in a thread with an opinion that goes against the narrative of said thread. For instance; If I popped in any number of the Russian threads, and said I don’t believe the Russians hacked our election, I’d get downvoted to hell and back. If I said they absolutely hacked out election, I’d probably get gilded. </p>

<p>For fuck sake, there was a post the other day about Adam Schiff, and every comment in that thread defending Schiff was upvoted while every comment calling him out was downvoted. But that isn’t vote manipulation or brigading, right? </p>

<p>What the hell are us regular users who have been around here for years supposed to do? At what point can we actually feel like the mod team as a whole has our backs? Don’t tell me to “report what you see” either. We both know that would never work as the amount of reports you’d receive would far outweigh the current mod team’s ability to handle those reports. </p>

<p>This is the only sub I’ve ever seen where it’s resident users are allowed to be bullied, and we can’t say shit about it lest we hurt someone’s fee-fees by insinuating that they may not be genuine and then we end up getting banned for it. Kinda ridiculous IMO. </p>

<p>Watch, I bet I get drilled with downvotes for this comment. </p>

<p>I think the fact that a local news story about Seth Rich that the local station redacted, based on the findings of a man now suing the person who hired him as a PI for helping spread fake news, was used as the basis to push the Seth Rich conspiracy theory into the mainstream (onto FOX news), is a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, this is what I mean about you. </p>

<p>Everything you spit out supports the MSM narrative. The MSM has been proven to be corrupt and in it for ratings and money, yet you hang on everything they say like it’s the fucking gospel. The MSM is literally, by law, allowed to spit propaganda with no repercussions. And people like you swallow it up like they are beyond reproach. When did it become the norm in society to accept anything you are told without questioning it? Germany had this same problem with it’s MSM in the 30’s ... how did that end up? A dumbed down, uninformed people are easier to control. </p>

<p>When I see the MSM attack/expose <strong>both</strong> sides (as they should be doing), then I will begin to believe them. As is, CNN, NBC, ABC .. they all make a living attacking Trump. Fox makes a living attacking the left. But not a fucking one of them attacks both sides at once. I dunno about you, but to me that is a huuuuge clue THAT IT’S ALL BULLSHIT. </p>

<p>Why did you approach me with conspiracies concerning Russia, and Trump? Because you know it’s a hot topic, and you know people will react. You assume I’m a Trumper, and it was a weakass attempt to draw me into an argument. </p>

<p>I bet you think Oswald acted alone, don’t you? What about 9/11? What are your thoughts there? Or the Bush family’s ties to Nazism? What about the Clinton Foundation? Are they a glowing example of helping humanity? How do you feel about The Catholic Church? </p>

<p>How do you feel about the Federal Reserve, or the fact that Obama and Clinton abused FISA and the FBI in order to spy on people? Does the fact that Henry Ford was awarded a Nazi medal bother you? What do you make of the CIA, and various operations like Paperclip, Mockingbird and the like?  </p>

<p>Funny thing is; I’m totally willing to believe Trump colluded with Russia (in fact, the <em>only</em> reason I’m glad he won is because he is just enough of a cocksucker to take everyone down with him), and I don’t disagree with the points you brought up, but are you willing to believe Obama and Hillary are as crooked as he is? Probably not. </p>

<p>This is what drives me nuts about people like you. You only see one side of the coin. To your mind, conspiracies are one sided and can’t exist across the entire spectrum. And it simply does not work that way. People like you didn’t give a fuck about conspiracies while Obama was breaking laws in office, or while Bush 2.0 was using false evidence to invade Iraq. Nope, you only began to care after it became obvious Trump could win. Why? Who knows. I have my guesses, but I will keep them to myself at the current time. </p>

<p>Let me clue you in; these “elite”, the left, the right, the middle ... they’re 95% crooked as fuck. Bush, Clinton, Obama, Trump, even fucking Reagan ... they’re all dirty. Difference between you and I, is I can say “yup, Republicans are dirty as fuck, annnnd so is the DNC.” </p>

The second one I&#39;ve seen parroted all around r/politics and there is still 0 evidence of Trump giving anyone &quot;secrets&quot; let alone the stretch that anything questioning your narrative can somehow be spun as evidence because it&#39;s somehow &quot;deflecting&quot;... </p>

<p>The original moderator comes back and tells me he will give me a second chance, lol, I had already been unbanned by a mod... Read the following,  this is wrong.</p>

<p>(Me )I don&#39;t know any mods, can you get another opinion, it&#39;s definitely not fair for me to get called a prick on my own post... and not be able to defend myself.</p>

<p>(Mod)Responding to people attacking you with attacks of your own isn&#39;t the answer and doesn&#39;t help anyone. You can have a second chance if you give me some assurance that you understand what I&#39;m saying and will try to mind the rules going forward.</p>

<p>dontdothey • 2h
Thank you</p>

<p>dontdothey • 2h
I will 100% do that, did you ban the guy that called me a little prick? :) You should unban him too... if you did ban him.</p>

<p>Wow if that isn&#39;t a biased statement, I don&#39;t know what is! As for the &quot;victim mentality&quot;...I get threats on a regular basis from a significant contingent of insane individuals. Reddit inc. knows all the users that regularly send me death threats, yet each account is still operating with impunity. I&#39;d say that&#39;s a fairly valid reason to be upset! Also, I&#39;m keeping a list of these accounts to eventually bring to the authorities, so there&#39;s that!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>react however he wants </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How would you react to this scenario?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ignore reports and brags about it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bots (or really, really bored individuals) have been tasked with reporting <em>every</em> post and comment of mine. Since we came up with the excellent submission statement idea, as well as the 2 month account limit, those who would disrupt this sub have shifted tactics. One of their new &quot;strategies&quot; is to flood the mod queue with superfluous reports, and my account is one that they target aggressively.</p>

<p>As a result, it&#39;s gotten to the point where my <em>merely participating</em> in the sub creates more work for the mod team since <em>everything</em> I do or say gets reported by these bad actors. To prevent the already overburdened mod queue from filling up even more, I frequently preemptively approve my posts.</p>

<p>When I see that my comment or post has been reported <em>multiple</em> times in <em>seconds</em>, I often will let others know publicly what I and the rest of the team are dealing with.</p>

<p>In fact, when I signed in this morning, <em>every</em> post on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> had been reported by these serial abusers of this function. </p>

<p>I approved them all as well.</p>

<p>What you call &quot;bragging&quot; I call &quot;transparency&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reinstated his post removed by another mod when it didn&#39;t follow the rules</p>

<p>Citation needed on that one! I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re referring to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7zhckv/for_those_who_constantly_ask_for_proof_that_tmor/">this post?</a>.</p>

<p>The moderator who removed it did so by mistake, as they hadn&#39;t seen my submission statement that was buried to the negative by the TMOR brigade.</p>

<p>Can you think of a single other example that&#39;s actually true?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actively makes partisan politics posts that dismiss a popular conspiracy </p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol you mean Russiagate?</p>

<p>Let me explain something: It&#39;s the very nature of the conspiracy theorist to be skeptical of the majority. I&#39;ve been sharing material on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for a decade on every topic from modern politics to Babylonian bloodlines. </p>

<p><em>This morning</em> I made a post <em>specifically</em> calling for the boycott of mainstream partisan politics. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a significant agenda at play here to frame the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods as right-leaning partisan hacks.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he puts the thread into contest mode</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contest mode is a reaction to the aforementioned brigades. The majority of those complaining about contest mode are those with minimal constructive history on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the brigaders themselves who are disrupted by the use of contest mode.</p>

<p>Contest mode literally gives every comment a fair shot, and I find it rather amusing that its use has been weaponized into an anti-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> talking point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so actively posting to smear a conspiracy</p>

<p>IOW, you&#39;re frustrated that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a whole isn&#39;t completely accepting the Russia collusion conspiracy theory. Sorry not sorry!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let me explain something to you.  Skepticism is holding doubt about the truth of something.  Skepticism is great, but it&#39;s not what you&#39;re practicing.  Everything you post that is anti-russiagate isn&#39;t skepticism.  It&#39;s your bias.  You are posting things that push the anti-russiagate narrative.  Then you make posts that say &quot;hey, partisan politics are terrible and dividing us!&quot;... then more partisan perspective anti-russiagate posts.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This morning I made a post specifically calling for the boycott of mainstream partisan politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You made a post that was aimed at a sub that will never read it saying &quot;hey, if you guys want to boycott republicans, might as well boycott the dems too!!&quot; because your bias is anti-left.  Not to mention, your post wasn&#39;t even a conspiracy.  What were you hoping to achieve with this post other than saying &quot;WELL THEN GUYS, GOTTA DO BOTH SIDES IF YOU HURT THE RIGHT!&quot;</p>

<p>Here, I&#39;ll even point out some of your posts that are obviously partisan narrative posts:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ynf2n/kim_dotcom_let_me_assure_you_the_dnc_hack_wasnt/">A Kim Dotcom tweet claiming that the DNC was hacked, and hasn&#39;t put up the proof</a> - It&#39;s an unreliable source pointing to the &quot;memory stick proof&quot; we heard about months ago without proof of his claims.  You put it in contest mode.</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7we1sx/rather_not_have_a_paper_trail_top_democrat_on_the/">zerohedge post</a> here, or your <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7vfc2s/schiffs_latest_bizarre_claim_russian_ads_promote/">other zerohedge post</a> - in one of them, someone calls them out for being a poor source, your response was &quot;yawn&quot;.  You&#39;re not trying to have discussions about what you post, you&#39;re trying to post things that dismiss it, and walk away from it without downvotes.  If anyone buries you, you just flip it to contest mode and laugh.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v78zd/liberal_totalitarianism_and_the_trump_diversion/">interesting post</a> where your title mentions &quot;Liberal Totalitarianism&quot; and you call out propaganda campaigns, but specifically Russiagate.  It seems like it feels right to you that propaganda is being used to pretend Russia is the boogeyman.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re already claiming these are just skepticism, but it gets better, just wait.  Like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7t55pj/the_russiagate_stakes_are_extreme_the_information/">this one that &quot;proves&quot; that Russiagate was a conspiracy to bring down the president</a>.  In it, you detail how anyone who believes Russiagate is just caught up in propaganda.  You posted propaganda about how a different belief is the propaganda you shouldn&#39;t be caught up in.  </p>

<p>Or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7sy6uc/skepticism_of_the_russiacollusion_conspiracy_does/">here&#39;s your cheerleading post to tell everyone else to keep up the good fight who is skeptical of Russiagate</a>.  You&#39;re basically telling people to fight if they don&#39;t believe in it.  THIS IS ENCOURAGING PARTISAN POLITICS BICKERING.  You made this post in reaction to an earlier post that got brigaded, so you put this in contest mode and stickied it so everyone could see it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And today, when I question the Russian collusion/bogeyman narrative I&#39;m labeled a pro-POTUS Russian &quot;agent.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you want to call it a bias when I say victim mentality?  Your words and reaction sure seem like you&#39;re capitalizing on being a victim.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are attempting to use these issues to turn us against each other, when we should really be setting our sights towards the top of the pyramid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the president not somewhere at the top of the pyramid?  Should we not be able to peacefully discuss Russiagate without a mod claiming that it&#39;s bullshit and banning people that talk back?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just remember that if you get attacked by these partisan hacks, then you know you&#39;re doing something right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, just remember, if anyone is calling you out as pro president, you&#39;re on the right track, right??  Healthy skepticism here.</p>

<p>Surely though, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mnyb8/the_entire_trumprussia_probe_is_a_sham_this_is/">this post dismissing Russiagate as a sham is completely unbiased and skeptical</a>.  You seem to like how the author claims they&#39;re grasping at straws and going after anything they can find because they have nothing.  Surely that&#39;s skeptical of an ongoing investigation right?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to keep going.  You get the point.  Maybe you still somehow claim that these are skeptical, and if so, I&#39;ll agree to disagree.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a significant agenda at play here to frame the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods as right-leaning partisan hacks.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t post like it is then?  You and a couple mods with supporting comments in your threads sure come off as pro-right.  You&#39;re &quot;skeptical&quot; of Russiagate, but you don&#39;t actively try to tell everyone why any other conspiracy is bullshit.  Just this one.</p>

<p>I could just as easily claim that there&#39;s an agenda here to frame everyone that believes Russiagate as a TMoR brigader.  I&#39;ll give you the same advice.  Don&#39;t fall for it.  Real people here are interested in this even if goes against your bias. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>IOW, you&#39;re frustrated that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a whole isn&#39;t completely accepting the Russia collusion conspiracy theory. Sorry not sorry!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I don&#39;t care that you don&#39;t accept it.  It&#39;s that you&#39;re actively trying to get others to believe that you&#39;re right about it not being real, and then abusing your mod powers to keep your posts visible.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m frustrated that you, a mod, is actively posting threads that go against an ongoing conspiracy.  There&#39;s an ongoing investigation into collusion with Russia with several indictments already.  Do you just believe it&#39;s all a deep state conspiracy or what?  What is it that makes you believe so much that Russiagate is false that you have to frequently post things calling it a lie?  Why can&#39;t you let others make up their mind instead of trying to get them to believe your narrative?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m a firm believer that contest mode would help take the incentive away from those constantly vying for top comment, only to deride topics they’re offended by or slide discussion. It’d also nip vote manipulation in the bud.</p>

<p>Users who participate in hate subs that attack r/Conspiracy should be instabanned, as should those clearly acting in bad faith.</p>

<p>I really like the sentiment behind your post, but unfortunately I think suggestions likely to upset the agitators will be dismissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m personally still on the fence about contest mode. It seems like a decent idea, but it has a few problems. For one, it really scatters the conversation. A very informative and helpful comment may be completely buried just by the random sorting. That&#39;s not a big deal early on, but if the post makes the front page and gets really popular, people who are late to the thread may never even see half of the discussion that has already taken place. </p>

<p>Then there is the issue of how easily it is to abuse these randomized comment sections. If one user (or multiple users) decide they don&#39;t like they discussion that is taking place, they can flood the post with a bunch of top level comments to bury the actual discussion. In a normal post these comments would quickly be downvoted and hidden, but in contest mode they will be scattered throughout the thread and if there are enough one will always be at the top. We have already seen this happen in the past when one (now ex) moderator decided they didn&#39;t like the discussions in any post critical of Trump so they used alt accounts to post numerous comments and completely derail any discussion that was taking place.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid that all contest mode would do is turn vote brigades into comment brigades. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Informative comments are brigaded and completely hidden from view now. It’s unfortunate that all regular users know they often need to sort by controversial in order to find a genuine conversation.</p>

<p>The system in its current state is heavily abused, so its absolutely pointless relying on the community to “quickly downvote” as vote manipulation ensures certain users or topics rise to the top comment spot and remain there. Contest mode eliminates this and gives everyone an equal opportunity to share their opinion. It’s quite clear if someone’s spamming top level comments, and in those instances people can report to the mod team.</p>

<p>There’ll be absolutely no point in continuing with comment brigades if they can’t guarantee control of the conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do I like about the page? It&#39;s my news of the day synopsis where I can usually get a good idea of what&#39;s going on regarding my particular interests. </p>

<p>I like looking into potential conspiracies..I like theories and speculation. I like well researched/sourced information and thought provoking posts that present potential conspiracies.</p>

<p>I like seeing logical/rational debates on the merit/credibility of conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>This is what I like about the page.</p>

<p>Suggestions for 2018:</p>

<p>Keep striving to give a platform to conspiracies. All of them/Any of them</p>

<p>Contribute..make quality posts about conspiracies/theories you&#39;re passionate about when you have the time to do so. Also consider expanding your horizons into other conspiracies/theories.</p>

<p>Avoid jumping the shark. Do the research, apply due diligence to the best of your ability. Learn to admit when you&#39;ve been wrong or operated on false information. Have the courage to retract an inaccurate post or comment.</p>

<p>Avoid equating &quot;credibility of one&quot; to credibility of the entire sub. This applies to posts and users. </p>

<p>Political conspiracy posts - This is obviously where the friction is emanating from for the most part. A few observations I&#39;ve had.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Taking precedent into consideration: There is no comparable precedent regarding the 2016 presidential election. We are, all of us, in new territory. Ergo, we are all experiencing new things. Stay flexible and open minded in order to derive as much truth as you can from these new experiences. (Be true to thine own self)</p></li>
<li><p>Hot topic political posts that hit r//all front page that result in heavy traffic from users who don&#39;t normally contribute to this sub through posts and comments. There are only a few realistic options here.</p></li>
<li><p>Voluntarily vote on the possibility of blocking r/conspiracy from r//all until the Mueller investigation has finished, thereby insulating the sub while at the same time depriving the sub from having a larger impact on reddit as a whole.</p></li>
<li><p>Take contest mode for the full Monty test drive on all political conspiracy posts to negate partisan brigades from having negative effects on the sub.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring out the banhammer. If so, be prepared for all that will follow. It will be messy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Or...adopt an attitude of &quot;this too shall pass&quot;. These current investigations into the establishment (past and present) and the current administration will end at some point. r/conspiracy will still be here after it. There will still be much to discuss whichever way the findings of the investigations go. More importantly, we will be here discussing that and all of the other conspiracies and theories we love to discuss. The rest of it is temporary if we choose wisely.</p>

<p>Finally...to all the real conspiracy lovers on this sub...lead by example. Exemplify that which you wish to see. Just because there&#39;s a -100 next to your comment doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t/can&#39;t see the merit/value of the truth/logic in your comment. Instead of being discouraged I shall choose to take the time to point out the merit/value/truth/logic of said comment and not worry about the -75 next to mine.</p>

<p>PS - We&#39;ve lost alot of good contributors to this sub due to partisan politics/beliefs over the last year. They&#39;ve gone elsewhere for a variety of reasons. We should do everything we can to curb that trend.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an easy commodity to replace in terms of years of research and knowledge that leave with them.</p>
