<p>‚ÄúThere are a million billion different moralities. We make our own morality. There is no <em>moral standard</em>. It simply does not exist.‚Äù</p>

<p>I want to slap them with a sociology textbook to the face. </p>

<p>No, foolish one. Allow me to answer your proclamation with a question or two. </p>

<p>In the history of Earth, has there ever been a society of any size that survived, that applauded selfishness? That adored the act of running away from battle? That honored the act of betrayal? That condoned unjustified killing and stealing? That practiced molestation of children on a societal level? </p>

<p>Has there ever been a group of people who survived longer than a year doing any of these things or thinking these ways? </p>

<p>The answer is a resounding no. </p>

<p>Now, I know what the idiots will say; ‚ÄúWell uh duh our society is pretty damn close to that uh huh duh.‚Äù</p>

<p>Yes, moron. And our society is crumbling, due to an overwhelming wave of selfishness and immorality. </p>

<p>Morality comes in many shapes and forms but it is indeed present within all of us and it‚Äôs presence is undeniable.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell yesterday I gave you some of my food, do you think today I could have some of your food? I‚Äôm hungry.‚Äù </p>

<p>This inner knowing is present among even isolated tribes in remote jungle areas. We know that we <em>ought</em> to <em>this</em> but many of us do <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>Because our morality has been compromised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question of good and evil is fundamental to the world of conspiracies. Many beleive there is not good or evil, and morality is relative.</p>

<p>I used to believe that. It is like somebody wants people to believe that. It is the conspiracy.</p>

<p>So, one starts to realize there is good and bad and they are not interconnected in some new age we are all one philosophy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in terms of conspiracy... morality is the  psych game in which we easily get played as fools.  The plebs battle amongst themselves over immaterial ideals (in their minds) while their masters concentrate on securing physically superior positions to dominate (in the real world). Those who hold on to it like an absolute are triggered into being played whenever they&#39;re moral absolutism is threatened (re: trans bathrooms).   It&#39;s been a plague on the European mind for centuries (I&#39;ve lost count of how many 30 year wars there were) and &quot;post-modern&quot; moral relativism is viewed as one of the ways out of it because it acknowledges a larger world epistemology where personal myopic absolutes can be put into perspective against non-personal systems of control.  And that&#39;s where the real battle is, outside your mind and outside your enemies mind.   It&#39;s a European liberal fantasy to wish for the plebs to share the same moral code as their masters.  This moral penduluum swings both ways, plebs acquiring their masters code is the red-faced conservative approach while true blue liberals would like to have the masters adopt their people&#39;s code.   The importance of this penduluum is to avoid being hypnotized by it - no matter which way it swings it does not reveal an answer because it manifests a contradiction.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to note that there <em>are</em> millions of moralities.   It&#39;s just that 99.9999% of them are garbage that ends in human misery and suffering.</p>

<p><em>They are not all equally valid.</em>  That&#39;s the falsehood of the cultural Marxists and the postmodernists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, accusing people of whinging Moron&#39;s or fools because they disagree with you, or have let to learn what to reckon you have learnt isnt the right way to go abiut this. Is an unprofessional approaching to educating people.</p>

<p>There are, have been and always will be an infinite amount of different moralities. That&#39;s the price of freedom. Its just that only some are actually self sustainable. That said, they&#39;re only self sustainable be we, as a society, deem them and not other moral codes to be.</p>

<p>You are also to suppose that us as humans, and humans within societies, have some sort of fundamental right to exist. We don&#39;t. We just do. If morality exists, it exists above and beyond us, and applied to all things in the world wholly. If humans are destroying the earth, then how is it moral for us to exist over other lifeforms being destroyed by us? Any true, universal moral standard isnt  particularly compatible with humanity above all other life. Or is so, that wouldn&#39;t be moral. Not moral in a true, pure sense. </p>

<p>So either that or morality is something we make ourselves, in which case it is as much a structure of ourselves as society itself it. If nothing else, it&#39;s just an extension of the human condition and evolution. But then, that&#39;s not free, that&#39;s simply survival of the fittest. If we&#39;re not free to choose morality, is it really moral? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the suit fits... I think there is a lot more going on inside us than a humonculius (of singular moral dignity) confronting the world through the peepholes of human perception.   The human experiences a world riddled with symbolic meaning and it is precisely these variety of signs and meanings that give rise to an identity in us, various identities inside us.  It&#39;s not a question of  &quot;The Identity&quot;, as in who we are singularly, but &quot;a who&quot; it is that we can see responding this way or that way to an environment of signs.  The meaning of a sign is a collaborated agreement  between other people and us, it is the agreement that seals the sign&#39;s meaning for us and also seals our identity for us, as that person who agrees upon the meaning with others.  </p>

<p>I am talking materialistically, behaviorally,  these signs condition us into imagining we are &quot;a&quot; someone. This means inside us, there cannot be one single moralistic horizon for all the signs we recognize for ourselves, they are internal abstract ideas which are full of contradictions - impossible contradictions that manifest the moment they attrmpt to collapse into material reality.  It happens every day: humans fight over symbolic meaning as if their very identity was stake, it is.  That Broncos fan would not exist if the Broncos and all their symbolic meaning did not exist for them, they&#39;d just be someone else.   </p>

<p>So I respectfully disagree, it IS a suit you wear, and there are millions of them at our disposal.  And I do agree with you that THIS is super serious problem. At any time the symbolic meaning is up for grabs. That is the symbolic battle we find so personally distracting.  This is straight up Promethius updated by 1950s cybernetic engineering for use in the 21st century.  It is a visceral experience, not entirely conscious, which makes us act like animals in each other&#39;s eye.  </p>

<p>We choose these &quot;suits&quot; occording to the situation, and once they&#39;re donned we often act like that girl in poltergeist: ready to rip the head off anyone who says we are possessed.   Fear, and how it obstructs reason skills, is a byproduct of these internal conflicts. </p>

<p>Have you seen Flight From Death? they go into some of this.  Watch moralistically conflicted Christians unable to comprehend using a cross as a hammer...
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iYMsKzkGCq4">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iYMsKzkGCq4</a></p>

<p>But, I want also add that all this sign crap (imho, it is crap) operates on top of what some people call the Primal Self.  Thing is, by definition the primal self is devoid of symbolic conditioning and so, you might agree, whatever moral code you may ascribe to it would be in truth just a projection of the observers morality.</p>
