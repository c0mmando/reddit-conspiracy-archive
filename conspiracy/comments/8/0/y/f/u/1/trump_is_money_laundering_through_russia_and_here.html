       The "Yiddish connection" is largely an international syndicate, much like the Italian mafia. Whether one criminal is based in NYC or Moscow is of secondary importance.

       Actually people like you were claiming "fake news" back then too with the WaPo and NYT....but that doesn't exactly fit your narrative.
      </p>

       Nixon even claimed there was a "witch hunt" before he got knocked down...sound familiar?

       That literally reads like a who's who of MSM propaganda outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, maybe it's all true, but sourcing from places like these actually bolsters the case that's it's all a bullshit nothing burger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget, these are the same outlets that lied about 9/11 to get people to accept invading Afghanistan, the patriot act, the TSA etc
      </p>
      <p>
       And lied about Wmds in Iraq so people would accept the invasion of that country. Oh yeah, and Saddams plan to ditch the petrodollar for the euro, that's not happening any more
      </p>
      <p>
       And lied about Libya, so people would accept turning it from a place that had one of the highest standards of living in Africa, to a failed state run ny terrorists. Oh yeah, and his plan to create a anti-rothschild, anti-colonialst gold backed currency, that's not happening any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       And are now lying about what is happening in Syria, lying about the real source of funding and training of groups like isis, the white helmets etc, lying about false flag chemical attacks etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, and the Golon Heights, an area of Syria rich in mineral resources , is being occupied by Israel. Also the entire country lies in the path of a proposed pipeline to supply gas to Europe that would complete with Russian gas supply.

       doesn't mean it doesn't have merit.  You guys all come from T_D which is the most biased sub on Reddit and continuously cite Infowars or Breitbart as sources.

       stop acting like "whataboutisms" can't be valid arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       You made the statement that "you people" could witness something and still deny it.  The person you replied to shared an example of "you people" doing exactly that very thing.  That not only destroyed your attack, but also showcases how ignorant and bias you actually are which then destroys your credibility

      <p>
       Well here's a newsflash for ya!  All media outlets are biased.  So these aren't things that the right would publish.  With that being said, just because it was printed by a source you don't like, even if they have pro yes retractions on other stories  (which all news outlets do eventually) it doesn't make everything they say true.  They have a reputation to uphold.  And the people working for them have jobs to keep.  That means not printing straight up lies Constantly.

       History has shown that this is simply not true. MSM media on both sides if the false left/right paradigm have proven time and time again that they can lie constantly to push certain agendas, and it's outside most people's overton window to even consider questioning it.

       You accuse me of trying to create a narrative, but literally nothing you have said in this entire thread has anything to do with the OP. Something someone trying to create a narrative might do: try to continually derail conversations into other topics (the reliability of his sources (which you dismissed out of hand although there are 19 different ones), try to divert the conversation to a different topic (like the 4 COMPLETELY unrelated topics you tried to bring up))

The purpose of the coup was to rearrange the dominant institutions of the US government so as to enhance their ability to carry out policies agreeable to the increasingly urgent dictates of the British-dominated Morgan- Rockefeller-Mellon-Harriman financier faction. The immediate beneficiaries of the coup have been that class of bureaucratic, technocratic administrators who have held the highest public offices, exercising power in many cases almost without interruption, since the days of the Watergate scandal. It is obvious that George Bush himself is one of the most prominent of such beneficiaries."

       TIL discussing Operation Mockingbird is a forum disruption tactic.

       It shows you that the mainstream media is a limited hangout. You can look at more recent examples like CIA agent Edward Snowden taking down the NSA after the NSA took out CIA director Petraeus.

       And they're valid when I did them. The media does keep the truth out of view, and often lies. Are you familiar with the concept of an admission that hurts a party being admissible in court? The mainstream media is trustworthy when they admit things that harm the oligarchy.

       That's not accurate. I'm saying they often report the facts, but they also hide things that should be reported and often make things up. Such as the Steele dossier.

       The facts are the important part.  That's the stuff critical thinkers drill down on, not the speculation and empty allegations.  These articles included a lot of facts, documentation and corroboration.

       ....It's not like a former times reporter Daniel Simpson once said in an interview "Asked about how the censorship over such a vast organization could function, Simpson explained that "there are different processes at work." Citing his own experience, the self-styled “renegade” correspondent said that even in the Balkans, the Times had a pre-determined view of what happened. Editors were not interested in analyzing the tragic effects of Western military intervention, and they certainly were not open to exploring alternative explanations and views. "

       Lol. Turn on my TV. Open up my newspaper. Let my entire perception of reality, my entire understanding of the geopolitical machinations of the world and basically my entire world-view be shaped by these MSM outlets.

       And if anyone one dares question the narrative , they are just a crazy conspiracy theorist.

      <p>
       And if any journalist questions the narrative, they just work for some silly blog. Because there are definitely no journalists outside of the MSM sphere that have any respect at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, these newspapers have a long history, have won Pulitzer prizes. They have documentation, facts and evidence. They should never be questioned. There only motivation is the make the public more informed. They would never lie or have an agenda.

       Yes, I am aware and well read.  You're denying the evidence from 20+ sources that include documentation and facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your original comment has been comprehended.  You refuse to believe anything you believe to be from the MSM regardless of the evidence and facts provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       You watch Tucker Carlson and read opinion blogs for information.  Many that make claims with no evidence whatsoever.  You'll believe the empty claims, but claims with evidence, that's just too far a stretch for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question the narrative, but the facts are the facts.  They exist independently of the narrative.  Critical thinkers know how to separate the facts from the opinions and narrative.  You clearly do not think critically if you think Tucker Carlson's editorial show is actually real news.  How many times has he retracted bogus allegations this week alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Opinion blogs are not journalism, so you calling them journalism clearly shows YOU are the one who is NOT AWARE of the difference between hard journalism and editorial/opinion blogs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claims should always be questioned if they dont provide evidence.  The evidence is what proves the claims.  This post had 20 sources with hard facts and evidence to prove the claims.  Those claims were corroborated across multiple organizations.  The sources were verified and you're one of the few idiots choosing to remain ignorant to those facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your agenda is to discredit anything that might show Trump is corrupt despite Trump implicating himself in obstruction of justice on national television and his son admitting to collusion with Russia during the election to get illegally obtained emails in order to influence the election.  Even when Trump or Trump Jr admits on TV or Twitter you'll still deny it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts and evidence determine the credibility of the claim and those sources listed by the OP had facts to back them up.  Facts you refuse to even look at.

       Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesus dude, this is proving really hard to get through to you. I never claimed I read through all the articles. I never claimed that the accusations weren't true.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I said was the all the sources referenced were all known bullshit propaganda MSM outlets with track records of lying. Thats it. That's the only claim I made. You've created all these other claims and agendas yourself and projected them on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put it this way, if a known liar tell the truth once,  it doesn't make it a lie. It also doesn't mean they don't deserve their reputation as a liar in the past and should now be blindly believed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really seem to be missing my original point.
      </p>

       All I was saying was that by sourcing exclusively from MSM outlets, you actually inadvertently bolster the argument against you, especially in a conspiracy subreddit.

       I'm not saying that every single fact within all 20 articles is wrong. I'm saying by ONLY quoting known bullshit propaganda MSM outlets that you give the IMPRESSION that it's bullshit and actually give more credibility to the other side of the argument.

       This doesn't mean anything.  There are multiple branches of the MSM, and all of them engage in bullshit, fabrications, cover-ups, psychological warfare and generally keeping the public uninformed and pacified towards the actions of the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this really is conspiracy theory 101.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, this doesn't mean that EVERY SINGLE THING they have ever said is factually inaccurate. Propaganda is more complicated than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for credible resources, I'd recommend globalresearch.ca,  activist post and the Corbett report. And I respect Eva Bartlett and John pilger as journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know what, if someone presented me evidence that they had knowingly published 'fake news' and lies on multiple occasions (like I did with the ny times) I wouldn't just put my fingers in my ears and scream 'LALALALA I CANT HEAR YOU THEY ARE RESPECTABLE JOURNALISM EVERYTHING IS OPINION BLOGS LALALA' and would actually question my trust of them.

       In the real world a list of 20 articles from reputable organizations would not be considered propaganda.  It's only in your world does it give the impression that its bullshit.

      <p>
       You've insulated yourself in a place where you can pick and choose what you want to believe regardless of the evidence presented.  Calling a psy op or a coverup or propaganda is just your excuses for why you decide not to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You couldnt even tell me what a credible source is.  You're rejecting all the sources and all the hard evidence and legal documentation based on a subjective impression.  When you finally start to tell me what you call credible resources you reference globalresearch.ca, activist post and corbett report, all of them blogs.  Eva Bartlett works for RT.  How's that for irony, claiming all the MSM is propaganda and you're trusting a Russian blogger working for Russian state media for your information.  I guess I can understand why you want to deny Donald Trump was involved in money laundering with Russia based on the sources you use.

       Or perhaps all those bongs have given you brain damage. I mean, you were telling me I watched Tucker Carlson when that was some one else, is this all a bit confusing for you? Or perhaps trying desperately to hold on to the blue pill that the narrative and reality presented  by TV news and newspapers is the truth and they are Honourable journalists. I remember when I realised that TV news is bullshit, it was difficult to comprehend in the beginning.

       I hate to break it to you, but it's 2018, most real journalism is in the internet. These are websites with news stories and analysis. I think it's funny you disregard anything that isn't a newspaper that's 100 years old or on television.  Wake up dude! These people are information gatekeepers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah Eva Bartlett is not Russian, and she doesn't 'work for rt', she is an independent freelance journalist who has contributed to many places including rt. She has extensive on the ground experience reporting from Syria
      </p>
      <p>
       But look, here is one of your anointed truth tellers, the guardian, trying to white wash and defend known terrorists associates the white helmets. And who wrote the article, a technology editor from San Francisco who has never set foot in there and knows nothing about Syria.

       This is standard behaviour for what you think is a 'reputable'

       So when you post links to the the guardian in a conspiracy sub,  EVEN IF WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS TRUE, IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION ITS BULLSHIT BECAUSE OF THEIR PAST BEHAVIOUR (maybe it will get through this time...fingers crossed)

       They manipulate what people see:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The elite media set a framework within which others operate. If you are watching the Associated Press, who grind out a constant flow of news, in the mid-afternoon it breaks and there is something that comes along every day that says “Notice to Editors: Tomorrow’s New York Times is going to have the following stories on the front page.” The point of that is, if you’re an editor of a newspaper in Dayton, Ohio and you don’t have the resources to figure out what the news is, or you don’t want to think about it anyway, this tells you what the news is. These are the stories for the quarter page that you are going to devote to something other than local affairs or diverting your audience. These are the stories that you put there because that’s what the New York Times tells us is what you’re supposed to care about tomorrow..
      </p>
      <p>
       The real mass media are basically trying to divert people. Let them do something else, but don’t bother us (us being the people who run the show). Let them get interested in professional sports, for example. Let everybody be crazed about professional sports or sex scandals or the personalities and their problems or something like that. Anything, as long as it isn’t serious. Of course, the serious stuff is for the big guys. “We” take care of that...
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the elite media, the agenda-setting ones? The New York Times and CBS, for example. Well, first of all, they are major, very profitable, corporations. Furthermore, most of them are either linked to, or outright owned by, much bigger corporations, like General Electric, Westinghouse, and so on. They are way up at the top of the power structure of the private economy which is a very tyrannical structure. Corporations are basically tyrannies, hierarchic, controled from above. If you don’t like what they are doing you get out. The major media are just part of that system."

       I asked 4 times already and you didnt answer, you just doubled down on how all media is not credible because its owned by corporations.  I assume public outlets like NPR and PBS are not credible because they operate on government funding.  You refuse to answer the question yet say these sources are totally credible when you cite them.

       After asking you multiple times which sources you find credible you finally come back with Tucker Carlson on Fox News, Zerohedge and 2 other conspiracy blogs.  They have all made allegations without proof.

       Saudi's gave Crooked Hillary $45 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton Foundation accepted over $250,000,000 from Foreign Govts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the hacked email from Podesta on Wikileaks, it clearly shows Podesta and Crooked Hillary's staff biting the nails over their foreign bribery becoming known to the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that email link you literally have Joel Beneson, who was Hillary's 2016 Campaign Strategist saying shut it down immediately stop accepting money from foreign govts until Hillary wins the election. Podesta and Cheryl Mills chime in replying with their ideas about how to propagandize a way to cover it up!
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's just one example. I can literally find 50 more Podesta emails proving shameless naked corruption and bribery at the Clinton Foundation.

      </p>
      <p>
       That is the spreadsheet of all the hundreds of donors to the Clinton Foundation, as revealed by Guccifer 2.0.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scroll to the very last line, add up the column for "Total Amount Donated" it's over $200 MILLION DOLLARS.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's talk about Ivanka and a few apartments in Panama. Everything you have cited is chump change compared to high roller Crooked Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could keep going. But it doesn't matter anymore. Trump won. Crooked Hillary lost because she was the worst candidate in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can keep fighting that battle that Crooked Hillary should have won, you can enter into a mystical and hallucinatory alt-timeline where she did win, and you can imagine all the "what if's" that would have turned out different.

       You can link to Donalds page all you want doesn’t change the fact that modern journalism isn’t about facts it’s about clicks/views.  They don’t care if they are right or wrong it’s about being provocative and making a story hit the mainstream.  Dude your on a conspiracy page dedicated to saying the government and people who deliver the news to you are liars.  Then you use those exact people to try and prove your point. It’s a tough sell and I’ll tell you this there are more people here that probably agree with me than with you.  I appreciate the post and the effort you put in but If your gonna use sources like these especially in current times with how these entities are viewed all I can say is good luck in this sub.

       So, what you've identified are two names. Felix Slater and Rybolovlev. You are positing that they are laundering with Trump but you haven't explained any collusion or election interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I recall, Ryoblovlev most recently was targeted by the Russian government over someone help escape their clutches and they tried to financially punish him by crashing his shares of the bank in Cyprus or something. Broad strokes, there, because it's been a while since I've looked into it. Point being, if anything, that is evidence Trump is not working with the Russians as they used Vekselberg to out him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's do a quick comparison, because I'm not saying you are wrong. I am going to say that I have a much better sourced article than this that uses primary source documentation to PROVE 100% that the DNC revenue stream and people like Media Matters have Russian rubles in their banks and they used it to sway the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ruben Vardanyan, whose job is to make Putin's friends rich, runs an investment firm, Troika Dialog that paid The Podesta Group and the Podesta Group failed to disclose these ties, making it a FARA violation. We know this because of the LD 1 disclosure form and the Panama Papers. Two separate sources that independently corroborate each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ruben Vardanyan also paid John Podesta through a front known as Joule Unlimited. We know this because of his leaked emails and the contract included in those emails. John Podesta has yet to disclose this and it is a violation of the FARA rules, again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Podestas would be in jail if the law applied to them equally with Manafort.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the tip of the iceberg, because I have a lot more primary source evidence, but Ruben Vardanyan is the easiest to understand where the evidence is publicly available. Nothing secret. No taking anyone's word for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They used their funds through Center for American Progress, Comet Ping Pong, Media Matters, Correct the Record and Shareblue to influence social media through astroturfing through the Internet and even directly instructed news outlets on what to report.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS IS WHAT COLLUSION LOOKS LIKE.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you are wrong, but I'd like to see something more than just biased news articles where I know John Podesta can call or email and just tell them what to say.

       It's evident that OP has a hard-on for boosting his self-esteem by damaging Trump. He's using fake news sources that slander trump to support his slanderous premise. What a stupid guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damaging trump is all liberals lust over because they are so low in self-esteem they need to bring better people down to feel good about themselves. It makes them feel like a savior, but in reality what they're doing won't boost their self-esteem. They will always be a piece of shit loser because their self-esteem revolves around the suffering of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boosting your self-esteem the functional way is when it revolves around accomplishing things in your life independent of others. OP is a moron, downvote and move on everybody.

       Political ideology has evolved, it's no longer about ideas and beliefs, it's now IDENTITY POLITICS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberalism is synonymous for virtue signaling, entitlement, low self-esteem, and dysfunctionality. YOU are a liberal, not by the old definition, but by the NEW definition. You voting differently doesn't change your identity politics.

       He says in a 3 paragraph post where he does nothing but ad-hominem attack and make ridiculous blanket generalizations about "liberals". How much of your self esteem is tied to trying to make "liberals" look stupid?

       Awful lot of people who apparently only look at the name of the media outlet and make a decision on its veracity from that. If you chose not to read it and decided it's a lie simply because it's from a media outlet you dislike, you're intellectually dishonest and misinformed.

       It has been clear the collusion crap was an entry path into investigating beyond just that and taking him and others down via things that have nothing to do with collusion.

       I asked 4 times already and you didnt answer, you just doubled down on how all media is not credible because its owned by corporations.  I assume public outlets like NPR and PBS are not credible because they operate on government funding.  You refuse to answer the question yet say these sources are totally credible when you cite them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not being nasty here.  You're the one saying we cant believe anything we read and then claim Tucker Carlson and conspiracy blogs that frequently make claims without evidence are legit.
