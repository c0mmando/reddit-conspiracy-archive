<p>They aren&#39;t &quot;criticizing OP&quot;, they&#39;re defending a supposed shill.  This one where you&#39;re calling out the number of downvotes simply said, &quot;What is the conspiracy?&quot; which looks to me like an attempt to dismiss it.

<p>That&#39;s how reddit operates.  Someone posts bullshit, people downvote them, and those same people upvote the person calling it out after that.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re telling everyone about forum disruption.. well that&#39;s exactly what the supposed shill is doing, not the person calling him out.  The person mentioned is making accounts to evade bans, which is not allowed.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s a weirdly aggressive tone to take with a complete stranger asking a basic question. When I see comments like this, I&#39;m always suspicious that they are trying to bully other people into not questioning whatever narrative they want to push.</p>

<p>Kind of sounds like you&#39;re trying to disrupt our forum by emotionalizing, antagonizing, and goading, a tactic taken directly from the <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">link</a> I just posted:</p>

<p>&quot;Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how ‘sensitive they are to criticism.’&quot;</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re using tactic <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">#19</a>: &quot;Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the ‘play dumb’ rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance.&quot;</p>

<p>Every comment you make proves more and more that your intent is dishonest and disruptive.</p>

<p>That literally doesn&#39;t mean shit.  A lot of people peruse the internet when they work their jobs because they get bored.  I personally get tired of reddit because of people like you. This is my only account with my information on it so I sure as fuck don&#39;t give a fuck if people check my history.  I sit in 2007scape during the afternoons when I play and I&#39;m sure there are posts in their post 5 pm cst.  I then sleep for 8 hours and get up and go work my engineering job.  While I&#39;m at work I start perusing again when I get bored.  I&#39;m sure shitloads of people, besides those 100% obsessed (This must be your crazy ass), do the same fucking thing.  </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see this you can&#39;t be help.  You&#39;ve gone past delusional.  </p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;m pissed and triggered because little sacks of shit like yourself keep making baseless accusations.  Then trying to prove a point with them that aren&#39;t there. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck how a child like you feels.  As far as I&#39;m concerned you&#39;re the child here because you are throwing shill accusations around like it&#39;s Halloween candy. I enjoy commenting here and will continue to do so regardless of your fucking opinion. </p>

<p>Man the only one who looks humiliated in this thread is you.  </p>

<p>As you continue shouting and swearing at possible teenagers on the internet, did you ever stop to consider whether the problem does not lie with the one calmly discussing facts?</p>

<p>Whatever you do, don&#39;t take it out on your poor dog.</p>

<p>There is no calm here.  You&#39;ve asked for this.  You poke with baseless accusations and not expect someone to bite back.  Ever heard the saying &quot;Your mouth is writing a check that your ass can&#39;t cash&quot;.  This is where you are. </p>

<p>Do not believe that every negative comment or downvote you receive on reddit is real. There are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dz470/most_reddit_addicted_city_over_100k_visits_total/">organized shilling efforts</a> and rampant vote manipulation.</p>

<p>I simply asked what they were shilling for. If there is no particular person or organization, how have they been identified as a shill? Why not a questionable user with multiple ban-evading alts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sock puppets are pretty common here. </p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ci8dy/what_is_the_point_of_top_minds_of_reddit_is_it/">User admits to using 40+ accounts</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/lCWqR">https://archive.is/lCWqR</a>, <a href="https://archive.is/97B26">https://archive.is/97B26</a>. Most of these have been suspended by Reddit.</p>

<p>This user would use multiple accounts in the same thread to gang up on other users or to support their arguments. There are over 240 different threads going back over 1 year, where more than one of these accounts appears in the same thread. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YvtN6PE.png">https://i.imgur.com/YvtN6PE.png</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/h0ME0uf.png">https://i.imgur.com/h0ME0uf.png</a></p>

<p>They&#39;re still here on new accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>The self-post troll. Some of you might have seen threads like these:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7q0c2h/is_my_mother_an_reptillian/">Is my mother an reptillian?</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7h5lje/is_my_neighbour_a_vampire/">Is my neighbour a vampire?</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7of2ba/will_my_sister_soin_becoming_a_vampire/">Will my sister soin becoming a vampire?</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ojilc/iam_25_and_my_mother_is_breastfeeding_me_again/">Iam 25 and my mother is breastfeeding me again.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79r0lh/why_is_incest_still_forbidden_in_the_usa/">Why is incest still forbidden in the usa?</a></p>

<p>This user would make a self-post, typically with a &quot;bait&quot; title. They would then reply with alt accounts. I have a list of 20 accounts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7f39tq/roy_moore_is_no_predatorlove_between_an_older_man/dq98vqm/">here</a>. They were all suspended by Reddit admins. </p>

<p>They made new accounts, got banned, made some more and they pop up every now and then.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ffung/establishment_shill_theresa_may_calls_to_regulate/">An article about Theresa May from June 2017</a> - OP is using 2 sock puppets to support their posts. Looking deeper, they use those accounts simultaneously in at least 68 different threads. They even post threads with the same titles minutes apart. <a href="https://redd.it/5i8cjn">Thread one</a> <a href="https://redd.it/5i8bdv">Thread two</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7jyzdk/interesting_video_is_california_under_attack_from/">A YouTube video posted December 2017</a> - 17 out of 30 accounts were created 3 weeks earlier, within a span of 68 minutes.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<p>It&#39;s possible the accounts you linked are sock puppets.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll work on a better visualization later but this is a series of bar charts showing their post histories: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CCpABv7.png">https://i.imgur.com/CCpABv7.png</a></p>

<p>Pattern seems consistent with being banned and making new accounts, at least for some of them.</p>

<p>I can check later and compare account creation times to ban times.</p>

<p>These are the account creation times: <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f3037f63d75700112d991ca251728d02">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f3037f63d75700112d991ca251728d02</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>I always get a chuckle when I see someone making a post complaining about &quot;shills&quot; when they&#39;re using multiple sock puppets themselves.</p>

<p>To be clear: I think alt accounts are fine unless you use them to astroturf, manipulate votes, or disrupt discussion.</p>
