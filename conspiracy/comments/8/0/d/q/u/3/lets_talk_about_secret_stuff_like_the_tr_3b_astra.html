       So, we know the TR-3B Astra exists, its not exactly secret, just not official.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are learning the universe is actually a plasma/electric universe, although its not official either, and most official sources you find on plasma cosmology will try to debunk it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other secret stuff is out there that you know of?

       You do also know that many groups of scientists have been striving to get these types of patents listed so they can benefit mankind? It's not all controlled and some parents have slipped through on purpose to allow people to discover certain patent designs and applications.

       There is a mini nuclear power plant under Greenland when the US was planning on putting a base with nuclear missiles under the ice to attack Russia. In the near future all of the radioactive materials will be exposed when the ice melts at the current rate. This was part of operation icebreaker iirc.

       Have you heard of the straw man? That's a position that's easier to beat than the real position. I would say "Alien technology" is such a position. I'm interested in understanding why "Alien technology" requires the rapid political globalization of nation states and the transparent military aggression unmistakably characteristic of the 21st century liberal democracies so far. And why does so-called Liberalism overtly shroud an event like 9-11, while far-right and far-left constituencies find themselves willing and able to unite in opposition to that monstrosity and other obvious conspiracies hiding between patently untrue standard explanations and the fear and confusion they subconsciously induce, especially within a straight-forward "government stance" of assumed innocence which defies the intelligence of the 50% (which is a whole lot of brain power) who think this is a conspiracy but rarely go on record as such?

       All previous wars had somewhat mysterious triggers. But they were real-world triggers (Pearl Harbor, etc). This seems to be an "un-announceable Pearl Harbor". OK, we won WWII because the general public was tolerably aware of the situation, agreed with the government, and pitched in. Why does not that same logic hold now?
      </p>

       Unless it isn't even a fight. Maybe it's a takeover. Which might be a relief to a lot of people just about now. I just think we should know the difference, and as I recall, that's the job of the Press. So claimed Voltaire.

       Archeologists inexplicably found Mercury pools at the Teotihuacan pyramid ruins in Mexico. Also much of the place had suffered a fire in early times. Ship blew up on launch pad? This was covered in an episode of Ancient Aliens this season.

       Also Qin Shi Huang's tomb near the terracotta army is said to have had flowing rivers of mercury but has yet to be opened and verified. However:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the 1980s Chinese researchers found that the soil in the burial mound above the tomb contains mercury concentrations way above those elsewhere in the vicinity.

       Also mercury was found in tombs in ancient Egypt dating to around 1500 B.C.

       I've been waiting to talk Mercury. Only for this reason though: I found out a few years ago that ancient tombs or sites, pyramids, ect, some of those sites have rivers or lakes of Mercury below them or something. I remember two, one in China and one in ancient Aztec or Mayan sites. They had Mercury pools near them or below them in hidden chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing that our ancestors were way more advanced than we give them credit for in main stream discussions, could they have any way of using that tech back then?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the ancients did cut stone and moved tons of it, and all that thousands of years ago, and in ways we can't reproduce even today.

       You should check out the history of India’s Vinamas. They have scrolls along with the Chinese detailing how they were given to them by “Gods” otherwise known as a highly evolved race. They say what powered these flying ships was Mercury Vortex Engines which is similar to electric propulsion. Also, there are manuscripts that the Chinese has on how to build the ship. Not only is all of this information available on the Sanskrit text but if you look at most of India’s palaces and temples they resemble how the Vinama closely resemble it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do want to make a wild assumption about it though, since there was Mercury found in the Pyramids would this mean that they were actively engaging with other civilizations?

       my guess is that there was an astroidal impact 13000 years ago that destroyed a more advanced civilization.  those that escaped found safe havens in places like egypt and did what they could to share the knowledge they had/where able to salvage.

       probably the best 2 starting points:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) The old Abovetopsecret forum thread where that "Astr0" guy wrote down his "story":
       <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1023494/pg1">
        http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1023494/pg1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some parts of what he told people back then were strongly in tune with many other reports and threads regarding the topic of "black triangles", that I read across the span of 15 years of ufo/conspiracy research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially the "dream recording stuff"/the general "importance of dreams" was a very interesting detail...
      </p>
      <p>
       which I later also found mentioned in many places at the second source:
      </p>
      <p>

       Forgotten Languages, probably the strangest website you will ever find.
      </p>
      <p>
       For initial research into FL itself, checkout the reddit megathread and the 4chan archives:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6xb4d2/forgottenlanguages_megathread_long/">

      <p>
       Short explanation: The articles you find on that site are mostly encrypted with a special software that generates artificial "constructed languages" that also have a secondary function as anti-languages.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means, that you can only decrypt the artificial languages if you yourself have the software (called nodespaces). The anti-language function also "swallows" your intention, making the process of just even trying a non-nodespaces translation absolutely futile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully there are quite a lot of snippets of knowledge in English all across the website.
      </p>
      <p>
       FL is not a LARP/Alternate Reality Game, the website has ties to defence/intelligence services/communities and also military remote viewing, aswell as occultism and ancient mysticism, plays a large part in all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, it is not very easy to digest.

       finally! somebody who can tell me about forgotten languages.
      </p>
      <p>
       so you really think it's not an ARG huh? i went down this rabbit hole a while ago and was really on the verge of believing that it was a forum for controlled/limited disclosure- until i saw a thread on /x/ implying that it was all a LARP. very fascinating stuff. are you involved in the community trying to translate it at all?

       I have been looking into that website for like half a year give or take, because at some point you stumble on what you are supposed to find I guess (after researching lots of UFO/"conspiracy" stuff for more than 15 years).
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion it is most certainly not a LARP/ARG - far too much effort went (and still goes everyday) into all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably it is ultimately at the top level directed by an advanced AI that can send messages from the future back into our present day for dissemination to "whomever it concerns".
      </p>
      <p>
       That AI seems to be aided by human agents (Ayndryl and the other "contributors") that are subtly placed under full cybernetic/memetic control to perform the AIs bidding in our present day.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing to be translated, as Ayndryl (the FL "master admin") once explained to some guy from 4chan via email, their area of expertise is the topic of anti-languages and translation avoidance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole structure of the constructed languages formed by the nodespaces software prevents translation without having your own nodespaces version, the anti-language structure literally swallows your intention of translating the content, ultimately it leaves you running in circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am on my own in this, not involved with any community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also so far I have not contacted the FL "admins"... but some of the recent video uploads were "quite helpful" for me specifically
(the videos are mostly a form of advanced transfer mechanism for memetic structures), as I was able to deduce further instructions for research and also information/guidance about remote viewing from them.

       Hm,
      </p>
      <p>
       I mostly pointed out the transmission of dreams as it is a shared component between "Astr0's" tale on ATS forums back in 2014 and a very recurring theme found within FL (especially in recent articles).
      </p>
      <p>
       I am more or less myself just about starting to research that specific topic, but first I somehow have to improve my "dreaming skills" I guess, because I am not that much of an imaginative or lucid dreamer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably the transmitted dreams will have shared/similar themes, but that is just a guess.
      </p>

       They are probably able to target the whole EM spectrum and any given device in the area they operate in.

      <p>
       I dont know the specifics of their subliminal message transmission capabilities, but it seems they are for example able to influence the creations of artists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reason why I believe they can influence the work of artists:
      </p>
      <p>
       Around x-mas time, so like 2 months ago, I had watched one of the FL youtube videos and then "by accident" some hours later I found a quite interesting music video from some unrelated artist being discussed in another forum and through some mental combination work I then edited the audio track from the FL video onto the visual part of that music video... resulting in a new message that was able to transmit specific meaning to me.

       Interesting topic, but it's difficult for me to verify the existence/feasibility of any of those things. I can verify the feasibility of things like an

       Cost reduction in access to space would generate trillions of dollars in economic growth from

       .

       As far as I know we are not trying to do this at the moment. The reason is it costs a lot to bring material up to space and we do not yet have publicly (or otherwise as far as I know) the ability to mine the moon for materials so we need to bring them up from Earth. You can imagine the costs - but you can also google the costs and find out real easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only is bringing the materials up to space a challenge, doing even the simplest thing like replacing a module takes many many hours of spacewalk.

       Paul Birch, who came up with the orbital ring concept, estimated

        $13 billion
       </a>
       (p.5) for the whole thing back in the 1980s. His ideas was to build a Partial Orbital Ring System (PORS) which is pretty similar to a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loop">
        launch loop
       </a>
       and use that to send the material up for the full orbital ring system.

       I'm not arguing that it would be worth it, it's just that considering the world at this moment it's not going to happen. Nobody has 13 trillion dollars to spend, or even one trillion dollars. And how would you make that money back? Mining Palladium? If you bring massive amounts of any metal or substance back to Earth obviously the price would plummet - one of the reasons DeBeers artificially inflates the price of Diamonds, even though more pure diamonds are now made in labs without issue.

       Assuming that's true (many of these things actually have pretty inelastic demand, but we'll just assume your premise), I'm not sure why you think a post-scarcity economy is bad.

       'Suppressed secret cosmology' conspiracy theories are just the worst. What is the point? What does anyone gain by suppressing knowledge of basic physical law? How would they ever do that? Per the theory we can't ever know, because we're living in a fantasy world with fantasy physical laws. It's 'perfectly circular' like a plate of spaghetti.

       Power. Control. If you hide the true math and physics, you hide true free energy and other related systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all ties back into electricity and control and greed. The world would be a completely different place today if the idea of free energy was widely understood/accepted. These new physic and math equations make it possible to do such things. Advanced propulsion systems, advanced free energy systems. Advanced aircraft, advanced technology. Think about it. You really think the deep state wants the average consumer to have access to that kind of stuff?
      </p>
      <p>
       NO. They want you to keep working your whole life so you can buy new pointless shit like a iPhone and other dumb crap that keeps you entertained and distracted from the truth.

       I'm being cute, I do understand the rationale, and I don't disagree at all that there is enormous technological suppression happening. IMO it's become the entire purpose of modern civilization, ever since the development of powered flight. But none of that's really 'secret' (just something the MK'd masses are trained to compartmentalize away and not think about), and it's not at all dependent on keeping natural law secret - perhaps arguably on keeping people disinterested in science and philosophy, which could be said to be splitting hairs, but the point I'm making is that there isn't any particular (or perhaps better said 'singular') 'secret cosmology'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll also just say, we already have 'free energy'. The Sun is a more perfect energy source than humans will probably ever use. Energy crises have always been bullshit economic (aka marketing/sales) events. Electricity is already essentially free, or certainly could be (and is charged for mostly out of social custom). The documented historical tech suppression of the petrol cartels and nations (shutting down public transport, collusion to control fuel efficiency of engines and prevent the manufacture of alternatively powered ones, etc.) is, again, not dependent or because of there actually being any singular 'suppressed secret cosmology' that holds all the answers and spells out our pathway to the stars.

       After World War II, many German tanker loads were seized and taken and found to contain mercury. A lot of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the Germans were conducting research into advanced propulsion systems. Many UBoats after the war were found with mercury shipments.
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably know where I'm going with this but it looks like the Germans had managed to get some experimental craft and needed the Mercury to help power the propulsion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have many links on this but it was being discussed on an episode of disclosure on Gaia streaming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like the Germans knew what they were doing.

       It's funny, all the scientists that came from Germany, they spoke of many more that were not taken in by the United States, scientists who were of greater value, who had knowledge on Plasma, and electricity, we seemed to get a bunch of guys stuck with the old particle ideology, bringing them down the nuclear fission route.

       So its highly unprobable to create a plasma "shield" this way and anti-gravity has nothing to do with it.
But maybe i'm wrong. but just saying something with no proof is a total bullshit
