However, perhaps this shoddy treatment by YouTube will help to open her eyes.  What I mean to say is -- she doesn&#39;t seem to believe in false flag operations, but now she sees that discussing them is becoming off-limits (at least to YouTube), so maybe that will give her cause to step back and think about why TPTB are trying to shut down discussion.</p>

<p>This is a huge problem, people seem to think the internet is run by some constitution of free speech when the reality is they are guests on a privately owned corporate website.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely BUT, people cannot monetize their vlogs and other crapola on those sites so the old saying applies: &quot;money makes the monkey dance&quot; and as long as YT pays out, and no one else is able to provide a similar pay out, they will continue to dominate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we&#39;re getting bogged down in semantics, I think Youtube is very clearly banning free speech.

    <div class="md"><p>I am sure that the US legal right to free speech (if that&#39;s specifically what we&#39;re talking about) does not apply to private or corporate run services. I am sure that Youtube are limiting the act of speaking freely but not impinging on your legal right to free speech. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like to say that is a semantic argument but I suppose it is. I didn&#39;t consider that people were making a distinction between the act of speaking freely and the legal right to free speech. But the bottom line is your legal right to free speech is not something Youtube have to respect.</p>

<p>And where I currently reside, there is no free speech law. It&#39;s not a universal thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are banning free speech in their platform.  They always have done so.  It was all in the terms of service.  What they are doing now is extending the terms of service beyond pornography and violence to include specific opinions.  This is an infringement of free speech (notice that I DID NOT SAY first Amendment) on their platform</p>

<p>There are other platforms, but YouTube has a 76% market share <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/online-video">https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/online-video</a>, so they have a huge say in what opinions people will see.</p>

<p>So in that revised context yes Youtube are limiting the act of speaking freely. But they are not impinging on your legal right to free speech (if you live in a country that has such a law).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the question isn&#39;t it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to say something like &quot;I don&#39;t want to choose a Youtube alternative because they have no users and my content won&#39;t get seen&quot;. But remember Youtube started from nothing too. I know the barrier to entry is a mile higher than it was back then so it&#39;s not all that straightforward.</p>

<p>But ... I&#39;m yearning for an alternative and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m alone in that. I honestly believe that at some point we Internet users will come to realize our value and power and a privacy focused non data-mining service will be made available. Somebody else made the point that Google would probably just buy such a service but if it was done along the lines of the open source software movement with legally binding licensing and whatnot, I think we could have a good chance.</p>

<p>In this case, YouTube IS restricting free speech and extending their TOS to include specific opinions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh they absolutely are restricting speech. But they have the right to do so on their platform. Just like if you were to start a website it would be your choice what content goes up or stays on be site. </p>

<p>In order for speech to be actually and truly restricted in the way it is meant in the constitution, there must be punishments implemented on you for saying something. The government is the only one who has the power to legally silence you. A private business cannot silence you completely, only on their service can they control what is said and that is their right. </p>

<p>So to the point of the original comment, no rights are being taken away since you don’t have rights when dealing with a private entity. You can’t lose what you don’t have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freedom of speech goes a lot deeper than that, The first amendment is a god given right that the government is not permitted to interfere with in any way.  The argument you&#39;re using means any assistance the government gives google would be a direct violation of the first amendment.  That means no more corporate welfare and more canoodling with the CIA.  That means none of that for anybody.  It would be a pretty serious blow to the free market that you probably think you&#39;re defending.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no such thing as a god given right. All of the “rights” you have while in this country are subject to vote by people. It used to be a right to own people, that changed. Rights change. Several court cases have affirmed that government interaction with a private entity does not make that entity a part of the government. Therefore when YouTube imposes censorship on their platform, they are well within their rights to do so. They are not the government. So until YouTube is ruled as acting as a part of the government, they will be free to remove any content they choose too from their platform. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re wrong and stupid, and here is why.  You&#39;re thinking of the bill of rights like an endowment. Like a benevolent Uncle Sam is bestowing rights on us like he&#39;s flinging handfuls of freedom candy out onto the grateful masses. That&#39;s not what it is. It&#39;s a contract in which the government agrees to protect the rights that are already ours to fight for and defend, in exchange for our citizenship.  Nobody gives me the right to free speech and nobody takes it away. A &quot;vote&quot; as you put it, when in fact it takes a constitutional convention (Which is a huge ordeal, BTW) doesn&#39;t give or take rights.  It defines what rights the government is obligated to protect.  Google can censor all it wants and it&#39;s no different then me telling you to shut up, but if Uncle Sam is in anyway way helping them do that.. and they most certainly are (even if we&#39;re not talking about black money or Smith-Mundt Act stuff), than it is absolutely a 1st amendment issue.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, it doesn’t take a constitutional convention to amend the constitution. An amendment is proposed in congress, it must then receive a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress. If it does and is signed by the president, then three-fourths of the States must affirm the amendment with a vote in their state legislature. If all this is done, then the proposed amendment becomes a legal amendment to the US constitution. The constitutional convention is a way to amend the constitution but is not the only way and has never actually been used to establish a new amendment. </p>

<p>As for the bill of rights, there is nothing special about them in legal terms. They are amendments to the constitution. Subject to the same rules as all other amendments. Therefore they can be removed by vote (see the process i detailed above). </p>

<p>The constitution changes, although infrequently. And yes that means that ALL amendments of the constitution can be altered or eliminated. Including the first ten (aka the bill of rights). The only “god given right”’you have is your right to be alive(and even that is questionable as the death penalty is a thing). Everything else is just a right given to you by the government of whatever nation you are in. A god given right can’t be taken away. All the amendments in the constitution can be. You may want to learn how the laws of the country work before you speak again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thought just crossed my mind, what if enough of us got together and started reporting real news sites (for posting there fake news propaganda). If enough people reported the same video or YouTube channel, could that make a difference?  I don&#39;t know the first thing about running a YouTube account, or what happens if you get reported. I just thought it might be a small way to take a stand against them removing YouTube accounts we actually care about and turn to for information.  Maybe?  </p>

<p>And all of these people saying &quot;Duhh they can do whatever they want! They don&#39;t have to give you free speech! Just go somewhere else!&quot;... these are people who have never owned a website or tried to have any kind of online presence outside of anonymous Reddit comments.</p>

<p>Just try it. Try owning a website and try to promote it without any social media or YouTube. And block Google from accessing your website altogether. Nobody uses DuckDuckGo, Gab, or any of this other bullshit that you think is a great alternative. You&#39;ll get very few viewers / readers, and they&#39;re people who are most likely already on &quot;your side&quot; so you&#39;re not bringing in any fresh thoughts and opinions.</p>
