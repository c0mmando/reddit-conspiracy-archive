        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I came across a fecesbook (Facebook) discussion between a few of my friends, regarding an article discussing how the process of banning assault weapons was headed our way (I live in Northern Columbus, Ohio) as well as several other states.</p>

<p>The current definition for Assault Weapon (by the standards of the people creating the legislation) is any gun that houses 10 or more bullets in a single magazine, and/or is capable of semi-automatic fire.</p>

<p>So in other words, if this bullshit passes, literally like every gun in existence outside of Bolt-Action and one or two other types, are going to be illegal to own, and with come with a 5th-degree felony charge if caught with one.</p>

<p>The ignorance behind the topic of Guns is just completely baffling.  I don’t own any guns, not even a pistol for self defense (though I should considering I’ve got a daughter to protect) but I know the difference between fully automatic, semi-automatic, as well as knowing the “AR” in AR-15 doesn’t stand for Assault Rifle, and that when speaking in terms of Assault Rifles, generally that means a militarized version of say, an M-16, etc. (guns that are fully automatic, and employed by armed forces).</p>

<p>I can’t help but feel this is either one of two things. The people pushing this, doing so blindly, and so ignorantly, so that it purposely fails, and sets us back on gun-reform, OR, hoping that with the recent shootings in the last 6months, that they can sneak this past the more educated part of America, in hopes that once it’s established, it will be impossible to reverse, or never be reversed.</p>

<p>This whole thing is just unbelievable to me, that such a broad term could be used in legislation, when basically only one type of weapon is trying to be kept out of reach...</p>

<p>What is your guys take on this situation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, it&#39;s a term/design and the ability to switch firing rates (ie. full auto, 3-round burst, single fire (which would be semi-auto)). Ignorant people conflate the military versions with the &quot;civilian&quot; version(s), because of looks not functionality (ie. if you go into a gun store to buy an AR variant, it will be single fire semi-auto). The military version would be a class 3, and <em>you can get one</em>, but there is a major process behind it and it costs upwards of 20k+. </p>

Like I said, any gun can &quot;assault&quot; just as it can be defensive.

The people trying to pass legislation are the ones saying this...it is their job to be surgical with every word, definition, and meaning in regards to shit they try to pass, yet this is what they came up with? Like I said, I seriously can’t believe it...it’s almost gotta be bullshit for one of the two scenarios to play out like I said.

    <div class="md"><p>No problem.  I hope it doesn’t pass, because that would just be stupid.  And if it does pass, it won’t be until after the fact, that statewide messages are sent out, telling people to forfeit their handguns, and anything else semi-auto will people finally be like “uhh, oh..wait a second..”</p>

<p>But yeah, the anti-gun brigade irritate me almost more than anyone else, b cause they truly don’t understand that criminals will obtain these weapons no matter what.  </p>

<p>If guns are deemed illegal, we will just end up with the CIA bringing in and regulating the flow of weapons, just like they did/do with drugs.</p>

<p>If that ends up being the case, I’d bet that since all guns are illegal, and the “black market is the only place to obtain such things, the laws we had in place that allowed retailers to sell only semi-auto weapons will be null and void, and I would bet, the criminals that have to go to criminal organizations for guns would have just as easy access to fully automatic guns, as they would semi-automatic guns </p>

I have a semi auto hunting rifle and an sks and the hunting rifle is way less scary looking than my sks but the hunting rifle is way more powerful and accurate. If I showed them both to people who were ignorant of guns they would almost unanimously say the sks is an assault rifle and a scarier gun.

    <div class="md"><p>Your last sentence is exactly the point. Military style rifles are specifically made for distance target shooting with a large magazine capacity. The argument that a handgun is just as dangerous is intellectually dishonest. Any gun can execute someone at close range, but if someone wants to cause mass casualties safely you’re just lying to yourself to think both weapons are equal. </p>

<p>It’s not like I’m totally anti gun, I’ll probably own one in the future and my family has plenty, but I can at least recognize unnecessary risks. Also as a side point, the “gun as a tool” analogy to the hammer is dumb. A hammer’s intended purpose is to drive nails into a surface to secure or construct something. A gun’s intended purpose is to throw metal projectiles a long distance extremely quickly with enough power to puncture whatever it hits; it isn’t used to bore holes in stuff, or make rivets, or any other constructive purpose. One is a tool that can be used as a weapon. One is a weapon. And that’s fine, they are good for self defense and home defense, but you gotta call a spade a spade</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I’m so tired of the anti-trump brigade using dead kids as their podium, acting like he’s the reason we have this problem in our country.  I think the guy is an idiot, but as seen posted on this very forum, back in the day, there were quite a few mass shootings linked to people taking anti-depressants, and other psych-altering substances.  Considering like 99% of cases against the pharmaceutical companies were won when proving their drugs nearly solely contributed to the select shootings, you can bet the whole “mental illness” angle will not go anywhere.  Especially while the country is divided over the whole gun issue already.</p>

<p>It appears liberal view is that banning guns is the problem, but bringing up mental illness, and the likelihood of pharmaceuticals contributing to these situations continually results in massive pushback, and liberal shit talking about how the right are a bunch of rednecks who won’t let go of their precious guns.</p>

<p>If there was ever a point in time where the system has us at each others throats over an issue so they don’t have to lift a finger, this is it...110%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So pretty much all weapons will be illegal as technically if they don’t fire full auto, they are semi automatic? Definition of semi automatic is partially automatic which in fire arms terms, means self loading... if you have any sort of weapon that “self loads”, it is deemed illegal. Well see how far this goes. </p>

<p>So in other words, if this bullshit passes, literally like every gun in existence outside of Bolt-Action and one or two other types, are going to be illegal to own</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re greatly overestimating the magazine size of most semi-auto hunting rifles.  7 bullets (6 in the mag, one in the chamber) is the largest capacity I have seen off the shelf.</p>

<p>Most semi-auto handguns have larger capacities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you are wrong. Fully automatic weapons can be owned with a class 3 license. It&#39;s extremely expensive, say around 10k + plus a lot of paper work and extensive background checks, thus the avg Joe can&#39;t afford it. Owning a fully automatic AR is very possible.  </p>
