        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s an enigma in the eyes of mainstream archeology, which is why it&#39;s only been less than 10% excavated in over 20 years. The only reason it wasn&#39;t destroyed upon finding it was because the news of its finding spread too quickly and it would have been clearly suspicious. Can&#39;t destroy it? Drag it out over decades and let the curious people die off. Honestly I&#39;m surprised it hasn&#39;t been destroyed &quot;accidentally&quot; by the ongoing war in nearby Syria.</p>

<p>A few of the reasons that make me believe this: The Vulture stone has been potentially correlated to the younger dryas extinction, there&#39;s animals carved in stone that didn&#39;t exist in that local, and it was deliberately buried.</p>

<p>We have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg, with older circles yet to be excavated. What message will we find when it&#39;s all out in the open?</p>

Mainstream archeology is dragging out the excavation because it would force a paradigm shift in understanding human re-evolution. For one of the greatest finds of modern history, why have &quot;historical&quot; institutions such as the Smithsonian neglected to help fund it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A global revolution?  Why?  On what grounds?  You really think there would be some massive uprising if people learned about a differing version of events or the existence of a publicly-unknown species of hominid from about 30-40,000 years before known human civilization?  Im genuinely curious why you think this.  People don’t even take up arms when they’re bamboozled by the political and donor class into voting against their own interests today and many are so uneducated they couldn’t even tell you how long homo sapiens has been around, let alone when the Bronze Age started, when the Egyptian Old Kingdom existed, when Rome fell, let alone when Warren Harding was president.</p>

This isn&#39;t an opinion I came to overnight.

    <div class="md"><p>Another proto-theory: the plants normally &quot;sync up&quot; with the natural ElectroMagnetic Field (EMF) of the whole planet and especially the near-distance surroundings. The wi-fi man-made EMF, when interacting or overlaying with the planetary EMF, can create a <em>lack</em> of important frequencies that would normally be present and that somehow affects the plant&#39;s growth.</p>

<p>This theory would account for the inconsistent scientific results between different study places and methodologies. It matters exactly how the human-created fields are precisely set up. In fact, it may be possible to <em>improve</em> plant growth by changing that set up.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that we do not understand the natural EMF and its interactions with technological EMF well enough, and the EMF revolution just this last 100 years, massively accelerated by wi-fi, was undertaken with no foresight at all on this area of interaction - everyone just assumed it would all be OK. It&#39;s invisible anyway...</p>

<p>That was basically what they were doing, staring up watching the night sky dance.  Its not like its some crazy thing to think.  It was a lot darker, the skies clearer, and there wasn&#39;t much else to do at night, but watch and observe the changes in the sky, until you realize there are patterns to it and go from there. </p>

<p>Here is right from the second paragraph on the main wiki page on human evolution:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Behavioral modernity, involving the development of language, figurative art and early forms of religion (etc.) is taken to have arisen before 40,000 years ago, marking the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic (in African contexts also known as the Later Stone Age).[2]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with some aspects of magicians of the gods and this was one of them. I don’t think it was deliberately buried. I think it was covered by the same flooding and sediment that buried many other things around the Middle East and pretty much all of n America. I do believe it is the tip of the iceberg and there are likely more sites to be discovered. I think what they are trying to hide is that we are swiftly approaching that same debris field that comes around every 12-13k years  and I don’t think they want the world to know it. TPTB will survive it but most of the rest of us won’t. Hell, I bet the world’s space agencies know it and are helping prepare for the lucky that will be ready</p>

The carving is also inconsistent with the style and level of preservation that we see in Gobekli Tepe.</p>

<p>The picture you linked is actually a carving of the Hindu monkey-god Hanuman from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virupaksha_Temple,_Hampi">Virupaksha Temple Complex in India</a>, which dates from the 7th-10th centuries AD. </p>

<p>where is the comet&#39;s crater?</p>

<p>The craters may look a bit different than you might expect.</p>

<p>See this blog for the pics (scroll down):</p>

<p><a href="https://craterhunter.wordpress.com/a-different-kind-of-climate-catastrophe/">https://craterhunter.wordpress.com/a-different-kind-of-climate-catastrophe/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some time between 20,000, and 30,000 years ago a great comet 50 km to 100 km wide was thrown into the inner solar system. And it immediately began to break up. That disintegrating comet was the progenitor of the Taurid Complex. A family of objects in related, short period, Earth crossing orbits. And 12,900 years ago, just after the end of the last ice age, two large clusters of fragments from that monster, both with the fragment size, density, and distribution like we see in comets Linear, or SW-3. Had a celestial train wreck with this fair world of ours. The individual fragments of each cluster were so close, that in the heart of their respective impact zones, only the first fragments to fall, fell into cold atmosphere. The rest fell into the already superheated impact plumes of those that had gone before. And they just cranked up the heat And pressure.</p>

<p>Something like 1.1 billion tons of material fell in those two clusters. And the event lasted a little over an hour. The progression of the event was a result of the Earth’s movement along it’s orbital path, as it crossed through the orbital path of the giant comet’s debris stream. Not a product of the Earth’s rotation. So that, if it was a daytime event, the fragments would’ve been outbound from perihelion. And as the Earth Crossed the debris stream, the airburst storms would’ve began in the west, and progressed to the east.  In a night time event, the debris stream would be inbound towards their perihelion, and the opposite would be true. You get a better idea of the progression of the event if you consider how fast the Earth itself is traveling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should really watch the Joe Rogan podcasts with Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson. I believe there&#39;s three of them by now. </p>

<p>What Graham believes is that a meteor broke up as it entered the atmosphere 12,800 years ago. The shards rained down over the massive glacial ice sheet which covered the top half of North America at that time. This resulted in a very fast melting of the massive ice sheet, which quickly became the mythic worldwide flood mentioned by countless civilizations mythologies ever since.</p>

<p>If you would like a physical book about the theory, I would highly recommend Magicians of the Gods by Graham Hancock. </p>

Then it got corrupted, it collapsed, according to the global myths of the great flood 12500 years ago, possibly into the sea. 
The corrupt people of Atlantis spread to the 4 corners of the world and slowly took over every more primitive cultures because they had superior technology and &quot;mystery knowledge&quot;. The mystery cults are a descendant of this ancient &quot;knowledge&quot; that was used to entire everyone around the world to join these cults. 
It is possible that the end of Atlantis was similar to our time today, so therefore the information would be dangerous as we would see the blueprint that these mystery cults have planned for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to give a different perspective on this, the fact that only 10% of the site has been excavated really isn&#39;t that surprising. Modern archaeologists know that a lot of the information about a site comes not from the artifacts themselves, but their context (material that it&#39;s buried in). By excavating an entire site, the context is destroyed and most of the information is lost. Instead, we&#39;ll do smaller more precise digs, and leave as much of the context intact as possible for the benefit of future researchers with more advanced techniques.</p>

<p>The other issue with Gobekli Tepe is that Klaus Schmidt, the archaeologist who spearheaded research into the site, died in 2014. The institute he worked with is still doing research on the site, but until someone else is willing to devote their entire career to it, progress will slow down quite a bit.</p>

<p>All that being said, Gobekli Tepe undoubtedly one of the most important sites in the world at the moment and has the potential to rewrite what we know about neolithic societies. I expect we&#39;ll see a lot of interesting revelations coming out of there in the coming decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s not all that surprising, but it is disappointing to say the least. Given the location it is one of the most easily accessible sites to excavate.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any archeological training, but can I sign up still?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The site is currently being run by the German Archaeological institute. You can check out their blog here, which has updates on the progress of the various projects being run on the site (I just found the blog myself, and I gotta say, it&#39;s unusual for a team to provide such regular updates on ongoing projects). I&#39;m not sure how volunteering for digs works with them (and there&#39;s usually a lot of red tape to jump through for high profile sites like this) but the contact information is on the site.</p>

<p>The other thing I&#39;ll mention is that usually only a tiny fraction archaeological research filters down to the mainstream media, which can create the false impression that nothing is being done. The team at Gobekli Tepe has been, and continues to publish their research regularly (almost 80 publications in the last 10 years alone), though most of it isn&#39;t eye-catching enough to warrant mainstream attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you been paying attention about the &quot;bags&quot; that the entities (the pollen gods) carry? </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://ancient-code.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Gobekli-Tepe-hanbag.jpg">1</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://ancient-code.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-handbag-of-the-Gods.jpg">2</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>These entities have been depicted as &quot;gods&quot; with a pinne cone (again symbolism for seeds) but we all know what happens when a foreign civilization more technologically advanced shows up. They are seen and worshiped as gods, especially those bearing gifts in form of seeds in a handbag. </p>

<p>Now fast forward to today, we have build the doomsday vault. Are we preparing in silence for the same thing again? Gobekli Tepe was buried on purpose, be it to hide it from rulers and kings trying to destroy anything that does not fit the narrative or from elemental catastrophes like the floods so vividly described in almost all ancient cultures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a theory that the monoliths being a T shape causes them to possibly work like a tuning forks for a frequency. With the images of animals carved into the stone the theory is that they could possibly hold frequencies for different animals in the rocks, sort of like holding information until we are at a point where we understand how to use that information. Whether its true or not is unknown but its very interesting! </p>

Im genuinely curious why you think this.  People don’t even take up arms when they’re bamboozled by the political and donor class into voting against their own interests today and many are so uneducated they couldn’t even tell you how long homo sapiens has been around, let alone when the Bronze Age started, when the Egyptian Old Kingdom existed, when Rome fell, let alone when Warren Harding was president.</p>
