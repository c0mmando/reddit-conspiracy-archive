<p>So these redditors are circle jerking over making a medical procedure MANDATORY?</p>

<p>They want our perfectly non-corrupt government to make a medical procedure MANDATORY for our children and for us to have no say in the matter?</p>

<p>They want us to be forced to receive the product of a pharmaceutical industry, for which the manufacturers are EXEMPT from any liability? </p>

<p>They want us to be forced to receive a product, which <strong>by law</strong> we canNOT sue for damages?</p>

<p>Even if you think vaccines are great, the brainwashing here is preposterous.</p>

<p>And unfortunately if you want to know the truth about vaccines, there is a bit of a learning curve. That&#39;s the problem with Reddit... The small simplistic sound bytes from the pharmaceutical industry (herd immunity! Polio! Safe and effective!) get upvoted, while the lengthy boring explanations of how vaccines can be dangerous get down voted to oblivion, where they are not seen.</p>

<p>As dr. Suzanne Humphries mentions here, <a href="https://youtu.be/toFrsBaqtgg">https://youtu.be/toFrsBaqtgg</a>, actually learning something new takes longer. Actually going through the medical literature is boring. Actually overcoming your cognitive dissonance in light of new information is not easy.</p>

<p>I cannot address the motives of these debunkers; for all I know they may be absolutely sincere true believers in status quo explanations for everything. But it is almost uncanny how academia, government agencies, and the mainstream media seem to want us all to believe in statin drugs, chemotherapy, and vaccines (all very profitable for the pharmaceutical industry). We are repeatedly told that man-caused global warming is a dire threat, that JFK was killed by a lone gunman, that UFOs do not exist, and that new-Darwinism explains evolution. And the &quot;skeptics&quot; reliably preach this party line. If <strong>scientism</strong> is a kind of religion, the debunkers resemble the Inquisition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s weird. I find it more weird that the antivax movement is getting traction at all. It&#39;s not a circle jerk, it&#39;s just common sense.</p>

<p>Its like someone coming out and just saying &quot;we should abolish shoes&quot;. The general response you&#39;re going to get is that the majority doesn&#39;t agree. It&#39;s not a circlejerk, it&#39;s just that common sense is being questioned without a solid basis. </p>

<p>Then, instead of accepting that, because the general population is so pro-shoe, this sub starts scratching their chin and sayin &quot;hmmm everyone is pro this so I should be anti this&quot; and refuses to believe any points otherwise, while simultaneously putting the burden of proof of the full populace instead of themselves.</p>

<p>Next thing you know you&#39;ve got a bunch of idiots running around without shoes on getting hepatitis and infections claiming their better off for it because the government isn&#39;t controlling the way they walk anymore. </p>

<p>There is so much left for us all to learn, To me the biggest conspiracy on this planet is the actual hiding of the reality of our &quot;reality&quot; and keeping people seperated and in a constant created state of duality, chaos and misery.

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t have an issue with normal vaccines, the medical reasoning behind it makes sense and is true regarding gaining immunities... but that flu shot makes no sense to me. &#39;I mentioned it in an old post but I got extremely skeptical of it this year cause my insurance company kept texting me multiple times to remind me to get the flu shot and even &quot;text back with DONE&quot; to inform them. Normally don&#39;t hear anything from them. I usually don&#39;t go too far into conspiracy but if I wanted to secretly implant something into people, this is a great way to do it... an optional flu shot that people who are hip would refuse while the unsuspecting would take it on their doctors advice or just cause its the thing to do. We have awhole ecosystem of bacteria in us.. but possibly even fungi/yeast, parasites, or viruses, some that go undetected... some beneficial, some not. </p>

<p>For the record, I have never gotten the flu shot as I never felt the need and I might only get sick enough to miss multiples day off work once a year... nothing major tho. And like you said, they &quot;guesstimate&quot; a strain to protect against each year and it doesn&#39;t always work out. There is also the fact that saudia Arabia refused the flu shot vials that came from US so if those dudes are suspicious then mebbe its worth skipping. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot more complicated than that friend. There&#39;s vaccine reactions (which people don&#39;t realize their kid&#39;s chronic illnesses are reactions), contamination (like sv40), vaccine escape mutants, actually faring WORSE if you catch the illness anyway (like with the pertussis vaccine... kids get so many doses of that, that they sometimes work more like repeated-exposure allergy shots than vaccines), epigenetic changes from aluminum binding with phosphates in the cell nucleus, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, the good ol herd immunity lie:</p>

<p>Dr. Russell Blaylock MD, a retired neurosurgeon, says that if one takes a moment to consider the history of vaccination, the concept of herd immunity as it applies to vaccines unravels quickly.</p>

<p>“When I was in medical school, we were taught that all of the childhood vaccines lasted a lifetime. This thinking existed for over 70 years. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. In essence, at least 50% or more of the population was unprotected for decades.</p>

<p>If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95%. Yet, we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50% or less of the population having vaccine protection. That is, herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades and no resurgent epidemics have occurred.</p>

<p>Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He does actually research vaccines.  His specialty is in microbiology, which is very similar to immunology and is applicable to vaccines.  He has put out dozens of papers, and is an incredibly knowledgeable person.  </p>

<p>I can pull you up a bunch of peer-reviewed studies that clearly demonstrate that vaccine-induced immunity generally does not last much more than a decade.  There have been a lot of mumps outbreaks in colleges of fully vaccinated populations, scientists looked into it and realized that it was because vaccine induced mumps immunity was very short lived.  </p>

<p>Why do you assume that &quot;people who actually research vaccines&quot; say they impart lifetime immunity? Nobody says that anymore, it has been thoroughly disproven.  Herd immunity is a myth for most diseases, it may technically be possible, but it would require a lot of boosters throughout life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it wasn&#39;t a bullshit paper and Dr. Wakefield was exonerated. Maybe you should be doing some research of your own there, bud.</p>

<p>&quot;Despite Molyneux alluding to “other elements” which he did not name, at least both The Lancet and Dr. Andrew Wakefield agree that he was exonerated of the disciplinary findings against him now that they have been completely overturned. The British Medical Journal had better have a strong enough relationship with the drug company Merck to offset the expulsion from the National Library of Medicine that journal may now face as a result of defaming Dr. Wakefield. Now that The Lancet ombudsman has acknowledged that elements of its own retraction of Dr. Wakefield’s paper have proven to be false, The Lancet had better hope the same for its own relationship with Merck as well.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you are incorrect. Most vaccines don’t even have any virus in them, they contain surface proteins that viral bodies produce, so that the body can recognize and develop antibodies against those proteins which allows the immune system to know to attack things that have these proteins on them. The point of immunizing children is to give immunity before there is a chance of contracting the actual disease which would obviously cause infection, not be the heavily regulated inactive formulation specifically made to cause immunization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you believe injecting aborted fetal cells, bovine DNA, formaldehyde, aluminum, mercury, antifreeze, 2-Phenoxyethanol, phenol, methanol, MSG, polysorbate 20/80, foreign DNA, etc. in an undeveloped immune system is smart and safe?!?!</p>

<p>As for the viruses, you are wrong:</p>

<p>&quot;The live viruses found in some vaccines are frequently said to be killed, inactivated, or attenuated. This is a myth. The main method used to inactivate viruses is treatment with formaldehyde. Its effectiveness is limited and temporary. Once the brew is injected into the body, the formaldehyde is broken down: potentially releasing the virus in its original state. It is documented in orthodox medical literature that the &quot;crippled&quot; viruses can revert to their former virulence.</p>

<p>The viruses and bacteria included in vaccines are claimed to be in very small volume. However, these quantities are high enough for the diseases to occur in some people. Most of the diseases that people are vaccinated against no longer occur in the Western world, and only ever result from the vaccines. When they do occur, the vaccine-induced cases are always more severe than normal infections of the same pathogens, and these cases are sometimes fatal. Deaths have been reported in the British medical journal, Lancet, from vaccine-induced yellow fever. A susceptible person may succumb to infection when exposed to only a minute dose, especially when it is injected directly into the bloodstream. Conversely, there are other cases in which a healthy person will not succumb, even when exposed to large doses environmentally. It is not the pathogens, but the interaction methods between pathogens and hosts which causes diseases to appear, and ultimately determines their severity.</p>

<p>Most disease symptoms are the visible signs of a body&#39;s attempts to defend itself against infections. With disease injections, many important defenses in the digestion path and mucous membranes are bypassed.&quot;</p>

<p>The CDC source only includes components, not percentages. Don’t get swept up by fear mongering. The viruses section about them recovering to the point of infection after injection is filled with false conjecture. Read more primary literature. Read more about the regulation of the design and testing of vaccines. Hell, even if you just stick to some more scientically grounded articles with more than 2 sources youll be better off.  I understand that a lot of the biochemistry is difficult to understand but that oped is just fear mongering. “Aborted fetal cells” are embryonic stem cells. They are used in every human tissue lab in America. They are not scary, they are useful. “Bovine dna” they refer to is FBS, fetal bovine serum, a culture medium that contains lots of embryonic growth factors. The article is plastered with pictures of big ass containers of things that are harmful when you ingest a lot of it but it ignores the biochemical interactions these substances have with one another that only serve to preserve and protect the patient and vaccine, as well as even more baseless conjecture about substances thwy coildnt find negative warnings about  Forgive me for paraphrasing, but one of the sentences says something like “We can only guess what this chemical does, but its gotta be bad”  Hell im surprised they didnt have a picture of old chinese food next tl the MSG section</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, you can try to sugar coat and say these harmful chemicals are not harmful when in fact they are yet if vaccines were safe and effective, how come the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting system exists? Why are pharmaceutical companies unable to be held liable for damages/deaths caused by their products?</p>

<p>&quot;The court voted 6-2 against the parents of a child who sued the drug maker Wyeth in Pennsylvania state court, for the health problems they say their daughter, now 19, suffered from a vaccine she received in infancy.</p>

<p>The ruling was a stinging defeat for families dissatisfied with how they had fared before a special no-fault vaccine court.</p>

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said Congress set up a special vaccine court in 1986 to handle such claims as a way to provide compensation to injured children without driving drug manufacturers from the vaccine market. The idea, he said, was to create a system that spares the drug companies the costs of defending against parents&#39; lawsuits.</p>

<p>Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented. Nothing in the 1986 law &quot;remotely suggests that Congress intended such a result,&quot; Sotomayor wrote, taking issue with Scalia.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually had to chuckle at that last line. It’s as if some people forgot how many people used to die yearly around the world at younger ages from diseases that are now rarely seen because of how effective vaccines are. Even the damn cbs article you linked ends with the pediatric association calling vaccines a marvel of modern medicine. </p>

<p>Here’s a CDC link for you <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm</a></p>

<p>You can do some more <em>incredibly easy</em> searching to compare influenza deaths of vaccinated children to unvaccinated children, and the number is something close to 75% of the deaths were of unvaccinated children. And you might look at that already staggeringly hight percentage and still try to convince yourself “that’s only 3 out of 4”, but when you also consider that on average about 60% of children get a flu shot per year that number gets noticeably bigger in relation to the total number of children in the US. Hell, this flu season alone so far 85% of pediatric deaths are of unvaccinated kids. </p>

<p>Stop deluding yourself that you know better than the hundreds of thousands of medical professionals who praise vaccines as a medical marvel. Because you don’t know the science, you act you can’t trust doctors, but you can trust clickbait “alternative medicine” sites like heathwyze which, even though I didn’t explicitly say it in the last comment, twists the fuck out of the articles it purports to review to fit their own narrative. Just read one that alluded to a study showing that cilantro could heal infections, skipping over the fact that it was only shown to work in combination with antibiotics. That site is dishonest at best and a sham at worst. </p>

<p>In case you doubt the information about these ingredients, here is the information from the vaccine inserts showing these toxins are contained within them.</p>

<p><a href="https://vaccines.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005206">https://vaccines.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005206</a></p>

<p>Then on top of these dangerous ingredients, we need to worry about the contaminants which find their way into these vaccines.</p>

<p>&quot;Researchers examining 44 samples of 30 different vaccines found dangerous contaminants, including red blood cells in one vaccine and metal toxicants in every single sample tested – except in one animal vaccine.</p>

<p>Using extremely sensitive new technologies not used in vaccine manufacturing, Italian scientists reported they were “baffled” by their discoveries which included single particles and aggregates of organic debris including red cells of human or possibly animal origin and metals including lead, tungsten, gold, and chromium, that have been linked to autoimmune disease and leukemia.</p>

<p>In the study, published this week in the International Journal of Vaccines and Vaccination, the researchers led by Antonietta Gatti, of the National Council of Research of Italy and the Scientific Director of Nanodiagnostics, say their results “show the presence of micro- and nano-sized particulate matter composed of inorganic elements in vaccine samples” not declared in the products’ ingredients lists.</p>

<p>Lead particles were found in the cervical cancer vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, for example, and in the seasonal flu vaccine Aggripal manufactured by Novartis as well as in the Meningetec vaccine meant to protect against meningitis C.</p>

<p>Samples of an infant vaccine called Infarix Hexa (against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenzae type B) manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline was found to contain stainless steel, tungsten and a gold-zinc aggregate.</p>

<p>Other metal contaminants included platinum, silver, bismuth, iron, and chromium. Chromium (alone or in alloy with iron and nickel) was identified in 25 of the human vaccines from Italy and France that were tested.</p>

<p>GSK’s Fluarix vaccine for children three years and older contained 11 metals and aggregates of metals. Similar aggregates to those identified in the vaccines have been shown to be prevalent in cases of leukemia, the researchers noted.</p>

<p>Many of the vaccines contained iron and iron alloys which, according to the researchers, “can corrode and the corrosion products exert a toxicity affecting the tissues”.</p>

<p>And please refrain from using the CDC as a source. They have been caught ficing numbers and lying too many times to count.</p>

<p>&quot;Dr. William Thompson, senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contacted me during 2013 and 2014 and shared many issues regarding fraud and malfeasance in the CDC, specifically regarding the link between neurodevelopmental disorders and childhood vaccines. Dr. Thompson and I spoke on the phone more than 40 times over a 10 month period and he shared thousands of pages of CDC documents with me. Eventually, Dr. Thompson turned this information over to Congress via Rep. Bill Posey of Florida. Among the issues discussed in the phone conversations were lies told to the public by the CDC regarding the link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders (including autism) as well as the links between the MMR vaccine and autism in African American males and the MMR vaccine and “isolated” autism. Isolated autism is the term coined by CDC researchers referring to all children who received an autism diagnosis without additional diagnoses of mental retardation, cerebral palsy, visual impairment or hearing impairment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The group, which claimed to represent scientists across the CDC&#39;s diverse branches, calls itself SPIDER (Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research). The letter to CDC Chief of Staff, Carmen Villar, expressed alarm &quot;about the current state of ethics at our agency.&quot; The scientists complained that &quot;our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests&quot; and &quot;circumvented by some of our leaders.&quot;</p>

<p>The scientists told Villar that, &quot;questionable and unethical practices, occurring at all levels and in all of our respective units, threaten to undermine our credibility and reputation as a trusted leader in public health.&quot; The letter charged that staff level scientists &quot;are intimidated and pressed to do things they know are not right,&quot; and that, &quot;Senior management officials at CDC are clearly aware and even condone these behaviors.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay Im not defending vaccines but your post got me thinking. Does this apply to ALL vaccines cuz last year i had to take 2 of them for preparation for a trip to Saudi Arabia. One was for flu and one was some kind of fever i could catch from an arab place. So what is the conspiracy behind vaccines? Ia it to keep us sterile? Microchipped? Dumb down our minds? I never felt none of those, Im defo a skeptic to these things to get me wrong. And this is a trip i had to take to go on Umrah, Muslim pilgramage. The funny thing is I left Islam after that trip and still was 100% myself. Felt no different since i had those jabs. Now the irony is I caught the cold flu over there even when i had a flu jab. Sometimes I think vaccines may be important depending the level of disease but sometimes I think they are pointless such as a flu jab. Can someone please enlighten me about this vaccine and the conspiracy within the issue? </p>

<p>My personal opinion? It&#39;s just that the manufacturers want to make money, and that normal doctors don&#39;t take the time to think for themselves. Could you imagine the medical system admitting that (most) vaccines are dangerous? They&#39;re so far in over their heads with their lies, that they can&#39;t ever go back. And most doctors are well intentioned but brainwashed and don&#39;t want to hear any evidence against vaccines. It&#39;s human nature not to go against the grain. </p>

<p>Also, the medical industry really doesn&#39;t make much off vaccines. Places like CVS, Walmart, etc., all offer vaccines for free if you simply walk in. A flu shot of 10 doses costs, on average, $8 to produce, and is sold at an average price of $14 to the public sector, and $16 to the private sector. So that&#39;s 60 cents profit per person. 60 cents times, let&#39;s say, 100 million, is 60 million dollars profit. That is not a lot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through the comments and the unquestioning, blind faith every one of these commenters places into this is terrifying. It almost feels like a witch hunt. They maliciously insult anyone who questions the injections and  demand that it be forcefully administered by law. It’s beyond all reason that they never question the dangers this train of thought could lead to. How can they be certain that what is being injected into their bodies is safe? </p>

<p>Another issue is the blanket statements being used against any who question these injections. I don’t have an issue with all vaccines. I agree that vaccines are arguably one of the greatest scientific achievements of our time, but that’s not to say that every single vaccine ever created from here on into the future is going to be considered free from all scrutiny. When did it become unacceptable to question what is being injected into our bodies, particularly the bodies of developing infants. </p>

<p>The CDC is an institution like any other, run by human men. They can be influenced and bought just like any other. If any one of their immeasurably profitable vaccines (a multi billion dollar industry) is threatened by inconvenient data, this information can and will be suppressed. Human men, with families to feed and lives that run on money, these are the people we are being asked to put our blind faith into. These are the ones who decide what gets injected into our infant children. And they have the public riled up in an angry mob of a frenzy fighting their battles for them. </p>

<p>Is it true that there was a whistle blower within the CDC that is now not being allowed to testify his case to congress, A doctor who flatly confirms that the CDC are and have been suppressing hard data linking their vaccines to dangerous side effects? Maybe, maybe not, but in this crazy world, even bringing up the question is more than enough to label you a complete nutbag. We are being told to never question authority, we are being called stupid for ever considering people can be influenced by money. If we continue down this path, even the very notion of freedom may be lost to us forever. </p>

<p>Vaccines were originally created in a different time. A time where we could still trust our government to regulate big business. That time is not today. Today our government IS big business. And the vaccine industry is one of the biggest businesses of them all. It is very profitable to have a forced product. It is not profitable to guarantee that products safety. Please remember. This is not the same world our grandparents grew up in. We can not afford to switch off our brains and allow them to make every decision for us. Our lives are worth more than their profits. </p>

<p>I used to believe that too, but the more research I did the more I realized it is a lie, they are essentially a weapon used to control the herd.</p>

<p>The government did used to be a bit better, but back then the science was even worse, so vaccines are causing carnage back then too.</p>

<p>A quick starter pack below for anyone who wants to learn more about the current situation with vaccines.</p>

<p>The main problem we have is that the necessary studies are not being performed, the industry doesn&#39;t want to find the harm their products cause as it can mean loss of confidence, sales and also huge compensation payouts.  So what they do is whitewash their products, data is played with, statistics are used to lie.</p>

<p>For example the honest experts are so sick of Big Pharma for not funding any proper studies into the safety of injecting Aluminum, that now they are crowdfunding for over $600,000 to perform the trials.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated.&quot;</p>

<p>Follow the money!! (see below)</p>

<p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

<p>Under Freedom of Information we see that CDC experts privately admit the dangers of vaccines, they admit that vaccines are causing neurological problems, speech delays and they warn the information must be embargoed.</p>

<p>Key quotes below:-</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</strong></p>

I resisted. And I&#39;m so glad I did, as it was later discovered that the vaccine they used (Pandemrix) had a rare but incurable side effect: narcolepsy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what Reddit’s advertising policy says about health related advertisements, this will shed light on why there are front page posts promoting vaccines.</p>

<p>“ 13. Health-Related Advertisements</p>

<p>Advertisements related to health-care services or health-and-wellness products must comply with applicable laws, regulations, licensing requirements, and industry requirements.  </p>

<p>Advertisements may not promote unapproved or unsafe pharmaceuticals and supplements. Further, advertisements may not make false, misleading, or exaggerated health claims, promote products that are subject to any regulatory action or warning, nor promote a non-government approved product in a manner that implies safety or efficacy in diagnosing, mitigating, treating, curing, or preventing a particular disease or ailment.  Advertisements for online pharmacies and health services, including online therapies, are not permitted.</p>

<p>Subject to the preceding requirements and pre-approval by Reddit, the following products or services may be advertised if approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority”</p>

<p>As you can see only fda approved medications and procedures can advertise on Reddit. Which would make it a very desirable place for a vaccine manufacturer to purchase advertising from Reddit. 131,000,000 users is a lot of people to influence. </p>
