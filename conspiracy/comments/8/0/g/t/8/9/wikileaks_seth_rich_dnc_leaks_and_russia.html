       I'm copying this from a comment reply from another thread here on
      </p>
      <p>
       IIRC, Assange told PBS that DNC was the leak.  Assange told PBS in the interview with Judy Woodruff that the source was from the DNC. There is no evidence whatsoever that Russia was the leak of the DNC emails. I also found the interview where he mentions Seth Rich by name, which I incorrectly stated in my original comment as coming from the PBS interview with Woodruff and Assange.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes sense to me for several reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, Seth Rich was murdered in the street shortly after the leak. Nothing was stolen, and the killers have never been found. He also had the means to be the leak as he worked for the DNC in a position with access to the info leaked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, he was a Bernie fan. Anyone supporting Bernie was outraged when people like Donna Brazile admitted that the DNC rigged the primaries against Bernie. This gives Rich a motive to leak the info.
      </p>
      <p>
       My third line of reasoning stems from the fact that Clinton's campaign was shit talking Russia for a long time. Not saying it may not have been warranted, but they have been trying to pin anything and everything on Russia. It felt to me that they were preparing for a possible military escalation once Clinton assumed office.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes sense that once the leaks happened, if the DNC gave any credence to the possibility that Seth Rich could of been the leak, they would be obvious suspects in his murder. Even if they had nothing to do with it, that would look very bad during an election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only would it look bad, but Trump, being the media whore that he is, would never let it down. He would of hammered the theory over and over if it meant winning the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC and Clinton/Podesta had every motive to put the blame on Russia, which supported their earlier statements about Russian issues they kept pressing in the election, while also pivoting away from any theory that could bring them into the spotlight of not only having a motive to silence Seth Rich, but also giving more attention to the fact that they rigged the Democratic primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldn't they rather create an issue of outside influence on the election, instead of losing face while the public focused on the rigging of the primaries?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since then, the media has been stuck on Russian interference, while the horrendous crime of rigging the primaries has essentially gone unpunished. I have no problem with investigating Russian interference, but I'm beginning to feel that it's become more of a media distraction to keep the public from holding people accountable for the insanity  of our presidential election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately the only links I can find to the 20+ minute interview been Woodruff and Assange is to a Facebook video from the PBS newshour. Facebook links are apparently not allowed, but you can always Google the interview yourself.

       The Bernie Fan thing is a common misconception - the Pandas for Bernie thing isn’t Seth’s account, if that’s what you’re referring to. That account is still active and has claimed he’s not Seth Rich after Seth himself died, so I’m inclined to believe him.

       One thing I've always been confused about is why Kimdotcom claimed that Panda was Seth Rich, even after the account actively claimed that he was not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or did Panda deny being Seth after Kimdotcom made his little announcement? 
As much as I believe it was Seth who leaked the files, and was subsequently murdered for it, I've yet to see anyone come forward with anything but circumstantial evidence.

       Um, no. I didn't say a single thing that you are saying. His account here was MeGrimlock4. I said that his mother said he dressed up like a panda as often as he could and that is something very specific to him.

       This thread has been downvoted literally since the second I put it up.

       There's clearly a lot of people who either disagree with my post, or are trying to keep it down.

       I made it to have a discussion and get feedback on my ideas. I don't expect everyone to agree with me, but just down voting the post without refuting my theory is suspicious to me. That's the way it goes around here lately.

       Still, this is anecdotal evidence, not proof.

       It won't be proven until his murder is resolved. But I'm much more inclined to believe he was the leak as opposed to the Russians.

       Then again, I'm always more inclined towards the conspiratorial side of these things.

       Which is why i require such a high standard for definitive proof. Lest I succumb to my bias and join the ranks of flat earthers and chupacabra chasers.

       There is an obvious civil war going on within the governments various alphabet agencies and military contingent, they all obviously need cover stories. Pretty simple to figure out who the various players are as well as their motives as long as you have been paying attention and your mind doesn’t automatically jump to ‘inter dimensional child molesters’ and things of that nature.

       Oh, when the military contingent that clashed with Obama over how to handle Syria and ISIS decides to rally around a reality tv star, while the whole world catches on fire during the “Summer of Chaos”, with Trump acting erratically every step of the way...I figured it would be obvious.

       Around the time that people found his reddit account, they also found an instagram account called Panda4Progress, which had clearly been his. A group of people then insisted that an unrelated account, Pandas4Bernie, had also been his (for no other reason than the name similarity) when it clearly was not- but many people spread that as fact anyway. That was the origin of the unconfirmed rumor that he was a Bernie supporter. However, that was not the origin of the Panda monicker; it is confirmed that he used it.

       He was about to start a job for the Clinton campaign. This one is hard for people to explain. It's gotten to the point where the theory is he was mad deep under cover. I'm just not buying that.

       I haven't heard that rumor before, but it's also confusing in the sense that it seems like it would be a huge conflict of interest to work for the DNC and a campaign at the same time.

       His parents said this. After Clinton got the nomination he was about to move to New York and work for her campaign. So unless they are lying, Seth probably wasn't some activist against her.

       That would be pretty interesting if true. My questions in regards to that information would be, how is that not a conflict of interest?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did the parents hear that information? Was it from Seth himself, or the DNC/Clinton campaign?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm very skeptical of anything the parents were told after they were provided with a
       <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.wnd.com/2017/05/thats-patently-false-seth-rich-family-spokesman-denies-dnc-is-paying-him/amp/">
        "family spokesman"
       </a>
       by the name of Brad Bauman.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article described Bauman as, "Brad Bauman, a professional Democratic crisis public-relations consultant who has frequently criticized President Trump, abruptly ended a call with WND when asked about his connection to the DNC."
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently he's also been pushing for the whole Trump Russia theory. Why would he be a family spokesman for the murder of Seth Rich?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the DNC didn't refer him, he has a very clear political bias and motive to protect the DNC/Clinton campaign.

       His parents told WaPo that he had been offered a job and was contemplating whether he should take it, not that he accepted a job and was getting ready to move:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Seth had been walking around, calling friends, family and his girlfriend, pondering the broader picture of what the job change would mean," his parents said. "He wondered how he would pick up and move to New York City for four months, the strain that it might put on his relationships, and how it would all affect the life he had built for himself in Washington."

       Washington Post cannot be considered as a credible source on this matter due to their relationship with the DNC and Clinton campaign. They even hired John Podesta after the election. If that's not a proven bias, I don't know what is. As far as Seth Rich is concerned, WaPo is too far out of the realm of journalistic integrity to be credible in this matter.

       Right. And, the recorded conversation with his gf right before he was shot doesn't sound like a couple deciding on a move to me. And she didn't live in DC, anyway, did she? They were already long distance, I think.

       I remember a lot of issues being brought up about who his girlfriend even was. I've tried figuring it out in the past with no luck.

       I also never knew he was offered that job by the campaign on the day of his murder until I read your link. Kind of freaks me out a bit. Theoretically, if Clinton's campaign or the DNC was involved in his assassination, wouldn't offering him a job dispel any theories of his being a Bernie supporter? It sounds an awful lot like a cover up.

       Agreed; he obviously put a lot of work and heart into his work in the DNC and on voter involvement, and I'd imagine that if a good person found that the org they believed in and worked so hard for was so corrupt, the level of betrayal felt would be immense.

       I know people who were very involved in the Democratic Party, and their level/form of anger at the corruption is different from what mine is, as someone who's primarily an independent. They have a feeling of a deep betrayal of trust that I didn't have.

       There's a video of Seth Rich questioning the election commission about ballot integrity not long before his assassination. He was specifically interested in why provisional ballots might be used.

       I think it's fair to say that the guy was interested in the security of our democracy. Those provisional ballots are really placebos that don't count. They do it on purpose to trick people into thinking they're voting when the reality is that a provisional ballot often might as well just go in the trash. If you were one of the hundreds of thousands of people whose voter registration was tampered with in 2016, you would have voted on a placebo ballot (if at all). The funny thing is that although hundreds of thousands of registrations were confirmed tampered with in Brooklyn, NY alone, my experiences on r/sandersforpresident during the 2016 primaries and all the independent evidence I can find suggests that would-be Bernie voters were targeted. If anyone is unfamiliar with that side of the 2016 primaries rigging, I just found

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no evidence whatsoever that Russia was the leak of the DNC emails.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's none that Seth Rich did the leak.  And actually, what about this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/papadopoulos-documents-offer-insight-dnc-email-hacking-timeline/story?id=50832978">
        According to the affidavit, Papadopoulos told FBI agents that in the early part of 2016, one of his foreign contacts (labeled "The Professor" in court documents) “actually told me that the Russians had emails of Clinton.” The affidavit goes on to say that
        <strong>
         Papadopoulos said he learned that before joining the Trump campaign, which would have been before early March 2016
        </strong>
        . He also told investigators that he never told anyone on the Trump campaign about the “dirt” that his contact claimed to have on Clinton, the affidavit states.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sio he knew of the stolen emails in before March 2016  Seth Rich was murdered in July 2016 well after the emails were already in circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kills the Seth Rich timeline if true.

       I was talking about the DNC leaks, not the Clinton emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why would the leaks come out after his murder? It doesn't rule out Rich at all. If not the opposite. Of course he would of had to of been alive in order to leak the info in the first place.

       Not only that, but my link in the post had Assange relating the source to Seth's murder.

       He was about to start a job for the Clinton campaign. This one is hard for people to explain. It's gotten to the point where the theory is he was mad deep under cover. I'm just not buying that.
