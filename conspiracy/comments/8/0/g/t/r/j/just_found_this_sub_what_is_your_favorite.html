Why did they build this?  And, why did we get put here; or, why are we here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So by the time something crashlanded near Roswell, NM we have just collected 1,800 nazi scientists that want a second chance at experimenting on an unsuspecting populace.

    <div class="md"><p>So imagine you&#39;re a Nazi scientist arriving in America, 1947. Nine years after these, now WWII victorious cocky Yankee shits, were shooting their shotguns into a clear night sky based on a radio dramatized broadcast  about alien invaders.  What&#39;s my go to slight of hand whenever I don&#39;t want people to see what I&#39;m doing? I know they&#39;re afraid of aliens already.... hmmm hmmm.  Well maybe first I&#39;ll puzzle them with alien mysteries for a while. Man, I should start harvesting some test subject organs to get the funding I need.  Better catch and release some, dose them, we&#39;ll be dressed as aliens in my black budget stealth helicopter. No one will believe the few actual victims through the fog we create.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a source on that?  I know that women are more likely to catch HSV (in fact all STIs) because of their anatomy, but during herpes outbreaks the lesions are VERY contagious, and coming into contact with them is risky.

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find any stats on how likely it is during an outbreak, but barring lesions on the skin for the virus to get to the bloodstream, it&#39;s still pretty unlikely.  More likely than without an outbreak, surely.</p>

<p>I&#39;d have to dig up a source, but the virus traveling the urethra is highly unlikely.  The reason it&#39;s easier for women to get it (and the reason simplex B is so common; cold sores) is because of an abundance of absorbent soft tissue.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>barring lesions on the skin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that is exactly what an outbreak is - hence why I disagree with you statement that it is <strong>very rare</strong> even if there is a current outbreak.</p>

<p>Definitely outside of outbreaks the chance of transmission is small, its small for male to female and even smaller for female to male.  But given 70% of the time herpes was passed with no apparent outbreaks again I wouldn&#39;t use the phrase very rare.  Unlikely maybe but not rare.</p>

<p>Also HSV does not need to get into the blood stream.  HSV is not a bloodborne virus.  HSV infects the nervous system. If there is skin to skin contact when the virus is shedding (present on the skin) and if the virus breaks through the receiving persons skin then they can get infected with herpes. Technically this can happen anywhere on the body but the mucus membranes in the oral or genital regions are more open to minor tearing and that is why that is where herpes usually breaks out.  Men can get herpes if there is any sort of microscopic tear on the penis, or any other part of the genitals that come into prolonged, vigorous contact with the shedding virus - exactly what happens during PIV sex, or anal or oral sex.</p>

<p>Again I agree that women are more likely to get herpes (and all other STIs) because they have more genital mucosa but IMO saying that men catching genital herpes is <strong>very rare during an outbreak</strong> is disingenuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand me: Lesions on the unaffected party.</p>

<p>Herpes has only a 2% chance of transmitting without an outbreak to males.  I&#39;d call that &quot;rare&quot;.  I can&#39;t find a number for how often it transmits with an outbreak, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it went from &quot;rare&quot; to &quot;unlikely&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s anecdotal, so take is as such, but I dated a woman for two months.  We had a lot of unprotected sex in that time frame.  She told me she had herpes.  She said that she had an outbreak for the week leading up the confession, and that&#39;s the point at which we broke up.  I got tested, and I&#39;m clean as a whistle.  I was terrified, because I was almost certain that I&#39;d have it at that point.</p>

<p>I did a lot of reading about herpes, and an outbreak is much more likely to cause transmission, but it&#39;s far from a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>I am not at my computer at the moment but I will update this post with the stats I have about transmission shortly. </p>

<p>I agree that it is not a foregone conclusion that coming into contact with an outbreak will cause transmission, but it is still not recommended if someone wants to avoid getting herpes.   My only concern was your use of &quot;very rare&quot;, and your anecdotal evidence is not enough to convince me that it is very rare.  </p>

<p>And yeah, I&#39;m certainly not advocating that people have sex during an outbreak.  That&#39;s a huge risk.</p>

<p>When I use the phrase &quot;very rare&quot;, I mean in the context of the population.  1/4 women have herpes, but even given that number, the chances of contracting herpes, but your own numbers, only 4% of men who encounter it, contract it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Wehrmacht">The Clean Wehrmacht Myth</a>. Everybody who knows a little bit about WW2 will tell you that German atrocities were inflicted not by ordinary soldiers, but by a fanatical elite force called the SS. Modern historians, however, have come to the consensus that this story is actually a synthesis of Nazi propaganda and Cold War realpolitik. It turns out that the sharp divide between the Wehrmacht and the SS was exaggerated by the Western Allies in order to rehabilitate a militarized Germany. Denazification was originally supposed to be a thorough process, but then the Warsaw Pact suddenly endangered the stability of Europe. How could the NATO governments re-arm West Germany after dismantling and shaming the army following the war?</p>

<p>The answer was to cover up Wehrmacht crimes and pin them on the smaller SS. Former army and navy officers were able to hold power in the new order, while volunteers for the Waffen-SS were declared to be war criminals through guilt by association. The Cold War is over now, yet the revisionist historiography is still in the public&#39;s mind. Very few laymen know how easy it is for governments to permanently twist recent history for strategic aims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about favourite, but i do enjoy the theory that everything is fake. i don&#39;t mean in a simulation sense, i mean every TV programme, advert, news bulletin, fashion statement, magazine, mainstream music,internet blogs, youtube channels, forums... anything that tries to attract the attention of the general population is a lie. All of it is made up, created by suits and pushed just to make money.</p>

<p>We talk about crisis actors on here. Yet, watch a &#39;real life documentary&#39; on TV. Things like &quot;ocd cleaners&quot; &quot;dinner date&quot; &quot;pawn stars&quot; &quot;big brother&quot; anything that has &quot;random members of the public&quot; is all just an act. None of these people live the lives they portray on TV, they&#39;re ALL actors.</p>

<p>A few years ago in the UK, many broadcasters were caught doing &quot;phone-in quizzes&quot; where you could win some serious dosh. Turns out that every single one was a hoax and they had members of the film crew phone in to win. now imagine how far that rabbit hole goes where we didn&#39;t catch them?</p>

<p>But the more you see it, the more obvious it becomes. Go watch reality TV, watch the &#39;actors&#39; who are meant to be normal people. It&#39;s all a lie.</p>

<p>fashion is a lie. music is a lie. Tv is a lie.</p>

<p>All fake. Everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand me: Lesions on the unaffected party.</p>

<p>Herpes has only a 2% chance of transmitting without an outbreak to males.  I&#39;d call that &quot;rare&quot;.  I can&#39;t find a number for how often it transmits with an outbreak, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it went from &quot;rare&quot; to &quot;unlikely&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s anecdotal, so take is as such, but I dated a woman for two months.  We had a lot of unprotected sex in that time frame.  She told me she had herpes.  She said that she had an outbreak for the week leading up the confession, and that&#39;s the point at which we broke up.  I got tested, and I&#39;m clean as a whistle.  I was terrified, because I was almost certain that I&#39;d have it at that point.</p>

<p>I did a lot of reading about herpes, and an outbreak is much more likely to cause transmission, but it&#39;s far from a foregone conclusion.</p>
