Getting tired of this shit and I&#39;m considering starting a community and maybe sue them collectively.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>I ran diagnostics for everything I could think off and a whole new conspiracy theory came to light. I had the TaoBao app installed and it was using data when closed and on wifi and it drained my battery and used my processing power constantly. Guys, this might be some Chinese spy software and I&#39;m going to run it on a virtual machine and analyze the fuck out of it just for fun. If any of you wish to do the same, please share your findings!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s two sides to it I guess. They&#39;re not going to drop all that money supporting older versions of their software, and they&#39;re not going to leave the extra power on the new kit doing nothing. So some sort of slowdown is just going to happen.</p>

<p>But then it would be awfully easy to add little bits and bobs here and there that the new kit has no problem with and the old kit can&#39;t quite manage. And they&#39;d make more money if they did. And the odds of getting caught are basically nil, unless you take the piss with it. And when things are easy and make money and are hard to catch, they tend to happen.</p>

<p>Also not for nothing, your post reads like an advert. Even if it is, it probably shouldn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with rechargeable lithium batteries it is recommended that you completely cycle the battery, meaning let it die then charge it to 100% also it’s a good idea not to leave it on charge throughout the night. Batteries are only good for a certain number of cycles but that number can be drastically reduced by not cycling the battery and keeping a current running to it even after its fully charged. At least that’s what they told us to tell customers after receiving a battery replacement on a fairly new iPhone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the opposite of what you should be doing. Fully discharging is for NiMH batteries that haven&#39;t been used in phones for almost 20 years. Lithium ion batteries are happiest when they&#39;re in the middle range of their charge. Don&#39;t let them drain, don&#39;t keep them constantly topped off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an old HP business laptop, which is now 14 years old. I have never changed batteries in it, and I still get 2 hours of battery life when unplugging it. It&#39;s a relatively huge battery though at 80 Wh and 12 cells.</p>

<p>I have several old phones, and they seem to hold a charge well, even after 3 years+. However, the top brand names like HTC, Samsung and Apple that I have all had their batteries degrade rapidly after a year, and die in between 18 to 24 months.</p>

<p>Battery tech is very dependent on the anode &quot;channels&quot;. It always leaves a little bit of &quot;residue&quot; when discharging. This is the nature of the chemical process of charge/discharge. These &quot;channels&quot; are getting thinner and thinner with the need for thinner and thinner batteries because phone manufacturers want thinner and thinner phones. Batteries will &quot;clog up&quot; pretty quick and stop working. If you get a thicker battery then you will not see the same degradation in a year to two years. And if you make battery internals too thin they can go boom too.</p>

<p>Are batteries designed to fail? Maybe. Even if they aren&#39;t, I doubt phone manufacturers are racing to make batteries retain their quality past a year - it&#39;s better to sell a new shiny device for more money.</p>
