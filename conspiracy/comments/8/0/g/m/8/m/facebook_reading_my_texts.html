       So to add to the theory that Alexa/Facebook spy on us and then serve ads or make suggestions. I used to have an associate of mine whom I had a falling out with - I deleted the person out of my phone probably 3 years ago. Last night someone else I know asked me if I still talked to the person and if so if I could pass his contact info over. Today I responded and said no I don’t talk to him anymore and I don’t have his number. I noticed this afternoon that the person I no longer talk to was suggested as a friend on Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was friends with that individual I had an Android phone, now I have an iPhone. Any contact info that would have been stored via an email app or anything like that was an old work email that I no longer use. The timing of this friend suggestion is WAY too coincidental - so Facebook is reading iMessage and SMS now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - to add to this we have never been Facebook friends or connected via social on any platform.

       I would think that if something like this is true a lot of people would care. It’s personal conversations that are supposed to be private and secure not used as additional source to make suggestions or serve ads.

       It is entirely possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I created a fake facebook profile the other day using a temporary email address, fake name, fake D.O.B., no phone number, etc. After I logged in for the first time I was met with a list of people that I may know - all of my closest friends in real life. I deleted my actual facebook account over a year ago, so they must be harvesting my data from somewhere else to make these suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I should add that I created this account using the web interface on a laptop. I use the whatsapp desktop interface, so its entirely possible that this is what "gave me away", so to speak. My roomate also knows the same people I do, so it's also possible that they made the connection via his Facebook use on the same IP address.

       Same thing happened to me. Deleted Facebook a little over a year ago. Created a FB profile with all fake information, address, fake pictures. Fake everything. Yet, lo and behold, as soon as I was finished all my friend suggestions were people from my home town and people I knew from university. 
I’ve tried clearing out as much of my data/online footprint that traces back to me, but I’m fairly certain at this point it’s too late for us all to not have an electronic/web presence.

       Then it’s pulling it from my contact list and the information from that person. I don’t live in the same state as my friends and family. So if it’s a location thing, it’s not getting it from my actual GPS location.

       Facebook keeps tons of data about people hidden that you never see. It even keeps such data about people who have no Facebook account. It probably had that information stored in your data somewhere so even after he was deleted from your contacts, Facebook still remembered a past connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, either facebook listened in on your mic or your other friend trying to find this person re-opened that connection for you. Facebook probably noticed your friend looking for the deleted friend, remembered you had a past connection, then suggested that you might want to connect with them like your friend as well.

       Anecdotal:  Went to lunch with my husband and a friend on Saturday.  My husband asked my friend where she got this particular bag - a utility bag, not a purse.  She told him the website and we talked about it for a couple of minutes and then moved on to another subject.  I wasn't using my phone at the time.  My phone was on the table and I have the Facebook App.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later that evening I'm looking at Facebook on my desktop computer uploading photos from our day and what do I see?  Ads for that website.

       Your friend who was looking for him, added him to their friends list on Facebook, so since you two or connected, Facebook assumed you might be friends with the person your friend just added.

       One time I had just flown into an a new city (Albuquerque) for work. I turned on the TV in the hotel and it was on an ESPN college football game that was being played at Texas A&amp;M. Immediately I was served an ad on a facebook on my mobile about traveling to College Station. I did not connect to the hotel wifi, I was on mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never traveled to College Station. I have never searched for travel to College Station. The only connection I had to College Station was the game on the TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook had to have hijacked my microphone to serve ads. So I don't doubt your experience.

       I have a feeling that that FB uses your location data to recommend people based on your proximity to each other. For example, I go to X place and always see X person. We don't know each other or have any friends in common, but FB suggestions recommends them to me as "people you may know." The only thing we have in common is that we always go same place at the same time routinely. I don't ever check-in ether. Spooky.

       I think they also listen to our conversations. A few months ago, I was talking to my boyfriend about my gymnastics class and I told him that I had to do some exersices on the balance beam and got really nervous because I'm afraid of heights so my hands started to sweat abundantly...Next day I see on my fb's home page an add of a product for sweaty hands and feet, I was like wtf

       Yes, yes, and yes. They DO read them, and once FB has been installed on your phone, it's literally on your phone forever, reading your shit.(No Citation, just over-exaggerating) I matched with someone on Tinder a long time ago, and we only texted back and forth, and she was suddenly on my "Recommended for you" friends list, with no mutual friends, no mutual contact info, nothing. She didn't even have that phone number I texted attached to her account. There was literally absolutely no info on this person that connected me to them, and we never even met in person for Facebook to truly know if I knew this person or not if it used my phone as a GPS to pick up other people around who also owned a facebook account to get me to connect with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       With shit like this happening, there's literally nothing you can do but just accept it. If Facebook or it's applications touch your phone, you're pretty much done for. Sorry.

       This is kinda stupid but an example, one time I sent a text about how cold I was. Within fifteen minutes or so, I logged on and saw an add for a sweatshirt that literally had the words "so freaking cold" on it.

       Similar thing happened to me -- was on a work trip with a group of peers.  by the end of the week i had become connected on linkedin with a few of them and one of them I exchanged numbers with.  When he texted me is number to save in my phone, my phone recognized him by first and last name before I had a chance to even save it.  My phone and Linkedin are in cahoots?

       I just sent an iMessage about walking with my neighbor when she walks her dog. On the next Facebook login, I got a sponsored ad for for: Suggested Ap "Wag! - Instant Dog Walkers". I don't have a dog. But that iMessage was the last thing I did on my phone. This is crazy. I guess I will stop using iMessage.

       Then it’s pulling it from my contact list and the information from that person. I don’t live in the same state as my friends and family. So if it’s a location thing, it’s not getting it from my actual GPS location.
