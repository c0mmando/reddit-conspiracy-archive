       Hey, first post here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was thinking today about the increase of fentanyl overdoses in the last few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be a stretch, but i had this thought that the Canadian government is putting fentanyl in the streets themselves in an effort to rid certain provinces of addicts. Especially BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 years ago i was in a detention school for a few months, and we had 4 or 5 seminars where the police would come in and warn us about what it does to you, and what drugs its commonly cut with. At this time, they said it was something new and not really in Ontario, the province i live in, but mainly in street drugs all across BC. But the public amd catholic schools werent recieving lessons about it until the first person in Ottawa overdosed. Approximately one year after the lessons started, there was one overdose of it in my town in 20 year old girl and they discovered fentanyl on the ground near a local high school. It was almost exactly a year ago that the local lady OD'd and not much since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again i could be overthinking, but i was wondering if anyone else thought the same and if they did, potentially have more information.

       All I know is Fentanyl is dangerous stuff. I was put on a 50 mg patch for pain relief and almost died less than 12 hours after putting it on. All I remember is I was at work doing health coaching over the phone and my co-workers noticed I was slurring my speech and couldn't formulate complete sentences. I remember getting progressively more tired throughout the day. I called my wife to pick me up so I could get to a Dr. and she couldn't understand me. A co-worker had to fill her in on what was happening and then walk me to the car as I couldn't walk myself. The Dr. said if I had left the patch on much longer I would have passed out and died. I fear this happens to many people who don't even realize what is happening to them. The effects creep up on you slowly without warning.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years later my pain Dr. had me try a lower dose patch to help with the pain. I stupidly went along and even though it didn't effect me as it had before, it still made me uneasy. After a few months I decided I didn't want to mess with the patches any longer and went through a horrible one week withdrawal my Dr. failed to prepare me for. Fever, chills, night sweats, constant itching, severe headaches, vomiting. It seemed like the flu but different and worse. I couldn't sleep at all and was misearble. I had never experienced withdrawal before and hope to never again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will never mess with that drug ever again. It is deceptively dangerous.

       It's just an awful drug that shouldn't be pushed onto people who don't know what they are getting into. I'm not even sure Dr.'s are entirely aware of how dangerous these drugs really are. I am now back on the "less dangerous" Oxycodone and would gladly give all of these opiods up for good once medical marijuana is decriminalized as it should be.

       Iowa. We approved cannabis oil for people with certain conditions and fortunately chronic pain is one of them. However, we have no way of getting any as we can't bring any across state lines and we won't have our own dispensory until Dec. 2018 at the earliest.

       Use Kratom to ween yourself off of the oxy then slowly lower your kratom doses and use it  only when your pain is severe. It works, don’t believe the FDA Kratom  is completely safe and helps lots of people off of pharmaceuticals. Which is why it’s being demonized in the media lately corporations can’t make money on a safe effective natural leaf.

       It's not a stretch at all.  The US government purposely poisoned alcohol during prohibition and then released it out on the streets in order to convince the public of how terrible it was.  They are doing the same thing with heroin now by adding fentanyl to it.  I have no doubts that the Canadian government is doing the same thing.  I also highly doubt these are the only things governments have poisoned to get headlines of dead addicts.

       Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.

       A Scottish
       <strong>
        American
       </strong>
       funded by the
       <strong>
        CIA
       </strong>
       (american org.) runs tests on children + MK ULTRA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Location happens to be in Montreal, which yes it's in Canada, but as far as I can tell there's no mention of the Canadian governments involvement whatsoever. In fact it seems the whole thing is run and funded by
       <strong>
        Americans
       </strong>
       . Just happens to be on Canadian soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll keep on "pretending" Canada is better. Thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be happy to read anything else you've got. It's a first world government there's gonna be dirt on them, just make sure it's actually them this time.

       A Canadian court decided that Rusoro, a Russian company, should have mining rights in Venezuela... ignoring every jurisdictional rule known to man... for the benefit of Canadian mining magnate, Frank Giustra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giustra bought up a bunch of uranium mining assets, and then sold it to Russia, where Rosatom now has controlling interest of Uranium One. The real Uranium One was a South African company, but Giustra changed the name of his mining company before selling it.
      </p>
      <p>
       These mining interests are known to the US State Department, based on their human trafficking reports, to be using forced labor including child labor.

       If you’re after a sinister conspiracy involving this particular drug problem, id  lean towards a Chinese targeted import of fentanyl in retaliation for the opium wars. AFAIK, the vast majority is coming into NA from Chinese pharmaceutical factories.

       Canada and specifically BC and Ontario put into place "supervised injection sites" in an effort to keep addicts from using dirty needles, spreading disease etc.
      </p>

       An effort to "remove all addicts" would be counter intuitive to the latest efforts they've made to help these people.

       I was watching a Drugs, Inc. episode about heroin in New York.  During the episode, they showed one dealer cutting heroin with fentanyl.  His rationale was that if a junkie OD'd on his dope, his sales would go up because other junkies would assume it was stronger than his competitions.
