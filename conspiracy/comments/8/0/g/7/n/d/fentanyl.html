        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey, first post here. </p>

<p>I was thinking today about the increase of fentanyl overdoses in the last few years.</p>

<p>It may be a stretch, but i had this thought that the Canadian government is putting fentanyl in the streets themselves in an effort to rid certain provinces of addicts. Especially BC. </p>

<p>4 years ago i was in a detention school for a few months, and we had 4 or 5 seminars where the police would come in and warn us about what it does to you, and what drugs its commonly cut with. At this time, they said it was something new and not really in Ontario, the province i live in, but mainly in street drugs all across BC. But the public amd catholic schools werent recieving lessons about it until the first person in Ottawa overdosed. Approximately one year after the lessons started, there was one overdose of it in my town in 20 year old girl and they discovered fentanyl on the ground near a local high school. It was almost exactly a year ago that the local lady OD&#39;d and not much since.</p>

<p>Again i could be overthinking, but i was wondering if anyone else thought the same and if they did, potentially have more information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is Fentanyl is dangerous stuff. I was put on a 50 mg patch for pain relief and almost died less than 12 hours after putting it on. All I remember is I was at work doing health coaching over the phone and my co-workers noticed I was slurring my speech and couldn&#39;t formulate complete sentences. I remember getting progressively more tired throughout the day. I called my wife to pick me up so I could get to a Dr. and she couldn&#39;t understand me. A co-worker had to fill her in on what was happening and then walk me to the car as I couldn&#39;t walk myself. The Dr. said if I had left the patch on much longer I would have passed out and died. I fear this happens to many people who don&#39;t even realize what is happening to them. The effects creep up on you slowly without warning. </p>

<p>A few years later my pain Dr. had me try a lower dose patch to help with the pain. I stupidly went along and even though it didn&#39;t effect me as it had before, it still made me uneasy. After a few months I decided I didn&#39;t want to mess with the patches any longer and went through a horrible one week withdrawal my Dr. failed to prepare me for. Fever, chills, night sweats, constant itching, severe headaches, vomiting. It seemed like the flu but different and worse. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all and was misearble. I had never experienced withdrawal before and hope to never again. </p>

<p>I will never mess with that drug ever again. It is deceptively dangerous.</p>

It works, don’t believe the FDA Kratom  is completely safe and helps lots of people off of pharmaceuticals.

<p>What do you think of that picture? The British think tanks control your government, they are putting their medical experiments in charge of your government.</p>

<p>Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t pretend like Canada is any better.</p>
