       The clue is Kevin Booth. I’m not a shill. I’m not a government agent. I’m not a shit stirrer (usually). Check out my post and comment history I’m a pretty normal dude (imo). I drive a forklift for a living. I have 2 kids a house and a wife. I’m 34 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw the
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/80ci6y/infowars_receives_youtube_termination_warning/">
        top post about infowars and YouTube
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m on thin ice, so please don’t take this as an attempt to shit stir. I think
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       there’s
       <strong>
        <em>
         any real conspiracy theorists left here
        </em>
       </strong>
       we should have a discussion re: the possible implications of the media’s collusion with Bill Hicks to discredit Conspiracy Theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often the argument is that the 2 have totally different world views. I’ll counter: Bill Hicks was a leftist humanist with primordial toxic-SJW leanings.  He liked to mock “Christians” as well as anyone else he disagreed with.  If looked at through the “he’s doing it to intentionally discredit conspiracy theorists” lens, the AJ/Bill Hicks dichotomy becomes easier to parse.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the motives behind pushing this specific “YouTube” narrative?  What do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       What else can we discuss on this topic?
      </p>
      <p>
       A few sources, can discuss ANY of these in more depth in comments.

       Wait did I misunderstand or did you say Bill Hicks was a SJW? The man who said Hitler had the right idea.. and said your not a human unless you're in his phone book. I feel like Hicks would hate these SJW's who think there are 100 different genders and shit.

       Those are the company lines. Was wondering if anyone would say it. Noted.  Upvoted anyways thanks for the thoughts AblettsInTheAir.
Edit: also, appeals to emotion don’t look good on u abletts.

       Of course anyone before now would hate SJWs. Anybody before Heavens Gate would hate Heavens Gate would hate Heavens Gate, including the people who joined, yet they joined because their unbiased outsider perspective was suspended just as much as the leader needed it to be.

       In my opinion, much of what talking heads say, is influenced by the fact they live a privileged life, and have lost their ability to be intuitive.

       Not sure.  I watched the Joe Rogan Alex jones interview.. He talks about a split in the elite... i see the legal cogs turning in regards to Awan brothers, Clinton Foundation and just seems the house of cards will fall.  If Bill became Alex he most probably works with CIA.. Maybe he is on the good side... or maybe he is effective marginalizing the truth movement..  But i do think MSM has lost the ability to control the narrative..

       As long as we can discuss it I’m open to any possibility. I’d hope there’s some good in Bill’s heart, maybe this was just a drunken bet gone wrong and he’s wanted out for years. Idk?  Bill if you’re reading this I’d truthfully help to support you if you apologized and explained, honestly.

       I think he was heading that way with Waco.  I think it sounds like a cool career change for a comedian.. and Bill would love the Irony of a conspiracy theorist born from a conspiracy..

       So here is an honest answer. Conspiracy theories are a form of mental masturbation. It is difficult to understand this conclusion without doing the heavy lifting and putting in the work to reach this conclusion. So I begin with a simple question what is knowable? It turns out that this question is very relative to the individual asking. How smart are you? Can you do the math to see that a Hydrocarbon fueled fire could not generate the joules to weaken or melt the steel support beams? Are you able to secure verifiable sources? Can you do the statistical analysis to verify your claims? Are your claims testable? Lastly, what is the pay off for doing all this work? Will you be better off? Emotionally? Monetarily? Anyway, I suggest doing your research but merely as hobby. Alex Jones is either intelligence operative or was compromised 20 years ago. His work is sloppy. He has made himself wealthy by selectively quoting mainstream sources and selling end of the world survival kits.

       No can't do the math..  The wings slicing through the structure is most questionable to me.. Alex Jones has been right about many things which doesn't mean he is not compromised.  I think uncovering the truth about Alex/bill might be more difficult than the math of melting points you mention.

       I used to consume a lot of media. I spend some of that time now researching what interests me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there’s nothing to the Hicks argument then there’s potentially more of a thing to research as to why some of these things have been made to appear as they do.

       concerned that Alex Jones is being used in a way to backdoor the curtailing of freedom of speech.  He is a charicature of what normal people think about every single person in spaces like CST. That archetypal image is powerful man. What is a good reason for not wanting to shine some light on this subject?  Should I go discuss this with John David Ebert?  I don’t have his number so I brought it to my online conspiracy theory related message board instead.

       I used to know who were the players in late 80's, 90's and going into say 2005. I will share some of my personal research. In the late 90's I started tracking web foot prints. Nothing fancy. Type in Key words and count hits on google. You could do it with other search engines but google was better. I created graphs and started to doing predictions based on which key words that produced the most hits. You could track a meme as it went viral. You could see which people or memes were losing traction. In 1998 Alex Jones had hits of 8,000. Zionist Jews had similar results. Illuminati had poor showings as well. After 911 these key word memes exploded. The funny thing is you could track and predict ideological trends based on hits. Transhumanism it was not even in the discussion 20 years ago. Do you remember peak oil? Alex Jones is a talking head of the now and future like Rush Limbaugh.  If he is lucky he will get to retire. Jones rose to prominence has been supported by the globalist media. They gave him air time. It takes a bit of double think to get you head around it.

       Thanks for discussing, couple of questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was your best prediction?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you pay attention to any of the “popular” “non-mainstream” “informational” “programming” nowadays?  I’m getting long in the tooth but I mean like Philip DeFranco or the John and Hank Green channels for example?  They remind me of a sleeker version of
       <a href="https://youtu.be/abEZwhQiUyM">
        Channel 1
       </a>
       that we used to watch in middle school homeroom.  Barstool Sports imo is of a similar nature for another example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure about peak oil I’ve heard the term but doesn’t really grab me so haven’t delved.
      </p>

       What do you make of all this?

       I turn off the set many years ago. I stopped the online stuff about ten years ago. I moved to place where it does not matter if you listen or not. Foreign country. I predicted Gold hitting 3,000. I also predicted the housing market. Sold my house and put everything into gold. I will predict a cryto currency Youtube type platform. it will be a big deal in 10 years.

       I am very familiar. Seller's market for residential. Commercial is really not doing that well in certain parts. It has to do with lending rules. Prices are better but will not get close to pre 2008 levels. Northeast is always expensive but it is where the jobs are. Buy small house or condo in the best area you can afford. Anything is better then renting. I am familiar with the south. The south is the best in terms of value.

       I think the flaw in this is the same flaw that people make when claiming that the Rothschilds have paid multiple people sums of 30 billion - 1 trillion dollars. The flaw is that if they did, they're doing it the hard way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say you wanna discredit an idea. How do you do it? You make bad cases against it that don't sound bad until you look into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I claim that you stole my money. You claim you couldn't have done that because you have no reason to, and then change the subject and talk a long time until most people listening forget.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I insist now, I'm the aggressor, and I'm also making a more serious claim, that you're both a thief, and Machiavellian. I also am convinced slightly that it's not worth bothering you over, since I'm now at risk of being branded the bad guy if I don't win the confidence of the crowd. You've also made yourself look like the nicer and calmer guy, brushing off a lie about themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a lot simpler than hiring someone to accuse you of reasonable things 24/7 while acting like a maniac.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies are like machines. They ware out over time, their method becomes outdated and easier for less educated people to understand, and eventually people will figure out exactly how the machine works without much effort. The goal of a conspiracy is to be forgotten as soon as possible and forever. Alex Jones goes contrary to that principle in the extreme if he's a double agent or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also briefly met Alex Jones in real life while I was in Austin at Whole Foods. The dudes real, and he's nuts.

       No, the argument is that they are obviously totally different people.  Different face, different mouth, different voice.  One was intelligent and funny; the other just shouts like an idiot and pushes shitty products to the pitiful mugs that hang on his every word.
