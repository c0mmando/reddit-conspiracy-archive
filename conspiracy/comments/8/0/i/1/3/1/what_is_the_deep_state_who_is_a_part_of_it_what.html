       What your graph shows is that the term starts to be used more, which is true.  It is used more because of something that was obvious, and that was appeals to unelected intelligence agency bureaucrats to undermine a democratic process and an elected representative.  For example, the neocon hero of the Resistance, Billy Kristol.

        Obviously strongly prefer normal democratic and constitutional politics. But if it comes to it, prefer the deep state to the Trump state.

       the deep state has been popularized and made retarded by trumpers, but the deep state is very real imo for example the military industrial complex wields a lot of influence behind the scenes.

       You can watch this interview with Peter Dale Scott at UC Berkeley from over a decade ago, where he explains to you what the term deep state means, and why it is used. In the US this term was used by the left.

       In what way does increased discussion correlate to the inception of an idea? It was spoken about for years prior. That it was only discussed by a small percentage of the population in no way negates the validity of their discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term deep state was ushered into the public lexicon at the point at which your chart jumps, but that in no way is provably reflective on whether or not the deep state existed before that time. Both your argument that the backed by the chart displaying the increase in the discussion of the term "deep state," and my argument that the deep state existed prior to 2016 can be true, without making the other false.

       You describe the Jesuit Order here to a tee. In fact,

        Catholic scholars now admit Jesuit Bellarmine's strategy of infiltrating states was implemented under the papacy of Pius XI in the 1930's after the Lateran Treaty gave the pope back his temporal power.

       Yes yes, but this is not thorough enough coverage of the subject. We need to hear about Rothschild and Israel because that covers WWI, WWII, desert storm, iraq, libya, and the constant gunning for Iran. Paint the Rothschilds as Jesuit all you want, but dismissing them as court Jews is a disservice to modern history, which is all us uneducated folks know.

       Israel is nothing more than the Rome's revived Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, with the current borders of Israel matching nearly identically that medieval crusading state. The pope has always contended for that land since the crusades. When the Jesuits first formed, Loyola tried to set up headquarters in Jerusalem. The claimant to the title of King of Jerusalem is the Jesuit-trained King of Spain.
      </p>

       The Mossad was started by Knight of Malta, Gehlen. Mossad works for Catholic CIA, as admitted by Halevy, former Mossad chief.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA also controls the Palestinian Authority, as attested by the former head of Palestinian Intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       All pursuant to the pope's two-state plan and the
       <em>
        Fundamental Agreement between Holy See and Israel
       </em>
       , which is, the internationalization of Jerusalem under Vatican jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is not controlled by the Rothschilds, who as you already acknowledged, were court Jews for the pope.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consensus of the members of the international community, which are nothing more than vassals of the pope, is a two-state plan; that man of sin having met personally with both Abbas and Netanyahu, the former of which he called an "angel of peace:" that CIA-controlled Palestinian stooge. Yep, Abbas is a good little pope-serving arab just like that King of Jordan, trained by Jesuits in America. And just like the Saudis, including Turki Al Faisal, former head of the Saudi Intelligence Agency who resigned 10 days before 9/11. This man was trained by Jesuits, and it is confirmed that Saudi intelligence was involved with 9/11. Same story with the CIA director, Tenet, trained at Georgetown, working jointly with the Sauds for the take-down of the twin towers in order to launch a crusade in the middle east. Indeed, the middle eastern war was called by George Bush, a "crusade." Bush, whose uncle was a Knight of Malta, and himself is skull and bones, whose members kiss the slipper toe of the pope in their initiation ceremony - employed arch-Jesuit Knight of Malta L Paul Bremmer to do away with the Iraqi guard, giving him authority to rule by decree, which caused the Iraqi insurgency. The Blackwater mercenary group which operated in Iraq is totally controlled by the Knights of Malta, Erik Prince and Joseph Schmitz, both of whom are advisors to Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jesuit priest Paulo Dall Oglio who incited armed rebellion against the Syrian government, was expelled from Syria just before the conflict erupted there. This Jesuit was a chief agitator of the Syrian civil war, which led the the refugee situation, also controlled by the Jesuits with their Jesuit refugee Service, currently flooding Europe with hostile foreigners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Netanyahu in 2014 wanted to give the pope Mt. Zion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shimon Peres who was the President of Israel, was trained by the Jesuits in Poland as a young man, and sold out the Israelis with his friend Yossi Belen by undermining Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem. Perez was literally a Vatican agent.

       Thanks for letting me know you are just looking for an excuse to justify your inordinate obsession with this family. The Rothschilds are not the ones at the helm of the international intelligence community, or global finance, or politics, or government, or the military; they are not responsible for the destruction of the white race, or the male gender, they don't control Israel; they are another rich family and happen to have a notable past, certainly involving criminality, and the same can be said about other families: there was a whole slew of them that came out of Venice, and some people get hung up on those families, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Focusing on them to such an extend that you are demanding is a pointless and a distraction and leads people to believe these retarded rumors that they have 500 trillion dollars and control all the central banks. It is a cancerous subject to introduce to people who lack discernment and analytical skills.

       Depends what you mean by power, and depends on the context. But again, the Rothschilds are not in control of international banking, so there is no point in raising this question.

       I acknowledged their criminal past and presented arguments as to why that they have no comparable influence to the Jesuit papacy. The banking industry is usurious and predatory, and being the Rothschild are bankers, I indeed have disdain for them, but we know who is in power, including in intentional banking, and it's not them.

       This isn't meeting your audience halfway and supplementing their miseducation, this is telling them they are flat out wrong. You are probably covering for Rome by being so insistent on these power dynamics, did you ever consider that? We just run around screaming Rothschild because the only info we get about Rome is from you and it's ignored for reasons I have expressed.

       Your premise is that even though I correctly identify the problem, I should compromise with others who incorrectly assert the problem is something else. This is an argument to moderation fallacy.

       You seem to be set on presenting Jesuits vs. Zionists as the ultimate controllers of the world as a binary choice, where the other non-controllers are completely subservient to the controllers. If you could get past presenting this binary choice, we would all get somewhere. Even just ditching the subservient part would get you a lot more ears. It's not your facts, it's your insistence of subservience and either or.

       Well the Illuminati was created in 1776 and only lasted officially until 1784. The deep state is a modern rendition of the same people. Both are just two different terms for the same guiding hand.

       Even if every cult had only 10 members that would still be a million active cultists in the US forty years ago.

       Did you watch the Captain America movies? I view it like Hydra. Hydra is this compartmentalized evil from comic books. In the real world, I think the deep state is compartmentalized and pretty organic. You could wipe out all of the deep state and another growth of the deep state would spring up to replace it. Just like there are Serpicos that spring up from time to time.  They're us and our pathos.  To do good to one another flows from this pocket of humanity, to control one another flows from this pocket.

       "A November 29, 1963 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit memo unearthed in 1977-78 proves that former President George H. W. Bush was a member of the (now called George Bush Center for Intelligence) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the recipient of a full briefing on the day after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 when Bush was 39 years old, despite his protestations to the contrary. Hoover’s FBI memo said “The substance of the foregoing information was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency…on November 23, 1963 by Mr. W. T. Forsyth of this Bureau,” revealing that former President George H. W. Bush was a key government player surrounding the events of the JFK assassination despite his repeated denials of association with the CIA.” On the day of the assassination Bush was in Texas, but he denies knowing exactly where he was, just as Nixon was leaving Dallas for a destination he reports he cannot remember either."
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton is a southern good ole boy that basically came out of nowhere &amp; put up onto the national stage who with Bush has ties to drug smuggling/money laundering in Mena Arkansas.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Oil tycoons of Texas including Johnson, the Bush’s, war profiteers like Cheney, military brass and chemicalized food director of an early Monsanto, Rumsfeld, the CIA network run by Bush and literally named the “George Bush Central Intelligence Agency”, the CFR Rockefeller commission, the Nixon administration puppets financed by Wall Street trash and Prescott Bush (Grandpa Bush who also on record financed Hitler into power and criminally during WWII),  and the military industrial congressional complex. America was new to a military complex of departments, agencies, and war manufactures who sprung up post WWII. It became a machine which in-grossed the nation within a few short years. War was profit for the bankers who wielded each dollar with debt, and trillions were spent on war financing."

       Look into the membership list of the CFR, the Bilderburgs, the IMF, the World Bank, the Pilgrim Society, the Club of Rome, Trilateral Commission. Look at the NGO's that are affiliated with these groups. Look at the European bloodlines: the Germanic, Austrian, Spanish, Roman, English, etc. Look at the sovereign military order of Malta. Look into the Zionists. Look into the Black Nobility (the papal nobility), Vatican and the Jesuits. Look into the secret societies and the organized crime networks. Look at the large multinational corporations that receive government contracts (Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Bayer, Monsanto, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect the "deep state" isn't as centralized as some people may believe (unless there really is a group of satanists composed of people from the aforementioned groups that are organizing a takeover), in reality it seems likely that these various powered interests stemming from the days of feudal society still have their networks of influence which they use to subvert nations. This is done through crown agents working in high positions of power within governmental bodies and large corporations. For example, almost every leader of the CIA was educated at Georgetown university, a Jesuit institution. This means its likely that the CIA is heavily controlled by the Vatican and papal nobility at the highest levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is just one example, I'm sure there are many others within government and corporations that are in some way connected to the European bloodlines. Are they all working together towards a "NWO" type situation? Its not clear - I would imagine that powerful people will tend to want to weaken their enemies, but not to the point to where it would also hurt themselves. But what is clear is that large nations like the US would be prime targets for infiltration due to their capacity for geopolitical influence. Thus we have seen the US as being almost completely compromised at the highest level - they have the largest military reach throughout the world from which to enact these people's will. This is why you see governments that were resisting the use of fiat central banking currencies being invaded and deposed of by the US military.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "boots on the ground" are the organized crime networks which are authorized by these bloodline and powerful interests through their infiltration of the police and intelligence agencies. Corrupt CIA and FBI agents will work with organized crime organizations by providing intel and operational support. The mafia networks are used for securing the major operational centers of the arms, drugs, and human trafficking networks; ie the ports of major commercial cities. Dues are paid to the bloodline rulers and is secured in private Swiss banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the governmental level they use their lobbyists and governmental agents to implement policies that displace the government's sovereignty to extranational institutions such as the Federal Reserve. Think tanks and NGOs are used to assist in the lawmaking and mobilizing public support. Meanwhile charitable organizations are used as a front for these activities so that these people are seen as doing good; in other words they are the public relations for their operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the corporate level you have infiltration of the medical, technical, and communication sectors. Pharmaceutical companies use their considerable funds to control legislation in congress while also influencing research journals. This is to create psychiatric disorders that will label dissidents and take away their rights legally while also pumping tons of ability degrading drugs into society through their networks of trained doctors (see the current opioid epidemic as an example). Silicon valley is infiltrated through groups such as Scientologists and the CIA and are used to implement social programs through various technologies. Corporations contracted by the military develop electromagnetic weaponry that influence human consciousness. These are used for controlling the populace by altering moods and implanting ideas while harassing dissidents. The media was infiltrated by the CIA under Operation Mockingbird and has been consolidated into 6 major corporations. This is done to control the narrative on opposition research exposing these activities while promoting their geopolitical interests such as the "war on terror".
      </p>
      <p>
       In general it seems that powerful interests from London and Rome have the most influence on the US political system, but I'm not convinced that they are completely in control of all of the subversive acts that have been accomplished. Many like to point the finger at Mossad and the Zionists, who I'm sure play a role as well. But in general I think there are a number of influences that people could consider part of the "deep state". I think I hit all the major conspiracy buzzwords in this post; I'll include fake moon landings and 9/11 nuclear demolition for posterity.

       I'm beginning to think that the Deep State are pawns of occult practitioners who use them to control society in a way that makes it easier for them to manifest their goals. The Deep State pawns are compartmentalised individuals who enjoy their positions of power in the grand illusion and seek to maintain them at all costs.

       For America, it is The Continuity of Government, an emergency system that supersedes the branches of the government and the Constitution.  They are an organized establishment, and their arm extends into the state department.
      </p>
      <p>
       The details are beyond the President's knowledge, it's a foreign entity that stretches up to global entities through the Council of Foreign Relations. The best the country can do is get out of a state of emergency and rearchitect the COG plan. It's current or previous agents like Oliver North, Wesley Clark, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, John McCain, and Henry Kissinger, would be a good place to start with names.

       I asked essentially the same question in another thread.  Be prepared for some pretty stupid and hollow answers.

       As far as I'm concerned people started using the term after Russ Baker featured articles by Peter Dale Scott on whoehatwhy a year or two ago when Mike Lofgren's book "Deep State" came out.  It refers to those extra-government operations that are outside of the public's awareness, and the inter-connected history of those operations - like how the same secret communication channels that were opened briefly during 911 were also used by Oliver North to deal arms.  Blurring the definition of the term is one strategy for defusing it.   WhoWhatWhy still devotes a section of their articles to this topic and browsing through their newsfeed should paint a clearer picture...

        You are so repulsed by Rothschilds having any power whatsoever that all of your work and research is discredited by this closed mindedness and lack of objectivity.

       I acknowledged their criminal past and presented arguments as to why that they have no comparable influence to the Jesuit papacy. The banking industry is usurious and predatory, and being the Rothschild are bankers, I indeed have disdain for them, but we know who is in power, including in intentional banking, and it's not them.

       Sure, all you did earlier was present genetic fallacies.
