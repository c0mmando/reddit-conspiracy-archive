    <div class="md"><p>If they came for me and me alone then no absolutely not, but you can be damn sure two or three of them are coming with me. </p>

<p>If they came for many people at once it would start a revolution. I’ve had this argument so many times it’s getting old. They don’t have the resources to face down a rag tag group of Iraqi insurgents successfully. I know, I was there. Modern warfare is incredibly complex. It is almost exclusively urban combat and there are a thousand cameras watching. You can’t just shoot a bunch of kids and get away with it, easily. It takes careful planning. </p>

<p>If they did this in the US it would be the death of them. Believe me THEY WANT TO DO IT. They simply can’t while the entire fucking population is armed. It’s fucking suicide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re imagining a tyrant going apeshit and starting a civil war with modern technology, then I think any rational person would agree that that&#39;s not a possibility anyone who cares about their individual freedom should take lightly. Good governments turning into indescribable nightmares are the norm in every place on earth for centuries, not the outlier. </p>

<p>But what most people like myself are talking about are simply the government passing bad, lazy, regressive laws to appease a mindless threatening majority, and thus making the future look bleaker and more restrictive than a country deserves. Which is what&#39;s happening right now, and would be worse if it weren&#39;t for good people fighting for good causes.</p>

<p>Anyone with liters of blood to lose or a brain stem hates bullets, and hires men with guns to protect them from other men with guns.</p>

<p>You think Russia or China would just sit back and let that happen? You think they would just sit there and jack off while the US cannibalized itself? </p>

<p>No! That’s fucking retarded, </p>

<p>They would either invade or demand we stop along with rest of the world. This isn’t rocket science. </p>

<p>Ignoring for a moment that you pulled those numbers out of your ass, why in the world would the government rely on ground troops? It makes no sense for it to fail to use any number of technologies that vastly out power what citizens are allowed to own. </p>

<p>It’s unreal.</p>

<p>You honestly think the government would just carpet bomb it’s own cities? Yeah, maybe. But if it did you think the rest of the world would just sit back? </p>

<p>Furthermore, if the government <em>would</em> do this and betray us, WOULDN’T IT ADD CREDIBILITY TO THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP OUR FUCKING GUNS SINCE THEYRE GOING TO BOMB US TO OBLIVION WHERE THERE WILL BE NO INFRASTRUCTURE LEFT AND BANDITS WILL BE OUT AND THE GOVERNMENT IS PSYCHO NOW AND THERES NO CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE PUSSIES AND JUST ACCEPT ANYTHING THAT COMES THERE WAY?</p>

<p>That’s why we keep the guns you twat. </p>

<p>Considering no one mentioned carpet combing I’m going to go ahead and ignore that asinine point. </p>

<p>The government controls the media and McCarthyism is very effective. They don’t need to start a revolution to fight back. A few well timed attacks and the right coverage will take care of problems quite nicely. Many won’t even realize there is a revolution to join.</p>

<p>Some would even claim we’re already under attack from our own government and I’ve yet to see the grand citizen militia rise up. </p>

<p>As you said, it’s an information war right now. People won’t go in the streets until the war goes hot.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I think they wouldn&#39;t be able to. The people they&#39;d send would be police, the majority of whom wouldn&#39;t use excessive force on a wide scale like that and of whom own guns as well and would be required to give up theirs, and who would be against any law to confiscate guns.</p>

<p>In the real world, not the fantasy world of liberals, not the dreamy fantasy world where they kick in the door and gun down all law abiding gun owner, the government would fail miserably, like in Australia. They&#39;d do a gun buyback which would fail, and at most would send ATF members to peacefully confiscate guns from people who commit crimes and have a gun registered in their name. In other words, exactly the same amount of confiscation as there is now.</p>

<p>If you think the government going around confiscating things works to keep it out of people&#39;s hands, you&#39;re fucking stupid.</p>
