       It was all over the news and Reddit, and not one single update since.  You'd think at least maybe an update on what the powder was confirmed to be, where it came from, what it did to Vanessa, how she is recovering?

       I haven't heard anything about it other than she was taken to the hospital 2 weeks ago.
      </p>

       I'm sure if the white powder was somethings, we would have heard about it. So I'm guessing it was nothing. Just meant to scare her.

       The article doesn't really give any details though, and this could just be my ignorance but why would the fire department be the ones testing this white powder to determine what it is?  (As the article says, NBC claimed)  Oh, and how did they know what the powder was less then 24 hours after it was reported?

       Well it doesn't really matter what the powder is if nothing happened does it? If it was just flour or something who cares, the important part is that no one was injured or killed. I'd think Don Jr would cause a shit storm if someone drugged and killed his wife. That'd be headline news for weeks

       Does it matter what the powder was? I think it does, regardless of who did or didn't get injured or killed, just as it's important to know who the person was who sent it.  You'd assume the President would have the power to find the person who sent it, since it was his daughter in law.  Call me crazy I guess.

       What makes you think they aren't going after the person who did this? The substance didn't cause any harm to anyone so that's why I don't think it's that important, I can't see how it could change anything about the story

       I don't think it would take this long to find out who sent it, mostly because the president is her father in law. He has some good connections.

       Depends on the city.  Some cities have their departments rolled in to work with the coroner's office.  I know large cities, like NYC, to make the logistics easier.

       Coroner's office doesn't just handle dead bodies or investigations.  The coroner's office is the highest law enforcement officials in the city, or county.  In any case, they also handle all medical investigations and incidents as well as death investigations.

       Could they be any more vague, not even listing the supposed sources?  Also, what the hell does "believed to be cornstarch" mean?  It either is or isn't corn starch.

       Right? If we didn't live in Bizzaroland, we would have gotten an "all clear, it was cornstarch and this is who sent it" bulletin with a photo of the perp in custody. It is so strange.

       Wouldn’t an all clear come from the secret service or some agency? Not just some rando anon source? Maybe it wasn’t given the all clear and the cornstarch is just a false narrative. I believe Julian Assange received some the same week, iirc.

       I agree that it is strange there was no follow up.  IIRC anthrax can be traced to where it was created based on contaminants and relative purity; they may be hunting down the origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it wasnt anthrax, they are probably still running down leads. Federal investigations tend to be a little tedious, unless its over deleted emails and mishandling classified information. Those types are open and shut.

       That was reportedly corn starch, but today seems to be something more sinister. Agree or disagree wirh someones politics but fucking worh peoples family is off limits. I hope the same level of effort is used to find the asshole that scared her is exerted as when they pursued the anthrax threats years ago. Fear is a tool of oppression, and no one should fear the postman

       Someone did post an article about it being corn starch but unfortunately they didn't list the sources who claimed this, and were completely vague about whether or not it was confirmed that the powder was indeed corn starch.

       It's something that's happened to about every president, or his family at least once.  I do agree that regardless of what your politics are, a man's family should be off limits.

       Also, nytimes was the first to report that it was found to be corn starch.  The article only says, "investigators" but in this case, it's more likely hospital officials testing it.

       Coroner's office doesn't just handle dead bodies or investigations.  The coroner's office is the highest law enforcement officials in the city, or county.  In any case, they also handle all medical investigations and incidents as well as death investigations.
