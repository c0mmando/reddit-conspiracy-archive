<p>Trump Jr., 40, took to social media to update followers on the status of his wife later that same day: “Thankful that Vanessa &amp; my children are safe and unharmed after the incredibly scary situation that occurred this morning,” he tweeted. “Truly disgusting that certain individuals choose to express their opposing views with such disturbing behavior.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The article doesn&#39;t really give any details though, and this could just be my ignorance but why would the fire department be the ones testing this white powder to determine what it is?

    <div class="md"><p>Well it doesn&#39;t really matter what the powder is if nothing happened does it? If it was just flour or something who cares, the important part is that no one was injured or killed. I&#39;d think Don Jr would cause a shit storm if someone drugged and killed his wife.

    <div class="md"><p>Does it matter what the powder was? I think it does, regardless of who did or didn&#39;t get injured or killed, just as it&#39;s important to know who the person was who sent it.

<p>Depends on the city.  Some cities have their departments rolled in to work with the coroner&#39;s office.  I know large cities, like NYC, to make the logistics easier.</p>

<p>I agree that it is strange there was no follow up.  IIRC anthrax can be traced to where it was created based on contaminants and relative purity; they may be hunting down the origin.</p>

<p>If it wasnt anthrax, they are probably still running down leads. Federal investigations tend to be a little tedious, unless its over deleted emails and mishandling classified information. Those types are open and shut.</p>
