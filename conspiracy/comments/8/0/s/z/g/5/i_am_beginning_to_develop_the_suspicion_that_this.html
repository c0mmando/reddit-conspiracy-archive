    <div class="md"><p>Relevant:</p>

<p>Sunstein&#39;s proposal to the Obama Administration in 2008:</p>

<p>Sunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with Adrian Vermeule, titled &quot;Conspiracy Theories,&quot; dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from &quot;cascades&quot; of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, &quot;The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government&#39;s antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.&quot; They go on to propose that, <strong>&quot;the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups&quot;,[35] where they suggest, among other tactics, &quot;Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.&quot;</strong>[35] They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the September 11 attacks as &quot;extremist groups.&quot;</p>

<p>The authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: <strong>&quot;We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.&quot;</strong> However, the authors advocate that each &quot;instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. <strong>However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>He added it to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/80luaq/most_of_us_already_know_that_the_us_has_been/">a submission I posted yesterday which sourced multiple articles (going back as far as 2009) that prove the US government is manipulating our online conversations.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been at least two proven false flags against <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to exaggerate how many anti-Semites are here. For every proven one, there must be many others who were not caught. Then there are the regular trolls who have no connection to the anti-conspiracy subs. They post here for fun.</p>

<p>Joshua Ryne Goldberg is an interesting character. He was a Jewish American who wrote neo-nazi articles, posted anti-semitic stuff to Reddit, and a whole bunch of other things. He wrote an article for the Daily Stormer, a neo nazi website, that claimed &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment.&quot; His alias was Michael Slay. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On online forums Reddit and 4chan, under the name European88, he uploaded thousands of anti-semitic and racist posts as a neo-Nazi, and on the specialty neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, he his alter-ego Michael Slay did the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the article he wrote for Daily Stormer, which was used by so many people as &quot;proof&quot; this sub is targeted by white supremacists and nazis for recruitment:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/5EBcB">https://archive.is/5EBcB</a></p>

<p>There is another example I am aware of. See <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">/u/interrogatorybunny</a>. He posted a bunch of obviously racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But his second post had proof he was actually a former <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mod &quot;Bipolarbear0.&quot; This is one of his submissions: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/</a></p>

<p>If you see the image he posted, it says right on there &quot;bipolarbear0.&quot; Under his moderator account, he was very anti-conspiracy, but then he posts racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>Also see this post by <a href="/u/Amos_Quito">/u/Amos_Quito</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3klzcr/racist_stormfront_article_declaring_rconspiracy/">&quot;Racist&quot; Stormfront article declaring /r/Conspiracy as a &quot;Fertile Ground for Recruitment&quot; for white supremacists was actually written by Joshua Ryne Goldberg - the Florida Jew recently arrested by the FBI under terrorism-related charges</a></p>

<p>Goldberg had a lot of different Reddit accounts: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/3knaoj/more_of_joshua_goldbergs_bullshit_on_reddit_he/">https://np.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/3knaoj/more_of_joshua_goldbergs_bullshit_on_reddit_he/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Have you seen Bill Still’s documentary “The Money Masters”? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and as good as it is, I&#39;d say it&#39;s vastly underrated because he has deeply studied both the problem and the solutions. Many people are rightly critical of the Federal Reserve as a private fiat institution that helps only the oligarchical bankers. But they put almost no study into what alternatives there are, and almost all believe the gold standard is a perfect fix.</p>

<p>The gold standard is better than private banker fiat. But if the bankers corner the gold before they crash the fiat (as they have done many times in history), you end up with exactly the same problem. With gold only, you are always worried about the market being cornered, you can&#39;t grow the money supply as the economy grows (the Populist movement in the late 19th century sprung from this problem), and you have to have capital equal to the currency supply taken out of production to act as a medium of exchange.</p>

<p>In contrast, a Hamiltonian public credit system has already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings">proven</a> to be the most effective way to create broad-based economic growth. Instead of allowing the Fed or private banks to create money through fractional reserve lending, the people have control over their own money and credit can be steered toward productive activities and away from derivatives-trading, or other forms of zero-sum gambling that adds nothing but systemic risk to the economy.</p>

<p>H is the Hubble Constant, which is the speed at which the universe is expanding</p>

<p>C is the Cosmological Constant, often called the Speed of Light</p>

<p>So, <em>How Fast</em> is the Universe expanding?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know, because we live in the Observable Universe, whereas most of the supposedly expanding Universe is not in the Observable Universe</p>

<p>so therefore we have to extrapolate what we think H might be</p>

<p>and of course you can look forever and never get a straight answer on how fast H actually is</p>

<p>all they tell us is that the Universe is expanding, and that red-shift proves it </p>

<p>(red-shift doesn&#39;t prove anything, btw, because i don&#39;t believe that they have any reference point for what that stars light ought to be while its still... maybe its just a red star)</p>

<p>and I&#39;ve never met anyone who has claimed to have been able to see or measure this so-called &quot;red-shift&quot; </p>

<p>anyway, they won&#39;t come right out and say it, but they want us to believe that the universe is expanding at the speed of light</p>

<p>in spite of the fact that apart of the so-called &quot;red-shift&quot; that doesn&#39;t prove anything, there is no evidence of an expanding universe, and definitely no evidence its expanding at the speed of light </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stars have emission lines that are at known <a href="http://www.astronomyknowhow.com/spectral-lines.htm">absoption bands</a>, we can measure these on earth by exciting hydrogen and other elements/compounds you find in starts.
You can measure the spectra of stars, have a look at the lines/bands and compare it to what you expect.
This gives you redshift.
You do this for a bunch of stars and you get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Hubble&#39;s constant</a> which we can measure.
Nobody is stopping you going out, building a telescope yourself, taking the measurements and measuring it for yourself. </p>

<p>You seem to be using the <a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/lambda.htm">cosmological constant</a> and c, speed of light (nomenclature used in physics) interchangeably.
Your use of &quot;so-called&quot; says to me you either hold scientists in contempt or just don&#39;t understand the concept at all.
I&#39;d highly recommend an <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/astrophysics-cosmology-anux-anu-astro4x-0">edX cosmology course</a>
so you can learn more.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t understand a concept in cosmology, you should try to understand it better instead of turning to someone who gets rejected by TED, maybe there is a good reason why they are outside the mainstream of science.
If he could prove his theories about the universe to be correct, then people would be more than happy to accept changes.
Not inviting people isn&#39;t a sign that they&#39;re being censored, you probably wouldn&#39;t invite someone who kept on shouting that the sky is green over and over when it&#39;s patently false to everyone there.To people who have spent 20-30 years learning and using this knowledge on the daily, it&#39;s like inviting a child to an adults party, you just don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus">consensus in science</a> is a hard thing to form, have you ever met a group of astrophysicists arguing about experimental data/methods/results/conclusions of specific research? They don&#39;t hide their animosity at times, if they could prove everyone wrong with a well-designed set of experiments/observations, they&#39;d get rivals replicating to try to steal the prize! This article explains the concept much better than I <a href="https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/what-does-scientific-consensus-mean-618f93c4513b">can in a comment</a>. </p>

<p>Hope that helped.</p>

<p>the &quot;consensus of science&quot; is one of the reasons i had to distance myself from science, as i could not associate myself with this cult any longer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s possible. But there is a lot of evidence discrediting it, including footage of the planes, eyewitnesses who saw the impact, and <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/aircraft.html">physical remains</a>. It makes absolutely no sense: why go to the trouble of inventing the whole planes story when you can just set off a bomb? The building had already been bombed before.</p>

<p>Further, the &quot;no planes&quot; theorists have a reputation for being divisive, which is exactly what shills do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I advocate the hybrid theory-- &quot;the ball&quot; theory and the &quot;no planes.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The ball&quot; theory is based on footage of a strange drone-like ball where the second plane was supposed to be. There is no footage of the first plane. </p>

<p>In the early days of 9/11 truth, observers noted that the plane captured on footage had an oddly enlarged body, midsection. People thought it might be a missile. What I now believe is that the footage of the plane was doctored to conceal the ball-drone-bomb. This accounts for the odd shape of the second plane.</p>

<p>Flat Earth is a result of people thinking their senses are good enough and that YouTube is a great research method.  It is the end result of allowing things to be said with little or no supporting evidence combined with an atmosphere that punishes those who actually ask questions about the topic at had.  A lot of conspiracy subgroups really don&#39;t take well to people asking questions which leads to this sort of thing.  You can see it in gerrymandered political districts too where the candidates keep getting more and more extreme since they have to appeal to a small subgroup to get the nomination. </p>

<p>Humans have a history of lying and trying to manipulate others, why should I trust anyone?

    <div class="md"><p>Real people who are members of this community, maybe, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true of the general population. &quot;Conspiracy theorists&quot; are thought of as wild kooks who think Bigfoot is an interdimensional alien from the future or some shit. In reality, we&#39;re interested in and investigate ideas like the military industrial complex, political corruption, the pharmaceutical industry, human trafficking, government cover-ups. You know, secret plans by groups of people to do harmful things. </p>

<p>But plenty of people actually think that bigfoot is an appropriate topic for conspiracy theorists, some of them probably even self-identify as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. Even so, when was the last time this community gave even half a shit about some cryptid bullshit? Or wild claims about aliens? Washington Post published a video of a supposed UFO a few months back and the community&#39;s take on it was that it was fake. I even saw memes outside of this community making jokes about how the &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; were now the ones saying aliens were fake. </p>

<p>Our image in mainstream culture is tied to ideas like the Weekly World News&#39;s batboy character, when the reality is that when people think of us, they should really think of &quot;characters&quot; like Julian Assange or the Rothschilds. </p>

<p>I think a good example of this disconnect is The X-files. The show is about aliens and ghosts and monsters and wacky shit. That&#39;s the image projected on to conspiracy theorists, and although I think that image has been deliberately projected by the media, some people might even embrace that idea. These fantastic adventures of the X-files. Even so, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJjVS61HNU0">a somewhat recent clip from the reboot of the show exemplifies the disconnect by explaining some real shit</a>. There are two sides to &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, and it seems to me that people who aren&#39;t deep into this stuff are more likely to think of wacky alien abductions implanting human-alien hybrids than all the stuff in that clip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Right Wing found it pretty easy early on to take it upon themselves to adopt every conspiracy and conflate actual conspiracies with bullshit conspiracies, resulting in being able to tell the truth while making themselves out to be batshit insane while saying it. So the pedophilia conspiracies have all been taken over, the political conspiracies have all been adopted to mask the legitimate tyrannies, and then they simply target conspirators who have actual knowledge by spamming their key words with oversaturated phrases.</p>

<p>This is the era of shitting information on the masses, like the existence of Aliens on Mass media, and then calling everyone crazy assholes for listening.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, and yes. Obama for falsifying his birth certificate to cover up his time in the CIA and for war crimes, Hillary for other war crimes and dozens upon dozens of murders. </p>

<p>Russiagate is utter nonsense originating with <a href="http://larouchepub.com/other/2018/4507_brits_in_rusgate.html">British intelligence</a> and every sub-theory has been credibly debunked countless times.

<p>In 2002 Arnaud de Borchgrave, Editor-in-Chief for The Washington Times, called Executive Intelligence Review &quot;an anti-Semitic potpourri of disinformation, factoids, rumor, gossip, loony tunes and an occasional fact.&quot;[15] EIR Counterintelligence Director Jeffrey Steinberg refers to that paper as the &quot;Moonie Washington Times&quot;.[16][17] The Times was founded by Sun Myung Moon. The New York Review of Books said that Executive Intelligence Review &quot;echoes Kremlin propaganda&quot;.[18]  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s called reality. In <em>reality</em>, &quot;kooks&quot; are everywhere. So obviously there would be some who identify as conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>You could equally say that a lot of football fans are &quot;f*kin kooks&quot;. </p>

<p>Or that a lot of people who like to ride motorcycles are &quot;f*kin kooks&quot;.</p>

<p>The difference is that government agencies have no incentive to artificially inflate the numbers of the perceived &quot;kooks&quot; in those other groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I remember correctly I though the towers were graded to sustain an impact from a smaller version of airplane and not for the size that hit it.  707 vs 767.  Since the 707 was the largest plane available at the time.</p>

<p>Also their refute of it calculates only at cruise speed (which nothing suggests they were maintaining cruise speed).  They also didn&#39;t factor in the fuel capacity of the larger jet, or that fuels have advanced since 1964.  All points would be critical to a recalculation on structural damage, which they opted not to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a compilation of Alex Jones ranting I just found: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4zxYpLY9QM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4zxYpLY9QM</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s a limited hangout. He&#39;s got deep ties to the CIA and even admits it. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s a liar though, he does put out plenty of good information. But he&#39;s also a gatekeeper, selectively withholding information through lies of omission, just like the rest of the corporate media. And he intentionally presents himself as a crazy person while doing all this. When custody of his children was challenged in court, his behavior in his videos was defended as being &quot;performance art&quot;. </p>

<p>People fall for it because human beings are stupid. No need for that high horse though, we&#39;ve all been victims to deceptions like this at some point in our lives. And it&#39;s not like Jones tells lies or something. He really does have a history of shining light on real issues that others don&#39;t cover. It shouldn&#39;t be hard to see why people would be taken in with that in mind. There are tons of examples of this. Even the social media personalities I like and respect like Jimmy Dore do similar things with regards to withholding information for political reasons. Look at Dore&#39;s conversation with Joe Rogan on his podcast to see what Jimmy really thinks of Seth Rich&#39;s mysterious murder, then wonder &quot;why doesn&#39;t Jimmy have a bunch of videos about Seth Rich on his channel?&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its like an onion, its got layers</p>

<p>the first layer is the mainstream media, roughly broken into L and R</p>

<p>the next layer is the alternative media, roughly broken into Alt L and Alt R</p>

<p>the next layer is social media, with full the full spectrum of Autism </p>

<p>according to one thinker,  the Autism epidemic is responsible for the rise of Libertarianism, because Autists are cold-hearted, non-emotional, fact-based...</p>

<hr/>

<p>so we are living in this transformative era, where years ago your grandparents were lead to believe that men walked on the moon because they saw it on the mainstream media...</p>

<p>... to your grandparents getting on Facebook and watching their grandkids laugh at the moon landing myth and post videos and blogs and memes etc </p>

<p>__</p>

<p>you can&#39;t really fault people who listen to AJ, any more than you can fault people who listen to Hannity or Brian Williams or any of the other professional liars</p>

<p>how many people do you know who could define a &quot;limited hangout&quot; or &quot;controlled opposition&quot;? </p>

<p>most people have no idea that these concepts are even a thing, much less that they are being subjected to them every time they consume news from any source </p>

<hr/>

<p>so here we are today, on reddit (social media) and you are reading my comment</p>

<p>opportunity cost: you can&#39;t spend time reading my comments on social media and also use that same time to read MSM or ALT media </p>

<p>__</p>

<p>instead of getting angry with your grandmother for listening to Hannity, introduce her to the Hannity sub reddit ...</p>

<p>show her how to participate in the conversation</p>

<hr/>

<p>we are all on different parts of the same path, just trying to get by and get along. lets not get angry, lets educate </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this definitely happens. I&#39;d guess that much of the vile anti-semitism you might occasionally see is this, for example. If they paint us all as mere racist assholes, then people will dismiss us when we point out that Israel is an apartheid state and their brutal occupation of Palestine is a crime against humanity. There&#39;s nothing wrong with being Jewish or practicing Judaism, and even the staunchest critics of Israel will generally say this clearly to avoid being decried as anti-semitic, but that doesn&#39;t matter if they plant anti-semitic trolls in the community. I&#39;m thinking especially of the racist idiots who add nothing to the conversation, usually the comments are extremely short and lacking in any substance at all. I&#39;ve NEVER seen one of these toxic, anti-semitic asshole users actually present GOOD and USEFUL information about the horrible things Israel has done. </p>

<p>For example, did you see any posts here about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ahed+Tamimi">that Palestinian teenager Ahed Tamimi who recently made news after she was filmed slapping and kicking an Israeli soldier who shot her teenaged cousin in the face</a>? If you did, I bet it wasn&#39;t from a toxic troll who is obsessed with whether a person is Jewish or not. Because they&#39;re not actually primarily interested in informing you about proven conspiracies in the world, they&#39;re just trying to spread hate. </p>

<p>I think flat earth theory is also an example of this. I can teach a kid how to use trigonometry and shadows to accurately measure the curve of the globe. People knew how to do this way back in ancient Greece. Even during the days of Columbus setting sail to attempt to discover a path through the Americas to India. They knew it then. We&#39;ve had the math and science to prove this shit for thousands of years! </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a large step from slapping conspiracy on the name of of the community and attracting those of an extreme paranoid outlook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Absolutely. People do just fine on their own too. People believe what they want. Typically what agrees with their experience of life. Confirmation bias. Truth or not. We&#39;re all guilty of this to some degree.</p>

<p>The only way to combat this bias is to apply scientific method to anything you might be learning about.</p>

<p>The internet is generally designed as a self segregating environment. It&#39;s not like scanning through channels the way people do with am - fm radio or standard broadcast tv. In passing we&#39;re forced to see things beyond exactly what makes us comfortable.</p>

<p>With web use, people seek out specific information and rarely take time to examine opposing viewpoints. When they do use the internet to carry out real research it&#39;s an unstoppable force of knowledge and learning. People must put real effort in to research. Months, years, digging and sorting the wheat from chaff.</p>

<p>Bottom line social media is an aggregator. Not a genuine research tool in most cases. If someone is basing their conclusions, solely off of a handful various social media posts, they&#39;re probably a lost cause to most people. All they need to do is spend their time online differently and things will change rapidly for them.</p>

Or is it possible this sort of statement is the latest evolution of the &quot;shill mentality&quot;.  The idea the people couldn&#39;t genuinely hold those beliefs being calmly assailed by &quot;Oh they are infiltrators aiming to discredit us&quot;.</p>

<p>It is really so unbelievable that these people believe these things?</p>

<p>This sort of logic leads to schisms and false confidence. We are now discussing conspiracies involved in the propagation of conspiracy theories, whose purpose is to discredit other conspiracy theories. What such a statement does is give people a false sense of security in their &quot;approved&quot; conspiracy theories and view outlandish ones as &quot;meta-conspiracies&quot;. This stops them comparing the genuine absurdity of the crazier theories with the absurdity of their own.</p>

Theories That Are Probably Not Bullshit:
• The Fed
• Global elites
• Ancient aliens
• Multi-dimensional existence (now proven, but for the love of f*** please don’t make me research a damn link)
• Agenda 21
• Corporate surveillance state
• Gov’ts systematically disarming citizens
• Facial recognition ... f-k Mark Zuckerberg all day with the heavy end of a hammer
• Google actively censoring content
• Twitter shadow-banning accounts who’s content it disagrees with
• Total Information Awareness
• A.I. is coming for us — if the human race has any future, it’s is as pets</p>

<p>Theories That Are Probably <em>TOTAL</em> Bullshit:
• Flat earth
• Hollow earth
• David Icke’s moon lizards
• Chemtrails
• Anything racist
• Outer space doesn’t exist
• Anything about JFK just because who the f-k still cares
• The idea that Freemasons are anything other than a gathering of shmoozers</p>

<p>I could go on (on both lists) but I need to get something resembling some work done today.</p>

We reached it, stepped foot on it, and never built a base there? When have we ever done that in the history of our country? Could be something there. Racist shit is noise level stuff. Re: outer space, did you ever see that video of the recreational user rockets that went into space and then they stopped spinning and it sounded like they went into some water? That is fucked, look on the net for it. I&#39;m not ruling anything out for sure. I agree about JFK, who the fuck cares. Agree on Freemasons, at least the local smaller ones, I don&#39;t think they are in on the big action. Maybe some bigger ones are?</p>

I would really love a sub like &quot;investigative&quot; or whatever. There should be a minimum of text length and no links should be accepted without a text that summarizes the content of the link, makes a statement or assuption, asks useful questions or presents the link in a certain context the user thinks might be interesting for other people. Users posting video links titeled &quot;Bush says he killed Kennedy&quot; and the video shows POTUS 4x stating &quot;I like Kilkenny&quot; should be banned.</p>
