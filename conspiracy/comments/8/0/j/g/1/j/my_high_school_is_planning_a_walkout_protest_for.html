        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My High School is planning (read &#39;conspiring&#39;) a walkout to protest the recent mass shootings and the 2nd amendment. This has me really concerned as even in the planning email that my parents shared with me (that they got from a frightened PTO parent, my parents have a reputation for speaking out against things that they disagree with) states that they will intimidate students to join the protest if they do not comply. This event has not been told to anyone outside of the school board and the &#39;inner circle&#39; of the PTO, so fairly few people know about it and this is one of the things that has me worried. They are doing this in collaboration with the #Enough organization or whatever they are. They are even including the feeder middle schools in this event and possibly the fucking ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. They have set up a group of volunteer lawyers for all the students who are detained/arrested, so this makes me feel like it isn&#39;t going to be a peaceful demonstration.
This goes against almost all of my (barely valid) beliefs as a high-schooler. I believe the school should be a politically neutral place (which it isn&#39;t) and a safe environment for everyone and their beliefs /orientations/whatever, and that the 2nd amendment is an essential part of the constitution that allows the people to remain free from the government. This conspiracy is creating a hostile environment that is not indicative of a peaceful environment. I remember during the 2016 election being (publicly) ridiculed for my beliefs and then almost exiled by people in my &#39;friend&#39; group, had it not been for like 3 people who are my actual friends, I would be a friendless loner right now. This is only going to serve to isolate the people who do not follow believe these things, so that they can be effectively profiled as &#39;loner right wing nuts&#39; so they can be targeted and locked up.
Any advice is appreciated and I hope you guys see this. The propaganda is getting insane, and this feels like what I would expect from pre-nazi germany not America. If you want links to the emails and documents they can be provided.
The &#39;Walk Out&#39; will be occurring on March 15, so look for it, you may see it on the news. If you are curious and want to know more/have advice PM, I have no clue what to do, but my parents have my back which is good (they said I could stay home/get picked up early that day).</p>

<p>Edit 1: I have had a few requests for the email evidence, and i will be happy to provide that, ill try to get a digital copy from my parents and link it here (sorry for spelling/grammar on mobile)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s what I mean. I&#39;d have a full list of reasons why it&#39;s not ok. I&#39;d go over it with my parents and make sure they are all on my side and I&#39;d present the list to the principle. I&#39;d also start my own little underground campaign to collect all of the kids that aren&#39;t mindless sheep. Maybe we would counter protest but instead of walking out we <del>lock Every one in</del> protest outside the principles or superintendents office and try to force the recall of the superintendent.  No wait... I don&#39;t think they can get replaced like that. Maybe it&#39;s school board. I&#39;m a bit removed...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait. People have been insisting for a week that the FL kids were able to do all their sophisticated organizing all by themselves. Now kids aren&#39;t able to organize? Which is it?</p>

<p>And it is a <em>public school</em>. They are on tax dollars. They can oppose violence all day if they want, but the 2nd Amendment? What if they were organizing to oppose abortion or gay marriage on tax dollars because they felt strongly about it? Are you still all in?</p>

<p>For the record I would bet money on the fact that adults were involved in the other protests though. Permits and travel arrangements are required for legal protests and these cannot be obtained by minors in most cases. Organization does not mean the sentiments are disingenuous.</p>

<p>And as to what they can protest? Anything. Literally anything. That’s the point of Free Speech.</p>

<p>It also depends on the specifics of the circumstance. Is it some adults organizing the means for the children to Be civically engaged and participation is optional?

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t how it works in public secondary school, though. The student body can have a vote and ask permission to demonstrate- and that should be without hindrance.

The school administration and PTO are doing it, it is a conspiracy because, they have not filed a protest permit they have filed a parade permit, they have not informed the students yet, nor the majority of parents.

    <div class="md"><p>I would advise you (and anyone else you can convince) to NOT attend.  Protesting never changes anything and if you get arrested, that arrest can follow you everywhere.  Want to go to law school - that arrest will make it hard to pass the bar qualifications.  Want to work in a field that requires state certification - now you have to pay money to get your record expunged.  The list goes on and on.  Please, I work in the legal field and this will not help you cause and could make your future self hurt.  If the students really want to do something, why don&#39;t you all show up at the next school board meeting and demand why the school district doesn&#39;t implement more safety features to ensure your safety while on school grounds?  I keep seeing these &#39;walk-out&#39; protests and the kids behind them have NO AGENDA, they are just doing what adults are pushing them to do....that is not how you solve problems.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven’t seen it said yet but don’t put yourself in a position to become a target later on. If this is all true and they are actually intimidating people to be apart of this then don’t let yourself be bullied into something you don’t want to do. If there’s a walkout and your teachers are actively participating then have a plan for your parents to pick you up and simply go home and enjoy your free day off. If the teachers are staying in class then stay with them and tell them you’d actually like to learn something instead of missing a day of school. Eat up those brownie points!</p>

<p>Kids are fucking dickheads and if you stand up to the masses in a situation like this they will use it against you for the rest of your days in school. Not because you’re standing up for what’s right, or what you believe in, but because you’re potentially fucking the slackers out of a free off day. So I don’t really see a point in going against the grain on this one. There are other ways to voice your opinion and they don’t involve people intimidating you into believing what they want. So if I were in this situation, I would wait for everyone to walk out. If the teachers walk then I would call my mom/Dad and have them take me home. None will be the wiser and there’s a good chance that 99.99% of the students walking are doing so for a free day off of school and for no other reason. So if this goes down, enjoy your free day off of school and go back the next day and actually try to learn something! </p>

<p>If you find yourself in class alone with teachers that didn’t/couldn’t participate then use the time to ask questions about coursework that you don’t fully understand or to get head of homework. There’s also a good chance that teachers will stay because they won’t get paid so ask them about upcoming assignments or what specifically you should focus on for any upcoming tests. There’s tons of ways you could use this to your advantage and I would suggest that you do so. If questioned about your lack of participation just say School is more important to you and try to change the subject back to school work. Again, you shouldn’t be pressured into anything and you should use this to your advantage in any way you possibly can. Good luck and don’t worry, you’ll make it through this. </p>
