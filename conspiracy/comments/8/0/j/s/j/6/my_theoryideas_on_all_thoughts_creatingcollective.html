        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a strange theory on drills, simulations, or anything you create, concentrate and put your focus on. This is my own belief- so, I do not want to argue..what I know in my life to be truth. I would just like to express what I believe is happening-</p>

<p>I am a huge believer in collective consciousness. I believe, we are all one, transmitting- projecting, receiving thoughts, vibrations, emotions nuances-
Some call this the law of attraction,- biblically, it all lines up- for instance (take every thought captive, what you reap you sow, whatever you put your faith in/as small as a mustard seed comes to pass, you can cause a fig tree to wither) the list goes on and on-</p>

<p>We have lived in a deep slumber, but the more we are awakened the more aware we become. The power to create and call forth good or bad into our lives according to our thought-</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it strange how trends happen, words over night become sayings all over the world. This is by collective consciousness. We as a people are strong- we just don&#39;t understand our power- so, we think carelessly/ put our thoughts on negative/violent not realizing that we are powerful transmitter/creators-</p>

<p>When we collectively put our minds on junk? Junk shows up. Reality tv show thinking? Our outer world responds and becomes a reality show-
Take a moment and see why art becomes life-</p>

<p>All these schools lately were having drills- rehearsing what would happen if something horrible were to happen?
All the collective emotion and fear?
What happened? It did!</p>

<p>Artists such as Paul walker passed away, in the very same way he made his living and reenacting (fast and furious)
Robin Williams passed away just like his movie
James Cary is going a bit bonkers like in 7
Michael Jackson (smooth criminal)
Heath ledger started feeling insane while filming the joker-</p>

<p>The list goes on!!&#39; </p>

<p>I think so many things daily and they show up within seconds! The more aware- it will happen at light speed
I don&#39;t watch any negative movies, or listen to dark music- it shows up somewhere!
I&#39;ve had my own song lyrics come to life-
I&#39;m careful now, at all I create.</p>

<p>You may think this is crazy- but I am telling you, it&#39;s truth!
If we want to change things- we have to collectively focus on what we want it to be--</p>

<p>Try it yourself- start thinking of something small and watch it show up! It will snowball and you will be aware how every thought is creating at all times</p>

<p>Sorry about typos- on my phone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you discuss is probably more accurately explained by simple awareness. For example I am unlikely to notice the use of a word I’m unaware of, so when I learn it I will hear (or notice ) it more frequently.</p>

<p>However I do believe in shared consciousness in the sense that as a large group humans seem to display a very fascinating herd mentality. We seemed to collectively be able to gather premonitions about impending danger, and there also seems to be some sort of memory passed down through generations allowing for similar thoughts and fears to pass on to others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!&#39; We are all intuitive:)
It&#39;s beyond focusing on a green car, and a green car shows up. I can think something and 5 people write on Facebook-
I&#39;ve had my screenplays show up with same characters, even an odd name misspelled by one letter (created by someone 5 years earlier)
I can think of crazy stuff and it&#39;s just there-
It&#39;s equal for all of us, but the world is in a slumber at how their minds create!
3 school shootings all were doing simulations--odd?</p>

<p>Our world turned into a reality show- why? The world was focused on shallow reality shows</p>

<p>Notice when something happens, it happens in bizarre duplicates--</p>

<p>We are all transmitting and thinking as one, but the world doesn&#39;t realize it-</p>

<p>The more aware you become- it happens in light speed,
To the point it freaks you out at what becomes of thought</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, thanks for sharing. I agree that these drills act as a primer on our collective consciousness and subconscious, making the event easier to manifest. Remember, these occult players are manifesting the event first on astral planes, and then help it unfold in the physical.</p>

<p>Your bringing up of the celebrities was very interesting and an idea I hadn’t heard before. Do you think these events were influenced because a large amount of people’s awareness affected the realities of these celebrities?</p>

<p>I have been experiencing this synchronicity so much that where I have a thought and then something related, or the same thing, appear in my physical reality in the near future. Once you tune in, it’s hard to fall back asleep to it. They call it the baader-meinhoff syndrome I think, and because it has a name people assume it is nothing more than an interesting psych9logical phenomenon. But is actually a structure of reality phenomenon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it! Yes! Once you&#39;re in tune, you no longer slumber. You anchor yourself in truth, and observe because otherwise it can cause anxiety-:/</p>

<p>I believe we are all truly thinking all thoughts as one-
We just don&#39;t know it. However, we can project onto people. That is why judgement is harmful, it encapsulates a person or sets them free. This can also happen to us, according to thoughts projected onto us-
So many biblical verses, have been pinging in my brain/making sense!
(Do not cast your pearls to swine) meaning.. don&#39;t share your beautiful thoughts and desires into certain people and they judge or project onto you-you can shield yourself by prayer against all ill spoken words-
Again God said, no word goes out unfulfilled
Good or bad-causing life or death-</p>

<p>For instance if hundreds of our youth are doing 
Training if a gunman appears at school- reenacting..
Feeling, fearing? They can call forth the event unless its counteracted with feeling safe, prayer, collective focus on something beautiful-</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve been taught in my spirit- what we see, speak, and focus on expands- multiply this a hundred, thousand fold- with the worlds attention-</p>

<p>Scriptures saying- over and over (fear not) is for that reason.. it creates more.
If we can get everyone to tune in to the outcome we want?
Peace, love, justice, mercy, compassion?
The world will twist that direction....
But, it&#39;s difficult to do- although many are awakening!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I will..:)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been intuitive starting as a little girl/ but, it wasn&#39;t 
Until I went through divorce, losing everything, leaving with 50 cents and almost homeless- add chronic pain-/
Basically fighting for my life- complete anxiety.</p>

<p>I had to face every fear! Fear of coming home late- no lights..house sitting in the boondocks completely dark, and alone- various frightening places alone 
Moving alone, decisions alone.... no income, health issues
Everything!</p>

<p>All I could do was pray, meditate, fight for my life-
And I mean fight, with every breath I would take-
I could hear my spirit say (help me) as I lay there alone-</p>

<p>Then strange things started happening- thoughts like downloads came streaming (I would read books- same things) I was utterly aware...I was given all this knowledge 
Within my own thoughts.
Then biblical stuff that I never understood started aligning!
I was taught I can&#39;t judge, or it will come upon me!
That we are all linked/one thinking the same thing-
What I do will come back like a boomerang-
Poetry and writing was infused 10 fold!
It was as though through all the suffering, a dam broke</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had t.v for 6 years- only watch comedy&#39;s in movies,/or positive -same with music-
I almost got paranoid, because everything I thought
Would show up!</p>

<p>This gift is for all/ it&#39;s not just me. Every person is equal-
It&#39;s just many people are blocked or hypnotized...
And have to surrender and seek and it will happen to them as well!</p>

<p>We just need to get everyone on the same page and miracles will be an every day occurrence/
We are living in the time of supernatural!</p>

<p>We as a people don&#39;t focus on beautiful though- 
What we look upon expands...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t hear god neither I got the info by being shown pictures while I was meditating. The bad thing is you get this info and you feel like you need to talk about it . I also listen to the bible on my mp3 player and and also I would recommend to watch old biblical movies and look into hermetic. It will be fun looking to the similarities. It has been fun tor me I think I know the natural programMing of nature we are all nature so I think if you are able to see it you are able to ascend the programMing. The bad thing is nobody really wants to talk about it but I want to. But I won&#39;t force it to anyone who don&#39;t want to listen. I hope you find someone I couldn&#39;t yet but it keeps getting more and more fun all this &quot;coincidences&quot; goodbye you can ask me anything I am always open to everyone </p>

That&#39;s a bummer... you should be able to share all your fabulous experiences!
My best friend, is my (go 2) as thinks keep getting incredibly crazier! She&#39;ll call me as well-</p>

<p>We were having coffee and said let&#39;s think of something we want to show up right now! We said tutu, and as we were leaving a lady was walking her dog with a pink tutu!
Then those pointy wooden hats, that are rare..
Walking and one was in the window- lol
It&#39;s almost like a comedy now-</p>

<p>I will look up, what you referred me to for sure!</p>

<p>It helps to have people to talk with, because everything starts getting so bizarre, that it&#39;s hard to absorb alone!
Sooooo many stories! 
Just a few weeks ago, I had a stranger in Whole Foods deliver a spiritual message and know my full first name, without asking! This kinda stuff is becoming a daily occurrence!</p>

<p>So much to share!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A week ago I would&#39;ve dismissed everything you said as hippy nonsense. Since then I&#39;ve found a lot of research papers that show that memory is a distributed and shared hologram. You can find this out for yourself, although I&#39;ve found a lot of the papers are heavy in jargon which makes them difficult to read. I&#39;m not a scientist and I&#39;ve had to slog through it and i could still have misinterpreted some things, so definitely do your own research.</p>

<p>Here is one of the more understandable papers I found (interestingly, the document on the CERN server has the title &quot;the truth is the one thing nobody will believe:</p>

<p><a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/886772/files/0509743.pdf">http://cds.cern.ch/record/886772/files/0509743.pdf</a></p>

<p>If I&#39;m understanding the paper here it shows that cosmic background radiation and the quantum world can interact with each other.</p>

<p>Memories of the collective are distributed across the whole network (humanity) and they are constantly recorded. It&#39;s possible to manipulate these memories (and some groups have been testing it like CERN, the US airforce, DARPA and some US universities.</p>

<p>The implications are pretty amazing though. To paraphrase Bill Hicks &quot;we are one consciousness experiencing each other subjectively&quot;</p>

<p>I know some people reading this will be sceptical and I would definitely have just filled it away as an interesting thought experiment, but it seems in about 2016 it went mainstream and there were a ton of new papers actually researching all this and being excited about the discovery (although of course there were tons of other papers before hinting at it or having part of the problem solved)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not at my home computer at the moment, so I&#39;ll try to update the post when I get back so anybody interested can use the same keywords to find relevant documents (if you put in &quot;holographic memory&quot; etc then you&#39;ll likely just find tons of new age type blogs. Use the right words on Google Scholar and you&#39;ll find how true what you&#39;ve written is</p>

<p>I actually think that more of us are coming to this conclusion because of the 100th monkey effect. Humans are realising we are connected, some are writing posts, some books, some research papers, but gradually the message is being shared to the collective by all the individual nodes.</p>

<p>Hope you find the paper interesting - it will lead you down other paths too, read the part about DNA</p>

<p>Also, look into epigenetic memory. Memory that is stored in our DNA and passed through generations.</p>

<p>If you want to look into things like the idea of time travel and manipulating 3D matter then search for things like &quot;non local&quot; or &quot;temporal&quot; (again using the phrase &quot;time travel&quot; will lead nowhere) and for manipulating matter look into acoustical holography, optical tweezers programmable matter</p>

<p>Another keyword to look out for is &quot;holographic associative memory&quot;</p>

<p>take care hope this post isn&#39;t too boring or too rambling! To quote Bill Hicks again &quot;it&#39;s just ride&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Super interesting!
The memory manipulation could be linked to Mandela effect-/cern...however, many say parallel universe and ours are exchanging info-</p>

<p>I would go s step further and say that things are constantly changing before our eyes- we just don&#39;t see--</p>

<p>It all truly gets too much for my human mind to comprehend- that I have to say to myself
(Just experience and don&#39;t analyze)
Or as you said- It&#39;s just a ride-
When I let go, I&#39;m good...But, if my day gets super
Crazy (like characters out of a movie) it can  cause me anxiety/</p>

<p>We are spiritual beings (sons and daughters of God)
Experiencing being human- and maybe now we are discovering our power! Maybe it&#39;s been hidden for so long-</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your insight!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey glad you found the link interesting.</p>

<p>Found another document tonight that is pretty insane. It’s from a set of declassified CIA documents about experiments they did with the Monroe Institute called Gateway Program:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf</a></p>

<p>According to the doc they have managed to cross different dimensions via consciousness. They found that the universe is a hologram that records everything and exists in all space and time simultaneously.</p>

<p>Check out the mention of “focus 12”. This change in consciousness lets the person talk to what they call The Absolute and ask questions to it. In the subsequent days they receive the answer. It is insane reading!</p>

<p>Again, I can’t vouch for any of this stuff and if you’d have told me a week ago I would consider this in anyway I would have laughed my head off. I’m just finding things that are really backing up this idea.</p>

<p>Same. I even talked with a friend about it. I think words/intent absolutely create our reality. I keep having to remind him to be mindful, because he has predicted/manifested a number of negative things that have happened, simply by &quot;gallows humor.&quot;</p>
