       I only know about a few instances of this happening: 9/11, 7/7, Sandy Hook and this latest shooting. How about with these school shootings, how often do such drills occur in schools in the states?

       Like I say, I don't know the frequency of these drills but how about assuming they occur once each term. What's a term, about 16 weeks? And a school day is what, 9am till 4pm? Let's give each day a six hour window in which to conduct such a drill and limit it to only 14 weeks. So that's 420 hours altogether in which to conduct a drill. The drill I imagine would be fairly short. Let's call it half an hour. Seems a pretty conservative estimation all round. So thirty minutes out of 420 hours; if you can work out the odds of those two events coinciding inside that time period I would be very interested to see what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, these odds would presumably be for the first event, the Sandy Hook shooting, is that correct? Such a thing reoccurring, as it did in this recent shooting, would surely be against greatly increased odds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll look forward to your reply.

       Unless shootings beget more shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think it's impossible to say because it would depend on the chances that a shooter would be generated in a given population, and first of all, nobody knows that, but second of all, it would depend on a lot of factors, not all of which are known.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know, shooters might even seek out targets that are in the drill state due to some kind of psychology of mass casualty events that we don't understand yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in other words, it's probably more like the stock market than something else. You can look at the past, but using data from the past to make predictions about the future generally will not work (although sometimes it might
       <em>
        appear
       </em>
       to work).

       I'm not sold on any conspiracy theory except JFK and 9/11, but one has to be willing to ask uncomfortable questions sometimes. Drills occurring during terrorist attacks and the like give cause to ask such questions.

       Yeah, I agree. It's a good question, and my reply is not meant to shoot anything down or negate the question. I just believe that engaging in these debates helps my understanding of the world. Questions should most definitely be asked, especially if the official narrative is full of holes as so often it is.

       Hello again, are you still up for helping me out? The time frame I came up with was about thirty minutes (that being the drill time coinciding with the shooting) out of 420 hours (that being the average number of hours in a school term, minus a week or so at each end). If you can work out the odds of those two events coinciding inside that time period I would be very interested to see what they are.

       I actually did some statistics on this data in the past, thinking something was sort of fishy.  However, what I actually wound up learning is that almost every single law enforfemrnt in every jurisdiction, from swat to state troopers, as well as fire departments, other types of emergency responders like paramedics or EMTs.. they're all having multiple types of trainings and drills on an annual basis. Like if you're a swat guy, trainings for active shooters, hostage situations and the like are literally a huge part of your job. Constantly training for the relatively rare occassions that shit really hrs the fan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combined altogether, it turns out that there are thousands or tens of thousands of drills and trainings any given year in the US by first responder groups, and a huge number of them are related, focused on, or just extremely applicable to mass shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my impression from trying to do some honest sitting at the time, but FWIW I felt pretty confident it would be very unlikely a shooting event could occur
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       there being relevant training ongoing in the time immediately surrounding it.

       No but for real.. you should be able to verify it pretty easily yourself.  Our police force in the US is completely militarized, uses military gear, and many units are training like the military. Our emergency services are constantly training for worst-case scenarios.  For example in regards to SWAT training..theres this thing called the National Tactical Operations Standards.
       <a href="http://ntoa.org/pdf/swatstandards.pdf">
        http://ntoa.org/pdf/swatstandards.pdf
       </a>
       .  Directly from their documentation,
       <em>
        part time
       </em>
       SWAT units are completing a minimum of 16 hours of training per month.  For full time units, its far more.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than 80% of towns with between 20,000 and 50,000 people have SWAT teams. 
 Almost every larger city has several independent SWAT units.  This level of police force militarization might seem completely absurd and unnecessary.  I'd agree with you.  But with roughly 20,000 towns in the US.. we're looking at tens of thousands of individual SWAT units that are completing a minimum of 16 hours of monthly training focused directly on active shootings, demolitions breaches, room clearing, hostage situations, and the like.  This all adds up to hundreds of thousands hours of training annually, making it quite difficult to find a time or region where preparation for shooting events isn't being practiced.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of that is even including emergency services, fire departments, regular police training, hospital trauma unit exercises, etc.  This type of training is happening constantly, because being a firefighter or on a SWAT unit, the
       <em>
        job itself
       </em>
       is training and being prepared for relatively rare, worst-case scenarios which are, by definition, unlikely to occur.

       But to have a drill in a school is a rare event, the police may have training exercise  and drills constantly but lockdown drills only occur a few times a year. At least in my high school we would have 1 lockdown drill and one fire drill a year, with no police iinvolved with the lockdowns. Fire department  would show up for fire drills. Even when I went to school in a shitty part of a major city we would have only 2 lockdown drills a year.

       Here's a theory (just a theory):
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the reason these schools are running active shooter drills is because the local authorities have identified a potential threat,
       <em>
        but can't do anything about it
       </em>
       because in America, you have to commit a crime before they'll arrest you. So the best they can do in the meantime is see if they can figure out some charges that will stick or a way to get a kid expelled, tighten up security at the school and run shooter drills. Because a threat actually exists. But you can't prosecute on a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then if the reason for the drills happens to show up, you've got a drill the same day you've got an active shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a theory. I'm not trying to shoot anyone else's down.

       Sounds a reasonable consideration. Such a thing happening during a drill might not be such a preposterous thing to imagine if that were the case. That it has happened twice now gives cause for suspicion.

       Another possible explanation that I haven't seen here yet is that if the potential shooter heard about a drill, he may figure that is a good time to strike. As it would then prolong response time because for some of the moments, people would think it is just a drill.

       I thought that too, but wouldn’t it also increase his chances of getting caught due to increased LE presence for these sorts of things?

       I thought the same thing also, but if you watch the reports by students, they werent even officially told there was going to be a drill, they just heard rumors from the teachers the MORNING of, I highly doubt this kind ran home and grabbed everything he would need to do this just spontaneously like that. It's just weird, and the girl talking about how she was standing with the guy while shots were being fired, or the teacher talking about someone in full body armor shooting a rifle they had never seen before. Heh, people obviously died, but what really happened, did one kid manage to do all this?

       It has to be insanely low. Yeah, people in law enforcement and rescue services are constantly conducting drills, but what are the odds that the exact drill situation would play out as a crime in the exact location within a few hours of the drill? That has to be crazy low, especially when you look at the odds of multiple events happening that way.

       Look at the odds that all agencies that have the data and knowledge to prevent this from occurring dropped the ball from city, county, state and fed.  That alone is very unusual.  Usually action is taken by at least 1 and if no action screams/demands were made by 1 agency with documentation.
