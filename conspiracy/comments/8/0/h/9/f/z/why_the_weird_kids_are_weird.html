        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What Nikolas Cruz did is beyond awful.  He will get what he deserves, whatever that is.   But if we don&#39;t start to recognize that the weird ones matter,  that being odd is as much a character flaw as having Gender Dysphoria, that is, not a flaw at all,  if it stays cool and normal to keep teasing them,  their hatred will always grow and grow.  Not everyone is born just like you,  some people have autism, some people have trauma. They can&#39;t help it.  I have 2 brothers with autism and I have seen first hand the cruelty.  This isn&#39;t sympathy for the devil.  As a Floridian this whole thing is very real...   We need to leave kids that are having a hard time as it is alone at the very least, but more so, try to help them.  I can’t even tell you what it felt like to have my brother called “Retard Rob” every day, I am sure it was 10 times worse for him.  That’s pretty fucked up when you think about it.  It’s like we go “Hey, this guy was born with the shit end of the stick, so let’s take it out and stab him with it.“  It’s our kill the weak culture.    We don’t care about them until the weak start to kill us.  We as a race are starting to understand each other so much better in the last 5 years,  I feel like the differences in our minds is one of the last frontiers after the gender revolution.     I hope that soon we will start to care about why the weird kids are weird.  Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There needs to be more empathy and more respect for individual idiosyncrasies and less alienation. People are being pushed to the edge until they can&#39;t take life anymore. They&#39;re provoked and their buttons are pushed until they can&#39;t take it anymore. I don&#39;t know what the solution is but I don&#39;t think the solution is in for-profit institutions who prescribe drugs and pretend to care about you when they really just want you out of the way of normal society. People need to start actually giving a shit about the weird people, but not in a fake way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Therapy and coping mechanisms help a bunch with almost any mental illness and some of the medication is extremely helpful when given to someone who actually requires it. </p>

<p>Empathy is also a key factor. Displaying to someone that you understand them and their situation/being there for support is such a vital act most people withhold from those most in need. </p>

<p>The world is such shit. Everyone is so frustrated with their day to day lives that picking on another person is a quick pleasure center release and makes them feel better in the short term. Then that leads to a frequent need to pump yourself up a bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have evolved past natural selection in a lot of ways... are transgendered just God’s way of saying “no breeding”? Maybe be that sure as hell isnt what we should be thinking.  Are retards supposed to eaten because they would’ve been a thousand years ago?  Maybe.  But not in 2018.  Having sympathy for some and not for others is completely wrong, and we all need to step up.  Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you believe Cruz could do it? Do you think your brothers with autism could carry this out? Cruz walked out of the building without getting caught. How was it even possible? There were swats and deputies and police officers from other counties when students were let out. He likely had a mask and vest and helmet in the duffle bag and clothes to change. After shooting, he took them off and hid in the bag and disguised as a student. Yeah, that sounds like Jame Bond type killer job. Conveniently, there is no video footage, there is no explanation how he walked out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did in fact read an interesting theory somewhere on the web (can&#39;t find it now) that said that one of the problems with this stuff is actually <em>suppressing</em> bullying.</p>

<p>Because you see, a loser male gets picked on and made fun of-- but at some point he WILL be having a bad day and he WILL snap.  When he snaps, he strikes back against the bully.  And presto-change-o ... no longer a loser male.  Instant status jump.  Everyone wins.</p>

<p>Now teachers and shrinks intervene and our lowest-of-the-low status male literally has NO way to ascend the heirarchy.  He sinks lower and lower and eventually it&#39;s Columbine or Florida.</p>

<p>For the record (and why this stuck with me), that was my pattern.  Really bad day.  Tormentor pushed wrong button, and I said to hell with it and went for him.  And I was instantly &quot;integrated&quot; into the high school society at large.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apathy is the real killer. So many just watch abuse happen and do not get involved. No one sticks up for each other anymore.  We had our share of weird kids, but we would tell others to stop.</p>

<p>By middle school and high school, instructors and administration would be telling me and my friends to stop causing a ruckus. We refused and some of us we suspended for sticking up for other kids.</p>

<p>In high school i was told point blank by the Vice principal, &quot;Chivalry is dead.&quot;</p>

<p>I responded, &quot;No it is not.&quot;</p>

<p>Bullies get away with things because people are conditioned to mind their own business, instead of conditioned to look out for their fellow student. </p>

<p>The culture needs to change. We need to become more vigilant and protective of each other.  Not divisive and apathetic. Look out for each other.  And just actually give a crap.  Give a crap about people.</p>
