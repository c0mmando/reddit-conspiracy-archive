       99% of r/politics posts are either anti-trump or pro-democrat. Several vote brigades are running in that sub to make sure the posts mentioned early keep on the first page. Every negative news about a democrat politician is heavily downvoted and even reported. The same happens with any positive Trump news. And several users here keep asking to support and vote for democrat politicians and the mods allow it.

       Your examples are comparing a story about a president from nearly 20 years ago who most have not thought about with the current president’s actions regarding a closely watch senate race. Doesn’t it make sense that one would garner more attention?

       Nobody denies r politics is biased. The key difference between liberal subs and conservative subs is liberal subs are far more open to different ideas. In
       <a href="/r/politics">

       </a>
       you are allowed to have dissenting opinion

       Go have a dissenting opinion in r/the_donald or

       and see how that plays out for you. This is the largest problem, not bias

       Show me a comment you made that got you banned from r/politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a liberal and have been banned from r/politics like 4 or 5 times but it's always due to incivility--probably towards conservatives to be honest because I curse a lot.
      </p>

       I see conservatives post there, but they are usually downvoted into the ground for either:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Trolling, or
       </li>
       <li>
        Giving an opinion no one agrees with and then they refuse/fail to follow up after getting corrected/called out

       Calling it "politics' implies non-partisanism.  Now anyone who's spent any time in there at all knows it is anything but. Misleading title.  Almost seems like a Reddit violation of some type. Rule number...something or other.

       I think at some point people need to get over that sub. Yeah it's a liberal circle jerk. Nobody can do anything about it. Just don't go there. I'm a leftie and I don't go there anymore. It's lame on any sub when everyone aggressively agrees with each other.

       It used to be a Bernie circlejerk sub. Now it's an anti-Trump circlejerk. People probably don't remember when it was a Ron Paul circlejerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the primaries anybody who didn't shit on Hillary was called a CTR shill. Then they tried to shift that to Shareblue but that's been banned from the sub while sources like Breitbart are still allowed so I guess it's now the "deep state."

       Can confirm. Use available reddit statistics tools to plot my accounts contribution history over time. The most activity and karma generated over time is over at [redacted]. That was my go to place to air out politics ideas, experience the community nuke them from orbit, then I could go back checking assumptions and rebuilding a better understanding of the issue. Learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sub flipped over night right around the night of the Dem primary in 2016. Suddenly new faces I'd never seen or tagged before filled the sub. Conversations no longer had counter arguments. Instead name calling and brief sentences that could be ripped from the talking points regurgitated on CNN all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped learning. No one would engage in conversation sufficiently to break down my ideas and provide direction for further research. At best it was 'because WaPo said so' or other circular headline reasoning. In prior years the direction would lead through wikipedia or source documents that could be analyzed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we moved. The accounts I'd seen for years on [redacted] were seen instead in other subs. The regular contributor base flipped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the best comments there tend to be the most downvoted. Which leads to comment delays for those accounts before too long. So they leave.

       I call it the Ellen Pao monetization program. I have no hard evidence to back up the claim. Simply observing the timing was right for the administrative negotiation to occur under her leadership. It would probably have been difficult for Spez to give back the money and back out of the program, so it moved forward.

       You brought up the 2016 primary, and the seemingly overnight flip. It wasn't just that sub, it was
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       online outlets. The only thing I can think is that there is a massive undertaking going on to push the extreme left wing narrative on the internet, and it's being veiled as outrage at Trump. Almost all moderate statements or statements that can, at least,

       The fall out is just now starting to be seen (sic, the redpill communities and droves of people redpilling). Lots of us traditionally left (and at least this progressive) are falling away from mainstream liberalism because it's just so fucking toxic. SJW culture is being pushed as the new norm and any disagreement is tanamount to Dispareagement. It's disgusting, it's authoritarian, and it's damn near facist.

       Genuinely makes me wonder if someone is trying to start a second Civil War, one in which a identity politics has labeled all of us enemies, just to tear apart the nation.

       Well put. When the propaganda campaign turned on my entire voter lifetime was as a Dem. Down party line more often than not, with the sage grandmother advice of when dissatisfied with performance to 'vote out the incumbent'.

       Simply arguing for items I felt important to be in the Dem platform lead to labels. Sexist, racist, Bernie bro, Trumper, alt-right, Nazi. Only comments explicitly in support of daily acceptable narrative received upvote.

       Too many groups were in place at the same time and turned it on all at once. As has been observed by Stephan Molyneaux and various professors SJW tactics mirror in many ways those used during the cultural revolution in China as communism rose.

       Assume a different outcome occurred in the election. There was a powerful base in place to drastically alter the US, all signs aligned with significantly undermining sovereignty (see TPP) and replacing cultural structures with something vastly different.

       It demonstrates what's at stake. The leadership of that particular party are not necessarily far left. It's about control and authoritarianism. Letting multi-citizenship global entities take control of all aspects, and completely drain the wealth out from the American public.

       Sanders proposes further left leaning ideals, but generates benefit for the American public? Relentlessly hounded by the yellow journalist propagandists. Can't have him get in the way of the fleecing of America.

       I remember during the primaries they had a moderator from The_Donald that openly talked about working for Breitbart and making the sub MAGA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire front page was nothing but anti-Hillary posts. No megathreads to merge them into one. Even third world state propaganda made it to the top as long as it was against her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they still have mods from The_Donald and have even banned Shareblue while still allowing Breitbart and others.

       By that logic it's anti-Trump now because he sucks on a whole new level never seen before. Unless you're a fanatic, he sucks far worse than Hillary ever could. So it makes sense that people who follow American politics wouldn't be fans of his.

       I think a mod that openly claimed he was making the sub "MAGA" and worked for Milo/Breitbart that stated he would make sure they always had a home there probably had a bit of an impact on the sub. Especially since Breitbart is literal propaganda and isn't banned from the whitelist.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I heard about shareblue the mods claimed they caught users trying to game the system. You're saying that you believe claims made by
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       mods even though they shared absolutely no evidence or proof? Do you believe it because you want to believe it or can you actually verify the claims?

       Even if assuming that's true. How many people supported either candidate? How often do you post in subs that are hostile to the candidate you support? The sub gained more and more hillary supporters as she was more likely to win the primary until a point where they are no longer out of view. The anti-clinton, conservative community were observed to be pro-sanders until the candidacy solidified.

       Because you're falling for some terrible selection bias. How many people like listening to music on reddit, but how many people are subscribed to specific genre/artist subreddits?

       There's currently no logical reason to equate one subreddit activity with another when they have absolutely no similarity.

      <p>

       How do you think that helps your argument? Do you think a subreddit's overall position on a matter can't change? Plenty of people have said that they left politics, me included, due to the circle-jerky nature that its become. Still does nothing to support whether it was bought and paid for.

       i used to mainly post to politics, news, and worldnews but i was banned from all three within a month of trump winning the republican nomination. its just as well, im not trying to argue with paid lobbyist shills, and then have my side of the argument hidden from public view with vote brigades.

       The left dramatically outnumbers the right there.

      <p>
       That being said, how do you fix it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatives don't go there, they prefer more safe space subs like r/conservative and
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       where people who disagree with them are banned.  So if conservatives won't go to r/politics, and prefer to just bitch about it from other subs, how does it get more balanced?
      </p>
      <p>
       Should the mods at r/politics give preferential treatment to conservative articles, say a free 150 upvote bump for every Breitbart article posted?

       Conservative subs are really the only places where real discussion happens. Go to somewhere like the supposed "politics" sub and you're bombarded with downvotes limiting your ability to spread your ideas or convince others.

       What would you do then to fix It? Reddit, at least since I've been visiting the site, has never leaned far right or has supported the GOP. So of course in a large sub it's going to tend to be liberal and young. What should they do? Ban people?

       Conservatives don't go there for the same reason that Progressives don't go to the Donald. It's not different. Get off your high horse. Progressives need safe spaces just as much. They will ban anyone who disagrees with them in one of their safe spaces like r Politics. Don't need any upvote bump. But posting conservative stuff at all would be a start. But we all know that won't happen. It's a progressive sub.

       I stand corrected. I tried to go post there and I could. I must have thought I was permanent banned when I probably received a 7 day ban. Never tried posting there again. Sorry for the confusion, and... thanks for helping me realize I'm not banned? Lol.

       because Im a Trump supporters is the REAL reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MO there is since its 85% bots and shariablue paid shills anyway, if you say ANYTHING that isnt hardcore Trump hate, and I mean extreme, you get a mountain of downvotes and "you are a scumbag" comments.  And then, if you fight back, you get kicked for "being uncivil", ignoring the fact that you just were the recipient of an online gang rape first.

       And at least 90% of the comments on their top and gilded comments are paid for libertarian free market anti-government, globalists, (like Jeff Bezos, and the Kochs.)  talking points and or AI bot replies.

       So much wrong with your argument. You open with a percentage that you don't support, then you actually make the bold claim that there is positive Trump news. Then you go to examples.  Bill Clinton is no longer in politics, so no one with half a fucking brain even gives a shit what he's doing.  Maybe that's why no one cares to see it.  Your example for Clinton is sexual assault, not for supporting a child sex abuser.  Trump's base has forgiven him for sexual assault already, and he has more lawsuits against him this year than Clinton has since being in office.

       Plenty are calling out the bullshit in real time. For example, Jimmy Dore on his YouTube channel. They're out there, but you'll never see them on any corporate platform. Don't let the corporate media shape your worldview, actual leftists are only we ever allowed attention in the corporate media to smear them.
