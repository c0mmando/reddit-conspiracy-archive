       I have a theory that not only has Russia been influencing western government, but that it's also been influencing the western populous by creating radicle posts, theories, in groups like TheRedPill, MRA, and on the opposite side Feminist groups with the purpose of creating a divide between women and men in the country. Obviously this isn't reflective of the movements of a whole, but I don't think anyone can argue that either sides don't have very radical members.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that Russian influence is responsible for the rise of BOTH the alt-right and the alt-left?

       No one knows if there was collusion outside of Mueller's team.  But saying the Russia thing is a nothing burger is absolute nonsense.

       If they stole someone's identity to do it then punish them inside the law but there is not some grave threat to our democracy for Christ's sake this Russian bullshit is getting so out of hand.

       It's just a distraction to get American's worried about a foreign boogeyman instead of looking inward at domestic corruption.

       Also the CIA/NSA/Establishment are the biggest hypocrites in the fucking universe for pointing a finger at ANYONE for democratic election meddling (the real kind) because that is our god damn specialty.

       So I must not be missing anything then. They made social media accounts to push their own agenda. As we do and as everyone does. Far as Im concerned that is their prerogative, it only became criminal when they stole identities to legitimize the accounts.

       You should stop focusing on the foreign boogeyman and worry about tyranny at home, something far more pertinent and far more patriotic.

       They've definitely been stoking every division they can, hitting both sides in each one, but I don't think they're deep into any niche communities like that, more just tweeting and spreading fake news to the broadest audiences possible.

       But the majority of those communities are built around tweets, reddit posts, and facebook posts. Wouldn't they cause plenty of dysfunction if they give men ill advice on picking up women in places like TheRedPill or MensRights while simultaneously spreading anti-masculinity memes and theories in feminist communities like BluePill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's already been shown that Russian bots post in r/The_Donald. It wouldn't be too far fetched that they're posting extreme things in other sub reddits with the purpose of dividing and breeding Man-hating or misogyny or misandry.

       Exactly and the propaganda delivery system changed under their noses.  Modern advertising theory (aka propaganda) was being studied and getting a lot of discussion after their early years and with that, they will fight to the death over what they believe, truth or propaganda.   Meanwhile younger generations were at least exposed to the idea that not everything on TV news is a fact.

       r/politics currently believes Trump has a 31% approval rating. The problem is the polling sample skews the percentage of R, D, and Independents. 23% of those polled identified as republican while 34% polled identified as democrat. Remainder was independent, but right off the bat your locking in a huge negative skew with the disparity between R and D. This is results driven polling and it’s partly why Hillary’s loss was a blindside to the entire democratic establishment.

       I'm old enough to remember when journalism was at least somewhat associated with investigative reporting that might actually uncover the truth, rather than being the simplistic public relations arms of the two party system.  Social media panders to the lowest common denominator for maximum exposure, and it occurs to me that the overused pejorative
       <em>
        "sheeple"
       </em>
       is appropriate for a good reason.

       Most glaring thing from the 2016 election cycle for me was watching George Stephanopoulos hammer the Clinton Cash author for not being able to definitively prove any of his assertions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The author then countered that he has no subpoena power, he lacks the resources/authority to definitively prove anything, but that he’s laid out a pattern of activity and resulting action that he felt merits an investigative body looking into. In other words, he made a completely reasonable argument. George just kept framing him as a loon making faulty claims and trying to discredit him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I read the Podesta email where HRC campaign members recap the interview with comments like “Our guy George!” “Wow, George did great!” It’s completely disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of public “news” anchors/journalists who dined at Podesta’s home is also disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then these people wonder why they have no credibility. Journalism is an absolute joke at this point.

       Russia tried to overthrow
       <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/29/russian-hacks-john-mccain-column/436354001/">
        Montenegro
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But perhaps the most disturbing indication of Putin’s violent ambitions is what happened in October 2016 in the small Balkan country of Montenegro, when Russian intelligence operatives plotted to overthrow the democratically elected government of Montenegro and murder its prime minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why would Putin go this far? Russia viewed Montenegro’s pursuit of European Union and NATO membership as both insulting and threatening. After all, Montenegro was once part of Russia’s traditional Slavic ally, Serbia. The country has long been a favorite for Russian tourists. Indeed, Russian politicians and oligarchs are reported to own as much as 40% of the real estate in Montenegro.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The conspiracy plan:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As Election Day protests were under way in front of the Montenegrin parliament, a group of 50 armed men, recruited by the Russian GRU agents and wearing police uniforms, would ambush and kill the members of Montenegro’s Special Anti-Terrorist Unit to prevent them from interfering with the coup. The armed men would then proceed to the parliament, where they'd begin shooting at members of the police defending the building.
       </p>
       <p>
        Led by the coup plotters, the protesters would then storm parliament and declare victory for the opposition. Within 48 hours, a new government would be formed and arrests would be made across the capital, including of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. If the prime minister could not be captured, he'd be killed.
       </p>
       <p>
        It appears the plot might even have involved trying to blame the United States for the violence. An Orlando company was contacted about providing security services in the Montenegrin capital during the election. One can only speculate that American security personnel on the ground during a coup would have made excellent patsies for stories on Sputnik and Russia Today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fortunately, the plan never got off the ground. Several days before Election Day, one of the plotters got cold feet and informed the Montenegrin authorities. Arrests were made, and the plot was disrupted. In the aftermath, the Russian GRU agents tried to hire an assassin to kill Montenegro’s prime minister, but to no avail. The agents eventually made their way back to Moscow.

       I don't think it really matters if the US promised that or not. It's Montenegro's decision to make if they want to join NATO. Doesn't change the fact that Russia tried to overthrow a sovereign nation and was planning on staging a false flag operation on the US.
