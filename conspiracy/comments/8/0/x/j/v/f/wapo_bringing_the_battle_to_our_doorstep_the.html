    <div class="md"><p>I never believe anything.  Believing is for chumps.  I know what I know ... and there are things I don&#39;t know until I do ~ know them.  I see crisis actors ... kids acting out of the crisis seeing their classmates blown away. This non-conspiracy school is a real school in a real county in a real state in the U.S.A.    Conspiracy Theory Folks seem desperate to create something they make up.  Kind of like when a chicken gets something stuck in their craw ... it bugs them until they spit it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jewish press, like WaPo, is the most powerful tool employed against the people by our oppressors. It manipulates the minds of people who otherwise mean well, and causes them to work against their best interests. Its a truly disgusting spectacle to behold, and I would like nothing more to see them all destroyed. There is a reason why they came completely unhinged when people began calling them &quot;fake news.&quot; They rely on the common man not realizing that he is being manipulated.</p>
