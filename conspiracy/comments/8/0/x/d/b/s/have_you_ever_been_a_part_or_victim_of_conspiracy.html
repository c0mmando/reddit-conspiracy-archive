Years prior when I went to SBCC someone driving a BMW threw a drink at me, missed idiot, just like the perpetrator said he did many times in his manifesto.

    <div class="md"><p>Met, not at all. Didn&#39;t even see the driver, but the odds of someone throwing something at a pedestrian and driving a black BMW and not being him seems very low. Only time in my life someone has thrown something at me like that.  Chance is I had met the tridelt girl who lost her life as my house hangout with tridelts all the time.. Talking about coincidences, there have been two killings in IV. Both perpetrated by sons of Movie/TV directors.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t even know... :)</p>

<p>I will give you the &quot;ultra condensed, leave &#39;em wanting much more&quot; version which I have been writing up for a while now.</p>

<p>Starting when I was about 9 or 10, aliens started their numerous attempts to contact me.  I did not know this was aliens for decades, though.</p>

<p>The Company became aware of this via their limited contact with these aliens, and started to attempt to recruit me.  There were a few attempts when I was in school, but things picked up dramatically in college.</p>

<p>I was heavily recruited for a tiny college I&#39;d never heard of.  I did wind up going there.  VERY long story short, the Company had an agent in one of the professors there.  He was to guide me.  They also sent two agents to actively recruit me.  One was an older woman (she claimed to be 32 when I was 18) and then her &quot;sister&quot; who was my age.  I wound up dating the sister.  They attempted to recruit me to a project named Caleb run by the Company.  [You will be hearing much more about that.]  Caleb was a project aimed at communicating better with these aliens, and more.  This was not what they told me, they made it sound like it was mostly-benign research into the minds of autistic people.  </p>

<p>I resisted and did not join this project, ultimately graduated and went on my way.  The professor was much later framed for child porn, sentenced to life in prison, and ultimately murdered in prison.  The two women who were sent to recruit me disappeared from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>The aliens contacted me much later to give me a message about my children.  I have not deciphered that message yet (it&#39;s been two decades).  They also sent a guide to monitor me from just before my kids were born until just after.  </p>

<p>That should be enough for now.  Note, there are two things here that you probably haven&#39;t heard of.  One is Project Caleb, and the other is the massive trove of psychological information provided to the government by standardized testing services.</p>

<p>Much, much more coming in the time ahead.</p>

<p>No, I am not crazy.  I am a perfectly sane, middle-aged husband and father who lives in a suburban home with a stable career.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get help, please for the sake of your family. It&#39;s clear some traumatic event happened in your childhood and based on that professor being arrested for child porn, you were probably exploited.

    <div class="md"><p>Please. I can assure you.  I was not sexually abused or exploited by anyone during my childhood or from this professor.  I am not repressing memories.  I even talked to a college friend after the professor was arrested saying something like &quot;My god, did you hear about [prof]?  That&#39;s fucked up.&quot;   His response was quite odd and something like &quot;well, it is sad, but some people just have their desires and demons they can&#39;t run from.&quot;  All I really expected was a response of &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s fucked up.&quot;  College was the best four years of my life, by far.  If there was some kind of abuse or exploitation by this guy, there&#39;s no way I wouldn&#39;t remember or wouldn&#39;t have gone after him in some way for doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it you don&#39;t believe me?  Is it because these are things that &quot;have never happened before&quot; so it&#39;s difficult to believe they <em>can</em> happen?  Half of me wants to dismiss your skepticism as just more of the same that I get here when discussing these things, but half of me wants to understand.  </p>

<p>I do, however, I want to ask you a question. How can you explain people who are autistic and can sit down at a piano, never having learned piano, and just play perfectly?  Do you think it&#39;s just because their brains figured out piano instantly, or may it have been because they were able to access some kind of information that allowed them to use the experience of someone else?  If the former, do you understand why I would be skeptical of that assertion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean look at it this way, if you&#39;re a corporation you can donate an unlimited amount of money, completely anonymously that far exceeds the limits of a citizen.  Furthermore, your religious rights as a corporation supersede the religious rights of any potential employees.</p>

<p>In a way, you have more rights as a corporate person than you do as simply a citizen.  You also pay a lower percentage in taxes.  I mean, based on the laws, corporations may not get the right to vote, but they have rights that supersede those of the citizens who work for them.  And who cares if they cant vote?  They can buy the votes and the politician.  They also get full rights on incorporation, they dont have to wait 18 years under a custodian for them to fully vest.</p>
