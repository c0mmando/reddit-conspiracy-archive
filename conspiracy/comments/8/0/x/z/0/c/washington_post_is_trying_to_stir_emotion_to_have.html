<p>They are not just survivor children. They are public activists/lobbyists making their rounds on the main stream news circuit. Public figures are not immune from criticism. They chose to become public figures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I&#39;m not sure anyone has been threatened in this case yet, but let&#39;s say they have, does that mean we should censor every group that has some members who threaten others?  The MSM supported Antifa when they were threatening people and running around the streets hitting people, should they be censored?  How about Muslims, there are terrorists that are Muslims who actually kill people, should we censor all Muslims.  This is what they are advocating, and it&#39;s an old trick by the establishment to smear entire groups for the actions of a few... Who sometimes are establishment shills to begin with.  This is a very slippery slope they are presenting here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one as far as I know is <em>attacking</em> Parkland victims either. But if you want to construe questioning the legitimacy of these students as attacks, then I would say that most of this questioning is directed at those students who have chosen to go public, to speak out on national media and organize walkouts. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s how it should be. I don&#39;t think anyone should be harassed or even really questioned just for being a bystander to an event like this, but the moment you decided to speak to the press, you make yourself a public figure, and invite all the attention that comes with, both positive and negative. We have laws in this country about harassment and threats, yet questioning their motives or even their identities is fair game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, real critical thinking isn&#39;t a skill that everyone is blessed with. And it can only be partially taught.</p>

<p>I think there are three categories of people out there: </p>

<ol>
<li>Those who believe everything they read (most people), 2. those who believe nothing they read, and 3. those who carefully analyze what they read and determine what information is valuable and true, and what is bullshit.</li>
</ol>

<p>You have to be able to sift through the bullshit and decide for yourself what meaning to take from the evidence that is provided. As a practicing attorney, this is incredibly difficult even for someone with my training, and I&#39;m completely unsurprised that the average person is not capable of doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So. To sum up. Hogg is a crisis actor. The shooter was equipped by... the FBI? And this has all been orchestrated by the anti gun lobby. People who don&#39;t like guns... they conspire to shoot up a school... or at least let it happen... to get a kid more Twitter followers than the nra. Or something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that you&#39;re being facetious, but I think its only because your mind has difficulty contemplating anything but the mainstream narrative. I really don&#39;t blame you for that, I was that way too, before I started realizing how much they lie to us.</p>

<p>And truthfully, I don&#39;t know exactly what happened and I would never claim to. Of course I admit that it could have gone down exactly as we are told, but I&#39;m very suspicious. Here is one possibility:</p>

<p>They have the goal of disarming the general people, so that we do not pose a threat of eventually rebellion as they continue to infringe on our rights. So they orchestrate a school shooting, because what better emotional appeal could they present to the people in order to convince us to disarm ourselves?</p>

<p>So they groom Cruz due to his instability, he will be their patsy. Hogg&#39;s father is in on the plan, and Hogg may be as well. They plan an active shooter drill the day of the operation to give them cover in case they have to cancel the operation for whatever reason. Government agents conduct the shooting under cover of smoke bombs, and they arrest Cruz. They threaten Cruz with torture unless he pleads guilty and agrees to never talk.</p>

<p>There are other possibilities and variations in what could have happened, but if you aren&#39;t able to entertain this idea then I think you&#39;re probably in the wrong subreddit.</p>

<p>Protocols (#V): </p>

<p>&quot;Capital, if it is to co-operate untrammelled, must be free to establish a monopoly of industry and trade: this is already being put in execution by an unseen hand in all quarters of the world. This freedom will give political force to those engaged in industry, and that will help to oppress the people. Nowadays it is more important to disarm the peoples than to lead them into war; more important to use for our advantage the passions which have burst into flames than to quench their fire; more important to catch up and interpret the ideas of others to suit ourselves than to eradicate them. The principal object of our directorate consists in this: to debilitate the public mind by criticism; to lead it away from serious reflections calculated to arouse resistance; to distract the forces of the mind towards a sham fight of empty eloquence.&quot;</p>

<p>Former YouTube engineer Guillaume Chaslot referred to coordinated campaigns across online platforms to spread a video as “4chan attacks” because such anonymous forums often served as staging grounds for these efforts. YouTube and Facebook have policies against harassment that served as the basis for removing some of the conspiracy theories. But Chaslot said the companies have not done enough to weed out deceptive content.</p>

<p>So they bring in an expert saying Facebook and Youtube are doing a decent job filtering out content for harassment, but not enough to get rid of &#39;deceptive content&#39; originating from places like 4chan and Reddit. Implying maybe Youtube and Facebook can only do so much and that the platforms where content originates need to be fixed.</p>

<p>In the opinions of the rep from YouTube, more needs to be done. The author of the article neither agreed nor disagreed. They never made a statement on whether or not this would be good or bad, effective or not. You made up a concluding statement and put it into the author&#39;s mouth.</p>

<p>you&#39;re doing it again. You took a statement and are peddling your own interpretation of it as fact. The only facts contained in that statement were: </p>

<ul>
<li>pizza gate was shut down</li>
<li>conspiracy and the_donald were also actively involved in discussing pizzagate.</li>

<p>No opinion on any of this was given.</p>

<p>For sure, there are always vile people willing to say vile things.  It&#39;s interesting they are attacking this sub specifically though.  I haven&#39;t really even seen any thing threatening or even mean to them.  The admin stepped in last week and the rules have been no harassment, threats or attacks, and I haven&#39;t seen any even before that.

<p>The article tries to create the narrative that an organized racist campaign orchestrated by 8chan was to blame for people questioning this incident and all of its oddities. How convenient that must be to blame that dastardly 4chan hacker again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are people supposed to keep apprised of such nefarious intentions if you ban them? You are proposing banning a media outlet that you contend is a running example of a conspiracy theory. Let people link and if you have a problem with an article and your arguments against it are sound then let the rest fall into place. Can&#39;t see what the weather is like outside if you have the curtains drawn.</p>

<p>Besides, how have you all missed the brilliant archive function? This is exactly what it is for. Boycott by not clicking the direct link. Want to know what&#39;s going in and debate some while still maintaining a boycott, click on the archive function instead. This shit is so obvious it makes me a bit suspicious anyone would argue to actually ban a news outlet. Especially if u believe it is involved in a conspiracy. You guys want to ban all links to official and non-official CIA, NSA, and FBI releases as well? How about political speeches? Media is full of players arguably complicit in conspiracy to one degree or another, you want to ban just the ones that go against your personal politics? That&#39;s bullshit and sounds like something a lot of other subs do, this one shouldn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok fair enough, especially about the archive function. But if they are targeting the sub, again, how do we keep apprised? I say post that shit up everytime they attack. If they get a few more clicks from this sub who gives a shit. Archive when it works, tdlr it and discuss how to resist here in the conspiracy sub.</p>
