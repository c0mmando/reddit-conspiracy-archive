       They say we are hosting harsh attacks on the Parkland students. Discussing public activists and there motivations is not "attacking" anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is pretty obvious where they are trying to go with this since we have all seen what happened to youtube. They are trying to make a case for censoring this sub..They don't deserve a single penny from our web traffic and should be boycotted.
      </p>

       They are not just survivor children. They are public activists/lobbyists making their rounds on the main stream news circuit. Public figures are not immune from criticism. They chose to become public figures.

       But what's wrong with talking about that?  If the government wasn't constantly using informants, covering up various other attacks, and out right lying, then we probably wouldn't be questioning them.

       Because not everything goes as deep as the Marianas trench. Saying 'question everything' gives you no solid base of reasoning, just unfounded questions without logical conclusions. 
Question things that are suspicious with reasonable evidence. The reasonable part has been lost on most posters.

       And who's to say where the reasonable evidence is?  How about with the LV shooter, there are tons of holes in that story, and looks like there were more than 1 person in those 2 rooms.  Are we not allowed to discuss it because the media says there was only one person involved?

       We discuss suspicious things. Nothing about the victims of the LV shooting was particularly suspicious, although the shooting itself was. That's why the shooting was discussed extensively, but the victims weren't.

       I only saw part of the D James video that he "got in trouble" for.  D James was highlighting anther users video, and I had never seen this user before.  Im not positive but I think D James run in with Youtube was over what was in that other users video that D James was playing on his channel.

       I watched that video, that other YT'er was pointing out how there were 4 different armed security guards and how two were un named and walked out and got on a elevator.  His theory was that's who were in room 134.  Had nothing to do with the Florida shooting.

       First, I'm not sure anyone has been threatened in this case yet, but let's say they have, does that mean we should censor every group that has some members who threaten others?  The MSM supported Antifa when they were threatening people and running around the streets hitting people, should they be censored?  How about Muslims, there are terrorists that are Muslims who actually kill people, should we censor all Muslims.  This is what they are advocating, and it's an old trick by the establishment to smear entire groups for the actions of a few... Who sometimes are establishment shills to begin with.  This is a very slippery slope they are presenting here.

       No one as far as I know is
       <em>
        attacking
       </em>
       Parkland victims either. But if you want to construe questioning the legitimacy of these students as attacks, then I would say that most of this questioning is directed at those students who have chosen to go public, to speak out on national media and organize walkouts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's how it should be. I don't think anyone should be harassed or even really questioned just for being a bystander to an event like this, but the moment you decided to speak to the press, you make yourself a public figure, and invite all the attention that comes with, both positive and negative. We have laws in this country about harassment and threats, yet questioning their motives or even their identities is fair game.

       No way. Question everything, and use critical thinking to come to your own conclusions. Think for yourself and stop trusting in people who are looking to manipulate you. That is what this country desperately needs. I hope you and people like you can wake up, for all of our sake.

       Unfortunately, real critical thinking isn't a skill that everyone is blessed with. And it can only be partially taught.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there are three categories of people out there:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Those who believe everything they read (most people), 2. those who believe nothing they read, and 3. those who carefully analyze what they read and determine what information is valuable and true, and what is bullshit.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       You have to be able to sift through the bullshit and decide for yourself what meaning to take from the evidence that is provided. As a practicing attorney, this is incredibly difficult even for someone with my training, and I'm completely unsurprised that the average person is not capable of doing so.

       That's why I've been subscribed to both sides of the spectrum. To sift through the bullshit. But I must admit that more often then not the trump/ right wing crazy off the wall things prove to be false. But I also frequently come across opinions from left wing media outlets that completely miss the point. But that is the difference. One side lies in opinion things while the other side lies in news segments.

       See how your mind just automatically shuts down what does not conform to the mainstream narrative? Almost like the propaganda that you've been force-fed acts as a barrier against critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The things I linked are odd circumstances, or red flags, around the shooting, of which there are many. They aren't "smoking gun" evidence, and if this really was a Deep State operation then you can't expect to ever find smoking gun evidence unless they screwed up majorly.

       So you just refuted your own evidence. By stating if it was really a conspiracy you wouldn't see these coincidences. You see the logical knot you got yourself in?  There can only be a conspiracy if there are no points of evidence linking to it?

       So. To sum up. Hogg is a crisis actor. The shooter was equipped by... the FBI? And this has all been orchestrated by the anti gun lobby. People who don't like guns... they conspire to shoot up a school... or at least let it happen... to get a kid more Twitter followers than the nra. Or something.

       I get that you're being facetious, but I think its only because your mind has difficulty contemplating anything but the mainstream narrative. I really don't blame you for that, I was that way too, before I started realizing how much they lie to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       And truthfully, I don't know exactly what happened and I would never claim to. Of course I admit that it could have gone down exactly as we are told, but I'm very suspicious. Here is one possibility:
      </p>
      <p>
       They have the goal of disarming the general people, so that we do not pose a threat of eventually rebellion as they continue to infringe on our rights. So they orchestrate a school shooting, because what better emotional appeal could they present to the people in order to convince us to disarm ourselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       So they groom Cruz due to his instability, he will be their patsy. Hogg's father is in on the plan, and Hogg may be as well. They plan an active shooter drill the day of the operation to give them cover in case they have to cancel the operation for whatever reason. Government agents conduct the shooting under cover of smoke bombs, and they arrest Cruz. They threaten Cruz with torture unless he pleads guilty and agrees to never talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other possibilities and variations in what could have happened, but if you aren't able to entertain this idea then I think you're probably in the wrong subreddit.

       If you believe in the NWO (which I assume you don't), disarming the population is an essential part of their plan. It isn't an end unto itself, but it is a means to an end.

Nowadays it is more important to disarm the peoples than to lead them into war; more important to use for our advantage the passions which have burst into flames than to quench their fire; more important to catch up and interpret the ideas of others to suit ourselves than to eradicate them.

        Former YouTube engineer Guillaume Chaslot referred to coordinated campaigns across online platforms to spread a video as “4chan attacks” because such anonymous forums often served as staging grounds for these efforts. YouTube and Facebook have policies against harassment that served as the basis for removing some of the conspiracy theories. But Chaslot said the companies have not done enough to weed out deceptive content.

       So they bring in an expert saying Facebook and Youtube are doing a decent job filtering out content for harassment, but not enough to get rid of 'deceptive content' originating from places like 4chan and Reddit. Implying maybe Youtube and Facebook can only do so much and that the platforms where content originates need to be fixed.

       In the opinions of the rep from YouTube, more needs to be done. The author of the article neither agreed nor disagreed. They never made a statement on whether or not this would be good or bad, effective or not. You made up a concluding statement and put it into the author's mouth.

       you're doing it again. You took a statement and are peddling your own interpretation of it as fact. The only facts contained in that statement were:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        pizza gate was shut down
       </li>
       <li>
        conspiracy and the_donald were also actively involved in discussing pizzagate.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       No opinion on any of this was given.

       As far as you know for sure, those comments are by independent actors with their own opinions. You can't accuse the Washington post of promoting censorship based on comment sections.

       Using that same logic there is no information on this sub that you can't find elsewhere. At least 90% of the posts are direct links to other sites, so there is no information that can not be found on another subreddit or website.

       No, it is a boycott, just like with CNN.

       I do have to say, though, I don't think they deserve it. I think WaPo is garbage, but I read the piece and don't see what they did wrong. They even omitted usernames. I really don't care what they think of us.

       CNN isn't banned, there content is welcome via archive. We just don't support them financially with direct links in the main post. If it bugs you that they aren't getting the revenue we once sent them, send them an email and ask them to apologize for breaking Reddit site rules and promise to never do it again. You are also welcome to go to their site and give them extra clicks to make up for what we aren't giving them.

       Of course I know the difference. A boycott is cutting off financial support. A ban would be not allowing their content.

       Archiving is extremely popular around here. Banning direct links would still completely allow users to post archived versions of the articles. All of the information from WaPo could still be posted here, they just wouldn't get ad revenue. So yes, banning direct links can be boycotting.

       Well, if it's a sub wide rule then you're SoL lol. It's not that big of a deal though imo. The information can still be shared, and that's the important part, we aren't censoring the INFO. Just keeping them from getting money from us.

       You're right, I did not post an article because my question was something of my own thought. They're "targeting us" because of a terrible thing that has taken place on this site. I wouldn't say they're targeting "us," though, unless you identify as one of the people spreading these lies. Although, judging by your response, that wouldn't be that far off...

       How are people supposed to keep apprised of such nefarious intentions if you ban them? You all are proposing banning a media outlet that is a running example of a conspiracy theory. Let people link and if you have a problem with an article and your arguments against it are sound then let the rest fall into place. Can't see what the weather is like outside if you have the curtains drawn.

       For sure, there are always vile people willing to say vile things.  It's interesting they are attacking this sub specifically though.  I haven't really even seen any thing threatening or even mean to them.  The admin stepped in last week and the rules have been no harassment, threats or attacks, and I haven't seen any even before that.  Shit, I was trying to defend this place from users who wanted to Doxx David Hoggs, but he Doxx himself, so it kind of left the admin in a weird situation.

       So you found nothing after all that googling??? Haha. Man you couldn't even find one weak example? How do you get though such self dissatisfaction? You had a chance to come up with a half assed example and feel all "oh I got him," but even with all that temptation you still failed to find

       Sorry Washington Compost, but when someone volunteers to appear on television, they have also given implied consent to be subjected to the highest levels of scrutiny from the public. Due to the fact that the large corporate owned media outlets have abandoned real investigative journalism long ago, it's up to the public to perform the research, which is what we are doing here.

       I didn't see a single call to ban this, or any other subreddit. I only saw criticism of your behavior. WaPo gets free speech just like the rest of you. You shouldn't react by banning them just because you don't like what they had to say.

       No, it isn't "literally calling for conspiracies to be shut down." It's very critical of them to be sure. However, it's hardly calling for their removal or ban.

       That whole piece is aimed at reinforcing the idea of removing conspiracies. It's a big hit at conspiracy theorists, trying to make then look deranged and crazy. If you can't see that then I don't know what to tell you.

       Note how they cherry pick, saying only David Hogg's father being FBI is why people question his intentions, while we all know damn well that David Hogg's previous TV News interview 2 years prior was the reason people started questioning him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article tries to create the narrative that an organized racist campaign orchestrated by 8chan was to blame for people questioning this incident and all of its oddities. How convenient that must be to blame that dastardly 4chan hacker again.

       How are people supposed to keep apprised of such nefarious intentions if you ban them? You are proposing banning a media outlet that you contend is a running example of a conspiracy theory. Let people link and if you have a problem with an article and your arguments against it are sound then let the rest fall into place. Can't see what the weather is like outside if you have the curtains drawn.

       Besides, how have you all missed the brilliant archive function? This is exactly what it is for. Boycott by not clicking the direct link. Want to know what's going in and debate some while still maintaining a boycott, click on the archive function instead. This shit is so obvious it makes me a bit suspicious anyone would argue to actually ban a news outlet. Especially if u believe it is involved in a conspiracy. You guys want to ban all links to official and non-official CIA, NSA, and FBI releases as well? How about political speeches? Media is full of players arguably complicit in conspiracy to one degree or another, you want to ban just the ones that go against your personal politics? That's bullshit and sounds like something a lot of other subs do, this one shouldn't.

       This is not because of my "personal politics". Do you even know what is going on???   They are directly targeting this sub.

       The archive function is a good idea but does not work...

       Ok fair enough, especially about the archive function. But if they are targeting the sub, again, how do we keep apprised? I say post that shit up everytime they attack. If they get a few more clicks from this sub who gives a shit. Archive when it works, tdlr it and discuss how to resist here in the conspiracy sub.

       But you do understand the difference in a ban and boycott now? IDGAF about CNN. But I do care about censorship.

       With every breath. Joel Berg, boychik, I thnk Op-Eds would be a good starting place for you, specifically the ones written by Jews about striking Iran's nuclear reactors circa 2010. That good old Jewish war mongering. Listen, Look, I've been readig WaPo for decades but they didn't become co-opted until c. 2009.

       You're right, I did not post an article because my question was something of my own thought. They're "targeting us" because of a terrible thing that has taken place on this site. I wouldn't say they're targeting "us," though, unless you identify as one of the people spreading these lies. Although, judging by your response, that wouldn't be that far off...
