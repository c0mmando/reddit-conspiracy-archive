<p>They are taking a lot of them down because they aren&#39;t going to sift through literally everything and if some of the good guys had to fall to get rid of the bad guys, they are okay with that stance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube is a private organization though. They are not obliged in anyway to ensure freedom of speech, they simply put forth the content that matches their ideologies and the ideologies of their ad companies. It&#39;s the same with any cable news/local station/paid programming/etc. If you are laying down capital to create the commodity, this case being YouTube as a media outlet, you take part in dictating the rules of the agreement when said commodity is purchased. YouTube has a clear content policy that is pretty much decided by whichever companies pay them for ads, but they nevertheless emplement it horribly when they demonetize and/or remove videos that don&#39;t break any of the rules but are simply about similar topics as videos that do. Examples can be found with comedy channels such as H3H3productions and InternetCommentEttiquette, as well as the mass number of news channels currently being taken down like Bombard&#39;s. </p>

<p>YouTube ain&#39;t shit and it&#39;s all about the money. Even simple google searches won&#39;t turn up any of the fringe content anymore, any video on the first 10pages will be from CNN or ABC - it&#39;s not just YouTube. The more scandals they can shove down our throats the more braindead we can become (especially if they silence opposition to given narratives) until we turn into a monotonous consumer society lied to and fed by our corporate powers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Continuing your poison water example, there&#39;s nothing stopping your customers from switching to a different water provider. They are not forced to drink your water the same way we are not forced to use YouTube. You freely choose to supply content and views to YouTube and their ad sponsors. If you decide that what YouTube is doing doesn&#39;t suite your personal likes, take your money (in this case, in the form of views or content) and take it to another media source. There is no moral regard when it comes to this dude, YouTube isn&#39;t some champion of free speech or creativity. They&#39;re sellouts to the biggest bidder and as soon as they got a large enough subscribing base it all went to shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube when it started was not a champion of free speech this is correct. However they have tried to champion creativiy of videos from thwir inception. However now with it&#39;s very large reach it needs to become just that. In this case we do have the option to switch to another platform but humans are creatures of habit and will not switch. We have so many other laws protecting this kinda of behaviour of humans why not in this case (for example gambling laws)</p>

<p>Back to my water example, what if free water was given out to the point where people could not get other water without vastly changing their lifestyle, what about people in jail consuming this water? Do they now just die? We need to hold companies and corporations (since there people too) accountable for their actions. </p>

<p>Also thanks for sharing your viewpoint! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t find the percentage either. </p>

<p>There are quite a few lawsuits (class action and individual) being filed against Youtube since the purge started a week or two back. One deleted channel was reinstated once the guy got a lawyer, so I imagine these other lawsuits are going to cause a reaction. This is actually a big deal when you think about all the implications.</p>

<p>We are talking about Youtube deleting accounts, often without reason (i.e. &quot;You broke our rules&quot; with no mention of what the channel did.) And they label videos as bullying for questioning in a shooting. Yeah, might not be nice to mention &quot;crisis actors&quot; but an investigation takes you where the truth is. And now we have that story of a very liberal group employing 10,000 people for this Youtube operation. This stinks man. It is like an extension of what we see in the FBI and DOJ... oh wait.</p>

<p>Something is up and my be is we are going to see the ramifications of this over the next few months. Already I notice Titus Frost mentioning he is making way more money on D-Tube, so you might have been on to something regarding moving. (Though it isn&#39;t about the money, it is about getting the message out and that is where the alts have no real ground.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s about the money. Don&#39;t let people used car dealer you. It&#39;s not a problem of free speech, as no one gives a crap that porn is not allowed and never will be there. Nor Isis execution videos. That&#39;s what pornhub or liveleak are for.</p>

<p>Any creator can go to another place, but they simply won&#39;t profit as much (if at all), but they still want to stick to YouTube. Why would that be? Because of money.</p>

<p>YouTube is beholden to the advertisers. The business has huge costs, and they need ads to balance that. And no advertiser wants their label attached to loonies, gives bad rep. Do you think Chevy would want one of their horrible real people ads before a guy calling a teen a FBI plant? Hell no.</p>

<p>S advertisers tell YouTube to clean up their house if they want the checks to keep on rolling. YouTube tags the things the advertisers feel problematic, and demonetises them. If the content is viewed as damaging to the platform, they ban it.</p>

<p>Follow the money and you will find the problem here. You want to say whatever you want and not stick to YouTube s guidelines? Can do so. Easily. Want to make money? Sanitizer your content, and provide things advertisers want to pay to appear in. Want cake and eat it too? That&#39;s not possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is extremely easy to discount your &quot;It&#39;s about the money&quot; point. Many, if not most of these channels, could NOT be monetized. This I know as I watched many of these deleted channels. And why hire a liberal group to be your neutral purveyor of truth? Makes no sense, well, actually it does. Just at face value, it is pretty clear this was a censorship operation (and it is happening across all social media).</p>

<p>So, why did Youtube delete channels (and call it bullying no less), when the said channels did not bully, nor did they have monetisation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the problem with videos like these (I&#39;ve seen a ton) is that they harp on realities that aren&#39;t actually present.  They take one piece of non-conclusive &#39;evidence&#39; and show it the entire video and always come back to claiming that is how it was faked, when in reality, you have little kids who <em>actually died</em> and there is <em>literal proof</em> of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They outright take down gun videos that are like just reviews of firearms and stuff like that. They say it&#39;s because of advertisers but that&#39;s bull because many advertisers dont mind selling to the part of the USA that owns guns. And they could have have segmented markets and whatnot to help advertisers only advertise in markets that they want. Really though YOUTUBE is allied withe the neoliberals and their goal is to turn American into Europe 2.0... BOLLOCKS because America has a chance to be SOOOO much better.. shitlibs are so quick to accept tyranny for temporary security, just like the ben franklin quote, and they dont care to try and make the optimal situation of voluntarist social safety nets... thats why shitlibs never give to charity and right wing christian groups are the only ones that house and feed homeless in the US. They forget that every authoritarian collectivist government has failed, including ROME! It&#39;s sad because one day they will be proven wrong and that will hurt all of us! Just look at the decline in europe and it&#39;s easy to see how unsustainable it is.. some countries there have been in recession since the dot come bubble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube never has and never will be a platform for ‘free speech’.</p>

<p>It is a privately owned profit making company, it’s profits come before all else.</p>

<p>The saddest thing about this is that people in fact view Youtube as being a place where people can speak freely, it never has been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Straight Outta 1984... They are the thought police. This is so anti 1st Amendment it is just ridiculous. Who are they to say what is truth and what is fake? This is beyond upsetting! They have started their own “rating system” and giving tons of channels “strikes.” One of my favorite channels Destroying the Illusion (Jordan Sather) was banned yesterday. He had about 115k subscribers. 
Literally like Brave New World and 1984 on steroids. We can’t stand for this shit. Write your representatives in Congress, write YouTube. Tell them you stand for free speech, freedom of the press. We support the Constitution of the United States of America. We the People will not give up our rights so easily. #donotconsent</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is extremely easy to discount your &quot;It&#39;s about the money&quot; point. Many, if not most of these channels, could NOT be monetized. This I know as I watched many of these deleted channels. And why hire a liberal group to be your neutral purveyor of truth? Makes no sense, well, actually it does. Just at face value, it is pretty clear this was a censorship operation (and it is happening across all social media).</p>

<p>So, why did Youtube delete channels (and call it bullying no less), when the said channels did not bully, nor did they have monetisation? </p>
