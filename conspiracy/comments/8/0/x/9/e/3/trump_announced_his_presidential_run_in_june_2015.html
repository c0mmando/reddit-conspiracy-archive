        The 2013 Miss Universe pageant was held at the Crocus City Hall, Krasnogorsk, a suburb of Moscow, Russia.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/347191326112112640">
        We know that Trump
        <em>
         wanted
        </em>
        to meet with Putin. From 5 months before the pageant:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?
       </p>
      </blockquote>

        Trump bragged about meeting with oligarchs and government officials while he was there:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I was with the top level people, both oligarchs and generals and top-of-the-government people. I can't go further than that, but I will tell you I met the top people," Trump said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/alferovayulyae/status/426103699572678656?lang=en">
        Here is the tweet in question from Alferova Yulya, self-described as "Advisor to the Minister of Economic Development of the Russian Federation":
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm sure @realDonaldTrump will be great president! We'll support you from Russia! America needs ambitious leader!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why would a mid-level government official know about Trump's plan to run a full
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016">
        18 months before he publicly announced his intentions
       </a>
       , unless this was discussed as a possibility during his trip?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/alferovayulyae/status/399867018725568512?lang=en">
        Well, we know she was at least in meetings with Trump:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Waiting for your business to start in Russia, Mr. Trump @realDonaldTrump! @eminofficial #Russia #Moscow

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/399939505924628480">
        Of course, if there was any question, Trump clears that up himself; from the weekend in question:
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I had a great weekend with you and your family. You have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next. EMIN was WOW!
       </p>

       <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/400358801007583232?lang=en">
        And of course he has to Tweet about it again the next day:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/rob-goldstone-russia-trump.html">
        Here is one piece that we know for sure: during this trip the Trump family linked up with the Agalarov's; this is the same family that set up the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Don Jr. and the Russian lawyer:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         the beauty competition in Moscow brought the Trump family into partnership with Emin Agalarov
        </strong>
        , a pop star in Russia,
        <strong>
         and his father, Aras — a duo that develops major real estate projects in Russia and appears friendly with the Kremlin
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then, Emin Agalarov has repeatedly boasted of maintaining a warm relationship with Mr. Trump. And a publicist for
        <strong>
         the younger Agalarov
        </strong>
        said on Monday that it was his client who
        <strong>
         requested that Donald Trump Jr. speak with a Kremlin-connected lawyer during the presidential campaign
        </strong>
        , a meeting first reported by The New York Times.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       EDIT: FWIW Seth Abramson also
       <a href="https://twitter.com/sethabramson/status/933582030327177216?lang=en">
        claims that Trump spoke to Putin over speakerphone while in Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant, and that the call was "incriminating":

       SS: Why did a mid-level Russian government official know about Trump's plans to run for president a full 18 months before he announced it publicly?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Russia agreed to green-light Trump Tower Moscow, and in exchange they would help Trump with his presidential bid so they could have an ally in the White House. The facts above seem to support this theory, otherwise the Russians are incredibly prescient.

       I'm not implying it's a courtroom, I'm just saying that your viewpoint relies on the assumption that information was passed. There have been whispers of Trump running for president since the 90s. It was no grand secret. I am capable of seeing circumstantial occurrences as circumstantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be very well be wrong, but my argument doesn't rely on implying malice in ancillary interactions, as yours does, so that's why I'm leaning more towards this being a simple compliment, while also not stifling discussion of alternate possibilities.

       You’re right that Trump has been thinking of running for a long time. If that’s the case, a plausible theory could be that Russia saw this as an opportunity to help Trump in order to interfere with our elections and politics.

       I'm not sure how much credence I lend her words.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The anti-Trump blogger Louise Mensch, who scooped mainstream reporters earlier this year, excited her followers over the weekend with a nonsensical 92-word post claiming that a sealed indictment – intended by the justice department to “form the basis of Mr Trump’s impeachment” – had already been “granted” against the president over his links to Russia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skeptics noted that criminal indictments are not “granted”; that impeachment is initiated by Congress, not an executive agency; and that Mensch appeared to have misunderstood the supremacy clause of the US constitution, which she incorrectly said meant Trump must be impeached before he could be prosecuted.
       </p>
       <p>
        “This new reality, in which purveyors of fake news occasionally report verified information, reminds us, once again, of how difficult it is to be news literate in our information ecosystem,” said Jonathan Anzalone, a lecturer in journalism at New York’s Stony Brook University.
       </p>
       <p>
        Undeterred, Mensch bullishly said on Twitter on Monday that mainstream reporters “know they are being scooped on the story of the century”.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a series of messages to the Guardian, Mensch denied that she had posted inaccurate stories. “I believe in a free press. People both can and should write whatever they want,” said Mensch.

       Agreed. I personally will only believe it if it can be demonstrated by Mueller, but I will never rule out that it’s a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I dislike regarding arguments seeking to bolster the likelihood of collusion being posts that really only take a surface level look and don’t bother to dive even one layer deep into critical thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that matter I also dislike posts that dismiss the possibility of collusion out of hand for the same reasons.

       Your relying on the assumption that the validity of one set of connected dots affects the validity of another potentially unrelated set of connected dots. I don't think it's low effort or low energy in the least.

       Like I said, I don't discount the possibility I'm wrong, but there is footage of Trump on TV from as far back as the 90s where he discusses running for president. It was no secret he had political aspirations.

       Exactly why some people believe he could have been targeted since the 90s. Not just by Russia, but Israel and any others who want to give him loans to expand his real estate holdings.

       Everyone with a shred of power is a target of Israel, but that's a whole other story, and I suppose it's also redirecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what you're saying, and also acknowledge that there would be a different sort of conversation (from others) if the name were replaced with Clinton, but even still, I'm not defending Trump or condemning the Russian angle so much as I'm saying that this particular piece of circumstantial evidence doesn't prove anything in and of itself, just as I'd say the same if we were discussing Clinton. They're both pretty unappealing people, in more ways than one, and I don't hold either in high regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather discuss what's being said rather than what you imply I'd say under different circumstances, so again I'm defaulting to this being a compliment until I see some evidence (even circumstantial) compelling enough to warrant a change of opinion.

       The conspiracy is supported by the Fusion Dossier which says Trump was being cultivated for 5 years before he ran in 2016. Whether it was successful or not is a different story.

       This is the most damning statement from his own mouth on video IMO. He absolutely showers Putin with praise then very famously said on the campaign trail he never met Putin.

      <p>
       Think about it from a conspiracy standpoint. The economic minister is cheering for Trump? What would an economic minister hope to gain from a Trump presidency. Trump could prove worse than anyone ever on Russia.

       The woman that OP and yourself are claiming to be the "economic minister" was an Agalarov employee, and not an economic minister at all. The post is disingenuous at its inception, and is meant to further sew the seeds of the left/right divide drivel that's been engulfing this sub and preventing meaningful discussion the past year or two.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not coming down on you, but take a step back and try to see deeper. It's not inherently good or bad to want to normalize relations with a major world leader. It's the motivation and intent that should be scrutinized, not the normalizing of relations itself. The action could potentially work to benefit both states. It's far more profitable for the US to keep Russia as an enemy; just look at the current situation in Syria.

       You got the intentions all wrong though. You think that liberals are being racist against Russians or something. I personally wanted better relationships with Russia. Hell, the democrats are on video trying to push "reset" buttons and claiming that Russia being our biggest geo-political enemy as outdated. Now the government is accusing Russian intel of hacking the DNCCC emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about your virtue signal. It's about who took private emails from a political party. Something that I would even view as wrong if it were Republicans who got hacked.

       I never implied liberals were anything, let alone racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my words constituted such, how is pressing a reset button not virtue signaling as well? It was disingenuous as democrats then criticized Trump for not placing stricter sanctions on Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be furious if the Republican's hacked emails contained information as damning as those released in the Democrats'. It's proven active collusion against a more popular candidate on the basis of political promises, and currently being defended as "free speech." Fuck the left and the right if either side feels that's an appropriate way to operate.

       Bernie may have been more popular but the democrats dropped the ball in seeing that. The numbers proved otherwise during the primaries. I wanted Bernie myself but I'm an independent and can't vote in dem primaries.

       They are talking about sanctions put on Russia for the hacking. What don't you get about that?

       So the whole scheme is predicated on building a Trump Tower in Moscow?
      </p>
      <p>
       A tower that never got past a non binding letter of intent?
      </p>
      <p>
       You think Trump wanted a tower in Moscow soooooooo bad that he’d be willing to risk everything he’s built by getting embroiled in the most fantastical political conspiracy of all time?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it’s more likely they saw Trump as an individual that would work more with than against them and also fit the mold of sowing division. They then did their social media scheme to denigrate Hillary and elevate her opposition, specifically Trump once he became the candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       They tried to bolster Bernie too, not just Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       There doesn’t need to be collusion for Russia to orchestrate online trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       There could be collusion, sure it’s possible, but predicated on green lighting a trump tower? That I find extremely far fetched.

       I never said that, as that would mean that I know everything that went on. It seems as though there was an established relationship, which Trump has denied, and it seems both sides stood to gain something.

       If this was simply one real estate deal, then I would agree that this is a witch hunt. This, to me anyway, seems like one piece of evidence that has been uncovered

       Alright my bad if I read too much into it, your comment just made it seem like you placed a lot of importance on the deal. Apologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can agree that it (Bernie support) may have been more borne out of anti Hillary sentiment more than anything else, but then that could also work as an argument against explicit collusion since trump bolstering ratcheted up once he locked the nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think the fact that they organized two anti trump rallies immediately after election pushing to paint Trump as an illegitimate president is a huge huge knock on the collusion angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there’s a handshake agreement on lifting sanctions, you absolutely would not undermine the legitimacy of the guy who’s got to follow through on lifting sanctions. That is actively working against your own self interests and makes zero sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       That to me is the biggest indicator that collusion may actually be a witch hunt and sowing division was the only game. Hillary losing was just a bonus.

        Guardian-2011 Trump Almost Ran
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump ran for president in 2000, Trump explored running in 2011. Trump has been in the news for pondering a run for numerous election cycles. Trump trademarked “Make America Great Again” in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was no secret that he had longed fostered presidential ambitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/russia-troll-farm/553616/">
        Internet Research Agency-2011
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If we know Russia was planning a US disinformation campaign as early as 2014, and had recognized the usefulness of internet information campaigns as early as 2011 then is it hard to imagine officials probed Trump on his ambitions when he was in Russia? No, it’s not. But it also doesn’t prove anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump loves to brag and he had been in the news in 2011 for contemplating running. I can totally imagine Trump boasting to Russian oligarchs how if he ran, he’d win. It’s classic Trump bravado.
      </p>
      <p>
       So does this warrant Mueller looking into, sure, and he is. But it’s also not indicative of anything besides some government guy tweeted something about Trump running for president. I’m sure in 2011 you could locate tweets (from Americans) saying Trump should run because he was pseudo campaigning. That’s how he got embroiled in the whole birther thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump had never shown presidential ambitions before his Moscow visit, then this would be a lot more intriguing. But Trump has been periodically boasting that he’d win a presidential election for two decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boasting you’d win when asked if you’d consider running and outright colluding with a foreign power to ensure victory are two very very different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a long way of saying, I’m not overly intrigued by this in regards to its demonstration of potential collusion.

       I agree with just about everything you said, but that's why I posted this to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What I put together is a lot of circumstantial evidence, with no smoking gun whatsoever. What it does, however, is establish that there seems to have been a relationship that is either more fleshed out than Trump admits, or that has been in the works longer than we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       On it's face, there's nothing wrong with that, and that's exactly why it's so suspicious. You don't deny ever speaking to or knowing someone when the two of you have done nothing wrong.

       Only thing I disagree with is your last paragraph. In politics everything is denied if there’s political damage from admission. This is nearly universal regardless of party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama denied knowing of Hillary’s server despite emailing her “.com” address. You don’t have to be a tech guy to understand .com isn’t = to .gov. This isn’t whataboutism I’m just saying politicians being forthright and honest in the face of political damage is pretty rare and it’s an off the top of my head example. There’s lots of others from the whole email server scandal. Not relitigating the past, just using as an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the very next day after election up until today, every possible effort has been taken to demonstrate Trump is not legitimate and probably outright colluded to rig the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The political climate towards Russia was wrought with suspicion and overzealous accusations based on (mostly) shitty reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not like it was a normal political climate and they just lied for no reason. Any contact (including past contact) with Russia was viewed as damn near proof of treason. I think it’s bullshit whenever politicians withhold info, but I’m not going to entertain that Trump’s campaign/administration is unique in this quality. Denial is the rule, not the exception.
