<p>“A considerable percentage of the people we meet on the street are people who are empty inside, that is, they are actually already dead. It is fortunate for us that we do not see and do not know it.

<p>The Bible also mentions Soulless humans, as do a number of other religions.</p>

<p>Certainly these days it seems like this is the majority. I also think this explains why subconsciously, many people enjoy zombie movies (they&#39;re autobiographies)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but what he means is that they aren&#39;t &quot;dead&quot;, it&#39;s would be better to say that they have not found or made their soul yet. Everyone has a soul, just some have lost track of it and obviously your actions are affected by that. </p>

<p>But on the other side, you could also argue that some souls have left their bodies but from what I understand, they should be able to bring it back through spirituality. Self-realization could be akin to soul-finding. And enlightenment akin to finding the oversoul(soul which all humans come from).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine that we&#39;re in a video game or the matrix.  Some souls decide to play the game, and they are given human bodies to play as.  But in order for the game or the matrix to work properly, there needs to be NPC&#39;s that are controlled by the game or the matrix.  These are “people” that run more like a bot or an AI but look pretty close to real players and you can only really tell the difference if you look really closely over time.</p>

<p>The topic gets muddied because we don’t know exactly what type of simulation we’re in and who’s controlling these programmable people.  Is it the simulation itself?  Is it the CIA with people programmed via MK-Ultra or military grade mind control technologies?  Are souled people still “asleep” and are easily manipulatable so they appear like soulless portals.  Are they cloned bodies being controlled by ETs or humans in control of ET type technology similar to the Grays?</p>

<p>Here is one of the more understandable papers I found (interestingly, the document on the CERN server has the title &quot;the truth is the one thing nobody will believe:</p>

<p><a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/886772/files/0509743.pdf">http://cds.cern.ch/record/886772/files/0509743.pdf</a></p>

<p>If I&#39;m understanding the paper here it shows that cosmic background radiation and the quantum world can interact with each other.</p>

<p>Memories of the collective are distributed across the whole network (humanity) and they are constantly recorded. It&#39;s possible to manipulate these memories (and some groups have been testing it like CERN, the US airforce, DARPA and some US universities.</p>

<p>The CIA have documents on their site that seem to confirm this. Here is one of the more understandable papers I found (interestingly, the document on the CERN server has the title &quot;the truth is the one thing nobody will believe:</p>

<p>I’m not sure I’d say there are NPCs what there are is people with no compassion. If you lack compassion then are you human anyway? If you’re fulfilled by making others suffer then is that really human? If science really has confirmed that we are one consciousness who are distributed to have subjective experiences then if someone hurts one they hurt the whole. Maybe this knowledge is meant to cast light on those that want to do harm others and also make us individually realise that we become dead in terms of being a human being when we do it to others </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m digging what I&#39;m reading so far. I&#39;ve tried to explain this to my &quot;only positive thoughts&quot; friends, they are lying to themselves. Denying the real evils that walk this earth is a dangerous way of thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As long as we keep lying to ourselves based on conditioning, wishful thinking, suppression or denial and believe the lies “out there”, mistaking them for truth, nothing will change. This goes also beyond having a “positive” attitude, where hope can be merely a trap and lie to the self. Believing in lies that are “positive” in appearance (regardless how well-meaning the intent or good-hearted the person) is actually being negative and blocks one’s awareness and spiritual evolution. Being positive can mean acknowledging something negative because it is the truth, seeing it for what it is. If you believe a lie, even if it seems positive and makes you “feel good”, you give away your free will and that has spiritual implications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By recognizing those without do live among, then we can navigate this earth a little easier. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, we’re all one, but we’re not all the same in this 3rd density experience here on planet earth. Sure, Gandhi and Hitler are one, but one of them doesn’t seem to have any conscience. The biggest illusion and projection regular folks seem to have is the assumption that the people in positions of power think and feel just like we all do and if they don’t it is assumed that they are just misguided and lack love in their lives. However, what if there exists a type of human who has no connection to the higher centers of universal love/awareness at all by birth? He/she is not even genetically wired this way, not being able to access it this lifetime around but he/she can emulate and fake these higher characteristics quite well and even distract you from evolving by sapping your energy and feeding off it. They can tell you exactly what you want to hear, appear compassionate, empathetic and understanding without meaning or feeling it one bit. And what if this type of human makes up half of the world’s population? He/she might be even a family member, a co-worker, neighbor, boss or even a close friend, a lover, husband or wife? Certainly not a pleasant thought and certainly a blow to the popular New Age paradigm of “we’re all one and humanity is becoming enlightened just by focusing on Love, Light” and so-called “positive thinking!”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a pretty ridiculous write up, gurdjieff basically taught self realization of consciousness and body movement/body consciousness as a way to deconstruct egotism. He himself never had anything to do with any sort of &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; sperm/blood psychosis rituals.</p>

<p>When he was teaching, there were a lot of different people that came to him to learn and read his materials, but ended up getting into other crazy shit that have nothing to do with what he taught, which in its purest form, is actually just Zen.</p>

<p>That write up is akin to saying that the Fla School shooter once read a passage in the Bible and therefor, the Bible is a predecessor to school shootings</p>

<p>For example here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gurdjieff&#39;s Fourth Way was primarily designed to shock his followers out of their normal state of consciousness which he likened to sleep. This is identical to the description of Abramovic&#39;s Method. What this illustrates is the process of intentionally inducing traumatic shock in viewers in order to take advantage of the impressionable, vulnerable state it creates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Shocks&quot; in his system ranged from a zen koan, to a random scream, to dancing in front of others</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The teacher, possessing consciousness, sees the individual requirements of the disciple and sets tasks that he knows will result in a transformation of consciousness in that individual. Instructive historical parallels can be found in the annals of Zen Buddhism, where teachers employed a variety of methods (sometimes highly unorthodox) to bring about the arising of insight in the student.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gurdjieff#Methods">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gurdjieff#Methods</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote from Abramovic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I looked at different people, like shamans, and I was very influenced by theosophy and Buddhism. So who can be my daddy? I’d like to think of Gurdjieff as my daddy. Gurdjieff mixed with volcano.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what is the context here? Was she his first introduction to mysticism? Notice she also mixes in shamanism, theosophy, and buddhism which is already muddying the waters of what Gurdjieff taught, which is simply the awakening of your awareness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many individuals tied to Gurdjieff (Idries Sha, John G Bennet) are also linked to Tavistock and intelligence agencies in both the UK and the US.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I agree, a lot of folks who studied him, got into some bad shit, but that doesn&#39;t really mean anything other than they were already seeking occult/secret/mystical info, and ended up on the dark side. </p>

<p>Its like you can be a white hat (good) hacker, or a black hat (bad) hacker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pondering this verse:</p>

<p>Joh_6:70  Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t say Judas was possessed with a devil.  It says he is a devil.  Really makes me wonder how many literal devils are manifest has humans walking around who have only one goal and that&#39;s deceiving and dragging souls to the pit with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>heraclitus (c500bc): &quot;Even a soul submerged in sleep is hard at work and helps make something of the world&quot;.  The fragment also goes &quot;The waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside wash into a world of his own.&quot; How does this idea relate people who subscribe to matrix simulation hypothesis? Figure it out, sad fact is: if you are unable to see the souls of others, and convince yourself they are dead inside, then you are the one who really has to do some soul searching because you are the one who is missing it.  This is about being &quot;woke&quot; which is, becoming aware that you get turned into a souless tool by believing in only you and yourself.  Anybody watch Cemetery of Splendor?</p>
