        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys</p>

<p>You may have seen me around here introducing people to the recent developments in unified physics that prove we live in a fractal holographic universe. I run <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> - and you guys always seem receptive to the latest developments in this area, so I figured I&#39;d throw this up.</p>

<p>I wanted to write up a post detailing the latest on developments in theory behind how the EMDrive works, and how it fits into a unified physics framework.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go through the most high level explanation of unified physics -</p>

<h1>Basic Unification Theory</h1>

<p>The vacuum is full of energy, it is a superfluid lattice of light. It is unperceivable unless it is spinning, which is what we see as matter. Matter is space spinning, and space is ground-state light. </p>

<p>Mainstream physics predicts that the vacuum should be absolutely <em>teeming</em> with energy, on the order of 10<sup>93</sup> grams / cm<sup>3</sup> of space. This number is extraordinarily high and so it has come to be known as the worst prediction of physics, the vacuum catastrophe. This is simply because we don&#39;t perceive this energy --- I don&#39;t have to explain to you guys that perception and reality are two different things :p.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t perceive it because it is in a geometric ground state, a geometry that expresses no vectors of force in any direction. This geometry has the capacity to shift, and thus become polarized or active, making it perceivable. The dynamic is similar to the &#39;time crystals&#39; articles that have been floating around. </p>

<h1>Holography</h1>

<p>So - if we take this vacuum energy, which is made up at the smallest level by something called planck units, which have a definitive size, mass, and time as a fluctuation of energy, we can prove the proton is holographic.</p>

<p>If you simply divide the proton by these vacuum fluctuations size and multiply by a vacuum fluctuation energy, you end up with the mass of the observable universe inside of each proton - the proton has a holographic representation of all protons. </p>

<p>Precisely 10<sup>55</sup> grams worth of vacuum energy fit inside the proton, the mass of the observable Universe.</p>

<p>You can then derive the rest mass of a single proton by applying the holographic principle, which postulates that the surface of a black hole can encode the volume. Since the proton has this immense amount of energy, we can treat it as a black hole and apply the equation.</p>

<p>When you do this, by dividing the surface planck units by the volume, and multiply by the planck mass, you yield the rest mass at 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p>What this is stating, plainly, is that each proton has physical access to the information of the entire Universe, but only a very tiny slice is expressed locally as mass, the rest is non-local.</p>

<p>This is because these surface plancks are terminations of wormholes that connect to all other protons. All protons are entangled through this wormhole structure of space, validating another theoretical concept in physics called ER=EPR, which states rather than entanglement being &#39;spooky action at a distance&#39;, it is simply caused by physical wormholes in space.</p>

<p>These wormholes are possible because of the massive amount of energy in empty space - it essentially turns our Universe into a giant singularity (or Bose Einstein Condesate for our physics guys) where instantaneous information transfer can happen across spacetime - in essence, macro quantum entanglement across scale.</p>

<p>At the most basic and fundamental level of reality, you are <em>touching</em> every other point in the Universe. </p>

<h1>The EMDrive in Unified Physics</h1>

<p>Recently Aerospace America released another article that details how they believe the EMDrive may work.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with the EMDrive, it is simply a microwave magnetron inside of a closed can, turn on the microwave and you get thrust, which seemingly violates our laws of physics, because there is no force being pushed out of the engine, there should be no force vectors (i.e. a rocket only moves because of it&#39;s exhaust, no exhaust, no movement).</p>

<p>However, we just have to change our perspective, and that&#39;s what the Aerospace America article postulates.</p>

<p>If the vacuum is full, and entangled, and electromagnetic waves can interact with it, what&#39;s happening is the magnetron is creating a density gradient in the field, just like a boat propellor does in water, and the EMDrive is literally <em>pushing against the quantum vacuum</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Here is thier explanation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the physics behind the EmDrive, White and his team speculate they may be seeing a manifestation of what’s known among physicists as a quantum drive or Q thruster. Such a thruster works on the well-accepted principle that <strong>empty space is not a vacuum but is frothing with fluctuations in quantum fields, with pairs of virtual particles perpetually forming and mutually annihilating.</strong></p>

<p>Based on an interpretation of quantum mechanics known as pilot wave theory, these vacuum fluctuations can be thought of as a dynamic medium that guides, or pilots, individually observed, “real” particles. And as a medium, the quantum vacuum’s constituents can interact and exchange momentum, not unlike a fluid, or a plasma.</p>

<p>As White sees it, the EmDrive can leverage electromagnetic fields to couple with the quantum vacuum and induce a slightly preferential flow in it. “A terrestrial analog to think of is a submarine that sits in the water,” White explains. “It takes advantage of the fact it’s embedded in its propellant.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.aerospaceamerica.org/Documents/Aerospace_America_PDFs_2017/February2017/Feature1_FuelFree_AeroAmericaFeb2017.pdf">article</a></p>

<h1>So what&#39;s pilot wave theory?</h1>

<p>You may be familiar with the copenhagen interpretation of QM, wherein we have all of these paradoxes like light being both particles and waves, the weirdness that comes out of it such as multiverse theory and quantum immortality - because of experiments like the double slit.</p>

<p>However, there is another completely logical, completely rational interpretation of QM that gives all of the same &#39;answers&#39; as the Copenhagen interpretation, without any of the paradoxical weirdness - and it&#39;s called Pilot Wave.</p>

<p>Pilot Wave postulates that what we are seeing with particle/wave duality is simply a <em>particle being guided by a wave in space.</em> Sounds too simple, doesn&#39;t it? A real live wavefunction that has real trajectories. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmC0ygr08tE">Here</a> is a video of someone re-creating <em>all</em> of the weirdness of the double slit experiment using <em>oil drops on top of a vibrating bath</em></p>

<p><strong>Why the fuck aren&#39;t we taking pilot wave as fact?</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s because it necessitates something that is very uncomfortable for physicists, and that is inherent non-locality. Essentially, for pilot wave to work the way we imagine it might, it means the entire UNIVERSE needs to be entangled with itself.</p>

<p>Well - thats what unified physics is finding - the entire universe is entangled and fractally self-referential, it is holographic - the information of the entire thing can be accessed no matter which particle you peer into.</p>

<p>And this is most likely the nature of morphic resonance, mystical states, occult ritual practice, etc - the information of the whole is encoded at every point in space.</p>

<h1>Zero Point and Antigrav</h1>

<p>The EMDrive is, in essence, an anti-gravity device.</p>

<p>There are other scientists who have had similar experiments in modulating gravity through spinning electromagnetic fields, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Tajmar">Martin Tajmar</a> who was able to create anti-gravity through spinning superconducting ceramic, this is in effect the same dynamic as the EMDrive - you are spinning EM fields that end up creating a spin in the quantum vacuum, which creates a pressure/density difference, allowing antigravity effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Following the work of Podkletnov, physicist Martin Tajmar, a professor of space propulsion studies at Dresden University of Technology, produced anomalous inertial effects (generation of small amounts of thrust or momentum) by spinning superconductive tori, as well as spinning superfluid helium. In the experiments performed by Tajmar and his research team, spinning superconductive rings and superfluid helium (both at a temperature of 4 kelvins), produced an acceleration in a laser gyroscope positioned above the apparatus (but not in direct contact with the apparatus). That is to say, the laser gyroscope itself experienced a minute acceleration in the same direction of rotation of the spinning superconductive discs (gyroscopes are used to detect accelerations and changes in orientation)</p>

<p>Interestingly, the effect only occurred when the superconductors and liquid helium were spinning in a clockwise direction, but not counter-clockwise. <strong>Tajmar has theorized that in the Southern hemisphere the counter-clockwise direction should produce an acceleration in the laser gyroscope in the direction of rotation of the apparatus while no similar acceleration will be observed for the clockwise direction of rotation, as occurs in the Northern Hemisphere. This is an important detail, as it is absolutely consistent with Haramein’s amendment of Einstein’s field equations where torque and Coriolis effects are considered. Tajmar’s experiment therefore confirms that the structure of spacetime has Coriolis dynamics present due to fundamental torque as the result of a gradient in the vacuum energy density producing the gyroscopic rotational effects of a body, such as the earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make no mistake about it, our understanding of unified physics will catapault us into the next evolutionary stage of humanity. We&#39;re talking wormhole traversal, antigravity, zero point energy extaction - it goes on and on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, that was really interesting. But the pilot wave theory does not have explain the &quot;observers&quot; effect. Particularly in lieu of the quantum eraser double slit experiment.<br/>
Or maybe it does?? Care to elaborate how you can explain the observer effect in regards to the pilot wave theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Dark Energy</strong>:</p>

<p>First, you have some huge miscalculations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mainstream physics predicts that the vacuum should be absolutely teeming with energy, on the order of 10<sup>93</sup> grams / cm<sup>3</sup> of space. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia, however <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy">says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The density of dark energy (~ 7 × 10<sup>−30</sup> g/cm<sup>3)</sup> is very low</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>So, you are off by a factor of 10<sup>123</sup> there.  </h2>

<p><strong>Spooky Action at a Distance</strong>:</p>

<p>You talk vaguely about this in a way that makes it sound like you think that entanglement allows instantaneous communication.  Of course we all saw the articles over the last couple years about experiments with satellites where they affect one particle&#39;s state on earth, and check its entangled pair in the satellite, and see that it has been affected by the earth particle in an amount of time that is faster than the speed of light.  This does not mean that information has been transferred faster than the speed of light, however, it&#39;s just a quirk of how the test is done.</p>

<p>Particle A is on earth.  Particle B is on the satellite.  By forcing the spin on A, they can affect the spin on B.  Particle C is on earth also.  Particle C is never talked about in the headlines.</p>

<p>To force the state of Particle A, they use Particle C in the procedure.  Then they test C.  The results of the test of C are necessary in order to interpret the results of testing particle B. The results of the test of C are sent to the satellite (at light speed).  Interpreting the results of B is not possible until the satellite receives the results of C.  </p>

<p>So, if you draw causality cones, everything still lines up.  If you ignore the importance of C, then it is possible to imagine that A affected B in an amount of time that was ftl, but it just isn&#39;t true.  Causality is maintained.</p>

<p>You go on to use Spooky Action at a distance to imply that all particles contain wormholes to other particles.  This is not true.  To use the &quot;wormhole to another particle&quot;, you have to transfer information in standard ways that follow the standard rules of special relativity.  The result is that the information is transferred.   Information is obviously different than matter.  We can send information over a radio signal to a satellite, but we can&#39;t transfer a person that way.  &quot;Wormhole&quot; generally implies transfer of matter, and using that word to convey that we can transfer information is extremely misleading.</p>

<p><strong>Pilot Wave</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert here, but you talk as if particle-wave duality is at odds with the pilot wave theory.  This is completely false.  It is a different way to interpret quantum mechanics, not an alternate theory.  It&#39;s just like if everyone else solves a homework problem using Cartesian coordinates, but you convert to polar coordinates, solve it, and convert back and get the same answer.  You haven&#39;t proved the other people wrong.  You&#39;ve just proved that there is more than one approach.</p>

<p><strong>EMDrive</strong></p>

<p>All the serious discussion of EMDrive is regarding one question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is the amount of energy that is unaccounted for within the experiment within the limits of instrument error or not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally, the answer is either: </p>

<ul>
<li>A: &quot;Yes it is within the limits of instrument error&quot; or </li>
<li>B: &quot;It&#39;s a bit more than we expected, but probably still within instrument error.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount of energy that would need to be measured to validate the theory is billions times greater than the amount measured.  </p>

<p>At one point a lab that had also done work for NASA in the past decided to tackle this.  They stated that B was what they found.  Sensationalist articles were written saying &quot;NASA has validated EMDrive theory&quot;, when the result could not be further than the truth.</p>

<p>** Zero Point Energy  (ZPE) or ZPM (for Zero Point Module)**</p>

<p>These are great for scifi shows like Stargate: Atlantis, but of course those are only fiction.</p>

<p>ZPE is a tech that we can&#39;t prove as impossible.  We know from Casimir effect that energy is available.  We don&#39;t have a frickin&#39; clue about how to harness it yet, but it&#39;s still possible that maybe in the future it will be possible.  </p>

<p>100 years, will we have limitless energy?  I think it&#39;s quite likely.  ZPE is a possibility, but we have no idea how to get from where we are to that point yet.  Fusion is probably a more likely possibility.  We know that there is essentially limitless energy available by fusion, the tricky part is getting the energy costs of containment down to a level that is lower than what we get out of it.  We know it is a hard problem, but not an impossible problem.</p>

<p>So, unless your theory about ZPE comes with an approach that can be used to harness that energy, you aren&#39;t really providing anything new.</p>

<p>I am not off, our observations don&#39;t line up with what quantum theory predicts. </p>

<p>This is known as the vacuum catastrophe / cosmological constant problem, and yes, it&#39;s the largest discrepancy in all of physics. </p>

<p>This is still a very real unsolved problem, and the theory that I am writing about solves it.

<p>The solution to the proton mass, as can be seen in <a href="https://resonance.is/wp-content/uploads/QGHM.pdf">Quantum Gravity and The Holographic Mass</a> hypothesizes this relationship. This is also precisely what Pilot Wave hypothesizes - that everything is part of a single quantum wavefunction, non-locally. </p>

<p>Again, if the enormous energy density of the vacuum is real, it allows for a quantum foam structure wherein distant coordinates are connected through a type of Wheeler wormhole network (that massive energy would be curving space immensely), and that&#39;s precisely the theory being put forth. </p>

<p>Ah, yes, I misunderstood you.  Yes, this is one of the largest discrepancies in physics. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t understand quantum mechanics well enough to fully grasp that side of the discrepancy.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll look into the HIUP paper you linked at some time later (I don&#39;t have time right now).  If it really can solve this problem, then you are right, it would be the biggest news in Physics.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to imply that ZPE is only science fiction.  I was saying that harnessing it is science fiction.  I actually thought I was pretty clear about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not buying a lot of what you&#39;re saying here.  I thought it was pretty much accepted that changes in spin states of entangled pairs happened instantaneously. It&#39;s just that there is no way to communicate this between observers at superluminal speeds.  I don&#39;t think that precludes the idea of entangled protons being possible.    </p>

<p>A wormhole could transmit matter or information, the only difference being that information would likely be easier to transmit. I don&#39;t think he is referring to a standard hypothetical wormhole here, more that in the &quot;zero-point&quot; dimension(s) that underlie holographic spacetime, all particles can be connected because there is no &quot;spacetime&quot; to separate them.  </p>

<p>To me it seems that the pilot wave theory must be at odds with wave-particle duality, because what happens to the pilot wave when the wave function collapses?  I thought that was the whole point of the double-slit experiment, observation collapses the wave function.  </p>

<p>There are currently satellites using EMDrive propulsion, so how can it be instrument error? The EMDrive is already producing thrust, that&#39;s why they are using it.  </p>

<p>Not trying to be argumentative, you seem to know what you are talking about, mostly just looking for clarification on your points and to learn more as I love this subject.</p>

<p>When we read the state of one variable, we say that it &quot;sets the state&quot; of the other variable, but that&#39;s not really the case, that&#39;s just our interpretation of what we are seeing.  This article here tries to explain it in more simple terms:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/entanglement-made-simple-20160428/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/entanglement-made-simple-20160428/</a></p>

<p>If you want to skip over a lot of it, that&#39;s ok, but go down and read the last example, where they talk about 3 cakes being read as either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; in such a way that no matter how you take the measurements of the 3 cakes, the number of evil cakes is always odd (ie. 1 or 3).</p>

<p>This is essentially the scenario that the satellite experiment is using.  Cakes B and C are on earth, while the satellite has cake A.  By reading the states of B and C, people on earth know what results the satellite will get when it reads A.  Does this mean that a message has been sent instantaneously to the satellite?</p>

<p>Many of the pop science articles say definitively &quot;yes&quot;.  If B is good and C is evil, then we are forcing that A will be read as good (since an odd number is always evil).  The problem is that we didn&#39;t know before reading B and C that their results would be good/evil.  So, we &quot;sent a message&quot; but we didn&#39;t control the value of the message.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s say we do the experiment 10 times simultaneously.  We have 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, etc on earth, and the satellite has 1C, 2C, 3C, etc.  We are reasonable sure (1023 out of 1024 times) that one of our 10 experiments will result in a good cake at the satellite, and <em>good</em> is the message we want to transmit.  So, we read our 20 cakes, and find out that 3C (at the satellite) contains the value we wanted to transmit (true).  The satellite reads 3C as true, and our &quot;message has been sent instantaneously&quot;.  The quotes here indicate that there is a great big caveat.  That caveat is that even though the satellite has read our &quot;true&quot; response instantaneously, it can&#39;t act on it. It doesn&#39;t know which of the 10 cakes it holds contains the correct response.  It has to wait until we send a message using traditional means that &quot;cake 3 contains the message&quot;.  </p>

<p>In spite of the caveat, there have been many pop science articles saying that &quot;the message was sent instantaneously&quot;.  In truth, the experimental part of the message was read instantaneously, but the instructions on how to interpret the result was not sent instantaneously, and those instructions are <em>absolutely necessary</em> to send non-random information.   So, causality is maintained.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Are you thinking of ion drive?  Ion drive is in use.  For example Dawn (the spacecraft that visited Vesta and Ceres) used ion drive.</p>

<p>I found one article that had a headline that sounds like it is saying EMDrive is being used:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/china-is-claiming-it-s-already-started-testing-an-em-drive-in-space">&quot;China Claims It&#39;s Already Started Testing an EM Drive in Space&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But as you read the article you realize that &quot;testing&quot; means that it is in a little box in a micro-G environment on their space station and they are playing around with it.  Testing does not mean that they have it strapped on a satellite, and that it is pushing the satellite around.</p>

<p>This EMDrive is a curiosity.  It&#39;s a box that if you look at it, it seems to do nothing.  But if you look really really really close at it, then you can&#39;t tell if it is actually doing nothing or if it is slightly moving on its own.  If it is slightly moving on its own, then it is violating the laws of physics as we know them, and if our laws of physics are wrong, then who knows what is possible.  Sure, we can extrapolate that and say &quot;if a little bit of energy is available for free, then we can make a limitless amount of energy available for free&quot;, but this experiment that we currently have doesn&#39;t do that.  It&#39;s basically just a boring dead box.</p>

<p>If our laws of physics are flawed as badly as proponents of EMDrive claim, then they should be able to produce one of these suckers that produces enough thrust that it won&#39;t be mistaken as instrumentation error.  We haven&#39;t seen that, so being skepticism is completely called for here, given that they are saying all the laws of physics are wrong without giving any alternative theory of how it works other than &quot;something something random motion something&quot;.</p>

<p>While I think the holofractal stuff is interesting, the absence of rigorous understanding of basic physics concepts like mass, energy and density is off putting and undermines your broader theory to anyone with more than a tv doc understanding of physics.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t &#39;my value&#39;. This is the basic vacuum energy expected value of quantum field theory, and the fact we believe we don&#39;t observe it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not there - it all depends on the vacuum structure, which is currently unknown. </p>

<p>We think that the big bang signifies the &quot;start&quot; of the universe, but it is more like the core or underlying framework of the universe. The universe didn&#39;t start compressed to this density and explode outwards from a single point, this density is underlying all matter at all times. We just attributed it to a &quot;before&quot; state because we can&#39;t observe it in any other way.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be unfathomably massive because the system is holographic -- each individual &quot;node&quot; has the information of the whole system, ie. the entire &quot;universe.&quot;</p>

<p>The best way I can describe it is:</p>

<p>The universe is like a graphics engine using light to render matter, but it only renders what is &quot;observable,&quot; determined through interacting systems on any scale causing interference &quot;feedback.&quot;</p>
