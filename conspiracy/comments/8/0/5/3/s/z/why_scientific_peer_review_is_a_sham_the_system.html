    <div class="md"><p>The peer review process is demonstrably broken, and we&#39;ve reached a point where &quot;science&quot; has essentially been weaponized.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peer review is a form of censorship, which is tyranny over the mind. Censorship does not purify; it corrupts…There is a lot of junk science and trash that goes through the peer review process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Australian physicist Brian Martin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do [scientists] have to gain by spending time helping an outsider? Most likely, the alleged discovery will turn out to be pointless or wrong from the standard point of view. If the outsider has made a genuine discovery, that means the outsider would win rewards at the expense of those already in the field who have invested years of effort in the conventional ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Researcher David Sackett sums it up nicely when he observed that &quot;progress towards the truth is impaired in the presence of an expert.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Marcia Angell, the former Editor-in-Chief at the New England Journal of Medicine, had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Kaplan, a professor of pathology at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, has stated that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peer review is broken. It needs to be overhauled, not just tinkered with. The incentives should be changed so that: authors are more satisfied and more likely to produce better work, the reviewing is more transparent and honest, and journals do not have to manage an unwieldy and corrupt system that produces disaffection and misses out on innovation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mathematician and physician Dr. Marc Girard explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason for this disaster is too clear: the power of money. In academic institutions, the current dynamics of research is more favourable to the ability of getting grants — collecting money and spending it — than to scientific imagination or creativity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peer review is, according to Richard Smith writing in Peer review in health sciences,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thought to be slow, expensive, profligate of academic time, highly subjective, prone to bias, easily abused, poor at detecting gross defects, and almost useless for detecting fraud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article continues by quoting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Journals have devolved into information laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry”, wrote Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, in March 2004. In the same year, Marcia Angell, former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, lambasted the industry for becoming “primarily a marketing machine” and co-opting “every institution that might stand in its way”…Jerry Kassirer, another former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, argues that the industry has deflected the moral compasses of many physicians, and the editors of PLoS Medicine have declared that they will not become “part of the cycle of dependency…between journals and the pharmaceutical industry.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally, in the words of John Ionnidis, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most scientific studies are wrong, and they are wrong because scientists are interested in funding and careers rather than truth.</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>All peer reviewed really means is that you convinced 3 other people that your paper is good enough to publish. Having been on both sides of of the peer review process, I know that many professors asked to review a paper typically pass the job to a grad student in their lab. It is impossible to know if a paper has false data, the reviewer simply has to trust that the experiments were actually conducted and the data is presented as is. Unless something is extremely apparent, no one accuses anyone of fraudulent science, so bad stuff slips into the scientific literature.</p>

<p>A problem to be sure. Most of us will just be lazy and continue to trust untrustworthy sources. Those with more diligence and Intelligence will look for other sources to support the scientists or debunk them, as the case may be. This is one case where skill at research would be most useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The process of peer review is being actively revised, though probably not to the extent that people would like. For example, the recently created journal Elife was supposed to solve some of the problems with peer review. One very beneficial addition to the process is a requirement (I think it’s required) for the reviewers to convene in a conference call to discuss their critiques of submitted manuscripts. This allows reviewers to criticize each other. In other words, this makes it a lot harder for reviewers to be unfair, either positively (i.e. help their friends, or promote conclusions that benefit them) or negatively (by suppressing information that contradicts them or scoops their friends). In the absence of this type of oversight reviewers are essentially anonymous and can really screw over work they don’t like, even if it’s solid work. Picture anonymous comments on any internet message board. </p>

<p>All this aside, peer review works reasonably well most of the time. Don’t forget, that this article has a particular perspective and that there are legitimate counterpoints. Science is complex, and it takes time and hard work to get to the truth. Peer review is imperfect, but still, over time the truth tends to emerge. </p>
