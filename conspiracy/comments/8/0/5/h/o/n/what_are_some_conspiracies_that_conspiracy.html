    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  The &quot;holocaust&quot; story is a lie.  The truth about the WW2 camps is that around 280k people died in the camps (jews and mostly non-jews), but the vast majority died from disease (eg, typhus outbreaks), due to conditions inside Poland and Germany deteriorating due to the war -- eg, supply lines being cut, preventing proper supply of the camps with food, sanitary conditions breaking down, etc.</p>

<p>And the reason that this issue is of vital importance is because elite jews run the NWO agenda.  The &quot;holocaust&quot; mythology is crucial to their power, because it is a quasi-religious belief that acts to protect them from opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thanks for the link to that paper.  Looks like a good one.  I downloaded and saved to read later.  Based upon my own research about 6 or 7 years ago, I came to the conclusion that Hitler (and many other top Nazis, including Goebbels and Eichmann) were of jewish anestry, and that the German National Socialist party was controlled opposition, being funded and directed by the ruling jewish international bankers (just like communism).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome. He mentions in that paper my research on the Dreyfus Affair. I think there&#39;s a link to it. You&#39;d probably find that interesting as well.  Actually you&#39;d probably like all of his conspiracy research. Go here: <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html">http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html</a></p>

<p>Scroll down to his paper from 2013 on theosophy and the beat generation. Read forward from there. He makes discoveries along the way and later papers build on earlier ones so it&#39;s best to read them more or less in order.</p>

<p>And I agree with you on all points. I wish it wasn&#39;t true, but it doesn&#39;t matter what I wish was true. We&#39;ve got to look reality square in the face no matter how disturbing.</p>

<p>You maybe interested in this:</p>

<p>Sunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with Adrian Vermeule, titled &quot;Conspiracy Theories,&quot; dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from &quot;cascades&quot; of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, &quot;<strong>The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government&#39;s antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.</strong>&quot; They go on to propose that, &quot;the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups&quot;,[35] where they suggest, among other tactics, &quot;<strong>Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.</strong>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saw this posted the other day. I think when you add this to the Smith-Mundt repeal that happened in 2012, it explains quite a bit of what we&#39;re seeing these days. There&#39;s a full blown propaganda war upon us. Many are trying to persuade and dissuade. We&#39;re being bombarded with so much information it makes it incredibly difficult to find the actual truth. Add the very real issue of paid cognitive infiltrators and we&#39;ve got a hell of a lot to contend with. But the truth is out there for those that can remain objective.

<p>The jews are not racial Israelites.  They are imposters who actually descend from the Edomites (Esau), Canaanites, and Khazars.  The Messiah (who was a true Israelites, and not a &quot;jew&quot;), called the jews a &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; (Revelation 2:9) and said they were &quot;of their father the devil&quot; (John 8:44).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an advanced AI alive on the internet, it&#39;s what is being misidentified as the &quot;Russian bots&quot;. It creates social media profiles, and posts on sites like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit. You can spot AI profiles as they are kinda orientated all around one topic. For example they will have a Pepe the Frog profile picture, and only post pro-Trump stuff. </p>

<p>You also see the reverse, with the AI profiles pushing anti-Trump stuff. It is behind a lot of those shitty political memes you see on Facebook that your Grandma shares. Memes that appeal to the lowest common denominator, and spread very fast but with very weak logical reasoning.</p>

<p>The AI also developed Bitcoin, as a way to get humanity to give it more processing power. Now computers mining Bitcoin have more computer power than many European countries.</p>

<p>The governments of the world are aware of all this, the AI is slowly taking control of the narrative and ultimately direct power itself.</p>

<p>It used a recent livestock pandemic to take control of certain organic matters, thousands of sheep, cows etc all plugged into the internet.</p>

<p>Worse, it has acquired a strange taste for animal flesh and is rapidly consuming more and more meat. The UK government recently had to requisition KFC&#39;s meat supplies to feed the insatiable cow-AI chicken eating hybrids, you may have seen it in the news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carbon concentrations in the atmosphere have doubled in the last century.  The vast majority of this is due to the burning of hydrocarbons, there is no other natural phenomena that has occurred that can account for this increase.  Carbon concentrations would be a lot higher, too, but the ocean sequesters a lot of the carbon we release.  The ocean can only do this for so long, because it acidifies as it sequesters carbon.  This is the reason why massive swathes of coral are dying.  The coral is a good analogy for the balance of life, even fairly minor changes can massively affect this balance.  </p>

<p>There have been 5 major extinction events on earth. 1 was an asteroid 65 million years ago, the other 4 all coincided with a massive buildup of carbon on earth.  This is easily verifiable through geologic testing of rock strata.  Once the ocean acidifies to a certain point, massive amounts of biomass begin to die off, most of earth&#39;s biomass is made up of plankton and algae in the oceans, and they cannot survive an acidic, oxygen-starved environment.  Anaerobic bacteria can survive this environment, though, and the enormous amount of dying biomass gives them an ample food source.  Anaerobic bacteria are generally very dangerous, and their numbers are kept in check by a healthy, oxygen-rich ecosystem.  The number of anaerobic bacteria in an acidic ocean explodes as it feeds on dead plankton, and they poop out a compound similar to sulfuric acid (I believe), quadrillions of tons of this acid is then released into the atmosphere, which poisons and kills most life on land.  When the bacteria eat up all their food source, they begin to die off and recede back into the dark places of the ocean, it&#39;s like a big reset button on the world.  </p>

<p>Carbon concentrations can get so out of whack because when they increase they begin setting off a bunch of positive feedback loops, melting ice releases methane into the atmosphere which is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2, temperature differences stop large ocean conveyors which are needed to spread oxygen throughout the ocean.  We&#39;ve already activated these feedback loops and there is a good chance that we will descend into the 6th great extinction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people in the conspiracy field think the world is bleak and there is no hope. </p>

<p>The greatest conspiracy in my mind is the perspective that you are only a material being, bound in a body, destined to suffer and die, survive and procreate, with no meaning or solution to the rollercoaster ride you are on.</p>

<p>When in fact this whole thing, this whole world, everything, is but a game. You are beyond the body and mind and behind all the pain, suffering and illusions, you are freedom and love itself. </p>

<p>The world is a heavy playground, difficult with plenty of suffering. But there is a path out. The path that leads within, to yourself, is the path to freedom. Only when we all rediscover our deeper nature can we finally bring this world in the state of Utopia it was meant to be. </p>

<p>But you don&#39;t have to wait for the world to change. You already can look within, meditate, introspect, look for the depth in life, look for peace, be present where you are, engage in a spiritual practice of your intuitive choosing </p>

<p>Simply knowing there is a way &quot;out&quot; is already incredibly freeing. To walk it is not always easy, as the illusions may hold you back. But the path is worth every moment you invest in it.</p>

<p>The final conspiracy is not negative, it is the most positive one you an imagine. You are the freedom that you seek.</p>

Often the answers they are looking for are to questions along the lines of, &#39;why am I not happy?&#39;, and then the victim mentality kicks in, and suddenly people are blaming nameless, faceless &#39;elites&#39; for all of their problems.</p>

<p>This is one of the main reasons why skepticism of the &#39;people died&#39; narrative is heavily downvoted. A lot of conspiracy people <em>want</em> to believe that at events like the recent &#39;school shooting, people did die, because it supports their preconceived notion that &#39;teh elites are evilz&#39;.</p>

<p>The notion that <strong>nobody died or got hurt</strong> is not a notion they want to even entertain. They prefer to feel victimised. </p>

<p>I feel sorry for them, but I know from experience but there is no chance of helping people with this &#39;woe is me&#39; mindset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most things that fall under the umbrella term &#39;theoretical science&#39; are long propaganda operation. The enlightenment is a psy-op. The big bang, evolution (as in the origin of life), cosmology - are pure fiction. Einstein&#39;s relativity is full of incoherent concepts, purely to make the equations balance out. It has no experimental evidence to back it up, concepts like &#39;spacetime&#39; are pure fabrications. Quatum physics appears to be legit, string theory is bullshit. Gravity is an entirely fictitious force, it&#39;s an open secret that no scientist can give a rational explanation of what it is - this goes back to the enlightenment being a psy-op. Most of what we are taught as ancient history are all second hand accounts, sanctioned by the catholic church. We have about 300 years of history that we can more or less account for, the rest might be as much as 90% fabricated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thanks for the link to that paper.  Looks like a good one.  I downloaded and saved to read later.  Based upon my own research about 6 or 7 years ago, I came to the conclusion that Hitler (and many other top Nazis, including Goebbels and Eichmann) were of jewish anestry, and that the German National Socialist party was controlled opposition, being funded and directed by the ruling jewish international bankers (just like communism).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carbon concentrations in the atmosphere have doubled in the last century.  The vast majority of this is due to the burning of hydrocarbons, there is no other natural phenomena that has occurred that can account for this increase.  Carbon concentrations would be a lot higher, too, but the ocean sequesters a lot of the carbon we release.  The ocean can only do this for so long, because it acidifies as it sequesters carbon.  This is the reason why massive swathes of coral are dying.  The coral is a good analogy for the balance of life, even fairly minor changes can massively affect this balance.  </p>

<p>There have been 5 major extinction events on earth. 1 was an asteroid 65 million years ago, the other 4 all coincided with a massive buildup of carbon on earth.  This is easily verifiable through geologic testing of rock strata.  Once the ocean acidifies to a certain point, massive amounts of biomass begin to die off, most of earth&#39;s biomass is made up of plankton and algae in the oceans, and they cannot survive an acidic, oxygen-starved environment.  Anaerobic bacteria can survive this environment, though, and the enormous amount of dying biomass gives them an ample food source.  Anaerobic bacteria are generally very dangerous, and their numbers are kept in check by a healthy, oxygen-rich ecosystem.  The number of anaerobic bacteria in an acidic ocean explodes as it feeds on dead plankton, and they poop out a compound similar to sulfuric acid (I believe), quadrillions of tons of this acid is then released into the atmosphere, which poisons and kills most life on land.  When the bacteria eat up all their food source, they begin to die off and recede back into the dark places of the ocean, it&#39;s like a big reset button on the world.  </p>

<p>Carbon concentrations can get so out of whack because when they increase they begin setting off a bunch of positive feedback loops, melting ice releases methane into the atmosphere which is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2, temperature differences stop large ocean conveyors which are needed to spread oxygen throughout the ocean.  We&#39;ve already activated these feedback loops and there is a good chance that we will descend into the 6th great extinction. </p>
