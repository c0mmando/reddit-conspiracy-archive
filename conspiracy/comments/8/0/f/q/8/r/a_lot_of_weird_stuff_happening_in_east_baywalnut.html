       Here is a picture of one of the SUVs I saw on delivery. I couldn’t get a picture of the side,  although it was clearly evident, because I was to afraid to get too close.
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/o7kzV">
        https://imgur.com/a/o7kzV
       </a>
       . This is an unmarked NATC vehicle except for the NATC logo. No plates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work in my car, so I am on the road a lot and see quite a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday, one of our major traffic lights was out, except it was not flashing. It was just red on all sides and the police were running around everywhere. Mostly sheriffs but also local Walnut Creek police also.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I wait at this light which normally takes a few moments, and I’m sitting there for 20 minutes trying to make a delivery, I look to my right and I see literally 12 cop cars, at least three ambulances and several firetrucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also see people laying all over the sidewalk which is bizarre, and also others sitting there on the curb as if they are stunned. There is a damaged vehicle there, but something just didn’t seem right. Especially since Police seemed to be running around doing fake things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well since that time yesterday, on our local website which would usually post a story if the police fart, there is no word of this major horrific accident that looked as if 12 pedestrians had been mowed down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn’t think anything of it until today, when I see there are sheriffs EVERYWHERE. Again, I drive for a living, so I know the difference between end of the month quota and a swarm of cops. Especially when sheriffs are few and far between here. It’s mostly police. But, it doesn’t end there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, today, there are black SUVs driving around like mad. I mean like they can get away with murder. They have lights installed and NO PLATES. I don’t mean government plates or weird plates. NO PLATES, all black, completely black tint, and lights on grill. The only thing on them is a government-looking logo that says NATC.
      </p>
      <p>
       These SUVs and especially these logos have never been around this area before to my knowledge. I am in a car in the east bay area and in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, nearly 10 to 12 hours a day. I have never seen NATC. I googled it, and it seems to have something to do with the Navy. But these guys are literally driving around like mad even in front of cops burning through lights in and violating just about every rule of the road without any consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just figured I’d post this here in case any weird shit happens in the next week or so. I see anything else I will edit the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I post this I’m hearing sirens everywhere right now. Anyway I apologize if this is difficult to read, I’m talking into my phone as I’m driving and I will try to edit it better when I get home. If you seen anything weird in the East Bay area by all means please post.

       One of the black SUVs was on my ass earlier and then tried to  go around me and then took off like a bat out of hell and only then did I noticed the NATC logo. I wish I had time to get a picture but I’m going to be on the lookout for sure.

       If you drive for a living, you need a dashboard camera! They're

       and they record 5 minute videos, writing over the oldest ones when the SD card gets full. Bonus, they are handy in situations like this where you saw something interesting and want to take a second look.

       On a side note, I received a text and phone call last week asking me to head over to WNC to help with a missing person.  I live on the peninsula and work in SF, so it was kind of odd, especially because everyone I know didn't receive anything.  Did you get anything like that?

       It sounds like they're doing an exercise then. They do a lot of training with law enforcement, security etc. For them to be acting like assholes in traffic and the cops don't do anything gives a bit of insight into how much clout some private security firms have.

       What was the Navy be training them in? That’s my question. Especially when it seems they’re just running around crazy running red lights and speeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I shit you not I just got in an elevator at my next delivery and who gets an elevator with me? A sheriff. There’s definitely some kind of weird training or grouping of sheriffs going  on, but these unmarked black vans really make it strange. We might see one or two sheriffs cars a week around this place, and I’m seeing groups of three and four at a time everywhere, and even get into an elevator with one.

       I don't think this has anything to do with the Navy. Lets take the Navy out of the equation if thats the logo you saw. The black SUVs are owned by the security company (NATC) and it sounds like they're doing some bullshittery with the cops.

       Some other people are mentioning an announced ICE raid. I wouldn't be surprised if Trump hired a firm like Blackwater to round them up. After all, Eric Prince is the brother of his new Education Secretary.

       More likely it's an Israeli company with a CIA contract to stage terrorism domestically via US-Mexican immigration.  Why do I say that?  Because US law officers are going to Israel for special training, and they're being required to read books about Hezbollah-sponsored terrorism across the US-Mexican border by Israeli authors.  Here are some of the books I'm talking about:
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss/138-1599917-0015132?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=hezbollah+us+mexican+border+terrorism">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I first heard about this non-existent terrorism several years ago by people who were required to read this stuff.  It's been several years since and I keep wondering what's the pay-off?  When does this operation finally go down?

       Why didn’t you just ask him what was going on? If he denies it, then it’s sketch, if he says it’s a training exercise, then ok, still sketch though.. don’t be afraid to ask people questions.. sometimes they might slip

       We just had a sheriff come into our store and ask to use the bathroom after that. I’m not paranoid but fuck this shit
Keeps getting weirder. No one ever asks to use our bathroom and a sheriff does on the day they are everywhere and I just made a snide remark to one of things being strange last two days?

       Sheriffs have there regular places to use restrooms, especially diners and coffee houses. Unless they were popping in to speak with someone, or were posted up outside for some reason, its very strange to wander into a store to use the restroom.

       In WC especially, since people in that area dont want to see the hired help where they shop.

       I work as a courier in Northern nm. 
Every now and then I'll see groups of undercover, unmarked police respond to situations that require extra help. If there's an situation going on that's blocking traffic, I usually check waze or dl a police scanner app so I can keep updated on whatever is going on. You may be able to listen in on whatever they're up to.

       I also drive around the Bay Area for work 10-12 hours a day. Haven't noticed anything too unusual except last night I heard police sirens for seriously over 30 minutes straight in SJ.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not unusual to hear them at night as they drive by, but these sirens persisted for at least a half hour. It was so unusual I downloaded the police scanner app to see what the hell was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I heard was information about a car chase, so I guess that would explain it.

       You have to be playing.  I gave my father, a 60 year old veteran with zero tech expertise my old dash cam a year ago and he had it up and running within the hour.  It’s literally just one cord and an SD card.  It ended up saving his ass when he was in a hit and run accident later in the year and the cop who responded gave HIM the ticket.  He would have been fucked had it not been for the video!  Also, they are less than 20$ online now, get one ASAP!

       Officials in East Bay alerted yesterday that ICE raids are planned for this week. The activity is probably associated with the operation. On the scale of operation described, I've be surprised if it was only ICE going in there. We're likely to see a mix of agencies operating in the mix for different purposes.

       Military contractors and military are used to driving erratically and blowing through stop lights (to avoid attacks/ambush).  There was a recent story between Jocko Willink and Leif Babin (two ex Navy Seals) in which they described blowing through Las Vegas stop lights during a training mission.  Jocko (the commander) didnt tell his men to "go easy", so they treated the exercise exactly like they would overseas (that is, dont stop at stop lights).

       that is a politician looking to stir up issues and get attention. I live 15 mins from Oakland and have yet to hear of one ICE raid or sweep. I have a good friend who works at the border patrol who coordinates a lot with them, And he says that she’s full of shit.

       Occam's Razor...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I also see people laying all over the sidewalk which is bizarre, and also others sitting there on the curb as if they are stunned. There is a damaged vehicle there, but something just didn’t seem right. Especially since Police seemed to be running around doing fake things.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds like an emergency/mass casualty simulation. Which explains the next point:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Well since that time yesterday, on our local website which would usually post a story if the police fart, there is no word of this major horrific accident that looked as if 12 pedestrians had been mowed down.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If it was a simulation, then there would be no report.

       But why would they need a damaged car with its undercarriage ripped Sitting there attached to a tow truck. It towed truck which I might add was there from the very beginning and may have totaled the truck there. Because I was at one light and someone I know was it the opposite side at another light stuck there and neither of us ever saw tow truck arrive.
