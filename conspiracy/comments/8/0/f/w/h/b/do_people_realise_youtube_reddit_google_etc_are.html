You do realize that right? Like you don&#39;t need to bend over to corporate interests and just let them do whatever they want free from criticism and push back. </p>

<p>You are going to end up with advertisers controlling the internet, just like they control the content on television and we will all be worse off of that continues to happen. The direction this is all heading is not a positive trend for anyone.</p>

<p>We are losing the public discourse to corporate and political (political not government) pressure.</p>

<p>Also, 1984 takes place in a corporate state government, so more or less, this could be one potential outcome of shifting infringement on speech to corporate monopolies that are legally allowed to restrict speech and shape the discussion towards their interests. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just something that they can do, but it&#39;s also a shitty thing that they can do. Just like taking down someone lost dog poster is a shitting thing to do</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a constitutional matter, I agree with you. </p>

<p>The first amendment applies to the federal gov.</p>

<p>The 14th applies the 1st to states.</p>

<p>There is no precedent applying the 1st to private companies EXCEPT: (and here is the kicker) a recent case that may go to the Supreme Court soon called knight institute v. Trump which is paving the way for Twitter accounts to be declared public forums. If the court were to decide for knight institute, we may soon see other forums and possibly even google declared a public forum.</p>

<p>Aaron Swartz co-founder of Reddit:</p>

<p>&quot;I think all censorship should be deplored. My position is that bits are not a bug</p>

<p>That we should create communications technologies that allow people to send whatever they like to each other.</p>

<p>And when people put their thumbs on the scale and try to say what can and can’t be sent,</p>

<p>we should fight background - both politically through protest and technologically through software&quot;</p>

<p>No, they&#39;re being sued because you can&#39;t install software on your device without going through their app store. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but legally you can make the case those sites have a traffic monopoly as high as 80% so other sites are legally considered irrelevant.   You don&#39;t need 100% market share to be a monopoly, you just have to prove the alternatives cant compete with a company that has 80% of the business.  So if you delete my video,  and realistically I have no where to go to get near the same audience I can sue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow nice like 4 threads today on how we shouldn&#39;t care about censorship. It&#39;s about the principle, why is this so difficult for you smooth brains to understand?</p>

<p>No shit it&#39;s not violating the first amendment, you really figured that one out for us! The first amendment is a part of the Constitution, as &quot;law&quot;. Being anti censorship is a principle. It is concerning to people who value free speech and expression that the social media companies (the current dominant means of communicating) are so quick to silence speech, as it is telling of where our culture and values are headed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chickasaw, Alabama was a town privately-owned almost in its entirety by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation. They charged a woman with trespassing for handing out religious literature in front of the post office, and the case eventually was raised to the level of the Supreme Court. It wasn&#39;t just any small case, either. In a 5-3 decision by the court, it was decided that the more a private entity opens and invites others onto its private property for public use, the more the rights of the individual circumscribe the private rights of the corporation which owns the property.</p>

<p>Read up on Marsh v. Alabama. It&#39;s a fascinating case.</p>

Are any of them receiving government subsidies? Does that make any of these companies a government supported monopoly?

<p>It ceases to be yours if you:</p>

<p>(A) Allow public access to it, AND
(B) Promote it as &quot;free&quot;, AND
(C) Make profit from advertising based upon the increased viewer count that you derived from falsely advertising it as free.</p>

<p>When people invest time based upon your assertion that your notice board is free...then they acquire the right to use the board you formerly owned.  They are not taking your property right...you are donating your property right by making a false claim...which is your right to do.  What you are not allowed to do is lure people to your board with false claims and then exploit them by saying &quot;tough shit&quot; that you spent all this time designing your notice and advertising it and bringing more people...because fuck you and I&#39;m keeping all your viewers.</p>
