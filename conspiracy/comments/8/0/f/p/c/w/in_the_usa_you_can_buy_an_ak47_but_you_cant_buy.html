<p><strong>It&#39;s completely legal, and easy, to walk into a store and buy an AK + ammo, but it&#39;s illegal to buy sex.</strong></p>

<p>How is that acceptable? A free society would allow both, and I hypothesize we would have <em>less</em> gun violence if people could easily get laid.</p>

Doing a background check for a prostitute is aa bad as is getting a gun with the ease of going to a prostitute is. Now that I think about it. These things are nothing alike</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People can see the advantages of legalizing it, even republicans probably, but there&#39;s no political will to legalize it, as it would crush careers. &quot;Family values&quot; man trying to legalize prostitution? Good luck on that re-election!</p>

<p>There maybe some truth to the idea that the government keeps prostitution illegal to oppress people, namely women of colour. Can&#39;t let them empower themselves and make money with their bodies, threaten the status quo of the European Beauty standard and the money made from the established beauty industry. </p>

<p>Gotta keep poor women down, can&#39;t let the (legal) labour force contract, if people had a way out of the workforce they wouldn&#39;t be taking minimum wage jobs, on a precarious hand-to-mouth check-to-check living. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point of reference followed by my two cents. You actually can’t just buy an Ak-47. You can buy a semi auto version of it, typically referred to an SKS, but they’re intimately different. You can buy a fully auto AK after you pay for a stamp from the feds that costs a lot. So, fundamentally it’s about money and collectible revenue. At this point prostitution is not legal, but if it were, there would be a fuckload of tax on it....pun intended. </p>

<p>I own both and they took less than an hour to buy. I&#39;m not talking about full auto, which is, as you said, gated by tax stamps and a high prices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you although I don’t reallly see the correlation. However as a woman, I for one think legal prostitution should be legal and I’m not sure why it is so frowned upon. I’m not talking like disgusting motel sex. However legitimate businesses, with girls (or guys) whom have papers that they are tested and clean, with protection enforced, as well as legally taxed. If that was a viable field in my younger years before I was in a committed relationship I may have gone into it and enjoyed it. Sex is usually a pleasurable thing for all involved, it would help take a lot of girls off the street, it may help sex trafficking numbers, who knows. However in America loving sex is frowned upon even though sex is constantly thrown in our faces. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because for something to become legal first you need a way of monitoring it. Once that is done, then you need legislation. If prostitution went legal that means that sex traffic would be so much harder because all sex workers would have to have special papers and permits and doctors documents etc. 
Imagine how many rich people would lose their money, from that, since sex traffic would be reduced. We cannot allow rich people to get poor now can we?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People can see the advantages of legalizing it, even republicans probably, but there&#39;s no political will to legalize it, as it would crush careers. &quot;Family values&quot; man trying to legalize prostitution? Good luck on that re-election!</p>

<p>There maybe some truth to the idea that the government keeps prostitution illegal to oppress people, namely women of colour. Can&#39;t let them empower themselves and make money with their bodies, threaten the status quo of the European Beauty standard and the money made from the established beauty industry. </p>

<p>Gotta keep poor women down, can&#39;t let the (legal) labour force contract, if people had a way out of the workforce they wouldn&#39;t be taking minimum wage jobs, on a precarious hand-to-mouth check-to-check living. </p>
