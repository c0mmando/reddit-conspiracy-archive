       Our media is teaching us (or trying to) that theorizing of any kind involving governments or tragic events is psychotic or mentally unstable. In fact, the opposite it true. The mainstream media is CAUSING mental illness in our populations by teaching us to turn off our intellectual abilities. It causes people to switch off their pattern recognition. The truth is, every human alive should be using their intellect to create theories of the world around us, REGARDLESS of what we're taught by authority. Now I'm not saying that every theory is always 100% correct. But persons that do not have ANY theories are without a doubt 100% brainwashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most conspiracies boil down to one simple fact — some humans will do anything to keep power, and that power corrupts. We've built a world where our societies are BUILT ON conspiracies/lies/coercion/murder/evil. Every human should be a conspiracy theorist, because to not be one is to be is to allow evil to control us.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate, what we're being taught is that conspiracy theories = mental instability. Truth is the direct opposite. They are causing metal illness by teaching everyone to accept without question authority.

       Same here, it sounds bad but all I think of when I hear conspiracy theorist is lack of real fact checking/sourcing and no clear guidelines to follow, people just jump on a biased bandwagon most of the time instead of looking for the truth.

       Because there are forms of philosophy that don't rely on logic and "relevance" exclusively to make arguments and insights into the human condition. Anglo-American philosophy, for the most part, has it's foundations in Wittgenstein and truth-value of propositions. It's useful, but it is only a tool, and has led to a bunch of bad philosophy, like Daniel Dennet's oeuvre.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, for example, humor is part of our lives and it is completely illogical, but it can make relevant and meaningful points about existence. It can more artfully tear down an argument than the most logically cohesive expressions.

       Interesting. I have spent my entire (admittedly not too long yet) life interested in philosophy and never before bumped into the term "Anglo-American philosophy". I'm still not sure how important your distinction is. The process of learning to be a critical thinker does not require one to work on perfect material - finding faults and learning to have your own thoughts instead of internalizing someone else's thoughts is the whole point.

       There's a split between Anglo-American and Continental schools of philosophy since WWII. It may not be as big of a deal as it was in the 90s when I went to school, since so much of continental philosophy has been denatured and become the basis for things like various forms of critical studies. Basically Anglo-American is interested in truth and truth values, whereas continental is interested in power and structures of power. Again that's a very basic explanation.

      <p>
       No, we should study all the forms of rhetoric and how they are used them to persuade others. Focusing on "relevant and logical" alone is not critical thinking, in fact, it's a ghetto of thinking, that misses the forest for a particular tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic is a tool that can't be applied to most human emotion and feeling, you know, the passions that drive us.

       Now if you want to switch that "and" to an "or" your statement would be more open-ended.

       I'm not sure if that's really true. The term conspiracy theorist has been weaponized since at least the mid-60s as a response to those questioning the JFK assassination official narrative. Before that, the term seems largely to have not had much widespread use at all.

       Whats worse is they are also saying subtly that conspiracy theorist = leak supporter = espionage. Or my favorite, that conspiracy theorist = mentally unstable = potential terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will push laws to shut down critical thinking under the guise of protecting people from those who have wrong thoughts...have wrong thoughts? Think things incorrectly = things the government told you not to think.

       "Those who subscribe to conspiracy theories may create serious risks, including risks of violence, and the existence of such theories raises significant challenges for policy and law. The first challenge is to understand the mechanisms by which conspiracy theories prosper; the second challenge is to understand how such theories might be undermined. "
      </p>
      <p>
       "Some conspiracy theories create serious risks. They do not merely undermine democratic debate; in extreme cases, they create or fuel violence. If government can dispel such theories, it should do so. One problem is that its efforts might be counterproductive, because efforts to rebut conspiracy theories also legitimate them. We have suggested, however, that government can minimize this effect by rebutting more rather than fewer theories, by enlisting independent groups to supply rebuttals, and by cognitive infiltration designed to break up the crippled epistemology of conspiracyminded groups and informationally isolated social networks."

       When has it ever been the government's job to say what is true and what isn't? In the near future free thinkers will show up as red on minimaps...they have been targeted for centuries and the cycle continues. Just sometimes we enjoy our time in the sun. Then for a time we must accept living underground, it seems...

       ...that certainly is a part of it, and those on the inside will learn to hate those on the outside. Group Think is a tool used to abuse other groups. My worry is for those on the inside yes, but more prevelant is my worry for those of the outside, who have and will continue to be abused in the name of security, justice and freedom.

       Honestly, when you look at the rapidly inflating income and wealth inequality both globally and domestically, it's kind of irrational
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to suspect that literal conspiracies (such as political corruption, corporate trusts, undermining the labour movement, etc.) are playing a significant role. People don't become obscenely wealthy on the labour of others

       Most of Las Vegas non commercial real estate is sitting empty purchased with cash from people from the far east who profit from operating slave wage labor factories.
      </p>
      <p>
       They inflate the price of real estate for the working class with money they made off the backs of people who are ready to work &amp; live within the factories in many instances.

       Well put OP!!  The deluge of school shootings recently and the media’s coverage/opinion of it has been a live re-enactment of Orwell’s 1984. Up is down, War is peace....from something as vital as causation to small points such as definitions of vocabulary have been disturbing. It all starts with us. My kids are taught to question everything they’re told by authorities. This can be done in a thoughtful way. Formulating your own opinion is what makes us intelligent animals.

       Absolutely. What I’m about to say is something I have no written sources to verify but it’s an intriguing thought nonetheless. I have a source who told me that Orwell is Illuminati.  He stated Orwell wrote 1984 not as a warning about a dystopian future to avoid, but as a “how to” textbook. Let that marinate for a while.

       Haha I don't think so, even if that is funny. You would never come to this conclusion if you simply read his other works. I would start with Burmese Days and Homage to Catalonia. Orwell was just another of the greater seers of this era IMO.

       Burmese days is a great book. Never read the other one.  I agree he was genius and I hope it was truly a warning. Like I said an interesting thought if nothing else.

       What I find funny is that we’re just supposed to believe the official story with poorly hashed together “evidence” from people that won’t share the bulk of the evidence, but definitely don’t believe any alternate theories.  It comes off very much as “Just trust us”, when they have so much evidence hidden away that could clarify everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally understand not believing Conspiracy Theories hook line and sinker, but lets just stop suppressing all the information and let the public decide for themselves.

       Understanding the role of the media, how it manipulates information and how to define and recognize these tactics are important parts of an education that not everyone receives.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have people that struggle to think outside of the boundaries they've established for themselves and/or have a limit on their understanding of the world and how it all operates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every human being privy to these skills would mean there's no conspiracy. Not everything under the sun is a deeply entrenched conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all an impossible task, hence we will never have closure. The best thing you can really do anymore is use the info to inform how you and your loved ones live life.

       A proper sentiment. At the fringe, some ‘theorists’ may be unstable. But even their thinking can help pinch through deception.

       Also, even if most theorists are unstable, at least we’re not psychopaths, recent activity on this sub notwithstanding.

       Well what happens when you’re depressed and anxious BECAUSE OF your knowledge and your theories about how the world works? I truly hate humanity and the life we’ve created. I wish I didn’t though because then I’d probably be happy and motivated to live. I agree that we should question information we get, and that they’re saying everyone who’s against them are seen as mentally ill, I recognise this. But I don’t think you’re gonna feel better/not be mentally ill because you make theories about conspiracies - it has made me worse.

       The issue is, most of you aren't actually open minded. You are just as closed off, only on the other side. You reject everything about the official story, just as others reject everything about the conspiracy stories.

       What I think is interesting as a non conspiracy theorist is that it's weird as hell that David Hogg was interviewing someone at 9:32 (whether AM or PM) about gun control, and yet that doesn't hardly get any attention. That's the only thing close to a concrete oddity, and it doesn't get any attention here. Why?

       Definitely. I was just banned from history for making some comments on their newest holocaust page. Not even remotely acidic comments either. Apparently, everyone on the history reddit knows the truth about a war they neevr experienced. The fact is if you don't speak up for your freedom and speak for yourself you won't fucking have any in twenty years time.

       Exactly.  But life, like poker, is a game of incomplete information.  You take what info you can get, you piece together a story that makes sense, while simultaneously taking into account that your opponent is deliberately trying to deceive you, and you make a bet.  Poker is a game of skill.

       There's not much of a cushion between "there's something wrong here" and "holy fuck the world is corrupt as fuck" as you go down the rabbit hole. Those less prepared to learn the truth go mad with the weight of the depth of the world because it goes much deeper and further than their small collection of systems they've borrowed from the media machine can ever possibly handle without catastrophe.

       I'm not sure if that's really true. The term conspiracy theorist has been weaponized since at least the mid-60s as a response to those questioning the JFK assassination official narrative. Before that, the term seems largely to have not had much widespread use at all.
