       Christ sacrificed himself for all of our sins. Lucifer, bore the mark of Cain in sacrifice to our sins. Christ died for our salvation. Lucifer lives to be blamed by you whenever something of your doing does not go well in life. Christ holds our love and sins on his shoulders. Lucifer holds our hate and sins on his.

       If you mean Tyre, then it's possible it's a double meaning. "Lucifer" also means light bringer, but that could be due to Lucifer's initial status as the angel of angels.

       No.  People add their own layers to rationalize away the parts that don't make sense to their worldview.  The bible is actually a pretty straightforward tale of an evil "god" who hates humans, women, revels in genocide, infanticide, blood sacrifices, hates women, and chose a "favored" family to oppress goy at every turn.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all in there.  You just have to peel off the layers of cognitive dissonance to see it.

       But there is a deeper meaning even in what you are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people claiming to be the Jews aren't the real Jews, they are twin brother of Jacob, Esau.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prophecy is said that they would control the world until the messiah comes back and then they and all other 17 nations must be repaid a debt from God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucifer is the spiritual God of Edom. This is why at the false churches they touch little boys. Because they worship a different God of the Bible. The regular population of course could never believe this because they hide behind the actual story while practicing something different all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jacob worships YHWH
      </p>
      <p>
       Edom worships Satan that is to say the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find any law in the Bible and you will find why our leaders perform and train into us mentally the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that time is almost over now, the signs given to those who understand can see that we are near the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole Bible is written for the struggle between the seeds of these two brothers, Jacob and Esau.

       That sounds nice 'n all, except that you made it all up.  There is literally nowhere in the bible where any of that is recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you enjoy fan fiction, and want to make up stories about the bible stories, that's fine.  Everybody's got their hobbies in life.  But don't pretend it has any basis in christian or jewish doctrine.  Taking a couple of common characters from the bible and making your own story about them isn't biblical.

       I do.  That's the problem.  You just assume I didn't, and that I'd believe you, that your own story was also in the bible.  It isn't.

      <p>
       Jacob is recorded in the bible, so is Esau.  The other characters, and everything else you wrote about them is completely imagined.  Not in there.  You're welcome to show me otherwise.

      <p>
       Lucifer is not in the Bible?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Isaiah 14:12-17 King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
       </p>
       <p>
        13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
       </p>
       <p>
        14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
       </p>
       <p>
        15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As we can see, the spirit of Lucifer is something to be in. It's those who rebel against YHWH, the God of the Israelite's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning the understanding of Edom being the nation that was set to rebel against God is also mentioned in the Bible;
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Malachi 1:4 King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and,
        <strong>
         The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As we can see, God hates this group of people particularly out of all nations on the face of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Romans 9:13 King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved,
        <strong>
         but Esau have I hated.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, God mentions his hate for this prideful people, who think they can be like Gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, see that Lucifer is just the spirit of Rebellion. Which is why it was used for Tyre as well, even though he was a son of Ham.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more obvious clues;
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucifer is the
       <strong>
        LIGHT BEARER
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Illuminati are the
       <strong>
        ENLIGHTENED ONES
       </strong>

       Who sits at the top of the so called Illuminati?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Rothschild
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What does Rothschild mean?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Red Shield
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Who was born Red?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Esau
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From the Apocrypha (1611 KJV version, later removed due to obvious reasons).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2 Esdras 6:9
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “For
        <strong>
         Esau is the end of the world,
        </strong>
        and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So Esau is will be in control at the end of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's literally not a secret, they even make fun of it.

       Lucifer is a spirit to be in. Let's ask the Luciferians.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the FREE MAN SONS (a modernized white wash of the originals) worship Lucifer.

       Lucifer is the spirit of rebellion against God.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Here's the verses you left out, to make it look like "Lucifer" was a separate character. (verse 3 seems kinda important, no?)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those verses are for Israel not Lucifer.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I presented was the Isaiah's understanding of watching his oppressors fall thinking they could be like God. They thought that they could ascend to the clouds to be like God. This is a prophecy that has not yet happened yet. This is what the nations will be saying in their minds as they watch the most powerful nation of people to ever rule the earth fall from their earthly position of heaven (kings/queens of the earth) like lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucifer again, is not real, he is a spirit to be in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted a video so it's clear what the doctrine entails. It's a spirit, not a person according to the Bible. The name matters not, it's intention is to detail adversaries of God. Again, what did the demons say when he asked the name?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark 5:9
      </p>
      <p>
       9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Who is the adversary of God?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Satan.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What does adversary mean?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Opposite
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Opposite is another word for what?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rebellion.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Being in the spirit of Lucifer is what?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Being in the spirit of rebellion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Malachi 1:4
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down;
        <strong>
         and they shall call them, The border of wickedness,
        </strong>
        and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Understanding that Edom is the BORDER OF WICKEDNESS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this understanding is no secret. The white washed Freemason's believe to be free, they must oppress the lost tribes of Israel because they know God is real. Thus they understand that their power is to believe in the opposite of what God tells the Israelite's themselves them to do.

      <p>
       Again, as I mentioned before, it's already implied that this would be the nation of people to carry the torch of Cain.
