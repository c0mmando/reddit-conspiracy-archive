        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not sure people realize how weird this situation is.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.intellihub.com/teacher-grazed-by-parkland-shooters-bullet-shooter-was-in-full-metal-garb-helmet-face-mask-bulletproof-armor-shooting-a-rifle-i-never-seen-before/">He was wearing full body armor + face mask + helmet</a></p>

<p>He had to have already been dressed in it while he was in the uber that took him there since it would be physically impossible to put on full body armor between the time he arrived and when he started shooting (~1min). 
Why would an uber driver pickup someone wearing full combat gear and a duffle bag?  Much less drop them off at a school in session?</p>

<p>Not to mention the <a href="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mXgSWhFd.vp2fTkVTqAYYQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/355f951da0861a9e0cd54851975e1b21">images of him being taken into custody</a> shows him not wearing any gear. 
This means he had to have gone on his shooting rampage, change out of all the tactical gear, and then go try to blend in with the crowds.</p>

<p>Both sides of the story can&#39;t be true. </p>

<p>All very weird by itself. But then we have the victims media anti-gun spree (a la sandy hook), the surge in anti-conspiracy theory talks, and the immense focus on banning guns as a solution (why not focus more on the case?) just makes this all pretty eerie...</p>

<p>If you consider &quot;fishy&quot; being multiple witnesses telling different stories every event in the history of mankind is fishy. No two people interpret or recall things the same way. Add in the life and death nature of these incidents and the stress that causes, I would consider it fishy if everyone told the same story.</p>

<p>I have experienced this in a way many times. In the military we would de brief after each shift and discuss situations that came up, how they could have been handled differently etc. It was more often than not that people, who were in the same room, during the same incident, for people to recall and interpret things differently.</p>

<p>Yep, everyone with a valid objection or question is some super secret agent. </p>

<p>Really? People give WILDLY different versions of eyewitness events. This has been tested and proven thoroughly, never mind anyone with a little life experience has probably experienced it personally.</p>

<p>Or you might ask yourself why only one person has seen this SWAT gear? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>first off, only one witness has claimed he was wearing body armor. So I doubt the claim to start with. Other clues in the witness description make it sound like she doesn&#39;t know what she is talking about when it comes to guns and armor. </p>

<p>But the story does mention that Cruz hid a bag with extra ammo at the school ahead of the attack. If he was wearing body armor it would seem as though he would have also dropped that off beforehand.</p>
