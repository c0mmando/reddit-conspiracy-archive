    <div class="md"><p>There was a post on here a couple days ago showing that the plane was flying around at the time, but there was also a comment pointing out that this isn&#39;t unusual and the plane isn&#39;t just used for ebola response. It flies pretty regularly for medical transport and other uses. If someone remembers the tail number of the plane, we should be able to confirm how often it is airborne, correct? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe &quot;host swapping&quot; weapon? Aren&#39;t Ebola and Zika both hosted by primates as well as humans? No way we&#39;ll ever know though without finding this guy alive. In whichever case, all of these new genetic weapons are frightening as fuck, as bad or worse than nuclear weapons. But unlike nuclear weapons, there&#39;s no international treaty on gene editing yet, and even if there were, it wouldn&#39;t prevent cheating or the dark market. There&#39;s actually an incentive to for states to do it if for no other (moral) reason than planning a defense.</p>
