    <div class="md"><p>I was hoping someone would ask this. </p>

<p>I’m not completely sure. I had a dream about it last night and Day dreamed about it during a church service this morning so it’s been on my mind all day. Here’s what I would do. (Keep in mind that I’m currently and E-5, a Sergeant in the US Army. For some reason in my dream I developed telekinesis <em>and</em> telepathy. So we’ll go with that. Psychic God.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Immediately demand to be promoted to Major from the US government so that I could lead special forces on my missions.</p></li>
<li><p>Converse with Trump and military generals to gage who was on the people’s side and who was corrupt. For simplicity sake, assume Trump and generals good, Congress bad. </p></li>
<li><p>Develop my powers to the point of godhood. If it takes years, so be it. If the power comes suddenly, then leap into action. </p></li>
<li><p>Eject <em>all</em> nuclear weapons into space; all of them. Either keep them on the Moon (or since that’s kind of dangerous, perhaps another place like a Jovian moon) or just destroy them in space. </p></li>
<li><p>Tap into the world’s communication systems and broadcast all countries military and scientific secrets for all eyes to see.</p></li>
<li><p>Round up pedophile priests, corrupt politicians, satanist leaders, CEOs, etc and prosecute them in the capitol building with my team by my side for security (though I don’t really need them at this point. </p></li>
<li><p>Lift the Capitol Building and perhaps the entire National Mall thousands of feet into the air while the trials are conducted on live television. Have people decide on the internet whether or not these people should be executed. Due to their crimes, it is likely the public would condone execution. Carry out the executions of 100s-1000s of the NWO puppet masters. </p></li>
<li><p>Show off my powers a little bit before retreating into the wilderness of China, never to be seen again. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Leave the world free from corruption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Telekinesis is possible because of a different dimension. The objects are moved by forces from that dimension. Entities in that dimension help certain humans out that way. So, see, you can&#39;t possible cultivate it - unless you&#39;re in contact with said creatures from that other dimension. </p>

<p>That is precisely how all &quot;magic&quot; came to be; entities from that dimension following the intent/words/mantras/conjuring/etc. of humans. The reason people think they can do magic if they have &quot;pure intentions&quot; is due to the lack of understanding of the role the other dimension and its creatures play in ours. </p>

<p>Magic is real, telekinesis is real, but we can not perform any of them without assistance. The assistance comes at a price. Be careful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pure intentions are not needed, just as a gun can be used to saved a loved one from harm...or kill them.  However, it seems karma <em>does</em> exist, and what comes around goes around, as they say - so whatever you put out into the universe (be it possible bad actions through telekinetic abilities or whatever else) you will ultimately get right back to you sooner or later.</p>

<p>All that said, while there is in fact a great deal of potential in the human mind that is to an absolutely massive extent not used on this planet, and although I don&#39;t doubt that some individuals (now and throughout history) can be/have been telekinetic, I don&#39;t imagine there are too many humans from Earth that have telekinetic abilities at this time.</p>

<p>Yes.  It&#39;s absolutely possible.  Our understanding of existence is <em>very</em> limited, to say the least.  There is a great deal that is possible, and that even we ourselves with all our limitations and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qJYwfAju8">&quot;channels that are closed off&quot; (purposefully and otherwise)</a> can do now and today which we don&#39;t/aren&#39;t doing.</p>

<p>YOU wish to learn how YOU can move things with your mind. For what gain? To impress others or yourself? Unless your intention is to solely use those qualities for altruism towards others, I think it will remain elusive to you.</p>
