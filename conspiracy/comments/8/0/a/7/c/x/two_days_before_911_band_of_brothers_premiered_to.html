    <div class="md"><p>In logic, the technical use of the word &quot;implies&quot; means &quot;is a sufficient circumstance for&quot;.[citation needed] This is the meaning intended by statisticians when they say causation is not certain. Indeed, p implies q has the technical meaning of the material conditional: if p then q symbolized as p → q. That is &quot;if circumstance p is true, then q follows.&quot; In this sense, it is always correct to say &quot;Correlation does not imply causation.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>However, in casual use, the word &quot;implies&quot; loosely means suggests rather than requires. The idea that correlation and causation are connected is certainly true; where there is causation, there is a likely correlation. Indeed, correlation is used when inferring causation; the important point is that such inferences are made after correlations are confirmed as real and all causational relationship are systematically explored using large enough data sets.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its an interesting idea and it is true that WW1 and WW2 unlike the Korean and Vietnam wars are heavily marketed to young men. Just think of all the video games made about WW2 compared with those of the Korean/Vietnam wars. They also had a hard time recruiting because the economy while not its best did not shit the bed yet. </p>

<p>However 9/11 on its own without any marketing help was all that is needed to recruit a lot of young men into the military. A HBO show compared to almost 72 hours of constant coverage including fake attacks like reports of one of the bridges in NYC with a truck found on it with explosives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember watching the first episode of BoB.Completely forgot all about the show after Sept 11.  It wasnt until several years later that I watched the rest of the series.</p>

<p>It was a case of &quot;Watch a real war on tv? Or a reenactment of one?&quot; 
Guess which show I picked.</p>
