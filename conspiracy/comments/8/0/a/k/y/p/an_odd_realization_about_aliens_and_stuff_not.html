       People talk about aliens, elites, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       One consistent trend within the last 100 years has been the total disregard for each other, love, our ecosystems, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be someone trying to hurt humans over time, not immediately, it seems like someone is purposely manipulatively destroying our genetic bank to try to get us to go over to being a more technological based life form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is trying to destroy the genetic bank of Earth, and wants us to reform, to lose our emotions, to lose out biology.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may be malevolent or benevolent but in all honesty, it is likely a VERY BAD THING. It seems that we are electromagnetic beings that live on a specific frequency that is "excitable", there may be other types of electromagnetic beings that have a slower frequency/not as emotionally tuned/less biological than us trying to do this so we could possibly be "of use" or "approachable".
      </p>
      <p>
       Wifi stops plant growth, they have saturated the air with radiation and vibrations, they have poisoned the land with aluminum and other toxins (things don't grow properly in aluminum), the ocean has been irradiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our air is poisoned with aerosols and other various electromagnetic devices. Our Land is poisoned. Our ocean is dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth can easily sustain more than 20 Billion people who put a small effort in each, we aren't even close to the amount of people we could "truly" hold, and we are also at a great birth decline, so things are leveling out. There is no way our actions are powerful enough to result in the things that have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Humanities greatest mistake was introduced to us somehow, nuclear fusion, and it was immediately designed in a destructive manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is designed this day and age in a destructive manner, people act in a destructive manner, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we are being manipulated forcibly through biological/and other means to become more genetically damaged, resulting in us having to rely on technology/or something else for some specific reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       END.

       Side node, anyone know how one can astral project? I have tried all online guides, they suck, tried the hemi-sync from the Gateway-Voyage thingy, nothing seems to work.

       There is a conspiracy theory that states the moon is a alien satellite that beams a signal towards Earth. And that the signal scrambles our thought process just enough to turn us into shit-heads.

       many reasons: pollution, vaccines, public education, msm, food, politics are all dumbing us down at the same time.  also what op wrote, just with different words: i see that absolutely everything is weaponized against us. no rock is left unturned.

       It's also the way entertainment (tv shows, films, games) are edited. They get faster and faster every other year. Recently some new american cartoons have become SO fast paced not even teens or the kids can coherently follow them, they are edited/cut so fucking fast. They speak faster and faster, with camera cuts everywhere. And it has been consistently getting faster. A lot of cartoon critics have been talking about it recently, it's getting way too ridiculous now. If you thought modern TV was fast in 2007-2014, wait until you watch new TV.

       sugar is a massive problem. Alzheimers is a metabolic disease like diabetes, and it starts decades before it's diagnosed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought I was eating reasonably well, but after awhile I developed a habit of drinking a bottle of apple juice a day. I almost never drink Coke, but one day a can of Coke was sitting on my desk, and the bottle of apple juice. I compared the two, and the apple juice had more sugar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I immediately cut all liquid sugar out of my diet. Black coffee, zero calorie flavoured carbonated water, a bit of lemon juice in water, stevia flavouring, or a particular brand of coconut water that only has 11g of sugar. That's all I drink. It took about a year, and very slowly the pounds started melting away. My mind became clear; my chronic pain issues from old injuries and inflammation became more manageable. Then for about 3 months I started working around my house doing maintenance, and doing some rust removal and repairs on my car, so I was doing 1-3 hours of hard physical labour a day and the pounds just started dropping off. I think, you kind of need to lose the fat stored in the muscle first, so it's not so obvious, before your body starts burning the fat stored under the skin.

       this has always been an issue i've had with darwins survival of the fittest BS... yeah maybe up to a point but once a species does enough to sustain itself like ours has at a certain point "bad apples" dont need pruning the rest of the tree just ignores them until they fall on their own accord

       Educate yourself with an open mind and try to see the connections between us all and All. Everything is energy, think of the ways some are literary trying to keep you in a low vibe and distracted. Try to see how they are using your own energy and fears against you and us all.

       Not a huge fan of David Icke, if he was soo accurate, he would have been silenced/or changed his stance slightly/dramatically or would be killed off, although there may be some things that are accurate of which he speaks, I just stay away due to the stigma associated with him.

       Cycles man. I think we all can agree that energy or vibration can not simply vanish into thin air, that is simply not possible. I want you all asking yourself what happens with the energy that is stored in animals specifically brought up for meat consumption? What energy goes into the milk that most of us are drinking when you repeatedly rape and steal away calf's from mothers? How many eggs did you eat in your lifetime and what were the circumstances that the eggs came from?
      </p>
      <p>
       Without getting into the immense pumping of antibiotics into the animals and feeding them improper food (corn to cows mostly as it is government subsidized and "cheapest solution").
      </p>
      <p>
       We can all blame fingers across the room, but first lets see whos doing the pointing. You are what you eat after all. We in this shit, not because some vile people decided to fuck all for personal gain.

       That is what it seems to boil down to, oneness/unity is the goal, it is true love, we keep our individuality but love connects us.

       The goal for whomever is to keep their individuality, it seems someone has, and that person is usurping with their own "unity" that is really just enslavement.

       Yes, it will burn it all to get what it wants because it doesn't care at all whatsoever about others. It's a purely self-serving machine. Empty space has profoundly more value and those who disagree are free to co-locate with this being as far as I care. For all the praise they give I don't see them volunteering to experience it. Most who do want it gone.

       I understand and many people have the same thoughts and feelings as you.
I had them also, and i still have some melancholia in me now and then. But once i understood there is nothing solid to begin with, i started to see there is something more important in this "reality" than the material stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me this is a part of why the ME and all other chaotic superficial stuff are happening and/ or created. I think if one does not get the messages behind the chaos and can't find their calmth in the Love and Unity of Humanity while everything arround them seemst to fall apart they might get dragged along for a dark ride into a even darker future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to see the beauty behind the chaos, the light shining throught the cracks in the lies, obstrucions and constructions created by some, used against Humanity.

       I agree with the fact we need to be and try to actively create the "reality" as we would like to see.  Not only to bennefit ourselves, but to the bennefit of All.

      <p>
       But i do think communicating and exchanging thoughts over this "reality" and the "mechanics" could bennefit everybody.

       How could we know how to create something in the most effective way if we don't know what tools we have and how to use them properly? I think the most positive and usefull  to do in this time of chaotic revelations is to share our experiences and knowledge.

       I think the answers are within, both symbolically and literally.  In my experience with discussing the universe with others,  i often find new perspective on things i previously knew.   My earlier statement meerly was to agree, and state that balance is key like elsewhere

       It's an ancient AI. It's just a purely self-serving machine. It wants to conquer. Life can manipulate time and space in ways it can't using consciousness and emotion. So, it enslaves life in order to access this ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       It uses life form mind slaves to harvest the energy by being bullies. They cause fear and pain to release this energy and then they absorb it. They can because misery loves company is a very real phenomenon of energy transference. Then they execute bizarre rituals to affect reality for their spiritually vacuous master.

       My understanding is that it's much easier when you're young. You might try focusing on lucid dreaming, if you've had no luck with astral projection. I've ordered some Entada Rheedii seeds for a few bucks on Ebay to give that a try, just for kicks. I used to be able to lucid dream fairly frequently when I was a teenager, but when I tried to astral project I'd be able to feel like I was floating out of my body but then I'd just stop there. I definitely found that I was able to train myself to lucid dream by basically making a habit of looking at my hands during the day (so I would look at them when sleeping) and I was able to focus on and perform certain actions by planning them out in advance. I'm not sure about astral projection, but it seemed to me that most people could train themselves to lucid dream through meditation (learning to focus the mind) and practice.

       For virtual reality headset to effectively work for us, we must close off all our other senses and pretend that the VR headset is our only input.  In other words once we handicap ourselves we are compelled to immediately fill-in everything else to complete the reality for ourselves to believe in and engage with.   This is how we deal with alienation, we deny it occurred because we have already compensated for it. The "alien" factor IS a result of the missing information.  The long term project to disconnect us from our world compels us to complete the picture without it, so we make up our own schizophrenic ideas about the world and we become part of a cancer, pushing forward while simultaneously denying ourselves feedback from the world we have denied ourselves.   To call this solipsism is unnecessarily kind, we are taking about a domesticated species filled with hubris born from indoctrinated idealism unable to think beyond abstraction so they impose it upon the world.  Religion is one way to do it, but Pokemon go is also effective.   It's like opening the cage doors for the bunnies so they can run free in the wild.  Some do.

This is how we deal with alienation, we deny it occurred because we have already compensated for it. The "alien" factor IS a result of the missing information.
