        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">61</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Zenyx_.html">Zenyx_</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Cameron Kasky, &#39;student&#39; at MSD and founder of the #NeverAgain movement is reported as <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/remysmidt/heres-what-its-like-at-the-headquarters-of-the-teens?utm_term=.yp7ZBGbM8A#.vnp2myrGJg">saying</a> he invited over students a mere hours after the shooting to discuss plans for anti-gun reform. By the next fucking day they had a website, all of their social media was created (except for several accounts that were created years before, personal accounts). Ok, let&#39;s suspend disbelief for a second that these kids aren&#39;t distraught from the murder of their friends and consider that they did form this group the night of the shooting, and made plans for a March, a trip to the capitol, and up to 50 interviews in the media per person(Cameron says he had 50 in the week after). How did these kids do this without it being pre-meditated? Also if you look at their Twitter accounts you&#39;ll find them constantly asking for media exposure for their movement. Here is the big bombshell though and a real conspiracy: Nearly all of these kids were talking about Gun Control within MINUTES of the shooting. You know what that means? These kids were advocating for stricter gun control WAY before Cameron ever brought up the idea of starting an anti-gun movement. Is it a coincidence that every single one of these kids involved talks about gun control before the group formed? This is a <strong>big</strong> red flag for me.  </p>

<p>Alex Wind:  </p>

<p>His <a href="https://imgur.com/a/UAVLJ">first posts</a> after the shooting (before the creation of the #NeverAgain gun-control movement) were, <em>yes</em>, about fucking gun control.   </p>

<p>Sarah Chadwick:  </p>

<p>Her <a href="https://imgur.com/a/dMJ0F">first posts</a> were pretty cut clear. Gun control gun control gun control.   </p>

<p>Cameron Kasky:  </p>

<p>His <a href="https://twitter.com/charles_gaba/status/963981961655193600">first post</a> was an exposition about the shooting with a little hint at the end letting you know to swing the polls and fuck Trump, Rubio, and other Republicans. He doesn&#39;t seem fazed by the shooting at all and it&#39;s clear the main point of the post wasn&#39;t to detail the shooting, but to get people to vote against Scott, Rubio and Trump. He created his account the night of the shooting, presumably while with his friends, so this one isn&#39;t too much of a red flag.  </p>

<p>Sofie Whitney:  </p>

<p>Her <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WNbc9">first posts</a> are the most interesting to me. She posts three videos with the hashtag #GunControlNow but the more interesting part is the tweet before the videos. The tweet states &quot;Please don&#39;t ask any of us what happened. You probably know more than us at this point.&quot; Fuck me on this one I&#39;ll let you come to your own conclusions about that.  </p>

<p>Delaney Tarr:  </p>

<p>This one is outright hilarious. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XFoiT">Here&#39;s</a> Tarr saying shut the fuck up to a comment implying some agenda pushing by the left. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1jExj">Here</a> is Tarr retweeting Sofie&#39;s comment about not knowing anything (they all retweet this comment for some reason...) and a particularly odd comment about the resilience of their community, and that now is &quot;the time to show the world...&quot; Is he implying some sort of movement an entire day before it&#39;s creation?  </p>

<p>Carly Novell:  </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/y5qTnQQ">Here</a> she is using the word &quot;gun&quot; an obscene amount of times. This was on the 15th but I thought I&#39;d include it because of how insane it is. <a href="https://imgur.com/a9ttCE5">Here</a> is Carly starting the tweets off right with a reply to Trump about Gun Control. Before the movement started.  </p>

<p>Other Members: People like David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Jaclyn Corin have either made their accounts since the shooting or did not post about gun control immediately. David Hogg mysteriously took a Twitter break for the months before the shooting until mid January.  </p>

<p>You could chalk up their tweets about gun control to the actual event that happened, but think to yourself: If a shooting occurred and 17 of your friends died would you really be tweeting immediately(before seeing your family and within hours of the shooting) about gun control? All of these kids retweet the same shit, they say the same shit, and they&#39;ve been constantly spouting off about gun control and anti-Trump since immediately after the shooting occurred.  </p>

<p>Implications of what I&#39;m saying:  </p>

<p>I think the movement was pre-planned, which would imply that the shooting was pre-planned. I have no evidence other than what I have supplied today to suggest that this shooting and the movement alongside it is not what it seems to be.</p>

<p>TL;DR: The #NeverAgain movement (leftist gun control movement) was created almost instantly after the shooting occurred, the night of the 14th. The students involved in the movement were tweeting about gun-control nearly 10 hours before the idea of a gun-control movement came up. And they all were doing it in unison. This leads me to believe the entire movement is completely inorganic from top to bottom. This also leads to more questions about the shooting because they were so prepared for this movement.  </p>

<p>Edit: Links were fucked up</p>

<p>Edit 2: This post has atleast 100 downvotes as of this edit. There are no arguments against what I am saying yet. This thread is being deliberately manipulated because it is the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking, the reason this shooting took place in a highschool is because highschool age children are pretty much the perfect vehicle for an agenda. They think with their feelings, act as a collective, and are easy to manipulate. The kids at Sandy Hook (if there were any) weren&#39;t old enough to understand what&#39;s going on and articulate themselves. Highschool kids are the perfect age for this shit. </p>

<p>All of this makes me feel like this shooting was very real and these kids are not crisis actors. However I do think that they&#39;re being manipulated and used, they just don&#39;t know it. They&#39;re acting like crisis actors without actually being crisis actors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orrrrr maybe they all had a reaction to seeing their classmates killed, maybe they needed to do something to distract from the worst event of thier lives. And maybe that reaction, which I&#39;d say seems pretty logical to any rational person, is to attempt to stop anyone else having to suffer what they have. They were maybe talking about gun control because,oh I don&#39;t know, the mass shooting that took place that day? It&#39;s almost as if shootings and guns are linked in some way? Maybe these kids were really fucking angry that school age kids keep dying in entirely preventable circumstances and maybe they decided enough was enough, and in an age of social media and fast moving news, they could do something about it right then and there? I mean what, should they wait for a while before they do something? You can&#39;t set up a social media account in seconds, sharing a hashtag takes no time at all. The media obviously would interview them alot in the aftermath. Hardly takes that much organisation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surely you&#39;ve heard of correlation without causation, and that doesn&#39;t even speak to imaginary policies that &quot;make fathers unnecessary&quot;.</p>

<p>Mostly, the shooters are also white males on SSRIs, but I&#39;m not so simple as to pick one of those factors and call it the root cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Statistics show that single mothers are for lack of a better term, criminal factories. The overwhelming evidence shows that children of single mothers, especially boys, tend to engage in criminal behavior at much higher rates compared to boys who come from a home with both parents, or even single fathers.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t just simply a correlation. Not when boys from single mothers rank higher in just about every negative metric compared to their peers who are from a home in which dad is present.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a firm believer that SSRI&#39;s also play a part, the evidence is undeniable, but lack of a dad in the home is a major factor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t say the last sentence, that was you.</p>

<p>I think there is more than just access to firearms that attributes to kids going to shoot up schools, mainly judging that by the increase in them in the past few years.</p>

<p>Nobody is giving a shit about these kids lives, schools aren&#39;t there for them and the other kids bully them often. however, it&#39;s the gun to blame for our deteriorating society and not the societies fault.</p>

<p>Fix the actual problem instead of just trying to bandage over the intense division and isolation that is spreading rampantly. It isn&#39;t guns, it&#39;s us.</p>

<p>Reacting to a mass-shooting with a few tweets about gun control is hardly out of left-field. Do you think it&#39;s suspicious when crimes by immigrants (or just brown people) are immediately followed by tweets to &quot;build the wall&quot;, from the POTUS no less?</p>

<p>This absolutely does NOT happen within hours of events. I am not talking about the creation of the movement online or in the planning of events. Who cares, they got through that fine. What is unusual is the fact that several random students spoke about gun-control on social media during the shooting. Those same students were invited by Cameron Kasky the night after the shooting occurred to discuss plans for the group. Please explain to me the coincidence that Cameron recruited all of the correct people that tweeted identical things  about gun-control, in an attempt to create a movement. Please also explain to me how he managed to do that without having a Twitter account. You have absolutely no idea what would be running through a kid&#39;s head in HS, because it&#39;s NEVER gun control. They never allow that debate in high school and kids aren&#39;t very much interested anyways. This movement is completely fake and just saying &quot;oh just believe it because they&#39;re kids&quot; is fucking ridiculous. You and those kids are being played right out of the ability to own arms.</p>

Each one is always part of the conversation among high schoolers. Millions of us are afraid to even come to school.

This post is just the perfect example of the gap between the thought process of adults and those of the young adolescents today. The response of the students is no conspiracy, it&#39;s the response of millions of us. I&#39;m sick of everyone saying these kids are government pawns.

<p>However, going into this as a black and white issue on a conspiracy sub (which does seem to have a decently sized group of non extreme partisan viewpoint) is a little brazen.</p>

<p>Could this be everything the country needs and a perfectly coincidental thing to happen in light of a tragedy? Yes. The leftist in me who wants to have faith in a government for the people wants to believe that and has respect for others who think like this as well.</p>

<p>However.....</p>

<p>If one were to simply lean on the opposite heel and look at it from a more right centrist attitude (ish) and a mild amount of critical thinking the op&#39;s post does call for some actual discussion in relation to being a conspiracy sub.
