        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A LITTLE STORY</p>

<p>In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control.</p>

<p>From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.</p>

<p>In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.</p>

<p>Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.</p>

<p>China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.</p>

<p>Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.</p>

<p>Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.</p>

<p>Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million educated people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.</p>

<p>Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t see this data on the US evening news, or hear politicians disseminating this information.</p>

<p>Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws adversely affect only the law-abiding citizens.</p>

<p>Take note my fellow Americans, before it&#39;s too late.</p>

<p>The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, please remind them of this history lesson.</p>

<p>With guns, we are &#39;citizens&#39;. Without them, we are &#39;subjects&#39;.</p>

<p>During WWII the Japanese decided not to invade America because they knew most Americans were ARMED.</p>

<p>If you value your freedom, please spread this antigun-control message to all of your friends.</p>

<p>SWITZERLAND ISSUES EVERY HOUSEHOLD A GUN.</p>

<p>SWITZERLAND&#39;S GOVERNMENT TRAINS EVERY ADULT THEY ISSUE A RIFLE.</p>

<p>SWITZERLAND HAS THE LOWEST GUN RELATED CRIME RATE OF ANY CIVILIZED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. IT&#39;S A NO BRAINER.</p>

<p>DON&#39;T LET OUR GOVERNMENT WASTE MILLIONS OF OUR TAX DOLLARS IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE ALL LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AN EASY TARGET.</p>

<p>Spread the word everywhere you can that you are a firm believer in the 2nd Amendment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time to speak loud before they try to silence and disarm us. You&#39;re not imagining it, history shows that governments always manipulate tragedies to attempt to disarm the people~</p>

<p>&quot;Whites&quot; aren&#39;t a race. You know what ethnicities do have homelands, though? French. German. Irish. Swedish. Italian. In most all of those countries, fluency in the language and culture are required for citizenship. </p>

<p>Hitler is generally considered worse than most because he <em>industrialized</em> genocide. &quot;Genocide by bullets&quot; proved too ineffective, so he instituted a policy of total war on a civilian population, and did so in the most efficient way possible. No one is saying there are no comparable evils, merely that there are no comparable evils to his scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made this comment earlier but I may as well paste it here. It is about &quot;taking&quot; the guns, it is about getting the country to give them up voluntarily:</p>

<p>In the last few days I&#39;ve seen highly upvoted &quot;common sense&quot; measures suggested such as: </p>

<p>Creating a federal weapon tax for a victims fund and costly annual mental exams for license and registration renewal (so, poor people can&#39;t have a gun?) </p>

<p>Restricting anyone that has ever been treated for a mental or drug problem (there goes anyone that has been treated for ADD or depression.) </p>

<p>Restricting anyone that has taken an SSRI unless the doctor will sign off that the person is stable upon completion of the med (what malpractice insurance would ever even let a doctor sign something like that, regardless of the risk?) </p>

<p>So, there goes the 2nd amendment for a huge portion of the country for seemingly &quot;common sense measures&quot;.</p>

<p>Add to that, another generation practically begging to be saved from guns- actors or otherwise. I&#39;m giving it 10 years before we ask TPTB to &quot;relieve&quot; us of our 2nd amendment right.</p>

<p>Oh so one Senator out of how many said they wanted to do that?</p>

<p>I could find some pretty outrageous things said by a single Republican Senator as well and attribute that to the entire Republican party. Roy Moore said in 2005 that being gay should be illegal. That doesn&#39;t mean that every Republican wants being gay to be illegal.</p>

<p>Has there <em>ever</em> been a serious push by Dems or Repubs to ban all guns? No. The answer is no.</p>

<p>To shoot at a range, shoot in a competition, hunting wild pigs that infest certain area&#39;s, home defense but I would say a pistol is better for that.</p>

<p>Not true, there are plenty of Americans who want to ban and confiscate guns. Right now the elite are pushing an &quot;assault weapons ban&quot; which can include all kinds of weapons, look at the legislation that was just voted down in Florida.  </p>

<p>Obama probably would take guns away if it were up to him, he pushed Congress to pass all kinds of gun control laws. Fortunately the American people aren&#39;t so easily fooled.</p>

<p>CCTV ORwell cameras everywhere, fined for social media speech, and can&#39;t even look at porn, is just a terrorist attack waiting to happen. I wonder if their is a correlation between taking away porn from men and the Rotherham cover up?</p>

<p>Also our concerts here usually don&#39;t have terrorists blowing themselves up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m English, gun crime is going up in England and the UK and it is very easy to get an illegal firearm here.</p>

<p>If I was one of those monsters who wanted to shoot up a school in England, it could be very easily done.</p>

<p>I believe it is a human right to defend oneself however one sees fit in the given circumstance, and I also believe part of freedom should be being allowed to own firearms as a right. This does not mean everyone should have that right as people who are unstable or have a criminal history should not be allowed to own a firearm, the good gun owners are the silent majority, no one wants to here their side of the story.</p>

<p>The problem in America isn&#39;t the guns, its the people who shouldn&#39;t have them, gun control wont solve anything, if they cant grab a gun they&#39;ll grab a knife, when knives are outlawed, they&#39;ll grab a spoon.</p>

<p>America needs to focus on better mental healthcare, and more in depth background checks upon buying a firearm, and they need to check up on current gun owners regularly and assess if they are still able to possess a gun.</p>

<p>I think you need to go educate yourself on the crime rate in the UK, the media often covers up shootings in the UK because it ruins their gun control narrative, the stats are high enough that on average their are 2 shootings a day in the UK and they are increasing year on year.</p>

<p>The UK is far from safe, we have no rights, we are not allowed to defend ourselves, police are too busy covering up rapes from Muslims and painting their cars with the LGBT flag to try to be inclusive. The UK is in a right state, we fought to free the world from the likes of Hitler and the Nazi&#39;s, now we are a country of submissive pussys who foam at the mouth every time they get to give a new right away.</p>

<p>You should be ashamed of the UK, I am.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a citizen of both countries.</p>

<p>Since you took the time to write out this post I will reply sincerely. I cannot disagree that self defense laws in the UK are a bit absurd and I don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening with the Muslims.</p>

<p>The problem is the increase in gun usage in UK crime isn&#39;t something that&#39;s up to civilians to solve. Arm the police certainly but not citizens and I will explain why further on. When I said that they are low in the UK I am talking comparatively.</p>

<p>You bring up mental health and I have also brought up mental health in my arguments about gun ownership, it is definitely a problem when it comes to mass shootings. Gun violence that is  <strong>not</strong> premeditated or that is a spur of the moment thing takes up a large portion of this statistic which is why I don&#39;t believe in every Tom, Dick and Harry walking around with a gun. Increased funding to mental healthcare both in the US and the UK need to be a major priority for a lot of reasons as well as mass shootings.</p>

<p>I believe the gun laws should be restrictive over all but guns should be obtainable only with rigorous training. In the US it is a state by state issue unless there is a Federal ban that affects all states, but every state and sometime cities can affect how guns are obtained - it&#39;s not like the UK which I&#39;m sure you understand.</p>

<p>I am a concealed carry permit holder in my state. I obtained my concealed carry by paying less than $100 total. I took an internet course on gun safety. I printed it off, took it to the Sheriffs office, paid the fee and 3 days later after the background checks I was an armed citizen capable of carrying my gun (concealed) almost anywhere. That is beyond ridiculous. A family member of mine in the UK has a mounted safe, had a police inspection, a signature and meeting with his doctor and other co-signatories.</p>

<p>I feel like legal civilian ownership of weapons and criminal possession of weapons are very contrasting and difficult subjects to compare. In the US the war on drugs and the forced destabilization of urban areas by certain alphabet agencies is a very well known and recorded phenomenon. As for the UK I don&#39;t know enough to properly get into it besides a lot of guns obtained by criminals in the UK come in via ships and are often setup on a weird sort of usage/deposit system.</p>

<p>I joke about the monarchy, but I agree with you on the way the UK is leaning. I see problems with democracy and the party systems that exist and have become a bit bitter at the taste of every idiot who can suck down air having the ability to vote for and on things they won&#39;t research.</p>

<p>I also feel like I can&#39;t give you as full a reply as I would like to, without writing a book of a post and how
I came to various conclusions. But to end it, I am not ashamed of the UK. I am very worried about both countries.</p>

<p>I am a gun owner in the UK, as for the US I do believe training should be required to conceal carry and that should be mandatory for everyone, it might already be I am not a US citizen.</p>

<p>However for other firearms as long as you are mentally and physically capable of owning them further training other than the basic should not be required, firearms are incredibly easy to use and you do not have to be a genius to know where to point the barrel safely, if you join a gun club I assume that you would be given the rules of the club like in the UK so that you don&#39;t do something stupid.</p>

<p>Disarming the American people in my <strong>opinion</strong> would be wrong and unfair to the majority of people who are good responsible gun owners.</p>

<p>Our laws in the UK concerning firearms are too extreme, in terms of what we can and cannot have, the current licensing we have should stay the same, however once you have your license you should be allowed to own what ever you want instead of being put it a category of what you can and can&#39;t own.</p>

<p>The criminals will still get guns there is no way to get around that, gun control like ours in the UK makes it so they have to get them by other means, our gun laws though too extreme do prevent guns from falling into peoples hands who are not fit to own a firearm, and they do protect the responsible owners which is what America should aim to achieve.</p>

<p>You need to understand if you don&#39;t already that the government doesn&#39;t want you to own guns US and UK, in the UK they tried to force our licensing fees from £50 up to £2000 which would put an end to the working class such as myself from owning firearms as it would just be too expensive. So part of owning a gun is about freedom, and America must protect its rights and freedoms without giving them away, and yet allowing legislation to pass that would stop people who would use them for violence from having them.</p>

<p>I believe that all gun owners should have a very thorough and intensive training. I mean intensive, weeks of classroom study and practical use. Anyone who is unsafe should be instantly failed.</p>

<p>I know in the UK there are gun clubs, here there are open ranges and private ranges. I&#39;ve gone to both and you will get people with NRA stickers on their bumpers ranting on about their rights while failing to practice proper trigger discipline and waving their gun around erratically. In private ranges these people are usually booted. It&#39;s just a large amount of the card carrying NRA members I see at ranges are usually the ones who completely fail at any form of safety and they are also the ones who are usually the most vocal about gun rights. </p>

<p>In a gun safety class I attended we were told to imagine an infinitely long invisible line coming out of the barrel, if that line touches something living then we have failed (even when the gun is unloaded). That lesson stuck with me and I am very strict about gun safety. My skepticism of the general public mass owning guns comes down to this; If I head out to the supermarket, I could easily see a half dozen driving infractions in a couple miles. The guy bagging my groceries is putting cans on top of my eggs. While an idiot with 2 kids doesn&#39;t look either way and walks out into traffic. Before I can shift my support over to general ownership, I gotta see either a strict and intense class or to see less idiots and more common sense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with the right to own, I just believe the path there should be more difficult, not behind a paywall like going from 50 quid to 2000. But properly regulated, which in the US in my opinion it is not.</p>

<p>I also completely agree with you that neither country wants us to own guns. They are afraid of an armed populace.</p>

<p>That was a very different time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.  No it wasn’t.  It was, as a matter of fact, <em>exactly the same</em> time then as now.  How is that?  Well, it was exactly the same time in that the people then had just as much ammo and “might of the state” going against them as is the case now.  “Oh but they have drones and tanks now!  They didn’t have that then!”  That’s your response, right?  Well, all those machines still have to be controlled and driven and moved by sons and fathers and mothers and daughters today just like any other time.  The emotional and psychological component involved in the trigger-puller and drone-controller cannot be looked upon as being appreciably different now than that of the individuals then.</p>

<p>Humans are humans.  People are people.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it wasn’t really that different a time - definitely not different enough to keep people today from still fighting for their rights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both sides had access to the same basic tools / technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing’s the case today.  Subdue the tank and drone controller and suddenly you have exactly the same tools/technology as they.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That isn’t the case anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite the contrary.</p>

<p>That’s like saying that someone without a gun has absolutely no chance against someone with a gun so they should therefore just give up and not even try to fight back.  That’s utter and complete nonsensical, yellow-striped bullshit.</p>

<p>Is the unarmed person at a disadvantage?  Absolutely.  However, many an unarmed individual has ultimately gotten the advantage over armed individuals - especially if they know what they’re doing.  A focused, controlled, and coordinated militia that’s all on the same page can be <em>extremely</em> effective against pretty much anyone.</p>

<p>The multi-billion dollar, “most powerful military in the entire planet!” behemoth of the United States had to pull out of Vietnam because they got their asses handed to them by a bunch of “skinny, malnutritioned, rice-patty-picking gooks” that had little more than pitch forks and a few machine guns to fight back with.</p>

<p>Think about that for a moment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If someone here can lay out how a segment of the current population could stand any chance of successfully overthrowing the government I’m all ears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply coming together and standing together in unity as one against the oppressors and being so resolutely unafraid that the fight doesn’t stop if and when some of your brothers and sisters around you happen to possibly fall.  The cause is more important than any one individual.  What cause?  Keeping the citizenry from being completely and entirely disarmed, declawed, and defanged.  Historically speaking, <a href="http://jpfo.org/pdf02/genocide-chart.pdf">bad things happen when that occurs.</a></p>

<p>If everyone were to all come together, things could ultimately be pretty darn effective.  This is part of the very reason why TPTB work so darn hard (and with unfortunate success) at making sure and keeping us apart and separated and at each others’ throats.  It’s because they know that if we were to all wake up to the fact that we’re being played by them and we all then come together as one against them, then we would be able to accomplish a <em>lot</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a witness to an attempted shooting in a mall this weekend. A gang physically fought, then went outside and grabbed their guns, came back inside the mall and brandished them in crowds of 500+ people, women, children. It took security what felt like an eternity to even respond. The guy got away and still has never been apprehended.</p>

<p>I had my little girl and husband with me. My husband has a firearm and permit but the mall&#39;s rules do not allow firearms on the premises, so we abided by the rules that day. All this to say that if my husband HAD his gun on his person I would have felt a hundred times safer. I have never taken a hard stance on guns before this weekend but I now absolutely believe gun control is the opposite way we should go. In a situation like that, bad actors with firearms can easily be disarmed by good citizens so that no person gets hurt. And that IS what should happen. </p>

<p>Instead, we were all herded out like sheep by SWAT teams with AR-15s and I still felt unsafe.</p>

<p>For instance, the German one is factually untrue. Germans were allowed to have weapons before WWII, in 1938 everyone agreed to take the guns of jews away. Guess which year noone could have a gun in Germany? 1945. </p>

<p>In Guatamala, guns are still legal, more or less. Only recently have they started cracking down of guns because they had too many gun homicides.</p>

<p>The Ugandan, Armanian and Cambodian ones are true, but also slightly misleading as there weren&#39;t many privately owned guns there in the first place.</p>

In the event that the U.S. government goes full-on tyrannical we&#39;ll be ready with our AR-15s, 100 round magazines full of .223 Remington rounds and full tactical gear.</p>

<p>No government in its right mind would engage a force like this.  Even if they did have a full compliment of Apache AH-64 attack helicopters equipped with laser guided hellfire missiles, Hydra 70 rockets and the M230 30mm chain gun.  Never mind that the Apache can withstand a direct hit from a 23mm round.  They still have to come get us on the ground.  Which would be their last mistake.  I would give a fully trained, fully outfitted Army squad maybe a 1:2 chance against us.  Maybe 2:3 if they had a few M-1116s with M2 Browning .50 caliber machine guns on  top.  Maybe 3:4 if they had one or two M1 Abrams tanks.  The 
M68A1 105 mm rifled tank gun is overrated... even firing multiple flechette rounds guided by a ballistic fire-control computer.  And if they are stupid enough to equip them with the M2HB .50 caliber machine gun AND a couple of 7.62 M240 machine guns... well... let&#39;s just say &quot;game over&quot; for them.</p>
