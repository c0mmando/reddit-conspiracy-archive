       This genuine Parkland shooting witness (a teacher) says she saw the shooter wear full tactical gear including body armour and face mask, and thought he looked like police were he not shooting students and teachers:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/teacher-grazed-by-parkland-shooters-bullet-shooter-was-in-full-metal-garb-helmet-face-mask-bulletproof-armor-shooting-a-rifle-i-never-seen-before/">
        https://www.intellihub.com/teacher-grazed-by-parkland-shooters-bullet-shooter-was-in-full-metal-garb-helmet-face-mask-bulletproof-armor-shooting-a-rifle-i-never-seen-before/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This genuine witness said she spoke with the "alleged shooter" after the shooting and joked "I'm surprised you didn't do it". Made no mention of body armour, mask etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-02-23/youtube-removing-video-parkland-student-who-claimed-there-was-second-shooter">
        https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-02-23/youtube-removing-video-parkland-student-who-claimed-there-was-second-shooter
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems we have a situation similar to San Bernadino, where there were 3 witnesses who said they saw 3 athletic caucasion shooters wearing face masks, body armour despite the shooting being blamed on 2 muslims (one was a tiny woman). In other words, professional shooters and the shooting being blamed on convenient patsies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The patsy with a history of mental illness was living with a former intelligence officer. It would have been very easy to drug him and make him believe he had done something he hadn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Hogg, son of FBI agent, is pushing the gun grab narrative. He said today to conspiracy theorists:
      </p>
      <h1>
       "You might as well stop now because we're going to outlive you"
      </h1>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He repeated the phrase again here:
      </p>
      <p>
       "They've lost faith in America. But we certainly haven't. And that's ok, because we're going to outlive them"
      </p>

       Is this a chilling threat from the NWO which just murdered dozens of school children?

       You can only Govern with fear or respect. People are laughing at the FBI and other authorities right now so they're going to have to amp up the fear.

       At a certain point you have to recognize when you're involved in trafficking in smears and noxious political innuendo like this and that you're being an unwitting tool for some political partisan outfit.  You have to see that at some point and become kind of reviled with yourself.  I hope.

       What I find so weird is how the girl who said there was two shooters also said she was talking to Nikolas Cruz during the shooting and all the media said that Nikolas was no longer a student there? I don't think we can believe anything she says.

       I just find it weird that Cruz would be at the school at all if he wasn't a student there and apparently told his guardian that "he doesnt go to school on valentines day".
      </p>
      <p>
       Cruz being at the school makes sense if they brought him to the school (either by force or monarch programming), then a trained professional carried out the attack while Cruz is inside, professional leaves with Cruz, and Cruz is then apprehended an hour later. That seems plausible to me.

       lol even posters on r/topmindsofreddit have trouble believing the shooting narrative with all it's contradictions. I wonder if the mods of that sub will delete this comment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I do have questions about the shooting. What was with the interviews he did saying it was like 9 o clock?
       </p>
       <p>
        Also... why did they say the fire alarm was pulled but you can't hear a fire alarm in any video taken in the school?

       According to Kay Griggs (ex wife of Colonel) they recruit men who were molested as children, had domineering mom and absent father. They're homosexuals and pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also recruit from European countries who will not feel bad shooting Americans. They celebrated after sniping women and children at Waco "trained to kill, trained to kill"

       1) are mk ultra shooters (like myron may) going to be 100% chance successful at killing the desired number of people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they need to invest a significant amount of money recording all the fake CNN interviews and paying off these crisis actors you'd think they'd leave nothing to chance ie.
