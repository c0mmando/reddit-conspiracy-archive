<p>So what you’re trying to say is that because the government has lied, they lie all the time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Why is everything you say a straw man? </p>

<p>You are <em>demanding</em> that everyone accept the official story without question. The answer is: no. I will not do what I&#39;m told, I will not accept the official narrative, and I will not surrender my AR15 or my .50 cal, no matter what words come out of your mouth.</p>

<p>Your OP is just bullshit you heard from civil rights haters about how everyone with a gun suffers from penis envy. I have a gun because I&#39;m afraid of my government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also clear you have no sense of history, because you categorically denied the possibility of staged events, which is why I proved you to be foolishly ignorant through historical examples. You don&#39;t even know about the FBI&#39;s long history of encouraging terrorism. Do me a favor, find out who supplied the World Trade Center bombers, and then we&#39;ll talk about your assertion that the FBI doesn&#39;t just go around asking people to commit terrorism (hint: you can listen to tape recordings of them doing this).</p>

<p>Your ideas are not as breathtakingly profound as NPR makes you feel they are. They&#39;re very basic iterations of &quot;trust your government&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t look at the facts!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said anything about removing guns! I said I’m a gun owner and want to keep them. There’s no way I’m changing my opinion on that either. I’m not trying to sway you that way. What I am saying is that I believe gun owners like us who believe in the crisis actor narrative are looking for anything to believe that he is in fact a crisis actor so anything he says against guns can be discredited, instead of actually fighting back with our own reasons why we shouldn’t seek to remove guns. </p>

<p>I don’t know where I categorically denied the possibility of staged events. I do have an understanding of history in fact, and I’m not trying to tell anyone to trust the government. </p>

<p>I&#39;m perfectly comfortable refuting any of the lies used by authoritarians regarding gun ownership. I don&#39;t feel any need to attack fake shootings because I&#39;m afraid I might be wrong. It sounds like you just heard that idea somewhere.</p>

<p>I do have an understanding of history in fact</p>

<p>Then why did you say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>magine if someone with the FBI came to you and offered you money to pretend like you witnessed a shooting and then be a social warrior in the media afterwards: first of all, the FBI wouldn’t even attempt to do something so stupid, second of all no kid would do this</p>

<p>when we know the FBI has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/nyregion/bomb-informer-s-tapes-give-rare-glimpse-of-fbi-dealings.html">asked people to commit terrorism</a> in the past, including giving them supplies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who is denying that people died?  The event can be arranged for and still have people murdered.</p>

<p>This is reddit, if you hear people yelling from the top of their lungs that no one died, it was all bullshit, yadda yadda yadda, no one died......you can bet that it might be people paid to be there and foster that idea.  Creating that rift between people who want to find out more and muddying the waters as they go.  Keeping more people on the fence is an easy goal.  Fewer people who understand the efforts going on can&#39;t and won&#39;t say anything to combat efforts to marginalize gun owners or defenders of 2nd and the like.</p>

<p>There were even people saying no one died in Vegas as well.  That they were all actors.  Those shills/ignorant people have intent and a goal to make those who ask questions look like loony toons.</p>

<p>Yes, the FBI would try to do that, and they have. Not all of them are that stupid/evil, but the ones in on the operation are. The fact they were running drills/simulations of this event before and during the shooting is the clue.</p>

Was it because he was in California and somehow that means it’s impossible for him to attend Parkland HS at the time of the shooting? I would contend that you’re trying to find a loophole where there is none. So you made your own. I’m a conspiracy theorist myself, and I want to keep guns.

    <div class="md"><p>These kids are being used to push a political agenda, following a major crisis.  These kids and their fragile emotional state are being used like puppets (or actors), knowingly or unknowingly (I have no clue). The biggest sign to me is the fact that Hoggs father is(was?) a FBI agent. Hogg has excused the inaction of the deputy that was present during the shooting. To me, he is there to deflect the heat of responsibility that the local police and the FBI should incur. The government, local and federal, fucked up hard here. So a FBI agents kid is utilized to defer attention from that and get us in a uproar about the gun debate. He has been ultra successful at this.</p>

<p>Just bc we use the term crisis actor doesn&#39;t mean there were no deaths, or that Cruz is not the shooter, or that Hogg and others are in on it.... Simply that they are being used.  At least, that&#39;s what I think it means.  </p>

<p>Anyone here disagree? Let me know</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh you want to keep your guns but you feel for poor little fella Hogg? Riddle me this Batman what is Hogg at this very moment doing? Did people die at Parkland. Yep. Was it a horrible massacre on students. Yep. Was there crisis actors present. Fucking yes. Why? Because they are pushing a narrative. And that narrative is gun control. And little fella Hogg is key spokesmen. Right now he’s not gonna go back to school until they “fix” it. Which is ludicrous since “they” are the ones that arranged the whole thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is definitely a horrific crime. You should consider directing your obvious disgust at the people that are trying to spin this to their advantage by manipulating the message.  They are creating their narrative other than just reporting the news. Literally DIRECTING students what to and not to say,  WRITING statements for students, and PRODUCING news casts that reflect what they want. Hmmm, writing, directing, and producing....sounds like a movie....too bad there aren’t any actors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is saying people shouldn&#39;t exercise a good measure of skepticism. The problem is that almost every case, from 9/11 to the the Boston bombing and school shootings are immediately called false flags and people are labeled crisis actors. In the vast majority of cases, what is reported as happening is what actually happened. </p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor isn&#39;t just a quaint idea. </p>

<p>What is more logical and reasonable, using occam&#39;s razor? </p>

<p>A gov&#39;t plot where school shootings are faked (repeated over and over again) or armed assholes killing people? </p>

<p>When everything is a conspiracy, any chance of identifying real conspiracies are lost in the noise. It&#39;s also a big part of why people get so much shit. </p>
