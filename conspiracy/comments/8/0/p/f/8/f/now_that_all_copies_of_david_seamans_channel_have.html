<p>He was very vocal about money as a manipulation of us all. </p>

<p>When his old friend was killed (RIP Ashley) there was a weird couple of days where he disappeared and his videos disappeared and he fled to a cabin. He supposedly puked up a black gooey substance and <strong>He said he had some sort of vision (?) that Nephilim are real</strong> (source anyone? this is from my own memory)</p>

<p>He covered the incident where a supposed hacker was gang-stalked after <em>&#39;hacking into comet&#39;s site&#39;</em>... I remember something about his car getting damaged by a ramming at night..?  </p>

<p><strong>Any exclusive details we lost due to the destruction of his channel?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any points besides these</p>

<ol>
<li><p>BitGold was financed by Soros... and Seaman liked its service... &#39;k.</p></li>
<li><p>Titus Frost called him a weasel and wanted everyone to boycott his content.... &#39;k</p></li>
<li><p>Seaman wrote a book once about how to generate buzz on the internet... and then he generated buzz.... &#39;k.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You know, none of those points take away from the validity of his videos. If I took his advice on Bitcoin a few years ago, I would literally be a dollar millionaire today. And he never misrepresented a commonly &#39;believed tidbit&#39; in the pizzagate theory. He just laid out some widely believed details, and he made a &#39;Pizzagate core evidence&#39; video. </p>

<p>This is disingeneous.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t care for the guy very much, he seemed to me like an opportunist. But still I&#39;m glad he brought pgate to the attention of many. Your exagerated criticism of him is suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know exactly but around the time he was having dramas around PedoGate he was going dark and thanking people for financial support.</p>

<p>I may be wrong but I thought it could be an act. He then started going everywhere in the conspiracy world, again no evidence but I thought he may be trying to broaden his audience and claim a few gullible s on the way.</p>

<p>(I have no real evidence ,just my gut telling me he isn&#39;t all that righteous.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve just witnessed the total deletion of all his content. </p>

<p>He definitely had his niche with the Podesta videos and anti-dollar videos.</p>

<p>But at least the niche was there.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s all gone.</p>

<p>Did he break any laws? Community guidelines? If he did so, I really hope there will be transparency about the details. I&#39;m not convinced.</p>

<p>But that could be his public narrative. Maybe he was threatened to present a relaxed explanation for the deletion. </p>

<p>His friend got murdered, and he fled to a cabin far away to lay low.</p>

<p>If he feared for his life, he would be open to negotiate for his life... like &quot;Don&#39;t tell anyone we made you delete the videos!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is a little to self centered and narcissistic for me so I wasnt subbed to his channel but I would check it a few times a month and to see what he had up. I never saw any videos of him saying anything racial, sexist, or condemning any religion or sexual oreintation. I didnt see any where he incited violence. He calls for investigations into alot of things politicians and elites are doing. Like many truthers on youtube he was getting his livestreams, notifications, sub count and ad revenue fucked with constantly. I feel bad for the guy.</p>

<p>At least this time the account is really gone. He had a habit of deleting his accounts for attention before later restoring them in the hope he&#39;d get more Patreon subscribers. He even deleted his own YouTube videos on Feb 26th last year so this is a nice anniversary.</p>

<p>He was a shill for himself.</p>
