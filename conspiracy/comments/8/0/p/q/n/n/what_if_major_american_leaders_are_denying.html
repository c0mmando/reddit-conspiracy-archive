       Nope. It's purely business. Mitigating climate change will require more spending. Which cuts into profits. All of the politicians are bought and paid for by some form of industry.

       This is why nothing is being done. Everything is about money and profit, to our own detriment we have entered a war with the natural world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy that we have been separated from nature and continue as a species with our techno-fix fix all solutions is probably one of the biggest conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also no secret that experiences with psychedelics and other substances can make the individual understand this. This being that we are a species with an identity crisis. Pulled towards technology but lamenting the destruction of the biosphere, the destruction is mass species extinction and massive degradation to the biosphere. All of these things are left in our collective wake, on our march towards the singularity.

       That would be a side affect, but it will also involve great loss of infrastructure and other development such as the currently in place water management systems.

       We don't have an accidental mass illegal immigrant program, that is how the industries who use that labor and yes recruit it via word of mouth from their own workers characterize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labor to them is nothing but a global commodity, and if they don't have what they want here in the U.S., they will bring it in from somewhere else.

       The only reason the public infrastructure is being neglected is because it is going to all be handed over to private for profit ownership.

       But, why would they want their own plants and buildings, utility systems and supply and production systems destroyed?

       So that when the world becomes inhospitable they can hoard all of the utilities needed for life in whatever bunker they've constructed for themselves using their massive wealth. It would also be why the government doesn't give a shit about mass inequality. When the world goes to shit and people start dying of malnutrition they will be hiding from it all waiting for everyone to die so that they may continue their way of life into the future.

       Perhaps a crisis such as that propels the human race into a new tech age? Maybe it's a catalyst to get us off this planet? Maybe we figure out desalination (at a effective and efficient rate)? Think larger. Sometimes you gotta work with what you got.

       Not really no. These are facts, and scientists generally try to discern what's happening based on the facts presented to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there outliers? Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the consensus and the data shows that major climate change is taking place right now and top American officials continue to deny it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it because they're bought out by lobbiests? Possibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a larger problem in the world that does not have an answer is what humanity is going to do about overpopulation. Eventually this is what will kill the Earth, so maybe a part of the denying has to do with top government officials from around the world agreeing that this will help curb the world population, allowing American officials to take the lead while saving face with their own countries, and then continuing business as usual with the Americans as if nothing has changed.

       I see what you are saying for sure. I think the flu and things like that can yearly take out more people than weather. So while I see what you are saying I can’t say That overpopulation and the denial of “climate” change is connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way it’s connected is that of what you said. If it’s overpopulation leading to direct climate change. Which I do believe is 100% true. It’s for sure causing changing. How much. Not 100% sure.

       Today you are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       But extreme weather events will get worse and continue to get bigger if our Earth warms up ESPECIALLY if it warms up really fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this past year in the Caribbean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economies will be tested and then broken as more and more destruction by natural disaster will occur. The governments have to know this. So why is the largest economy denying it in the face of easy fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could they just be that stupid? Possibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I refuse that to be true. No matter how much you hate Trump, that motherfucker worked his ass off and got the presidency for it. A man with that campaign effort cannot be an idiot. And there is no way that the public will ever know the full scope of almost any issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       And overpopulation has been the elephant in the room for decades now that nobody talks about. Possibly because it will be easier not the sympathize with the millions, and potentially billions, of people who are going to be fucked because of this? I think that's plausible. I know it sounds fucked up, but in my mind, it's plausible. Especially with the fucked up shit we've seen humans do in the past.

       Because that's how hedge funds work. Take two entities with inversely related stock prices (as one goes up in value, the other drops; and vice-versa). short-sell the falling stock (selling it then buying it back for less), allowing you to win on both ends of the hedge.

       Most green energy companies are big oil shell limited liability companies anyway. They take the government handouts given to green energy endeavors, and then funnel that money back into the parent company.

       To screw with your minds a bit follow me down this rabbit hole. I think what OP is referring to is the Georgia Guidestones. It does reference a limit on the global population of 500 million. It’s speculated these were put in place by the Club of Rome which makes logical sense. The Club of Rome commissioned a group of MIT professors to a 40 or 50 year study in 1972 on the carrying capacity of the human race on our planet. The books I read on it were “Limits to Growth”  (1992 update to the study) and “Overshot” (2002 update on the study). Needless to say we are immensely overpopulated, and the books while interesting are depressing AF. From this perspective the Club of Rome’s interest appears to be in maintaining a healthy stable population to ensure a viable planet.  Denying climate  change would fly in the face of a group highly associated with the Illuminati, who supposedly control most everything. To turn things on it’s head a bit, the reality is if we stopped using all fossil fuels tomorrow we would have massive economic collapse and global starvation never seen before. It has nothing necessarily to do with any conspiracy, it’s math. Energy throughputs is a measure of how economy’s function. Currently there is no other way publicly known to provide the energy we need to keep our economies running, feed the population, and the like without fossil fuels. So, it may be that denying climate change is a way to keep more people alive....albeit until Mother Nature fucks us all. Let that just marinade for a minute.

       I think they want to use the coming Poleshift to depopulate the planet.  If the public were warned about Nibiru Planet X then they would know that cities and coastlines will not be safe.  All the elite have to do now is call Martial Law and then let Poleshift tsunamis engulf those not allowed to escape to safe locations.  Combine this with chemtrails so the public cannot see Nibiru -- and also add a little something to these sprays so the public becomes weak and sick and thus unable to fight back!  Amirite?

       No one denies climate change. Climate always changes. What people are denying is government forced regulations and taxes to "supposedly help prevent natural disasters", due to a false narrative of global warming. Its not logical or reasonable to do so.
