       No offense but if you have been listening to Alec for years you should have come to the realization that he has been compromised for many years and most likely Cointelpro from the very beginning.  All you have to do is listen to him fake cry on 9/11 and also the video of him trying to take over a peaceful 2nd amendment rally with his bullhorn.  Those are two of about 2000 examples you could point out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex is by design the "conspiracy archetype" that the  mainstream media must put "conspiracy theorist" into a box with.  That way they can control any conspiracy narrative they want by having Alex interview/debate people and the  mainstream public will think that Alex speaks for ever "conspiracy theorist".  So when Alex goes on a crazy screaming rant it makes everyone that questions the official story seem crazy.

       He's even admitted that "half" of his family is in the CIA.  You can listen to his Y2K meltdown and realize he was controlled all the way back then and probably before.  I used to listen to him years ago and he would point out some good stuff but he has poisoned the well 1000 times over by now.  That is what his main job has been for at least the last 20 years, tell some truth but always poison the well at the end.

       They want us to not believe the Bible (and no, I am not overly religious, this is what they believe). They want us believing we are an insignificant tiny spec on one of infinite circular balls spinning around infinite suns in infinite space when in fact we are special and there are no other places like Earth. They want to disprove the Bible and make us feel powerless when in fact we are powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also want us to believe in aliens, either so we can depend on some other more intelligent life to come and save us or for us to band together and fight when intelligent life attacks. We are the only ones who can save ourselves.

       Of course it makes sense.  There is no way in the world Alex would still be alive if "the powers that be" didn't want him saying everything that he has been saying for the last 20 years.  So for that very reason Alex has to at least pretend they are trying to suppress him.  Also he isn't even banned from youtube.  Supposedly they gave him a "warning".
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you really under the impression that Alex is a  genuine honest person just looking for truth??

       Probably because what he does is 'entertainment' - not a search for truth. He's playing a character, to shift a product. I'm sure he didn't start off like that, but how he's buying eight-thousand buck Rolex watches and selling miracle juice...

       he's a gate keeper.  he'll out people like Bush and Cheney for 9/11, but he won't go all the way down the rabbit hole.  Christopher Bollyn is probably the best researcher to look in to in regards to who actually did 9/11 and what the exact political gain was.  Alex won't have him on his show or go to any of his events.  Alex is cointelpro.

       and like another poster said, he's there to represent the conspiracy theorist archetype and make us look silly.  all this isn't to say you can't get any good info out of him, but he is an establishment gate keeper that whose ultimately role is to discredit conspiracy research in the eyes of the public at large with his ridiculous performances and presentation imo.

       Its weird but the thing that always seemed off about him was not what he said but how he said it.  The way he screams and rants about topics, and then he takes a deep breath and is calm as can be.  When he's yelling and his face turns red and the veins pop out of his neck, its clearly an act.  He's not the least bit frustrated or angry.  Michael Savage and Mark Levin are two others who do the EXACT same thing.

       Coincidentally, one thing they all have in common is that none of them will ever criticize Israel for anything, which especially makes no sense in regards to Alex Jones, a so called conspiracy radio host, being that Israel was clearly behind 9/11.  If that radio silence isn't proof that Alex Jones is CIA/MOSSAD/deep state, then I don't know what is.

       I respectfully have to disagree. I don't think Alex Jones is either compromised or planted into the forefront of the Conspiracy community. He has way too much influence for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he's just a plain con artist. He makes most of his profit selling fear and overpriced products that supposedly help quell those fears. Unless he's working for the GOP, he's way too hyper partisan. I know he doesn't call himself a Republican, or even a Conservative, but his politics generally seem to say otherwise.

       Just more evidence that he is controlled.  For years he was preaching against the "left right paradigm"  and then he started openly supporting the republican party and Trump.  Obviously they are trying to tie the two archetypes together (Trump and Jones).  It is just like WWE wrestling.

      <p>
       That is just a perk he gets for the social engineering role he has played for years.  I'm sorry but if you don't think that Alex has intelligent agency ties you haven't done very much research on the subject (again he openly admitted that half of his family is CIA).  He has been publicly busted hiring interns and employees from Stratfor intelligence agency.  He has been "outing" the "elite" for over 20 years and they just let him??  Trust me if you research the subject in depth there is no way to believe that he is not a controlled asset, it's very obvious.

       I think that is giving the hundreds of millions of people on the Internet way too much credit. The fact that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who legitimately praise Alex Jones is not some unbelievable circumstance. When I say "influence," I'm not referring to just political or economic. I'm referring to his social influence. Like many large YouTube channels, he has possibly millions of followers devoted to him.

       I think that's  because people like Trump obviously would validate Jone's movement. This would inevitably attract more Conservative followers and increase his base. I think that's what it was that finally made him big enough to fit into the mainstream spotlight.

       I think we can both agree that Alex Jones is full of sh*t. He will say whatever he needs to say to try to prove a point.  That's how he debates and that's how he's become so successful at it. He throws in lies and fake sources that make debating him impossible if you presume they are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what he did in that interview, and that's what he does with his audience. Constantly lie and abuse their blind faith. He's basically just a modern cult leader.

       It doesn't really matter. You're not supposed to take anyone's info at face value. You're supposed to check into it yourself.

       He, and the documentaries &amp; projects he's been involved in, has woken up more people than any other researcher/reporter in existence.

       I'm not sure what you're getting at with this comment. The user I replied to said that infowars "regularly delivers valuable reports" and then linked this one as an example. I'm not sure what about this report is valuable. It first mentions 2 individuals who were WIDELY reported to have failed an Agent Orange study, and then tries to connect this with vaccines and autism. Note the article provides no link between the two.

       The point of a limited hangout is to make people think they're fully awake when they're really still trapped in a hypnagogic state. He may awaken people to specific issues, but he keeps people from awakening entirely on other issues, and his erratic behavior successfully keeps people from investigating the true matters he brings up.

       Gosh if only the Catholic Church didn’t have a massive history of actual pedophelia....unlike some random assed Rinky dink pizza parlor that apparently has controlled all pedophilia in the world thanks to the clintons.....

       Wait please feel free to correct me if I’m misunderstanding you. The Christians are undertaking a massive pedophelia conspiracy, yet because the Jews (I’m assuming that’s who you’re refering to as I took your “Christians right?” Comment to be sarcastic? Unless you’re referring to Christians as controlling media in which ousting themselves makes no sense) they have decided to ignore their Muslim counterparts doing the same thing, despite the Muslim faith being the largest threat to the existence of a Jewish state?
      </p>
      <p>
       Man you’re own conspiracy don’t even understand itself....quit thinking everyone is trying to deceive you. Some are, some aren’t. Some people are shitty af, some are good people. Your own conspiracy theory, at least what you allude to in your reply, cannot hold water unless you were bad enough to misphrase yourself.

       He's vowing not go back to his school (high school, supposedly) until laws are passed for gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems like a cover-up for the fact that he doesn't want to graduate from the school on his record, knowing his future will entail background checking, college applications, etc. He will work for CNN without graduating from high school with the shooting as his excuse for not wanting to complete his degree. He wasn't even in the same building as Cruz...

       I don't think he's a crisis actor or something ridiculous like that, but one of his reddit posts was an emotional condemnation of the college process, specifically about having mediocre test scores that invalidated everything else he did. I wouldn't be surprised if part of jumping for these media opportunities/political grandstanding is to better his chances for getting into a top college. And, honestly, I can't blame him (or that bald headed histrionic girl) for wanting to do so. It's only human.

       No, probably not. They won't accept him because he's rich, they'll accept him because his father donated a shit ton of money to the school. Connections via the FBI? Unless those are personal and very strong, that doesn't mean much. Harvard doesn't look at a kid and then cross reference their name with the FBI payrolls. It's much, much, much easier to grandstand on TV a month before decisions come out.

       hmm haven't seen much in the way from genuine emotion from the guy, mostly just recitation of controlled, scripted narrative.  any links to an interview where he isn't visibly reading from a teleprompter and breaks down to talk about a friend of his who was killed during the event or something similar?

       He had only been attending Parkland for a year, and he wasn't in the same building as the shooter. He also whipped out his camera DURING the shooting and interviewed fellow students about gun control as they were obviously traumatized and trying to process what was happening.

       I don't generally make a habit of watching videos of survivors of shootings to judge whether I consider their emotions genuine or not, and frankly that's a very strange thing to do.  If this guy is too emotionless and the girl is histrionic, where does that leave the appropriate response?  Why is it important to judge these people for how they are reacting to this situation?

       I didn't mean to exclude that. He can be doing both. Hell, it could be a 70-30 type of deal, where the majority of his reasons include politics, having friends die around him, etc, etc. But it is not ridiculous at all to say that going on TV to spout off liberal views and make himself an idol of purity, while also having (in his own words) shitty test scores that would hurt him in college admissions to top 20 schools, are present in his decision.

       Fair enough.  he's at least being more outgoing/ambitious about it than I might expect someone else to be and is probably considering how it makes him look to some degree.  It's just concerning to me how many people are totally willing to cast off the fact that these kids lived through a shooting at their school and are simply acting emotionlessly to promote themselves or an agenda.

       I know that, I've been intimately familiar with ivies. But the better metric would be looking at need-based financial aid percentage only. Merit based scholarships skew towards wealthier/privileged students---better teachers, better classes, better curriculum, tutors, etc are available if you have a wealthier background so it makes sense. Prove me wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, student loans also count as "financial aid". Combining all these types of aids dilutes the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying "BUT IVIZ HAVE FINANCIAL AID" doesn't necessarily imply that a majority of ivy students are poor, but it sure makes for feel-good PR.

       Its just a theory but to me it makes sense. The kid is 18 years old, made it through 11.5 years of school and is just “not going back”. Look at his ideas, the way he talks, the way he spells and forms sentences, this kid wont survive without an education. Plus, he really thinks that him not going back to high school is going to make the government take away the rights of US citizens? The whole “not going back” is just part of the plan to keep anyone from tracking him down and sort of washing his name. Its basically just destroying evidence.

       that seems ridiculous.  Word would spread around the school like wildfire if he didn't go there.  The other kids in his class would know that they've never met him before or had a class/played a sport with him, and neither has any of their friends or anybody they know.  That situation is impossible

       you are fucking retarded if you think those situations are in any way similar. theres literally hundreds of students that would sound the alarms if david hogg didn't go to that school. jesus campos is a security guard that has few co-workers. the media can not silence a school of students.

       There were so many people in my highschool, there could easily be hundreds of kids I have never seen before. Maybe he's just a kid everyone assumes they just didn't know. He's unassuming, easily blends in. Could be anyone. If he did go, could he be planted? He only was supposed to have attended for a couple of months.
      </p>
      <p>
       His history is fishy. I read an article that he was in another city on the news just a couple months beforehand. But no, that's not fishy, because he lived there then. But officially, really he was on vacation there. In the same article. So which is it? He lived there at the time or was in vacation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, students, real ones, are traumatized. Maybe they've been told, "hey we're going to out in a stand in to respresentatives you all to save you all the stress and trouble of the media"
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never been a conspiracy theorist when it comes to bombings or shootings, but the Vegas one didn't quite sit right with me and this one is
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       rotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was there a police officer's kid with a bullet proof vest at school? Why did a student insist there were two shooters, bc she heard shooting and saw the perpetrator at the same (ish) time? How can you SHOOT UP A CROWD and then blend in?! Nah fam.  Why did a teacher see a shooter in full riot gear? Did anyone find it? Ever? Where's the gear?? That would've have been ,easily, a great photo op for
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       news outlet, if the shooter DID indeed lose it before scattering. Why did he show up in an Uber? REALLY- NOONE has interviewed this Uber driver yet? For real?!
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is fucking fishy and it's crazy that very few people see it. On top of the Vegas shooting where people, in real time on social media, said there was multiple shooters, exists we're blocked and they didn't know why media was hiding it. Wonder what happened to those people?

       Agreed. But like I said, I think he was in the school a short period of time anyhow, could have been a plant? Which is a stretch, but something is definitely off.

       I don't believe that he's a crisis actor. If he was specifically chosen for this beforehand, surely they would have picked someone that wasn't such a little prick, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing likable or genuine about him, and his calls to action are so vague and childish. He's a kid pretending to be an adult.

       I think thats what makes it more believable. Kids at that age are typically dickheads. My problem with it, is that there are "graduation" pictures from 2014. Meaning grade nine =2014-2015. Grade 10=2015-2016. Grade 11 =2016-2017 grade 12 = 2017-2018. He's supposedly grade 11, 17 years old, looking the same now, as he did in the graduation pictures from 2014. 13-17 are some pretty major years for hormones and facial structure development, meaning he would not look exactly the same, even though he somehow does. This is why i believe the 22 year old crisis actor stance; he -COULD- look the same at 18 and 22, which is a lot more likely than looking the same across 4 years in the peak of puberty

       He already knew what Alex Jones thought about them. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Hoggs is welcome to his 15 minutes of fame but if he wants to go on Ellen and talk shit to everyone then he better be able to back it up or he will called a dumb shit like the dumb shit kid he is (not because he is liberal, he is 17 and most kids who are 17 are dumb shits and talk out their ass).

       Yet the unprofessional 17-year-old is being held up as some voice of reason that should open our eyes and make us demand more gun control. After all, he was in the building adjacent to where a school shooting happened.

       I can see not going on the Alex Jones show, he’s CNN material. But that tweet calling him snake oil reeks of snarky MSNBC style banter. Maybe he’s switching it up a notch.

       Alex just screams at people, even those he agrees with. He is 100% incapable of normal conversation. Look up the clip of him on the BBC. It ends in him screaming random shit and then "infowars dot com" while the host is trying to just bail out of the segment.

       I believe Hogg was a student and that he was at the school when the shooting happened.  I do not believe he is a crisis actor in any way.  I do believe that he and some of the other students are capitalizing on this tragedy for personal gain, and the media is allowing them to do so to spread a gun control narrative.

       This kid is a true bonafide political shill.
He shows no genuine emotion.
Fuck his reading of leftist talking points and fuck his punchable face.

       yup - if it's ok to fat shame a middle aged man then it's ok for me to gay shame an "in the closet" little boy.

       He's vowing not go back to his school (high school, supposedly) until laws are passed for gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems like a cover-up for the fact that he doesn't want to graduate from the school on his record, knowing his future will entail background checking, college applications, etc. He will work for CNN without graduating from high school with the shooting as his excuse for not wanting to complete his degree. He wasn't even in the same building as Cruz...

       I don't think he's a crisis actor or something ridiculous like that, but one of his reddit posts was an emotional condemnation of the college process, specifically about having mediocre test scores that invalidated everything else he did. I wouldn't be surprised if part of jumping for these media opportunities/political grandstanding is to better his chances for getting into a top college. And, honestly, I can't blame him (or that bald headed histrionic girl) for wanting to do so. It's only human.

       It's more likely that they were legitimately were affected by having people close to them die than the idea that they're going out of their way to grab attention in an inappropriate manner.  It's also notably only human.
