    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, just the bit about the CDC whistleblower in January isn&#39;t corroborated elsewhere. The only source of that story is yournewswire. Seems like they hijacked an otherwise intriguing enough story for a few extra clicks.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say this isn&#39;t a compelling story in its own rite. Definitely interesting, and I really hope they find him alive and well, though at this point the odds are definitely not in his favor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I misread what you wrote. Yes, vaccines contain viruses. The argument is that vaccines can have opposite intended effects if they&#39;re not prepared or stored carefully. Obviously, it&#39;s the responsibility of Big Pharma to monitor these safety precautions, and that&#39;s where we are today: can this trillion dollar industry regulate itself?</p>

<p>The annoying part is we use to have alternatives to the MMR vaccine until Wakefield suggested more testing on the MMR vaccine. What did the industry do? They removed all the alternatives and took away his medical license. Fucking savages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it very well could be possible.  A recent study showed that influenza vaccination makes people more prone to other respiratory illnesses.  <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/1804162/canadian-study-finds-flu-shot-could-increase-risk-of-getting-sick/">Another study</a> shows that repeated yearly flu shot uptake results in an increased risk of contracting influenza.  5 separate studies were all done on H1N1 influenza that all supported the conclusion that the seasonal flu shot made people more susceptible to H1N1 and made the symptoms more severe.  </p>

<p>Basically, being infected with certain strains of influenza can make other strains more deadly.  It is possible that the strains chosen for the flu shot basically had a &quot;deadly synergism&quot; with the prominent influenza strain this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Help me understand why people get the flu shot to begin with, aside from marketing and general sheeple-like behavior.  I&#39;m not an anti-vaxxer by any means, but the flu is a virus and they can&#39;t vaccinate you against every single strain.  Even if they could, the virus would mutate a very short time later.  So the shot may or may not do you any good.  It&#39;s also pushed VERY aggressively.  It&#39;s free where I live, and some stores will even give you a small store credit (like $5 or so) to get one.  WHY?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve literally never gotten one as an adult, and although I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t catch the occasional cold, I literally can&#39;t remember the last time I got the flu - like sick enough to (legitimately) stay home from work.</p>

<p>Anyone?</p>
