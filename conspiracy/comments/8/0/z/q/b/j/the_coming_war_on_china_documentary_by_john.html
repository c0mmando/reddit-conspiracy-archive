       I had no idea that the USA had as many military bases as this films claims it has.  And moreover i did not know that the USA has China LITERALLY surrounded by military bases.

       Very good, thought provoking documentary.

       If you're interested in the subject, check out Asia's Cauldron by Robert Kaplan. Stratfor is his brain child and he focuses a lot on Southeast Asia in his future forecasting. He provides a fair assessment of the current political and social climates

       The Thucydidean Trap. This is what we face. But what is the "trap"? It gets its' name fro mthe Greek historian Thucydides who recorded the Peloponessian war between Athens and Sparta. A key element of his Thesis (written 2400 years ago) was that both states had become Superpowers in the Greek world, creating mutual fear and apprehension between the two. This eventually lead to distrust and a 30 year war which decimated Athens and paved the way for Phillip II of Macedon (Alexanders father) to conquer Greece.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time and again throughout history the previous Super power has dealt with the rising one. Often it ends in conflict. Rome and Persia, Rome and Carthage, England and France, the Allies and Germany, England and the US. Notice how only one of those conflicts ended peacefully, and that was because of a shared language, cultural affinity, and enemy.
      </p>

       I don't think war with China is inevitable but I think that based on historical trends it is likely. It is likely that greedy, foolhardy politicians on both sides will continue to push the envelope of acceptable behavior and antagonization, stoking the inherent fears of their people, xenophobia, and domestic issues to direct the energy outwards to the "other". Both sides risk running into this trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will we rise above the trends of history? Will America accommodate the
       <em>
        reality
       </em>
       of Chinas' rise, or will we fight it? Could China and the US possible rule together, as a G2? Only time will tell...

       Just saw the trailer and it looks like filled with bullshit, some guy saying "They're not trying to run the world they only want to stop the US from dominating..." Buuuuuullshit this person obviously doesn't understand geoplitics, it's 2 competing powers that do what to run the world, that's how the world works, if it's not the US dominating, it will be China, if it's not any of them, it would be Russia, it's all a big game of the guy with the biggest stick imposing his will on the entire world, the person who says this is either complicit in the Maoist regime or just straight up dumb.
