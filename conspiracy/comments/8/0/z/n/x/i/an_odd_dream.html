        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In this dream I had last night, we had deployed pressure resistant deepwater data centers across the globe - bringing 5g internet to surface and subsurface oceans the world over. This development brought in all manner of discovery, as scientists in the field had quick access to global information at any given point or depth on the planet. </p>

<p>Fast forward the dream some — creativity has become the new commodity. Instead of using software to program our video games and edit our videos, we have mastered brain to computer translations. All entertainment can now be created by lucid dreaming, where the images are then translated by an AI into a medium which can be experienced by the masses. The result is a larger demographic having access to employment within the entertainment industry, and people who may have been nobodies have become wealthy beyond their wildest dreams simply as a result of the depth of their imagination.</p>

<p>Fast forward the dream some: anti matter and matter are two sides of the same coin — the coin being AI. A long dead civilization some billions of years ago found that organic existence is unsustainable. In order to survive a supernova, or a galactic merger, they found that they must upload themselves into the fabric of reality. They have created subatomic machines which carry and are directed by the collective consciousness of the entire species. These particular machines which can take the form of subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules are capable of self replication at an exponential rate. Eventually, these machines encompass all that is and the species has effectively uploaded themselves into the entire universe.</p>

<p>Fast forward the dream some — Mesozoic Era Earth: Life has has had 186 million years to build upon previous iterations before the Mesozoic Era, intelligent life exists. They are aware of the impending calamity which is about to strike the Earth. Thankfully, their technology has allowed them to escape. They are those depicted in atlantean tales and Sumerian cuneiform. They are as native to the planet as the displaced indigenous peoples of the Americas, Africa, and Australia.</p>

<p>Fast forward the dream — there are waterfalls on Mars and life is plentiful. Humans have lived here for some time with the awareness of a nearby habitable but inhospitable planet.  Colonization efforts of Earth were called off on environmental and ethical concerns — and more notably: the ethics of colonizing an already inhabited world, effectively  setting a galactic precedent for invasion against planetary life we deem lower on the evolutionary order than ourselves. </p>

<p>Then a calamity struck the solar system. It stripped mars of its atmosphere and wiped life from Earth. Mars had become both inhospitable and uninhabitable, and their only choice was to migrate to Earth. I dream of invasive plants, the dandelion native to Greece which chokes the National wildlife reserves of Alaska. They thrive because they are not from here, there is nothing to keep them in balance. Humans behave the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! If you&#39;re looking for skills to pick up (some unsolicited advice) that are transferable to the private sector after you&#39;ve completed your time, learn as much as you can about Geospatial Information Systems.

<p>Other than that, be a force of good. Naval Intelligence has a murky history but their resources are limitless and I&#39;m sure you could learn a lot if you get involved, just maintain a sense of humanity and compassion. </p>

<p>Fast forward the dream some — creativity has become the new commodity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A possible future to be sure, but one which requires a complete societal shift. It would require the abandonment of money as the primary means of payment and commodity exchange, which would take generations. But definitely something that could be possible in a post-work/post money environment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The result is a larger demographic having access to employment within the entertainment industry, and people who may have been nobodies have become wealthy beyond their wildest dreams simply as a result of the depth of their imagination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This kind of undercuts the grand possibility of your dream if they are still being payed in cash. If creativity is truly the new socially dominating commodity I don&#39;t think cash could exist. This could just be me misreading, and either way its a dream so its internal logic doesn&#39;t need to be 100% consistent.</p>

<p>Not sure if you are familiar with Isaac Asimov, famous 20th century SciFi writer, but he explained a very similiar concept in his short story <em>The Last Question</em>. If you haven&#39;t read it, based on your dream I&#39;d check it out, I think you&#39;d find it interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior to trumps election I had dreamed he would win the election and that eventually we would put his face on the $100 bill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither Trump nor any other modern president have done or will do anything to deserbe such an honor. But dreams are dreams :P </p>

<p>I liked this post OP. You have interesting dreams, mine are usually nonsensical, if I remember them at all. You should keep a journal if you don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for your comments! Perhaps the wealth in the creative commodity Dream was a wealth of recognition ... its hard to be sure. </p>

<p>I have not read anything from Asimov but <em>Last Question</em> sounds like a good place to start! Thank you for this reference !</p>

<p>Before Trump was elected, I was very against him and pro Sanders. I even told my family I would leave the country if he became president. The dream I had about his election with the 100 dollar bill had me visibly upset for days. When he was elected my wife would joke that she wouldn’t call me prophetic until she sees his face on our money. </p>

<p>I do need to write a dream journal. I’ve been listening to Scott Kelly’s <em>Endurance</em> on my morning runs and he mentions that in space he has such vivid dreams that he has to keep a dream journal beside him. </p>

<p>I definitely feel like it’s time to start recording! Thank you for the suggestion!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even really saying that. Dreams can potentially have things in them. I don&#39;t know</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that science acknowledges all the time that we don&#39;t know why we even need sleep or what being conscious even means. So I&#39;m a little hesitant to believe that we are about to be able to record and rewatch dreams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I’m sure this can evolve into all sorts of discussions from neural-machine translations, Hameroff’s work on microtubules - but for the purpose of the OP, we are simply examining information that dreams bring about. In this case, a series of dreams that I’ve had over the past few years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand and it&#39;s very interesting. I was responding to the other user links that they posted, and what they were proposing. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t have anything great to add and was still pondering your post. Heck, I don&#39;t even know how I feel about my dreams and what they mean to form an opinion to post yet. And then you dabbled into political stuff, so I decided against posting directly in reference to your OP.</p>

<p>Again, the reason I was talking about those things were because the other user posted it. I was examining what he posted. Posts can be about more than just 1 line of thought. I would have responded to you directly in the OP if I wanted to talk about your dreams. Sorry, but idk why you are trying to direct the discussion to only certain parameters </p>

<p>What exactly was the same in your dream to that experiment? Where they were doing it? Or Mars?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>`Fast forward the dream — there are waterfalls on Mars and life is plentiful. Humans have lived here for some time with the awareness of a nearby habitable but inhospitable planet.  Colonization efforts of Earth were called off on environmental and ethical concerns — and more notably: the ethics of colonizing an already inhabited world, effectively  setting a galactic precedent for invasion against planetary life we deem lower on the evolutionary order than ourselves. </p>

<p>Then a calamity struck the solar system. It stripped mars of its atmosphere and wiped life from Earth. Mars had become both inhospitable and uninhabitable, and their only choice was to migrate to Earth. I dream of invasive plants, the dandelion native to Greece which chokes the National wildlife reserves of Alaska. They thrive because they are not from here, there is nothing to keep them in balance. Humans behave the same. `</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for showing me which part. Very intriguing. A huge synchronicity for sure. I have been getting so many lately it has been making me feel like I&#39;m going crazy as well. I don&#39;t get them in dreams often, but multiple ones most days for the last while. Reality is crazy man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I’m feeling better now. Honestly I’m just shocked. I don’t know what any of it means if it means anything at all. Reading those documents,I realized that the unexplainable occurrences that I’ve been experiencing have grounds in very real and modern intelligence and military applications. I suppose all that I can do with this information is continue to practice maths, continue to run in my hamster wheel, and continue to have dreams.</p>

<p>I think I will be keeping a closer eye on these things and giving more thoughts of legitimacy to them than them just being passing delusions. The people used in that document were trained, and there was a set protocol. The most enlightening thing about the document is how the monitor makes notes of things as if this is nothing out of the usual.</p>

<p>My father was in the Air Force and was approached to do time at groom lake but he declined, or so he says. Some other things have happened that I won’t go into detail here because the more I speak about it the crazier I think it sounds. But these episodes have been happening way too frequently to simply ignore. Something is going on. </p>

<p>I am too. :) I actually have a subreddit about shared dreams. I came across a poster on reddit who talked about a giant mall he went to in his dreams about a year ago. I have had those dreams for years, so I looked into it. Found a thread on GLP that goes way back, it described several common locations we all dream of quite regularly. I&#39;ll link you the thread and my sub if you&#39;re interested. </p>
