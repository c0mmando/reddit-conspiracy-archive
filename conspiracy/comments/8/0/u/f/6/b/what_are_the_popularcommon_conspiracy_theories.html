<p>I seem to upvote you quit a bit but if you still believe in the magical spinning ball Earth you haven&#39;t done enough research on subject in my opinion.  </p>

<p>At least you admit that the heliocentirsm theory is full of holes.  I don&#39;t claim to know exactly the reality we live in but I do know that you must have a giant leap of faith to believe in a spinning ball earth with water stuck to it.  If we really did live on a 1000mph spinning ball there should be detectable, measurable curvature and motion of the earth, but there is neither.  </p>

<p>So if you don&#39;t think the Earth is a magic spinning ball or flat what is your opinion?  I&#39;ve been researching the movement for almost 4 years so I&#39;m interested on what you think is not &quot;cray cray&quot; when it comes to the Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m only going by evidence that I can see and test for myself.  I&#39;m open to where ever that leads.  As of now I see no evidence of a spinning ball Earth.  </p>

<p>The physics of water shows that water always finds its lowest point and becomes level, regardless of the scale (size of the body of water).  So since the oceans are all level water and most (if not all) evidence I can find also points to a flat surface and there is no evidence of a spinning ball, what conclusion should I come to?
To repeat my last question, if it isn&#39;t spinning ball or flat what shape do you think the Earth is?  (Hopefully you aren&#39;t just going to say &quot;simulation theory&quot; because of course that could be possible but is pretty much a side topic)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, user step2thejep has an new strategy. He made this post to then try to pick fights with people.</p>

<p>He replied to you below with a link saying flat earth is crazy, how could you believe it... but then said he doubted the &quot;official story&quot; about heliocentrism.</p>

<p>That link he inserted is why he is here, because that link is to his won website. He got banned from cryptocurrency sites for spamming his videos, so he tried to post them here but got no upvotes, so he now tries to inject them into discussions.</p>

<p>Why does he do this? Well because he is likely John Le Bon and that is his website which if you notice, is largely behind a paywall... that is right, for a mere $20+/mo he will give you his wisdom. He spams this link because its one of the few paid essays on his site. </p>

<p>Most of his theories come from not understanding basic science and ignorance, but to sum up his beliefs he does not believe that in evolution, dinosaurs, atoms, space, planets, a round earth, the sun, all of history, missiles, nukes, all wars, conflicts and mass casualty events (he claims no one dies in any current wars, conflicts, attacks) etc.</p>

<p>His style of debate is condescension, moving goal posts, asking impossible proof like a 3 yearold playing the &quot;why game&quot; and never offering his own substance.  </p>

<p>tl;dr step2thejep is john le bon, he is here to shill his own website/ videos which he charges money for and if you engage him in debate he is a condescending moron who is great example of the dunning kugger effect. </p>

<p>Hillary had the help of the DNC, DOJ, FBI, 90% of the MSM, and doubled Trump in campaign spending.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an army of 13 Russian internet trolls, with no connection to Trump, were able to swing the election in his favor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>US Media put Trump on 247 with only light critical questioning until Sanders the &#39;evil&#39; socialist got cheated out of the democratic nomination. Then within the day the media started going after Trump critically.</p>

<p>That shit was planned to keep attention off of Clinton until they could get rid of Sanders.</p>

<p>US media advertised Trump night &amp; day. UNPRECEDENTED.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but all of the media coverage was negative. They clearly favored Hillary. In Wikileaks it showed that the DNC colluded with the MSM in order to &quot;elevate&quot; Trump. They wanted him to win the primary because they thought they could tear him down in the general. With the grab her by the pussy tape and whatnot.</p>
