Decades ago humanity cloned a sheep and ever since then there has been almost no word of progress into cloning humans. Sure there is ethical considerations which I&#39;m sure are ignored by covert governmental installations and intelligence agencies. So why have we heard nothing? I doubt TPTB simply decided not to develop the technology.  Sure there exist laboratories on this planet that are actively engaged in cloning human beings. </p>

<p>Have any whistleblowers come forward with information about human cloning? Was it available during world war 2? Are films like &#39;The Island&#39; Hollywood disclosure of such things? </p>

<p>So going back to an earlier comment, now you can see people who have souls and people who don&#39;t? And what does NDE or religion have to do with cloning in the first place? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t, the NDE happened really fast and I explored eslewhere. If anything, I noticed some people shined brighter than others when I was pure bodiless consciousness, but I dont know if that is a correlation to soullessness. </p>

<p>And what does NDE or religion have to do with cloning in the first place?</p>

<p>Its a theory. Perhaps &quot;souls&quot; only exist within certain frameworks and rules of existence. For example, those who are religious, would argue that a computer, as a machine, doesnt have a soul.</p>

<p>Perhaps &quot;souls&quot; require certain circumstances to be in place to manifest, and if those circumstances are not met, then you get something akin to just a mechanical computer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very cold, and indifferent, but well spoken and far more intelligent than I anyone I&#39;ve ever spoken with in my entire life. They spoke on a different level. More to the core and soul, and knew everything about me. </p>

<p>We humans have empathy, which stems from our Soul Beings. These &quot;creatures&quot; (I don&#39;t like calling them that, but, it&#39;s the best word I can come up with about them - they are not humans), are very different. They predate &quot;us&quot;, and know us very well. There truly is not &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; in the Astral Realm, and they re-affirmed, this, however... There is always a price you must pay.</p>

<p>This particular gentleman (which I won&#39;t go into too much detail about - because of personal bloodlines) told me, they were between 200-300 years old, at least.</p>

<p>Take it for however you want (I don&#39;t care either way), but, I&#39;m not bullshitting... Anyways, hope that answers your question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would the purpose of cloning be? We clone mice so that we have a very good control group. We can clone livestock so that we have the best producing herd. We clone fruits so they have a consistent taste and texture. There is not benefit to cloning humans. We already produce twins and triplets through fertilization therapies. Cloning would be the same except the twin is born decades later. </p>

<p>If you have sufficient technology to do that you can easily achieve whatever goal you have with more ethical, cheaper, and less risky methods. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we don&#39;t hear about it because were intended to forget it&#39;s a thing. Only reserved for studying extinct species, and saving species from extinction.</p>

<p>Was watching a documentary series, through the wormhole, I&#39;m pretty sure of the name, might have been the sequel with a related name. I can&#39;t remember exactly. In any case the episode centered around cloning or DNA or something.</p>

<p>There was this one scientist they were interviewing for a while. He basically said it&#39;s entirely possible to clone people, no problem, the technical aspects have all been figured out... The only thing is the ethics part. </p>

<p>The way this scientist kind of smiled, or had subtle a smug expression, when he said the hang up was only ethics, was very telling. I strongly feel that he has cloned people already. Maybe on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The hole doc series felt like a limited hang out. I think most things in media are. Powers wouldn&#39;t let the information out unless they had already figured out something better, making the release mostly irrelevant. Necessary to show a marked progress of technological achievement to keep things believable to the general public.</p>

<p>I think people are less interested in cloning because that just makes a copy. Cool, sure. Really what people want is to improve themselves on a genetic level, genetic editing. Making the need for procreation largely irrelevant. Clones would be useful only once they have achieved what someone deems genetic perfection in their eyes. A back up clone, available to be used in an emergency. Hybridization with other species is highly likely to be part of the process too.</p>

<p>What do you think the military/government who have 50+ years of Nazi mind control research would do with a cloned human?</p>

<p>Try to create a hyper-aggressive super soldier maybe? A clone army? </p>

<p>That being said. You and I do not have access to the same technology and information as people having their DNA edited or being cloned. What feels like centuries to use may well be a regular process for the powerful elite.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say it&#39;s not common though. If they can pretty much grant immortality via gene editing it would be entirely possible to wait centuries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are saying. There is a possibility, albeit very small, that the elite actually have gene editing technology to be immortal. </p>

<p>The current technologies we know about seem to point that&#39;s not true. Gene editing right now can only add stuff to the middle of a DNA sequence. Tellomeres can&#39;t be repaired yet. Even so we don&#39;t have nanobots than can edit all genes at once. </p>

<p>I have the same fears as you, that the elite already achieved immortatility and what we do is futile, but the evidence up until now seems to show that is not the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The technology exists and it can be done. The issue becomes should it be done. As previous comments have mentioned, it is banned internationally with large penalties. </p>

<p>The other reason is ethical. I remember watch a program on cloning and the scientist they interviewed spoke about how we could do it but the scientific community feels it would be unethical to do so. There are too many unknowns about what would happen to the clone to be willing to do it. With sheep, if it lives in agony, well it’s an animal so oh well. But with a human clone, you’d be choosing to let a human being suffer in agony. No respectable scientist will do that. </p>

<p>Now this isn’t to say it’s not being tried somewhere in a black market type situation. We all know that TBTP would benefit personally from this and have the resources to make it work. </p>

<p>As for the mainstream, look for more work on growing human organs in the lab. Cheaper than full human cloning, less waste (why pay for everything when you only need one piece?), and more less ethically challenging. With the advent of 3D printing of living cells, this avenue will be much more profitable for companies. Who would want to pay for 24/7 storage on an entire body when you can print the organ you need in a day or so?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eventually the sheep were fine. That’s not how it started. There was major issues when the began the program. Which is where the ethical dilemma comes in for scientists today. Dealing with the early stage issues for a human clone. </p>

<p>the cost of lab grown organs will continue to fall as the technology improves. Within 15-20 years, you’ll be able to buy an organ in a few hours and have it be a perfect match to your body. </p>

<p>As for pig organ farms, again storage becomes an issue. Yeah we could do it but if there are cheaper and faster and more efficient alternatives, why would we? It’s like opening a new coal plant today. Yeah we could do it, but there are better options </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main benefit of cloning people might be to enable the rich to harvest organs or have multiple people for public appearances. Given the advent of the smartphone and cameras, the second is much harder and of a lower benefit, especially as a clone made of a famous person would be much younger.</p>

<p>Cloning for organs would be very unethical, would take a long time to raise a person to harvest them when you can just abduct people in developing countries instead.
The amount of smart people involved to make it happen would easily <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147905">lead to a leak</a>. It would only take a few people to pull it off.</p>

<p>Gene doping on the other hand, that&#39;s a similar technology where I&#39;m sure a country like China is using it for it&#39;s athletes, given that it would be undetectable unless you compared people to younger samples of their own DNA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever see The Island? It&#39;s a Hollywood movie about clones. The way they run it in the movie, it&#39;s basically an insurance program. They raise the clones to maturity and keep them contained in case their organs are ever needed. You&#39;re right that there are better ways that work OK, but I could definitely see something like that being used by the wealthy in the future. Seems like the kind of gross shit they&#39;d be down for, just to be sure that if they ever need a new organ, they&#39;ll have one that&#39;s a perfect match. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I have the seen the film, it&#39;s great! </p>

<p>But again, that would entail on the order of 100&#39;s - 1000&#39;s of people to keep quiet about some very obviously secretive unethical program/business, why would a government do this as a service? So they couldn&#39;t even use the state apparatus to suppress dissident.
Also given that it would take 10-15 years for a clone to be big enough to harvest (Sorry for writing this, killing a human for organs is disgusting) so thats even more time for it to leak. </p>

<p>Most people who want to live to 80+ in good health need to lay off the alcohol, smoking, drugs, meat, sugar, risky lifestyle (e.g. <a href="https://www.tetongravity.com/story/adventure/your-chances-of-dying-ranked-by-sport-and-activity">hang gliding</a>), avoid carcinogens, STDs, avoid carcinogens and eat a whole plants food based diet with exercise.
Don&#39;t even need to be rich to do it!</p>

<p>So I highly doubt human cloning for this.</p>

<p>&quot;The Inherent Bad Faith Model&quot; of the enemy dictates that he is always plotting, planning and developing strategies for &quot;our&quot; demise. Therefore, to combat and defend oneself, to develop counter-strategies, &quot;we&quot; must dive deeply into the haunted mind and imagine, then make, the monsters that we fear &quot;they&quot; are making.</p>

<p>Certain human freaks with bad but brilliant brains don&#39;t need much coaxing. Their imaginations are writhing continuously with horrifying, Lovecraftian, even worse, fears and the orgiastic release from same...only to be replaced by worse horrors. A hint is all it takes to get them going. Show them a double muscled bull and their mind goes immediately to making a <em>man</em> like that. It&#39;s a short hop to chimera man/beast/machine monstrosities. After all, what if &quot;they&quot; do it first?!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always wonder if cloning is the end goal for some of these mega ancestry dna websites. I read an article where scientists had compiled the complete DNA code of a person by using over 100 dna codes of his ancestors. I am wondering if they&#39;re trying to gather enough ancestors of certain people, maybe historically relevant individuals, to clone them. Einstein, Turing, etc etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If cloning is happening, they&#39;re probably cloning people in closed societies that have tight information control - like China.  To grow a clone, you need a human uterus, so if you want to clone multiple people, you&#39;d need to warehouse a bunch of women somewhere.</p>

<p>But, I think that humans are so cheap, that it&#39;s not cost-effective to clone them.  They have human trafficking all over, orphans and refugees.  There are some countries where mothers will sell their own children because they can&#39;t afford them.  The problem is that we have too many humans, not too few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason we don&#39;t hear about it is because it makes people uncomfortable (especially the religious). Anecdotal: twenty years ago I discussed cloning with a dairy science grad student. He said they cloned live stock all the time and that cloning a person wouldn&#39;t be that big a deal if you didn&#39;t mind sorting through the defective attempts and embryos (this wouldn&#39;t bother me at all(people don&#39;t give much of a damn about abortion, dropping bombs on people, and poisoning the environment aka people). I&#39;d like to reproduce through cloning. I think it would be cool to raise a genetic copy of myself.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eventually the sheep were fine. That’s not how it started. There was major issues when the began the program. Which is where the ethical dilemma comes in for scientists today. Dealing with the early stage issues for a human clone. </p>

<p>the cost of lab grown organs will continue to fall as the technology improves. Within 15-20 years, you’ll be able to buy an organ in a few hours and have it be a perfect match to your body. </p>

<p>As for pig organ farms, again storage becomes an issue. Yeah we could do it but if there are cheaper and faster and more efficient alternatives, why would we? It’s like opening a new coal plant today. Yeah we could do it, but there are better options </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main benefit of cloning people might be to enable the rich to harvest organs or have multiple people for public appearances. Given the advent of the smartphone and cameras, the second is much harder and of a lower benefit, especially as a clone made of a famous person would be much younger.</p>

<p>Cloning for organs would be very unethical, would take a long time to raise a person to harvest them when you can just abduct people in developing countries instead.
The amount of smart people involved to make it happen would easily <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147905">lead to a leak</a>. It would only take a few people to pull it off.</p>

<p>Gene doping on the other hand, that&#39;s a similar technology where I&#39;m sure a country like China is using it for it&#39;s athletes, given that it would be undetectable unless you compared people to younger samples of their own DNA.</p>
