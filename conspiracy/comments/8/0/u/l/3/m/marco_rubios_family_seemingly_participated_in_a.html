       Marco Rubio has suffered several allegations of being involved in pedophilia by Timothy Holmseth, who was arrested in Broward County just after the recent shooting. The arrest was purportedly triggered by Holmseth posting some court documentation on his youtube channel. That link is now gone and I was banned for posting it on 8chan's pol, in their Pizzagate thread. A judge in Minnesota found his audio recordings of child trafficking by law enforcement to be credible and vacated all court orders restraining Holmseth in December.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holmseth also mentions Marco Rubio's brother in law, who had was caught up in international drug smuggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marco Rubio's brother-in-law was the 'front man for an international drug-smuggling ring led by leopard-loving "cocaine cowboy" kingpin whose mansion was filled with big cats and a giraffe'

       Seems weird. It also should shock everyone that Rubio's family was involved in this drug smuggling operation WITH FLORIDA POLICE who were never named.

       True, but all scumbags need to be exposed regardless.  I don't think anyone gets this high in politics without shady family connection.

       Friendly reminder the NRA is entirely privately funded by citizens to protect the 2nd amendment. I dont think its a coincidence people find a corrupt connection between a florida politician and florida police after the disaster that is the broward county (read as: debbie wasserman schultz' district) sheriffs department starts to make national news.

       I stumbled on it as a result of the news of Holmseth's arrest. I certainly did not post it as part of an agenda, as I was going to include it in a snippet in a write up I'm working on about Liddle Kidz, which seems like a really bizarre organization backed by people of some kind of "touch tribe."

       They rent out places in hospitals to teach their classes to add legitimacy to their services, but they don't actually seem to be endorsed by any hospitals.

       Then there are things like "oral stimulation" of your infant which is okay for children with cererbral palsy who have drooling problems, but there is no reason to orally stimulate healthy children and certainly not by strangers.
