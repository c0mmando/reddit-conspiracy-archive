        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;d like to preface this post by saying that Sandy Hook was a fucking hoax, anyone who has actually researched it for an hour or more will agree to that. For those who haven&#39;t researched it, and think that children died at Sandy Hook there are some great documentaries about it which are absolutely devastating to the official narrative- <a href="https://youtu.be/ols9h8cJOfo">1</a> <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x56fnjy">2</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/btNM3a05R0k">3</a> - I ask that you please watch them <em>BEFORE</em> commenting and parroting the mainstream mockingbird CIA whore media&#39;s version of the event. There is a good reason why so many people believe Sandy Hook IN PARTICULAR, was fake, out of all of the mass shootings that they could have chosen to say is fake, and it&#39;s not because we all enjoy being disrespectful to dead children and their grieving families for fuck&#39;s sake.
The question that I have is <strong>Why hasn&#39;t the NRA called bullshit on the Sandy Hook Hoax?</strong> Given the fact that the government has been caught staging a fake shooting involving children in a clear attempt to infringe on the Second Amendment and there are so many anomalies and lack of concrete evidence to prove that the shooting never really took place, then why hasn&#39;t the NRA raised hell about it? I think it&#39;s because it would be so incredibly damaging to the entire system if it was revealed to the sleeping masses that it was all just a big fat phony hoax, the government would lose all credibility if the truth were actually forced to come out in a Supreme Court lawsuit and there would probably be utter chaos... but I want to know what you all think in regards to why the NRA hasn&#39;t exposed the Sandy Hook Hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% certainty is not required for a belief to be reasonable.  If there is a preponderance of evidence and that evidence indicates that something is &quot;more likely than not&quot; then that is sufficient.</p>

<p>100% certainty would require the elimination of the possibility that new evidence could be discovered later that would necessitate revision of the belief.  The only way to preclude the discovery of such evidence would be to possess all knowledge of a subject so that it is already factored in to the original belief.  Thus, 100% certainty would require possession of 100% of the evidence and this is an impossibility.</p>

I don&#39;t think the Government will admit to any false flag because if they admit to one then a snowball effect will occur and every false flag that has hapened will float to the surface. I don&#39;t think people would over throw the government but what do you think would happen if the FBi/CIA admitted to 9/11, Sandy Hook, Vegas, and now parkland? I could see less people trusting the gov but i dont see any type of revolution happening, just to many people are comfortable in their daily lives to revolt.</p>

Most of them are parasites capitalizing on tragedy. The others are just pathetic losers that obviously aren&#39;t getting the attention they think they deserve in real life. F*ck these people.

    <div class="md"><p>So, if you think debunking alex jones has any relation to anything beyond alex jones being a state-sponsored ignorant twat, you have a lot of wool over your eyes.</p>

<p>Alex jones is A limited hangout. He is the guy they use to make you think that if you question official narratives that you must be a crazy person like him.</p>

<p>Just look at the most famous alex jones quote &#39;they&#39;re turning the frogs gay!&#39;   He&#39;s wrong, but he&#39;s in the ballpark. He&#39;s referencing glyphosphate(roundup) causing hermaphrodism in frogs.   Glyphosphate is a problem in the US(not just because of the frogs, seriously research glyphosphate) and is banned in other developed countries, but no one listens to you about anything when you&#39;re yelling about them making our frogs gay.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the NRA doesn&#39;t call it out because they&#39;ll lose credibility in the eyes of joe schmoe. until most people are awakened to the situation it&#39;ll be an odd game of &quot;we know but can&#39;t say&quot;.</p>

<p>more importantly it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a hoax, FF or real - all can be engineered for the same effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sandy hook or Las Vegas narrative are both easy call outs, but the NRA isn’t innocent. Along with the bleeding greed that stretches across those in power the lies are irrelevant. The data is privatized, and the evidence hidden. The following three years of sandy hook were one gun story after the next. Then the election cycle occurred and it went dead silent. Now the cycle is over and we go back to the original programming. “Be scared”. Brought to you by every political party because every single person is corrupted by capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering that gunsales go up everytime people fear that there may be stricter gun regulations coming (which in the end never happen) they profit from the narrative true or not. </p>

<p>Last thing I heard in the news about firearmsales before this shooting happened was that they were going down because now that Trump was President people do not fear stricter gun regulations anymore so the demand went down so far that even Remmington is insolvent now.</p>

<p>I am not saying they have anything to do with what happened. I just say that having gun regulation talk in public creates a climate in which more people will buy firearms. So they just let it flow knowing that in the end nothing will change anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simple reason why the NRA wouldn&#39;t publicly support exposure of the Sandy Hook hoax is that the news media has inoculated the public against believing what they identify as &quot;conspiracy theories.&quot;  During the time it took to expose the true facts about Sandy Hook, many members would quit without even examining the facts in order to avoid ridicule for being affiliated with media demonized &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot;  Unfortunately,  in modern America, it has become less common to find people willing to investigate things on their own and not let the &quot;herd&quot; of TV-controlled public opinion be their sole guide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>News flash, the NRA believes mass shootings are real. You can do them too if you wanted. No seriously, if you have 2000 dollars you can kill nearly a hundred people give or take. Obviously less with MORE OR LESS guns. Either option kinda works but the more guns solution requires socialist money to get more police and maybe even private security to deter gun violence. With less guns what&#39;s the difference they always say. Well with the amount already pumped into the entire country it&#39;s just not feasible to round up guns. The solution is a fucked up more guns scenario. </p>

<p>I would like to think of it like final fantasy. Nearly everyone can fight or do some sort of magic to fight. Obviously the stronger of us need to protect the others. </p>
