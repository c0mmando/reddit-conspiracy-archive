Such as the works in Peru where the giant blocks are laid in patterns reflecting the likeness of various animal. That is one way to recognize true megalithic prowess from the cargo cult. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_masonry">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_masonry</a></p>

<p>The historians have tried to paint a picture of northeast Asia as rustic and wooden. When that couldn&#39;t be furthest thing from the truth. We see huge megalithic ruins far north . Very fine brick work often times 2 meters thick. And the surviving temples often have cast iron floors that never rust. </p>

<p>Globally we have this phenomenon of out of place skill and material. Sometimes we read about Siberian hard wood used to make elaborate carpentry work by anonymous builder such is the case with the Loretto staircase .</p>

<p>In Russia they have one of a kind massive granite bath tub.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t say this. This is what the uneducated, general public believes. </p>

<p>The past century of scientific work in these fields has completely debunked the idea that ancient and non-state societies are cognitively inferior to ourselves. The only differences are in social organization, population density, and the accompanying rapid genesis/spread of novel ideas/technologies.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s dishonest to suggest that there are &quot;no explanations&quot; for how ancient stuff was built when experts have dedicated their careers to this very question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there was a worldwide flood event around 11000 years ago speculated to have been caused by a meteor impact. sea levels rose dramatically(about 400ft iirc). being that a huge percentage of the world population lives near the coast, a dramatic rise in sea level would likely make it seem as if the entire world had flooded. the bible story is just the story of one guy but many people survived around the globe. many cultures have similar flood stories such as the austrailian aborigines who have oral traditions that describe land masses that would have been visible before the flood but are now submerged.</p>

<p>The nanodiamond stuff is alot sketchier than you think. A lot of the nanodiamond reports, specifically of finding a distinct layer of Lonsdaleite which is evidence of impact, couldn&#39;t be replicated. Graphane is very easily mistaken for Lonsdaleite and nanocrystalline copper can also be mistaken for nanodiamonds. As cliche as it is to say, more research is needed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s certainly true. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some of these tight formations, specifically Incan constructions. I began wondering if maybe they got several large rocks, and carved them simultaneously to make them fit together. Actually fitting them into a carved slot would be very tricky, but it&#39;s difficult to say what angles they did this at... For example, a fitting which looks impossible standing up may be simple if the rocks are lying down. I think with a lot of time and effort it&#39;s not that hard. Moving the rocks to the location on the other hand, I don&#39;t see a solution for besides overwhelming manpower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find these things fascinating. But I hesitate to agree that we&#39;ve been lied to about our ancient history. Certainly we are largely ignorant, but i think there&#39;s a plethora of other explanations. My favourite is the paranoid engineer: a hypothetical character type which would hide exactly how they created something. I&#39;ve met people like this, who take pleasure in showing others their works and watching them ineffectually try to figure it out.</p>

<p>I also think another reason for these mysteries is the modern perspective of hurrying. These megalithic constructions appear more impressive because we find it hard to imagine building something over many decades or even lifetimes. Labour was valued differently in the past.</p>

<p>It is obvious that ancient people had greater skill than many give them credit for, but I tend to think this as an indictment of the modern ego-supremacy more than evidence of the ancients being super advanced.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about that.  I mean, sure they had cell phones that doubled as mobile computers, but have you seen the UIs?  More primitive than early Android.</p>

Who knows if we never had a very advanced civilization that was wiped out and couple of 0000 years later we start advancing again.</p>

<p>Those images are from a church in the city of Yaroslav near Moscow. They have nothing to do with ancient temples in Siberia. In fact all of those images are Orthodox churches.</p>

<p>Hell there&#39;s a bloody watermark even showing where the pictures are from.</p>
