        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Source Article: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/donald-trump-video-games-violence-florida-school-shooting-gun-control-nra-gamers-a8228611.html">DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WILL &#39;DO SOMETHING&#39; TO STOP DANGER OF VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/80d24o/donald_trump_says_he_will_do_something_to_stop/">This headline also reached the front page of our subreddit and has filled with the usual reactionary Trump hate comments.</a></p>

<p>Lets look at the actual Trump quote from the article:</p>

<p>&quot;We have to look at the Internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds and their minds are being formed, and we have to <strong>do something</strong> about maybe what they’re seeing and how they’re seeing it,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts. And you go the further step, and that’s the movies. You see these movies, and they’re so violent. And yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn’t involved, but killing is involved, and maybe they have to put a rating system for that.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>So the &quot;journalist&quot; decided to cherry pick the words &quot;do something&quot; from the first paragraph. Those words were clearly in reference to the what kids see on the internet. </p>

<p>Anybody who actually read the article can see that.</p>

<p>Trump does go on to mention video games and movies, but I fail to see how the &quot;journalist&quot; can then copy and paste the phrase &quot;do something&quot; and attribute it to a completely new set of thoughts.</p>

<p>And that is how we arrived at the blatantly alarmist and vague headline: &quot;DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WILL &#39;DO SOMETHING&#39; TO STOP DANGER OF VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES&quot;.</p>

<p>Because what better way to get people whipped into a frenzy than to pretend Trump is planning to come after their games.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like a distinction without a difference.</p>

<p>He expresses a willingness to do something about what kids see on the internet. He says roughly the same things, regarding what they&#39;re seeing, about video games and movies as well. </p>

<p>Sure, he didn&#39;t explicitly say he&#39;d do something about video games, but I&#39;d ask this: why wouldn&#39;t he, given the logic of the statement regarding the internet? Are we supposed to believe that Trump would &quot;do something&quot; about the internet, but he&#39;d hold <em>video games</em> to be sacred and untouchable? If so, why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully understand that this headline claimed something that Trump did not explicitly say.</p>

<p>However, my point is that it&#39;s kind of trivial in this case, since it&#39;s pretty easy to infer from Trump&#39;s intent to &quot;do something&quot; about the internet that he&#39;d not hesitate to do something similar to video games, following the same logic.</p>

<p>I guess I think Trump&#39;s willingness to &quot;do something&quot; to <em>any</em> medium &quot;for the kids&quot; is 10x more troubling to me than a misleading headline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still don&#39;t get my point. </p>

<p>I understand that they are two different headlines, one of which is true, the other not. However, my point is that <em>even with the accurate headline</em> it&#39;d be entirely reasonable to infer he&#39;d be willing to do similar things about video games.</p>

<p><em>Donald Trump says the internet is X, Y, and Z, and based on that he will do A.</em></p>

<p><em>Donald Trump says video games are X, Y and Z.</em></p>

<p>He made no remark to distinguish video games from the internet, to explain why he&#39;d take an action A with the internet but not with other things (Games, movies) which share the same characteristics.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re going out of your way to make this about the headline, when the actual content of what Trump said is way, way more alarming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a press conference about policy responses to mass shootings.</p>

<p>Trump remarks that the internet has a negative influence and, based on that, something should be done.</p>

<p>In either the same or next sentence (depending on how you punctuate his spoken words), he remarks on the negative influence of video games.</p>

<p>So tell me this. If Trump isn&#39;t open to enacting policies related to video games, because they have a bad influence on kids, then...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would he bring them up in a presser about policy responses to mass shootings at all? Just rambling for no reason?</p></li>
<li><p>Why would he be open to policies on the internet for sharing the same quality of having a bad influence? Why the internet, but not video games?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t see a reason to conclude Trump isn&#39;t open to enacting policies on video games, unless the argument is that nothing he says can be logically analyzed in the same way we&#39;d analyze the words of literally any other adult with a functioning brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah. You&#39;ve mischaracterized me multiple times. I never once in this entire thread said I think the headline is not misleading. Never once. In fact I went out of my way multiple times to say that I agree it&#39;s misleading, and to distinguish that from the argument I&#39;m making about Trump&#39;s actual, spoken remarks. </p>

<p>You keep strawmanning me regardless, when you aren&#39;t feigning indignation about what that strawman is doing. </p>

<p>Anything and everything you can do to avoid talking about the actual content of Trump&#39;s remarks.</p>
