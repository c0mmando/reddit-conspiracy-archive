        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Teachers just told us there would be simulated gunshots and we‚Äôd be locked in the rooms around 6th period today... Should I get the fuck out? By the way this is completely serious, I‚Äôm not trolling at all. It‚Äôs highly likely this really is just gonna be a drill because we‚Äôve had a few threats in the district and even a few arrests within the past few weeks, but I‚Äôm a bit skeptical because from what I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs exactly what happened at both Sandy and Stoneman. I know this isn‚Äôt really a conspiracy but I‚Äôm posting just in case something really goes down so you guys here can have some concrete evidence.</p>

<p>UPDATE 1 - Everything I know so far</p>

<ol>
<li>No listing of drill on any school media</li>
<li>Parents were not notified before hand</li>
<li>Drill will occur at 2:20</li>
<li>3 teachers I have talked to know nothing about it</li>
<li>Mom called principal and principal denied simulated gunshots but many teachers have told classmates about them </li>
</ol>

<p>UPDATE 2 </p>

<p>Ok so I got in my car and left at 2:17, haven‚Äôt heard word from anyone yet, I recorded my exit which I‚Äôll post on here in a second, I had no trouble leaving other than a teacher who attempted to intimidate me into staying and made a derogatory comment about both my ‚Äúparanoia‚Äù and my Winchester hat...</p>

<p>FINAL UPDATE </p>

<p>Alright guys, my friends and my teachers are all safe! The drill went on a bit longer than usual, spanning a total of 20 minutes, loud noises were heard but from what I‚Äôm hearing from my friends they were just teachers walking around smashing desks into the floor really hard. Thanks for all the concerns, for now, we‚Äôre A OK üëåüèª </p>

<p>Oh also, one side note, I‚Äôm not uploading my exit now because it‚Äôs taking way too long to upload and it‚Äôs really not that important anymore</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of whether this becomes an actual threat or not, I think we can all agree that students should be able to opt out of a drill that contains simulated gunfire. It‚Äôs hard to do that if you don‚Äôt announce it until the day of. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if lots of kids at OP‚Äôs school call their parents and have them come to get them. I‚Äôm a teacher and some of my colleagues are combat veterans and former law enforcement. Should we ask them to sit through simulated gunfire as well? Shouldn‚Äôt they be allowed to opt out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the sentiment of ‚Äúquestion everything‚Äù, but you do need to establish a threshold after which you say ‚Äúit is <em>more</em> <em>probable</em> that this is real rather than a fabrication‚Äù. </p>

<p>There is always a chance that someone went to extreme lengths to obfuscate reality on an issue, but I would argue that <em>most</em> things, particularly those that are evidenced in peer reviewed literature, are not elaborate hoaxes (yes I realize that even peer review can be manipulated e.g. the OPEC leaded gasoline scandal). </p>

<p>An elaborate conspiracy takes quite a bit of effort and resources to maintain. Locking down more than a tiny percentage of issues would be infeasible, especially in disciplines that are under constant scrutiny from the international community of independent scientists, issues like nuclear physics.</p>

<p>You have to be careful not to squelch your curiosity about the world because there is a chance that someone is lying to you. As for the issue of nuclear physics, I can attest that at least the basics are undeniable. I have a Geiger counter and have recorded varying background radiation levels (outside of a nuclear power plant, around my house, around my work etc...). I also got the chance to take a tour in one of the power plants in undergrad and even got to see a hydrogen fusion reactor in action. </p>

<p>I really like the critical attitude, but I am confident that if you truly investigate the realities of nuclear power, nuclear weapons, and nuclear physics in general you will come to the conclusion that the basics are indeed sound.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for a thoughtful and interesting reply!  True enough about there being a certain threshold, one could go crazy chasing down every single thing out there.  OTOH, I find that as I open my eyes and my mind, many things come into focus differently than they used to, and it&#39;s like seeing certain things about &quot;reality&quot; for the first time.  </p>

<p>Either way, I enjoy the challenges of research, analysis, and coming to my own conclusions, as well as the sharing of information, ideas and opinions such as we are all doing on this board.  Fascinating times we live in, made even more so by the tech that gives us the ability to share and communicate so rapidly even across great distances.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been so busy lately that my research is suffering, and it&#39;s one of the things I really enjoy doing.  At any rate, I will revisit the nuclear issue, taking into consideration what you have said, and head down the rabbit hole as soon as time permits!  </p>

<p>PS  Interesting about Mr. Patterson, I didn&#39;t know anything about that story</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. It is interesting to me how such a wealth of readily available information has actually made thing <em>harder</em> for the average person looking for answers. The stakes are much higher in that the potential for insight on many (previously unknowable) issues is a reality, but the level of critical thinking necessary to glean anything useful is higher than it has ever been.</p>

<p>Before the information revolution it was much more difficult to fabricate a literal book because it would likely be on a shelf next to multiple books on the same issue. If it were the odd one out then it started to look suspicious. The low (negligible) cost of online publishing means that you can not only publish a primary document, but also reference to <em>other</em> fabricated documents to increase apparent credibility. It takes little effort to make a chain of apparently credible references. Just glancing over citations is no longer going to cut. You really have to dig deep to verify anything these days. It is even worse with news articles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and add AI into the mix, and raise the level of difficulty exponentially. I  wonder sometimes,  in moments of reflection and pondering the meaning of it all, if one of the main purposes of our existence IS the search for truth. If so, it would logically follow that no matter how advanced the tech and the level of intelligence to use it, the means of obscuring the truth will rise proportionally to keep the game interesting.  I say that somewhat tongue in cheek, but not completely, as I believe anything is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember those when I was very young, too. And our fear was the atomic bomb. It was reinforced by all of the stupid movies about atomic war and weird mutants from the radiation. It seems silly now, but we were kids and even adults were fearful. I remember when our dad got plans to build a bomb shelter in our back yard, but we were told we couldn&#39;t tell anyone about it. We told him that if everyone else we knew and loved were going to die, we didn&#39;t want to live either. There&#39;s still a bomb shelter in a backyard a few miles from here from that time. It seems surreal now. Later, we were told we were all going to die in the coming ice age, just like you hear about &quot;climate change&quot; now. Some really sick people back then and now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t want to traumatize my kids like that. We were taught to treat every weapon, loaded or not, like it was always fully loaded. That was so drilled into us, we still treat guns that way. Never point it at anyone unless you want to kill them, never put your finger on the trigger until you&#39;re ready to shoot, always treat it like it&#39;s loaded, so when you&#39;re standing or walking--point it down at a 45 degree angle. I didn&#39;t even enjoy playing paintball when I went with friends once. Lol! Too brainwashed! So I can&#39;t imagine people pretending like there&#39;s a live shooter shooting at people, unless they want to teach people to not freeze and react immediately upon hearing them. But how do they predict what kind of action should be taken if there&#39;s more than one shooter, for instance? Can&#39;t they teach kids to be aware without pretending to shoot them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blanks don&#39;t release a projectile. For the record, they make a noise because an attachment on the end of the weapon causes a enough compression to cause a loud sound. If close enough to someone&#39;s ear, you can get hearing damage. Also it may flash out sparks that cause heat damage briefly.</p>

<p>I still agree this is all strange, but I wanted to clarify on the bahavior of blanks.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;m speaking about. I didn&#39;t mean to imply someone could be shot by a blank, but that they&#39;re not without their own dangers. And to shoot them in school hallways, with kids in the classrooms, seems reckless at best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, but the real danger from using blanks is related to pavlovian conditioning. Programming a fear respondse to a combat scenario is something we did in Basic Training. Its not something all citizens should undergo as children. Do we live in Sparta? Are we led by a military Junta? I don&#39;t see why society can be militarized so heavily, and nobody is seeing it for what is. The military seeks new recruits for a very big war coming up. This is how they drum up those recruits. That is my personal view on why these sorts of drills happen. Not all school shootings need to be conspiracies, but there would be great incentive for them to be faked, if only to push the drills. Once students have to undergo drills in every school nationwide, there wont even need to be real shootings much anymore, to ensure the fear conditioning is effective. Thats some 4D chess stuff, but not too complicated I think.</p>

<p>I absolutely do not disagree. But I was avoiding going down that road because it&#39;s much easier for most people to understand &quot;even blanks can harm you&quot; than &quot;They&#39;re programming you&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Basic Training, I was taught to put an attachment on the end of the barrel when using blanks. Idk if this is always done, but its my understanding this is always done. If an attachment is present the wad or whatever, won&#39;t be travrlling towards any direction. It would stop and pop just out the side of the attachment (a contained event).</p>

<p>Regardless, I have yet to see confirmation that blanks are being used at all. The OP said &quot;simulated&quot; firing of weapons would occur. There are other ways to simulate a weapon firing.</p>

<p>The simulated gunshots, to me, sounds exactly like this. Kids being terrified, learning to fear guns, hate guns, conditioning them for a generation that will, in the future, be able to vote to get rid of guns. They would be more opt to ban guys when they&#39;re older because they were terrified of them as kids, most likely not even realizing the psychological reasons for their fear of guns.</p>

<p>Yes. Teach your children to fear the person without a weapon for just trying to show you a different opinion. Try getting out of the house btw, girls are out there, kids come after sex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Direct fire means projectiles that are fired directly, which means horizontal to the surface of the field/ground. Indirrct fire is things like mortars. They go up and then come down. That&#39;s what indirect means.</p>

<p>If there are rounds being fired from a rifle in your immediate viscinity, and you have reason to believe it could very quickly shift to your direction, you may as well react as if under direct fire, ok? For all intents and purposes you certainly are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was in high school we did one of these mock shooter drills. I‚Äôve posted about it elsewhere. The community, parents, and students were notified <em>weeks</em> in advance and you had the option to opt out and not go to school that day if that‚Äôs what you and your parents chose. It‚Äôs very strange to me that we‚Äôre doing these things with less than a day‚Äôs notice now. </p>

<p>Im currently a teacher and our last department meeting notes mentioned the idea of doing simulated shooting drills to impress upon students the seriousness of the drills. The other potential reason for this is to let people know what gunfire actually sounds like so that they react immediately rather than trying to process the sound first. It all sounds reasonable but y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm out. They‚Äôll have to announce these drills ahead of time and then what‚Äôs to stop a shooter from planning an actual shooting the same day as the drill when everyone‚Äôs guard is down?  I‚Äôve long been an advocate for public education and genuinely feel that I got a top notch public education, but things have changed drastically in the last six or seven years. I worry that these increased shootings will be the nail in the coffin for <em>good</em> public schools. I can‚Äôt blame a parent at all now for putting their kids in a private school, homeschool cooperative, or charter school. As long as we have a generation of kids with raging hormones who will graduate from college in massive debt with a slim chance of getting a job in their field, who get blamed for everything wrong with our country (‚Äúdamn millennials!‚Äù), who are pushed into college, and who have no social safety nets if they get sick or injured and need healthcare, we have no business putting them all together in a high stress environment like school. See also: teen suicide rate. Teachers are tearing their hair out and going the extra mile to try to reach every kid, look out for warning signs in every kid, etc. and it isn‚Äôt enough. </p>

<p>So, yeah, kid...go home if you are concerned for your safety. Let your parents know so that if they get a call from your school they aren‚Äôt blindsided. And if anybody gives you any grief for it be honest and tell them your thoughts on this. </p>

Naturally if this was to happen your body will go into fight or flight mode and will do the best thing in the situation, if that were to ever happen. I can&#39;t believe schools are going to this extreme by &quot;faking gunshots&quot;. I&#39;m seriously considering changing my major after this. (education major)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL.</p>

<p>So, this user claims that there will be a &quot;simulated gunshots&quot; drill at his high school today.  Based on user&#39;s post, user is 100% stating he is currently in school at JJ Pearce in Richardson, TX. </p>

<p>However:
¬∑ School website makes no mention of such drill
¬∑ School twitter makes no mention of such drill.
¬∑ Richardson ISD on Facebook has no mention of a drill.
¬∑ Facebook search reveals nothing about a drill.
¬∑ Searching JJ Pearce on twitter shows nothing about a drill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt its anything but, Get your Escape routes planned, Try and take rope and smash up spark plugs (the broken ceramic shards can be thrown at a window and will break it) Tie your rope to something and dip out when you hear gun shots and screams. if you have $$$ buy a $500 Armored backpack also. Take rope with you in your backpack (buy a 50 - 100 FT nylon rope that is wrapped up nice and neat) Be prepared, drills are always a bad sign. And even if nothing happens, its best to be prepared than not. You can save your life and everyone elses in the room by having a rope and sparkplug shards (have something else to break a window incase the shards dont work have atleast 3 methods 2 break a window in ur bookbag) (carry it class 2 class with you)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one of those thick wood or heavy metal school doors with a couple of tables (on it&#39;s edge long side floor to ceiling) shoved up against it and some chairs, then everyone inside away from any possible line of fire through the window would make a harder target than most people could get through in a few minutes. </p>

<p>And someone brave as heck close to the door ready to grab or pounce if anything did come through. </p>

<p>Would be a better chance than not doing anything but locking the door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best thing to do IMO is to remove all windows from school doors and put a layer of steel in-between, if you barricade something like that no one‚Äôs getting in for a while. Obviously it would take a while to implement something like this, as well as money and resources, but eventually I think we could get there. One could argue it‚Äôs not worth it, but I think enough could argue otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt the school system would think it was worth it and probably wouldn&#39;t have the money if they did.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about it best thing to do would be form a mental plan in many of your daily activities. Where would you go? What would you do if X?</p>

<p>Statistically you are not likely to have a shooting at your school. Might happen, might happen at any time. For the next few days figure out your personal plan for if. Then you will be ahead of the game if something happens.</p>

<p>Statistically you are more likely to be killed or injured in a terrible crash involving impaired driving. Every high school class I know of has one of those. So if there is a car load of kids that want to party in a car, don&#39;t go. If you gotta party take the party to somewhere not on wheels. When the speed gets up over 80 there isn&#39;t a plan in the world that will work short of buckle up and pray. Best to just avoid the situation. </p>

<p>Same goes for malls, movies, restaurants, bars (when you are old enough) or any public place. Have a plan in and a quick exit plan.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts and glad you were safe today.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they shut off the lights during the drill so it‚Äôs gonna be pretty damn hard to find one that‚Äôs not ‚Äúalmost completely black‚Äù. The lack of audio is because I screen recorded it from his snapchat on my phone. The only other thing I can show is a private conversation between myself and my friends who were in the school during the drill. If need be I‚Äôm fine with showing you this, as there‚Äôs nothing too personal in the chat, but I really don‚Äôt want to if I don‚Äôt have to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work at a school in Ohio. Last school year, the had us do our first active shooter drill with just staff. They made us watch Columbine footage to understand &quot;things we might see&quot;. Also brought in an auto rifle and fired blanks inside the school so we would never forget the sound of it happening inside the building. The final drill we had was they locked us in classrooms and had us defend against a &quot;shooter&quot;. It was one of the most traumatic events I&#39;ve been through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds rough, rough but effective, thank you for sharing. According to my buddies all they did today was locked everyone in their classes and shut off the power... I like the idea of a pitch black school because the shooter would‚Äôve had to have brought a flashlight to hit anyone, and it‚Äôs unlikely they would‚Äôve planned bringing one. In my honest opinion the rest of our drill is completely useless, the Florida shooter had no problem shooting through the windows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was really rough considering I&#39;m also an alumi of said school. The hardest part was hearing some of the teachers who I work with and taught me ask &quot;if there is a shooter in the hall way and we have to get out, do I go first and let the kids watch me die? Or do I send them out and watch them die?&quot; These are my elementary school teachers and this still haunts me that we have to ask these questions while in training. Some effective things we have learned is rubber door stoppers can really stop someone from opening a door. Another thing is if on the second floor, teachers have rope ladders to send students out the windows. Also many teachers have &quot;weapons in the room&quot;. Strategically placed objects such as weights to throw, a couple of bats in cabinets. Simple things like that. Also many rooms have panic buttons. Luckily said school is in a very small town with the local police department being a minute and a half ride when full speed in the cruiser. Another good thing about is many of the officers kids go to the school so once one gets there in case of emergency they are trained to throw on the swat helmet and grab the shotgun and go in. We have worked extensively with the local officers to try and make a plan as best as we can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My god, I‚Äôve never thought about that scenario... that‚Äôs a fucking tough one... Teachers aren‚Äôt soldiers, they‚Äôre not police, y‚Äôall shouldn‚Äôt be expected to lay down your lives like that! What a world huh? I‚Äôm glad y‚Äôall are taking so many precautions, whatever school it may be it sounds like the most secure establishment I‚Äôve heard of. The drills we have, like I said before, are practically useless. I‚Äôm going to have to suggest the door stoppers, ropes, etc., to my principal, fortunately we have a pretty good relationship and he trusts my opinions so hopefully he‚Äôll consider spending a couple of the district‚Äôs hard earned dollars on purchasing those supplies. Thank you again for sharing, hopefully more schools will implement these policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then, if there is a real shooting, they just duck and cover because that&#39; why the lesson drill taught previously. That basically make it easier for shooter to kill as many people as possible without getting counter-attack. You can throw 5 iPhones at the same time, it could deter or harm the shooter sever enough to drop the gun. I think you did a great job that some of the teachers and your friends may start looking more into what actually happened in Sandy Hook and Florida schools.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends, Columbine? Absolutely just two psychos with superiority complexes who were cooked up and exploded, all the details emerged and we wrapped that case up nice and easy. The Orlando shooting? Not exactly a school shooting but I don‚Äôt think it was a hoax, I can believe that a radicalized ISIS wannabe would shoot up a gay bar. Vegas and Florida are the ones I‚Äôm concerned about. My belief is that someone, whether it be the Democratic Party, CIA, FBI, ATF, Trump, etc. has something to do with the recent influx in mass shootings, stuff like that didn‚Äôt happen this often up until the anti gun agenda was failing to make any progress. I think a lot of the shootings were truly messed up individuals, but I feel like there were others, albeit a very small percentage, sprinkled in between to really just add tension and spark gun hysteria in America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s time you armor up. Show up to school in full battle gear.  Or, on second thought....  Gun control, obviously.  But think about the effects of trauma used in mind control.  Only now instead of taking kids and torturing them, they are moving it up and into the public eye.  Sometimes the best place to hide something is out in the open.  (think 9-11)  They are traumatizing school kids on a much bigger scale, WITH the buy-in or at least tacit approval of parents, teachers, and school administrators.  Think about it, they are now giving a big Fuck You to everyone, saying look retards, we are going to traumatize your kids and you are going to shut the fuck up and watch it happen.  Next level shit.  Ninja was right.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blanks don&#39;t release a projectile. For the record, they make a noise because an attachment on the end of the weapon causes a enough compression to cause a loud sound. If close enough to someone&#39;s ear, you can get hearing damage. Also it may flash out sparks that cause heat damage briefly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the book, A Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, they train kids from birth through subliminal messaging. Every night while they sleep they&#39;re listening to these message that conditions them to their future roles in life.</p>

<p>The simulated gunshots, to me, sounds exactly like this. Kids being terrified, learning to fear guns, hate guns, conditioning them for a generation that will, in the future, be able to vote to get rid of guns. They would be more opt to ban guys when they&#39;re older because they were terrified of them as kids, most likely not even realizing the psychological reasons for their fear of guns.</p>
