        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sometimes the obvious has to be stated.</p>

<p>The 2 kinds are:</p>

<p>1: willfully unbiased skeptics looking for hidden threats</p>

<p>2: narcissists looking for an outlet to justify their irrationality </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorist 1 will usually do a lot of hard work and will constantly criticize and challenge their beliefs before forming them. They&#39;re easy to talk to and often are effective at getting less aware people to challenge the official narrative by creating compelling collections of evidence and pointing out unnoticed facts that they think people should know. To conspiracy theory 1, the purpose of entertaining conspiracy theories is to find the truth, warn people about real and serious threats lurking beneath the surface and make people more socially aware of those with different but valid beliefs.</p>

<p>Conspiracy  theorist 2 is the antithesis of conspiracy theorist 1. Conspiracy theorist 2 abandons all logic and exclusively favors emotional, usually ego appealing arguments. They&#39;ll cherry pick evidence on purpose. Unlike conspiracy theorist 1 who will look out for their biases and challenge themselves, conspiracy theorist 2 believes their personal biases actually lead them towards the truth, and don&#39;t care if they have weak or even fabricated evidence.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters to these people is feeling superior to others by convincing themselves that they know a secret truth that the inferior people don&#39;t know, and can&#39;t know. Their theories are designed to be invulnerable to evidence. To them, all claims are created equal, no matter how arbitrary. In their mind, truth doesn&#39;t matter, so your evidence based and common sense claim to them is equivalent to their completely made up claim.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorist 2 usually suffers from the dunning Kruger effect. Because of this, they think that they&#39;re conspriacy theorist 1.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorist 1 might find themselves changing their beliefs often and finding new evidence that discards some beliefs that they now understand to have been foolish or extreme. Because of this, a lot of conspiracy theorist 1s might think themselves to be conspiracy theorist 2.</p>

<p>Just a reminder, so you don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking someone who believes the same conspiracy as you believes it because they&#39;re as open minded (or close minded) as you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then, if you are #1, you admit that it is possible that; considering the NRA have major lobby power, a conservative government has majority power in upper and lower, after decades of normalised gun violence with very little reactions in the form of gun control from the majority of States, that mass shootings are not the work of a master conspiracy to initiate a de-arming of the American population to enforce martial law?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit that its possible all those shootings are part of an elaborate plan to bring about martial law and a population unable to resist, very slowly... over decades, even though right now there is an upper and lower conservative majority.</p>

<p>I think you have made an illogical loop loophole.</p>

<p>Being a fully biased curiosity seeker where do I fall in the location? I believe there is a grand conspiracy and multiple major &amp; minor conspiracies, but I am looking for proof that some actually exist. I am biased in my belief that there is a conspiracy.  I doubt I can be convinced that all is well and that no one is trying to subvert the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just a skeptic... it is far easier.</p>

<p>I was a conspiracy theorist for about 4 years.</p>

<p>A conspiracy theorist tries to uncover what really happened. That is really hard. It is very error prone, and there are always at least 2 alternatives to the official narrative. (By design, I think).</p>

<p>A skeptic just says, &quot;This is a lie. This is wrong. This doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;</p>

<p>A conspiracy theorist will look at LV and say, &quot;Hey, Look at these &#39;put&#39; options and those Army trucks. Pay attention to the CEO of MGM. I bet [yadda, yadda] happened&quot;</p>

<p>A skeptic just says, &quot;The official narrative doesn&#39;t add up. [This and that] are lies. It is impossible to [x]. You couldn&#39;t hit [y] with [z]. The story keeps changing. Where is the video footage?&quot;</p>

<p>When you compare notes with a conspiracy theorist, you can almost always MATCH them on the skeptical bit... Yeah... &quot;NASA Lied. That&#39;s a fake. That&#39;s a fake. That&#39;s impossible.&quot;</p>

<p>Then they get into, &quot;It&#39;s a plot of the [New World Order/Illuminati/Jews/Reptilians]&quot; and I say, &quot;I&#39;m just a skeptic. It is sufficient for the average person to know that they lied about this important matter. Lies about 9/11, Iraq, and Iran are sufficient grounds for revolution. If you want to go further than revolution, you need more than the skeptical view... but I don&#39;t. I just want change, and proof of lies/coverup are enough.&quot;</p>
