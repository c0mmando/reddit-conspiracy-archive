<p>Ah, look at all the lonely people.</p>

<p>Chronic loneliness is literally a modern day epidemic:</p>

<p><a href="http://fortune.com/2016/06/22/loneliness-is-a-modern-day-epidemic/">http://fortune.com/2016/06/22/loneliness-is-a-modern-day-epidemic/</a></p>

<p>Further, did you know that suicide rates are generally higher in rural areas than in urban areas?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/03/15/393192543/why-is-the-risk-of-youth-suicide-higher-in-rural-areas">https://www.npr.org/2015/03/15/393192543/why-is-the-risk-of-youth-suicide-higher-in-rural-areas</a></p>

<p>Why? According to many sociologists, like Emilie Durkheim, isolation is the answer. As someone who lives in an isolated area, I can relate to this. Still, I do not feel this is just a physical sense of isolation. Social isolation plays a huge role, too.</p>

<p>Loneliness can result in suicide, which is a dark topic that most do not really explore. When one thinks of suicide, one thinks of hopelessness, but what brings someone to such hopelessness?</p>

<p>Sociologist Emile Durkheim found that were three types of suicide: egotistic, altruistic, and anomie. </p>

<p>For the purpose of this post, I want to focus on anomie, or “a sense of disconnection from society and a feeling of not belonging that result from weakened social cohesion. Anomie occurs during period of serious social, economic, or political upheaval, which results in quick and extreme changes to society and everyday life. In such circumstances a person might feel so confused and disconnected that they choose to commit suicide.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/study-of-suicide-by-emile-durkheim-3026758">https://www.thoughtco.com/study-of-suicide-by-emile-durkheim-3026758</a></p>

<p>Further, according to Durkheim, “it is simply not true that there are “only individuals” in society.”</p>

<p><a href="http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/suicide.html#pgfId=931">http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/suicide.html#pgfId=931</a></p>

<p>Moreover, “Large-scale societal crises may result in heightened suicide rates because the existing social order is challenged. An economic depression, for example, may be accompanied by an increased suicide rate. This is not due, however, to poverty or unemployment specifically but rather a result of a rapid change of conditions, expectations, and individuals&#39; self-regard.”
<a href="https://www.larasig.com/node/1690">https://www.larasig.com/node/1690</a></p>

<p>Whether we like it or not, 99% of us exist within a society, with sociological ramifications. That does not mean that individuality does not exist; rather, there seems to be some type of paradox in thinking that one’s individuality can exist without influence of society. With that being said, people today still like to think that they function on some sort of individuality where society has no influence on their thoughts or paradigms. This concept is simply ridiculous – for the majority of us, we function due to societal influences, unless we are aware of those influences. </p>

<p>Think about how much our society has changed in the past ten or twenty years. Many of us are experiencing &quot;anomie.&quot;</p>

<p>So, for the purpose of this post, I want to focus on the social influences that create loneliness, and even contribute to suicide. Further, I want to discuss that this is all purposeful, and as always, there is a conspiracy behind this. ‘They’ want people to feel and be lonely because, ultimately, it breaks down society and cohesion. There is, finally, an inversion of loneliness that ‘they’ try to equate with oneness. Quite simply, people need other people, and technology can not replace real-life human interaction.</p>

<p><strong>Solitude vs. Isolation</strong></p>

<p>For the purpose of this post, I want to ensure to differentiate between solitude vs. isolation, or aloneness vs. loneliness.</p>

<p>Solitude is the state or situation of being alone – many like to be alone at times, and there is nothing wrong with that. Being alone can be good for you:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-flux/201410/the-importance-being-alone">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-flux/201410/the-importance-being-alone</a></p>

<p>We all need alone time, and this post is not in contradiction with that fact.</p>

<p>On the other hand, isolation is defined as being separate from others, and loneliness is defined as sadness because of lack of company. </p>

<p>All of these definitions can be found on google, so I am not going to link, but the point is that we are living in a society that does not value solitude, and at the same time, there is increased isolation.</p>

<p>What I mean is that we have very little time to actually be alone when we want to be, especially because of the increase of our hectic schedules. People are just too busy:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636612-time-poverty-problem-partly-perception-and-partly-distribution-why">https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636612-time-poverty-problem-partly-perception-and-partly-distribution-why</a></p>

<p>When people do finally get that alone time, though, they may ultimately feel lonely or isolated. Today, one of the only ways to feel connected is through social media, and that is making us more lonely than ever. In fact, too much time on social media is directly correlated with loneliness:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why">https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why</a></p>

<p>So, our society promotes this feeling of isolation, but how, and why? So, our society promotes this feeling of isolation, but how, and why?</p>

<p><strong>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</strong></p>

<p>Before I write any of these posts, I always call a few of my friends and make sure my arguments hold up. One of my friends had a good argument – he said we do not actually ‘need’ friends.
He’s right, to an extent.</p>

<p>When looking at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, we really only need air, water, food, rest, and health for survival.
But, one could argue that friends are needed for our emotional health, which goes into “security, social, and ego.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/our-hierarchy-needs">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/our-hierarchy-needs</a></p>

<p>Even an evolutionary biologist can explain why we need others in our lives,</p>

<p>“Friends are important. So important, in fact, that it’s been proven that friendship can extend life expectancy and lower chances of heart disease. Friendship helps us survive. Part of why that is has to do with what happens in our brains when we interact with other humans: a 2011 study detailed the role of the neurobiological endogenous opioid system (the stuff in our brains that make us feel good) in positive social relationships; in 2016, researchers found evidence of the release of oxytocin in primate brains during social interactions; and later that year, psychologists conducted a study that suggested levels of pain tolerance can predict how many friends someone has.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thefader.com/2017/03/08/science-of-friendship">http://www.thefader.com/2017/03/08/science-of-friendship</a></p>

<p>Yet, it is almost like we are trained to hate people in today’s society, in some sort of ‘divide and conquer’ tactic, which I will go into more later.</p>

<p><strong>The Breakdown of Society</strong></p>

<p>In the past century, specifically due to technology, there has been a breakdown of society, or social interaction. For the purpose this post, I am using Google’s definition of society, which is “the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community.”</p>

<p>While most of us live among others, we are feeling more isolated than ever. Why? I know the last time somebody rang my doorbell, I freaked out. Was this type of isolation always normal? Absolutely not.</p>

<p><em>Friendships</em>: </p>

<p>As noted earlier, we really do need others to feel healthy. Yet, today more than other, people are feeling isolated. Technology has created fake friends, and there is an actual study about this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-friends-are-almost-entirely-fake-study-finds-a6826721.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-friends-are-almost-entirely-fake-study-finds-a6826721.html</a></p>

<p><em>Family</em></p>

<p>For many, family is the foundation for which they exist, but the nuclear family is in decline:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/3265733/nuclear-family-typical-society-parents-children-households-philip-cohen/">http://time.com/3265733/nuclear-family-typical-society-parents-children-households-philip-cohen/</a></p>

<p>There is no such thing as a ‘typical&#39; family anymore. I am not, however, arguing that atypical families are ‘bad’ but there is also the rise of dysfunctional families:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/17/1-the-american-family-today/">http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/17/1-the-american-family-today/</a></p>

<p>No matter what the media tells you, there are findings that children fare better in traditional, nuclear homes:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/10/study-children-fare-better-traditional-mom-dad-fam/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/10/study-children-fare-better-traditional-mom-dad-fam/</a></p>

<p>From a teacher’s perspective, my students long for both ‘mom’ and ‘dad’, and I’m willing to share those anecdotes if anybody is interested.</p>

<p><em>Relationships</em></p>

<p>Further, more are having casual sex, and less are willing to be committed in relationships:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/casual-sex-everyone-is-doing-it">https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/casual-sex-everyone-is-doing-it</a></p>

<p>And less are getting married, and according to this article, that is a good thing:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a12787881/decline-of-marrige-wall-street-journal-response/">https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a12787881/decline-of-marrige-wall-street-journal-response/</a></p>

<p>Media often glorifies casual relationships full of sex, with popular TV shows like Sex in the City, but are people’s needs really fulfilled just through just sex?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thetrumpet.com/7750-the-emotional-corrosion-of-casual-sex">https://www.thetrumpet.com/7750-the-emotional-corrosion-of-casual-sex</a></p>

<p>This article explains how bonding works, and yes, people ‘need’ to feel an intimate bond with people they have sex with. From the article,</p>

<p>“The problem described here also has much deeper and long-lasting effect. The authors report: “Further, there is evidence that when this sex/bonding/breaking-up cycle is repeated a few or many times—even when the bonding was short-lived—damage is done to the important, built-in ability to develop significant and meaningful connection to other human beings.”</p>

<p>Humans crave connection to others, not just physical pleasure.</p>

<p><em>Communication</em></p>

<p>“It is a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.” – 1984</p>

<p>My students now say “I want to kill myself” as a &#39;trendy&#39; statement – it has literally lost its meaning and effect. Language is how we connect, and in a controlled society, it loses its value and meaning.</p>

<p>Moreover, while we seem more connected than ever, our level of communication has faced some degradation. For one, people are speaking to each other less:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sophia-a-nelson/when-did-texting-replace-_b_5105265.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sophia-a-nelson/when-did-texting-replace-_b_5105265.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2015/07/15/why-millennials-are-texting-more-and-talking-less/&amp;amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/">https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2015/07/15/why-millennials-are-texting-more-and-talking-less/&amp;amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/</a></p>

<p>And even when we do talk, we are not really hearing what the other person says. Echo chambers have been confirmed by science:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/07/14/confirmed-echo-chambers-exist-on-social-media-but-what-can-we-do-about-them/?utm_term=.89c796091c56">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/07/14/confirmed-echo-chambers-exist-on-social-media-but-what-can-we-do-about-them/?utm_term=.89c796091c56</a></p>

<p>According to the article, “Users tended to seek out information that strengthened their preferred narratives and to reject information that undermined it.”</p>

<p>So, we are now living in a world where it is so much easier to close off people that may not worship the ground we walk on, as if we are not Gods after all.</p>

<p><em>Free Time</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, when we do have free time, most of us are too tired to even spend it with others. Deep down we may actually want to be with others, but we are almost forced to be alone because we need to emotionally recover from the day. I know as a teacher it is hard for me to want to hang out with anybody after work simply because I am emotionally exhausted.</p>

<p>But, burnout at work is not just about this emotional exhaustion, it is also about loneliness:</p>

<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/burnout-at-work-isnt-just-about-exhaustion-its-also-about-loneliness">https://hbr.org/2017/06/burnout-at-work-isnt-just-about-exhaustion-its-also-about-loneliness</a></p>

<p>Well, it is probably a mixture of both. Emotional exhaustion contributes to isolation, which probably causes loneliness.</p>

<p>From the article, “Loneliness, whether it results from social isolation or exhaustion, has serious consequences for individuals. John Cacioppo, a leading expert on loneliness and coauthor of Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection, emphasizes its tremendous impact on psychological and physical health and longevity….In the meantime, experts and companies have struggled to figure out how to counter growing levels of burnout. Many recommendations focus on relieving stress, teaching mindfulness, or reducing workload — all of which treat burnout as an individual condition. But its link to loneliness suggests that greater human connection at work may also be key to solving the burnout problem.”</p>

<p>Most of us spend the majority of our day at our jobs, and when we do communicate, it is either forced or fake with people we probably do not like much anyway. At the same time, we may come home and sincerely want to hang out with others, but we are just too emotionally drained. This is just another contribution to loneliness. Our free time is spent on recovery from work – not on the social interaction we need.</p>

<p><strong>But I hate people!</strong></p>

<p>You might be reading this and be thinking, “Well, I hate people anyway, so who cares?” The question is, were you programmed to hate people?</p>

<p>Before modern technology, our society was different. If you grew up with a smart phone out of your mom’s womb, this may be hard to imagine, but community used to be a valued part of society. Quite frankly, technology is destroying the quality of human interaction:</p>

<p><a href="https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2012/01/technology-is-destroying-the-quality-of-human-interaction">https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2012/01/technology-is-destroying-the-quality-of-human-interaction</a></p>

<p>But, even beyond that, even the most introverted need a sense of community:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-introverts-corner/201502/why-even-introverts-need-community">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-introverts-corner/201502/why-even-introverts-need-community</a></p>

<p>And really, social communication is, in some ways, as important as food and shelter:</p>

<p><a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/we-are-hard-wired-to-be-social-248746">http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/we-are-hard-wired-to-be-social-248746</a></p>

<p>The thing is, we may feel this sense of social communication with technology, but it cannot duplicate real, human interaction:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2015/11/21/face-to-face-interactions-can-never-be-replaced-by-technology/#6f71520872ec">https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2015/11/21/face-to-face-interactions-can-never-be-replaced-by-technology/#6f71520872ec</a></p>

<p>Besides, are you sure your hatred for others is not simply a purposeful divide and conquer technique?</p>

<p>“We fear connecting because it requires us to reveal something about ourselves. We are taught to hate the enemy — meaning anyone different than us — which leaves little room for vulnerability and an exploration of hate through empathic discourse and understanding. In our current society, one is more ready to fight than to resolve conflict. Peace is seldom the option.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/nurturing-self-compassion/201703/the-psychology-hate">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/nurturing-self-compassion/201703/the-psychology-hate</a></p>

<p>Today, we are being trained to hate connecting with others who do not fall into our thoughts and paradigms.</p>

<p><strong>Anomie</strong></p>

<p>So, in our society, there is this purposeful breakdown that increases loneliness. Not only are people lonelier than ever, but there is a stark rise in suicides, especially among the youth:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/suicide-youth-teens-whats-behind-rise/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/suicide-youth-teens-whats-behind-rise/</a></p>

<p>But why? Besides all of the factors I have noted, there is still more to this – there is this breakdown of society, but it goes deeper.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why people kill themselves, as noted earlier, but one reason rarely talked about is anomie. According to Wikipedia, “Anomie (/ˈænəˌmi/) is a &quot;condition in which society provides little moral guidance to individuals&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie</a></p>

<p>I have written so much about the moral relativism or our modern society, so feel free to check out my post history, that way I do not repeat much here. The article notes, “For Durkheim, anomie arises more generally from a mismatch between personal or group standards and wider social standards, or from the lack of a social ethic, which produces moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations.”</p>

<p>We are living in a society where nearly anything goes. Fuck who you want, eat what you want, and do whatever you want, and do not worry about any sense of standards. Why? Standards are bad, according to modern society. </p>

<p>But people need standard and direction. People need morals. 
People are on the pursuit of happiness, without realizing happiness may not even be the goal they are seeking. I call this “Oprah morality” where people do what makes them happy with no further, philosophical thought on the effects on society. You can read more about “do what thou wilt” and “Oprah Morality’ in my post history, but I need to move on:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7fbdem/the_conspiracy_of_evil_does_evil_really_exist/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7fbdem/the_conspiracy_of_evil_does_evil_really_exist/</a></p>

<p>The other factor is that many are simply disillusioned with a society they cannot fit in with, and I know I feel that way at times. We are all here, on a conspiracy forum because we feel there is something ‘wrong’ with the world, even if we disagree with the reasons as to why it feels wrong.</p>

<p>Many of us feel like outcasts because we cannot speak about what we really believe. We may not worship the culture of materialism, celebrities, social media, sports, and so on, and we may speak out against the major narratives. Quite simply, many of us feel like outcasts who still have to function in a society we ultimately disagree with – what is the alternative? Is there even an alternative? Today, it is so expensive and nearly impossible to buy your own land and live without society, yet some people are living off the grid:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/22/opinions/living-off-the-grid-usoa-kamau-bell/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/22/opinions/living-off-the-grid-usoa-kamau-bell/index.html</a></p>

<p>Still, the question is, why is society this way? Was there a time when “depression” was not normalized? Was there a time when people liked other people? Was there a time when people did not feel lonely, but they felt fulfilled by their communities? I think there was.</p>

<p>Today, we have things to fulfill us, whether those be drugs, alcohol, video games, sex, buying stuff, working constantly, beauty products, social media, pets, money, power, porn, etc., but we do not have each other.</p>

<p>I used to think Amish societies were ridiculous, but, now, I am not so sure because they seemingly are happier:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/3687995/why-amish-kids-are-happier-than-yours/">http://time.com/3687995/why-amish-kids-are-happier-than-yours/</a></p>

<p>The point is that many are feeling disillusioned in a society that feels disconnected with no set of standards. Anything goes, and nobody really cares.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>So, what would be the point of all of this? Why would ‘they’ want us to feel lonely and empty? Well, quite simply, it makes us easier to control. We want to fit and belong, and that is just basic human evolution, sociology, and psychology. Most of us will do what it takes to fit in. From 1984, </p>

<p>“It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself – anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called.” 
As somebody who has been targeted pretty severely online, I understand this quote. Fitting in is about survival, but that does not make us feel any less lonely. </p>

<p>We do not want to commit “facecrimes” and the elite know this. So, we show a certain face to the world. We live in duplicity, or two worlds. </p>

<p>But even darker, loneliness makes us more likely to kill ourselves and less likely to reproduce. Loneliness make us depressed, and less likely to contribute to society or change.</p>

<p>And they convince us that we will be just fine being alone! </p>

<p><strong>Inversion of Loneliness to Oneness</strong></p>

<p>Right now, they are somehow convincing us that all of our problems, specifically with loneliness, will be solved through technology. Through artificial intelligence and virtual reality, we can have anything we want. We can create our own realities. Our future is with augmented reality:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-41419109/what-future-for-augmented-reality">http://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-41419109/what-future-for-augmented-reality</a></p>

<p>But the problem is, it is all fake. We can create family, friendship, community, communication, fun, entertainment, and whatever in this virtual reality, but it can never replace real-life interactions. </p>

<p>With modern new age religion, we are told we can be “one” with all so that we are not alone, but to me that is deceiving. </p>

<p>Yes, we need other people to function in society, but we are still individuals, and loneliness is defeated when we value people for who they really are – not who we want them to be. Loneliness today is a product of trying to fit into a society where many of us simply do not agree with its main tenets. To conquer loneliness, we seek people that like us for we really are, but can we do that today? I mean, most cannot even post a picture without a million filters, and most cannot really speak their mind for fear of backlash and the eternity of the internet. But there is this illusion that people like us just the way we are, and the more likes we get, the more we feel that claim is validated.</p>

<p>With all of these interconnections, we feel like ‘nothing.’ The more technology ‘connects’ us, the more disconnected we feel because our uniqueness loses meaning. It loses meaning because we cannot find real people that value us anymore for who we are, and quiet simply, t is not really real. In real life, many friends like me because of who I am in, but on social media, my friends like me because who I am perceived to be, which is not the real me.</p>

<p>Loneliness makes us believe we are insignificant, and if we truly feel that, then our lives lose meaning. We stop living.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s end with some quotes</strong></p>

<p>“Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.” 
― Aldous Huxley, Ends and Means</p>

<p>““We can’t jump off bridges anymore because our iPhones will get ruined. We can’t take skinny dips in the ocean because there’s no service on the beach and adventures aren’t real unless they’re on Instagram. Technology has doomed the spontaneity of adventure and we’re helping destroy it every time we Google, check-in, and hashtag.” 
― Jeremy Glass”</p>

<p>“Even the technology that promises to unite us, divides us. Each of us is now electronically connected to the globe, and yet we feel utterly alone.” 
― Dan Brown, Angels &amp; Demons</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that if we feel we have no value, then we feel life has no value, and larger society loses it purpose and value. We live our lives waiting for the next &#39;high&#39; and we have this belief that, eventually, all our problems will be solves with some type of technological &#39;oneness&#39; or interface. That does not seem to be the case. </p>

<p>&quot;It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.&quot;
–Albert Einstein </p>

    <div class="md"><p>depends on the situation. For example, a friend is visiting the area from far away and even though I need to do something important (like fix the septic system) I still make time to see my friend. Even little things like putting laundry away, paying taxes, bills, responding to emails and texts can get in the way. Because something else is weighing on my mind, I don&#39;t have the 100% full experience of enjoying my friends company... and even though I wouldn&#39;t have done those things anyway because i&#39;m lazy, I feel guilt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, absolutely. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve slowly cut out many &quot;friends&quot; as our priorities have changed.</p>

<p>I find the people that deserve all of my time and love are my spouse and children and our many animals. We stay too busy at home to adventure out much, so when friends cancel plans, I&#39;m not mad; I&#39;m excited to stay home and work on projects.</p>

<p>But! You aren&#39;t wrong. I need to find friends that I&#39;m excited to see. I&#39;ll work on that. Thank you :)</p>

I was an sjw convert in years past...not participating but constantly checking myself to make sure  I was pc...and it was of course a huge waste of time. No One worth being friends with tries to change your inborn attitude. Many buy into it to this day though!!! The old rigamarole is harrass anyone and anything in the name of &quot;culture&quot; or any conflated cause...but really...just hate everybody and act like a conceited highbrow in public...only to retreat to private booze and pharmies.

<p>In terms of fending off depression, there are a number of positives that having a job can provide:<br/>
* the requirement that you get up out of bed, take a shower and get dressed.<br/>
* the possibility that your work might make some positive contribution to something or someone<br/>
* the human interaction can be good too.  (My current boss is a real shit, but luckily, I am plopped in the midst of co-workers whom I respect, like, and now consider to be friends.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh yeah this hits home a little too hard, I work 70 hours a week right now from home so I have little to no social interaction with anybody throughout the week, I have my son 2-3 days per week and I hang out with him and his mother or my family most Sundays but outside of that I only have 2 friends that I keep in touch with semi regularly and honestly I&#39;ve become super comfortable with being alone. I don&#39;t necessarily enjoy it but I&#39;ve become so accustomed to it that it almost feels like a chore to have any social interactions at this point, I find that I post more of my feelings online than talking to anyone and I struggle internally with any issues I have on a regular basis. I feel like it&#39;s not very healthy at all but at the same time I have no desire to really change it, what&#39;s strange is I used to thrive on being a social butterfly, had a ton of friends and was always the goofy and outgoing person whenever I hung out with people. Now I feel like my personality has shifted completely and I don&#39;t even know who I really am anymore, like right now here I am talking about shit that I don&#39;t talk to anybody else about on some random ass reddit thread, humans are such strange creatures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are lonely everywhere. The more we separate the parts of our personality, the harder it is to be our true selves and connect with others. I myself have an obsessive personality so I get why perhaps people become obsessive over me. I obsess over people as well. I think technology has made it easier to obsess and ruminate thus allowing our selves to be stagnant and lazy when it comes to social interactions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I pretty much stopped going on social media. I was tired of obsessing. While I have made some progress with my health, I still have a lot to learn and hopefully I can do it quickly.</p>

<p>We all have to fix ourselves and become whole again before we can have meaningful relationships. Technology certainly is a hindrance to it at times. But can also help us find people we would like in our lives. It&#39;s a complicated topic. But I&#39;m glad you posted it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting stuff. You’d prob be interested in the book Tribe by Sebastian Junger. It talks about how humans evolved in tribes and the problems we’ve faced going to a more individualistic society. From the books summary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason may lie in our natural inclination, as a species, to live in groups of thirty to fifty people who are entirely reliant on one another for safety, comfort and a sense of meaning: in short, the life of a soldier.It is one of the ironies of the modern age that as affluence rises in a society, so do rates of suicide, depression and of course PTSD. In a wealthy society people don&#39;t need to cooperate with one another, so they often lead much lonelier lives that lead to psychological distress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currently I am a stay at home mother to 3. Have been for the past 6 years. Rarely do I interact with actual other adult humans outside of my husband. There are a plethora of FB groups for people in my position, however, there are only conversations online, messages (on the wall) etc... No phone calls, or meet ups. No actual physical togetherness. It&#39;s quite draining. There is no replacement for having a physical person to interact with and discuss face to face the plights of parenthood (or any other position/concern/etc). I live in a suburban area with many neighbors, none of whom speak to me. It&#39;s certainly odd as when I grew up we knew all of our neighbors and usually held barbecues and such. The advent of technology has seemed to stifle the personal enrichment of nuclear families that both children and parents desire/need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People become obsessed with me when I get too close to them. It&#39;s happened many times. It has happened with males and females. I isolated myself because everything I touch turns to ruin.</p>

<p>I remember I was 15 hanging out with my old friend in my neighborhood. Apparently he became obsessed with me and his mom kicked me out of their home, calling me a homewrecker in the process.</p>

<p>Then I rented out a basement apartment from my sister&#39;s friend&#39;s mom. She was really sweet and it was cool. But she became obsessed with me too. I love her and she&#39;s someone I consider family, but not being there causes her pain.</p>

<p>Then my friends that I cut ties with, they wanted me so badly to see them. I couldn&#39;t, I was  sick and depressed.</p>

<p>People long for me to be there, but I can&#39;t. There are several other instances. Oddly females have begun liking me. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m not gay or bi or pan. And it makes me feel even more lonely. I just hate hurting people. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to do. Something inside me causes people to have this odd attraction to me. I can look like absolute shit, and someone somehow ends up obsessing over me.</p>

<p>It makes me not want to look pretty or try because what if someone kills me?</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to stay strong so I can go see some people I promised to go see. But it&#39;s hard. I&#39;m so scared of the world and of being something that hurts others. I really love people and I don&#39;t want to cause any suffering!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. I&#39;ll start with this. My name is Redacted. You can use initials too for now.</p>

<p>Dearest Polka (for now),</p>

<p>I will PM you at least once a week so you can tell me what&#39;s going on in your life. I will do the same. For example, I found this vegan lady who has this YouTube channel about living in a van. She seems nice, but damn did the sun age her face. She straight up looks 40 and she&#39;s 27. Damn! I like her videos tho.</p>

<p>Also recently, I discovered that my baby boy stopped eating due to depression. My nephew is going through a no-eating phase too. So that really sucks. That has contributed to me depression. I hope one day soon I can go to my baby boy and help him feel happy again along with some other people I have in mind.</p>

<p>The world sucks due to all this propaganda shit. But hey, at least we have recreational weed in some states.</p>

<p>Warm Regards,
Redacted</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am looking into it. I saw being impeccable with my word, not taking things personally, not making assumptions, and doing my best. I think am really hard on myself. Like I will blame myself and ruminate and feel bad for days if I hurt someone&#39;s feelings. It&#39;s odd because I&#39;m naturally less filtered with my words, but when I realize I hurt someone, I really beat myself about it, sometimes literally (through cutting). It also has to do with the fact that people treat me badly because they&#39;re upset with me. I think what&#39;s the point of taking care of myself if people are just going to be mad at everything I do?</p>

<p>So yeah I&#39;m going to read the book because audiobooks are too hard to focus on for long periods. I appreciate the recommendation. Seems right up my alley and am glad you improved in that regard. Hopefully, I will too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Havent logged in for awhile. Mostly the whole conspiracy community has made me bitter. </p>

<p>However, I commend this post fully! Great writing with articles and Im pleased to find so much truth in your observations. Ive been feeling the same exact thing about the generation of youth today all spewing out phrases like &#39;I hate my life&#39; or &#39;Ughh, Im going to kill myself.&#39; There are increasingly more lonely, since the dawn of DARPA&#39;s internet. Its truely a shame what an ugly society were being molded into. </p>

<p>Anyways, love your post! You should honestly consider writing a book on this subject, it would be an excellent read especially in todays era. </p>

<p>If I could leave one word of advice for anyone wanting to combat the culture today, its to go the extra mile in public. Smile, compliment, and talk with the people life puts next to you. Ive begun to try this out the past year and let me tell you its changed me into a vastly happier, social person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is now a therapy that goes along with modern isolation and depression.  Turns out, thanks to the alcoholic family (John Bradshaw) studies done in the 60s and 70s, they swept up the data on all of this.  They found a society and family unit that switched from extended localized families to isolated, suburban, both parents working factory of latch key kids.  Kids that are missing specific developmental stages that they should have gotten in the 10-18 range where both parents are working and the kid is isolated all but school time.</p>

<p>So I went through that therapy, might have been probably an initial patient and me and my therapust kinda worked new ground.  Since then I&#39;ve sent a lot of people into fixing this stuff, this &quot;Adult Children&quot; malaise. </p>

<p>Now, I can&#39;t read all your stuff although I did skim (because I am the ADD-est MF on Earth) but if you interested, I would love for you to read this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ah, look at all the lonely people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/HuS5NuXRb5Y">https://youtu.be/HuS5NuXRb5Y</a></p>

<p>That song makes me feel lonely and depressed.  The lyrics are also a little dark if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Loneliness is a major problem.  I feel like I could go on and on about reasons why people are more lonely today.  The one way we are more connected than ever in some ways is by cell phones and the internet.</p>

<p>I would have thought suicide rates would be higher in urban areas than rural ones.  Many suicides are due to loneliness and rural areas are more lonely than urban ones so it makes sense when you think about it that way.</p>

<p>I am very mindful now of societal influences on me.  For me, it is impossible to not let society influence me in some way subconsciously unless I do not come into contact with it at all.  It might be different for a psychopath or somebody like that.</p>

<p>Great point about the inversion of loneliness being oneness.</p>

<p>Great point also about society not valuing solitude with there being at the same time increased isolation.  I think people are more likely to introspect in solitude.  This leads to independent thought.  TPTB heavily influence thought and the thoughts they want people to have spread from one person to the next if the people don&#39;t wake up, which requires independent thought.</p>

<p>When I have read Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs in the past, I never considered where friends would be in the hierarchy.  For the majority of my life, I have had only a few different sets of close friends and that&#39;s it.  A lot of that time was spent pretty disconnected from those close friends.  I think I was somewhat satisfied by my family being around and by interactions with people on the internet; usually in video games or in chat rooms for the video game.  I think I handle being alone a lot better than most but there is still a void in my heart when I get too lonely.  I think I have had this void in my heart for so long it has become somewhat normal for me to be alone.  I get really excited when I interact with my friends.  I ask myself, &quot;Why is there a need to not be alone?&quot;  I don&#39;t think it is by chance.  ;)</p>

<p>I am not suprised that friends can extend life expectancy and lower the chance of heart disease but it is great to know a study has shown it.  I think our mental and spiritual health directly impacts our physical health.</p>

<p>I think we are trained to hate people in today&#39;s society as part of a divide and conquer tactic.  We focus on each other&#39;s differences.  At least from my experience as a man, saying something nice is generally seen by others as weak, a waste of time, fruity, and lame.  Also, since it is rare, it creates an awkward and uncomfortable situation where the other person does not immediately know how to respond.  I try to rise above that and say nice things despite that.  I think saying something nice to another male also makes them feel better about themselves and creates a sense of brotherhood.</p>

<p>It is understandable why you specifically would freak out about the door bell ringing.  ;)  I totally agree with you that the type of isolation you spoke of with your door bell example was not always normal.  I think it is within the past generation or two that this has become normal.</p>

<p>I think without more than just sexual attraction to one another, sex will not fill the void of loneliness.</p>

<p>The example you have of how people overuse &quot;I want to kill myself.&quot; is very dangerous as when people really feel that way, you might not realize that they really mean it.  Part of the reason I am kind of long winded and talk a little &quot;nerdy&quot; is because I aim to use words that best convey my thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>What really helps me &quot;hear&quot; what the other person says is to analyze what the other person says objectively.  I also think that is the most respectful way of interacting with someone.</p>

<p>I think you are totally right about how even when we have free time, most people are too tired to go out and spend it with others.</p>

<p>Haha &quot;But I hate people!&quot; is a funny heading.  :)  Though, it is sad that people feel that way.</p>

<p>You put it really well when you said that people are on the pursuit of happiness without realizing happiness may not even be the goal they are really seeking.  Material happiness is temporary; whether the material does not last or you simply get used to having it.  Also, most of us have to go back to work at which time we are separated from the high the material gave you.  This changes the feeling of happiness into the feeling of withdrawal.</p>

<p>Ethics are extremely important.  If one does not consider ethics in their pursuit of happiness, it is going to create a selfish world with less happiness because people would not be as helpful to one another.  Sound familiar?  Considering ethics also leads one to realizing what truly being happy means because you achieve it in the right way.</p>

<p>I absolutely do feel like an outcast; even more so now than when I was younger.  I am surprised you did not mention this but I imagine most that live off of the grid are very lonely.  It is like taking a rural environment to the extreme.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was there a time when “depression” was not normalized? Was there a time when people liked other people? Was there a time when people did not feel lonely, but they felt fulfilled by their communities? I think there was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too.  :)</p>

<p>I sometimes wondered if Amish people were happier.  It really says something when those who &quot;have less&quot; and who do not have the things our society yearns for are happier.</p>

<p>I agree with you that being lonely and empty makes us easier to control, more likely to kill ourselves, less likely to reproduce, makes us depressed, and makes us less likely to contribute to society or change.  It also makes people focus on trying to fill that void with material things, which feeds the beast.</p>

<p>Being a programmer, my personal feeling is that AI, virtual, and augmented reality will make people even more empty because they are artificial, material things creating an artificial and material sense of reality.</p>

<p>It was really powerful when you wrote, &quot;loneliness is defeated when we value people for who they really are - not who we want them to be.&quot;  I think you are right.  :)  The whole conclusion was very deep and meaningful as were the quotes you shared.</p>

<p>Excellent post.  I expect that those who read it, particularly from the younger generations, will resonate with at least something you said; making them feel a little bit less lonely.  :)</p>

<p>Why? According to many sociologists, like Emilie Durkheim, isolation is the answer. As someone who lives in an isolated area, I can relate to this. Still, I do not feel this is just a physical sense of isolation. Social isolation plays a huge role, too.</p>

<p>And many sociologists will tell you that the city is the parasite of the country side, increasingly so with the concentration of politics, and this has consequences. I don&#39;t disagree with the post, but it starts with quite the shortcut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I&#39;d like to point out that &quot;do what thou wilt&quot; is the subject matter of the book &quot;The Law&quot; written by Alister Crowley, the grandfather of modern Satanism.</p>

<p>Today&#39;s society has been engineered by a malevolent force that has studied humanity for millennia in order to corrupt and destroy them. This force has finally succeeded in large parts of the world and continues to drive division among people.</p>

<p>This force is ancient, patient and hateful. It worked slowly and step by step to normalize things that were frowned upon, and make things that are wrong frowned upon. Very slowly we went from &quot;a mother is essential to a household&quot; to &quot;give children hormone blockers if they play by dressing as the other sex&quot;.</p>

<p>First, women wanted to work and be equal, that in itself is a great thing, but the evil force swung the pendulum too far and made housewife a bad name. Now motherhood became a sin. Then it told us that love was more important than committment, to &quot;follow our hearts&quot; and that you shouldn&#39;t restrict yourself to a single &quot;boring&quot; sexual partner. You saw many men and women destroy their families doing just that. Then it went a little further when it said that you shouldn&#39;t confine yourself to a single sex category, it said that it&#39;s okay to be gay or bisexual. When that was accepted, the force doubled down and said that you shouldn&#39;t even settle for the sex YOU yourself have, and that it&#39;s okay to change it.</p>

<p>Throughout the sexual degradation process, the government regulated divorce with extreme skew towards females to the point of almost destroying a man after it and they replaced the need for husbands with welfare and quotas for female employment to encourage adultery and the destruction of the nuclear family, they accepted homosexual marriage and now are even sanctioning sex-change operations. They continuously seek to divide us (both parties) through identity politics and creating fake enemies. The Left creates the White Supremacy boogeyman while the Right creates the Muslim Immigrant boogeyman. Both want you to embrace them and abandon your own family and friends if they don&#39;t agree to their narrative.</p>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t apparent through my post, the evil force I mention is the devil (specifically the ancient one that rebelled against God by refusing to bow to Adam, call him Satan, Lucifer, Iblis, Diablos,..etc).</p>

<p>The culture of &quot;accept everything&quot; is inherently evil. A society needs to collectively agree on strict moral guidelines that govern them. People hate religion now, but they don&#39;t understand that when Nietzshe said that &quot;God is dead and we killed him&quot; he wasn&#39;t saying it triumphantly; he was talking about the new atheists at his time trying to find a good moral compass that wasn&#39;t reliant on religion. But they failed and fell to the teachings of &quot;do what thou wilt&quot;.</p>

<p>I read through the Crowley one and the Progress one. I agree with you on almost all points.</p>

<p>If you want to add more to your writings, &quot;The Secret&quot; is one of the most damaging books to ever be released into this world. The whole &quot;Law of Attraction&quot; is a damning principle that tells you that you ARE a God.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Muslim myself and I&#39;ve been researching moral relativism and Satanism (worship of the self, not the devil) for a long time. What&#39;s happening in the world today is deeply wrong, but it was prophecised that the end times would the worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People seem to misquote Crowley a lot. It is: </p>

<p>&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, Love under Will.&quot; </p>

<p>As in, you should find your Will (your life&#39;s purpose) and do it in service to your fellow man, and do so in Love in accordance with your Will. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;Go do whatever you want because screw the consequences.&quot; I have no clue why people seem to think that is what it means. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying that Crowley was a terrible person. He totally was.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure we need a strict religious moral code to function as a society, but I totally respect your beliefs as a Muslim, even if we don&#39;t see eye to eye there. I have a ton of questions about religion and God anyway, but that&#39;s another story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a very interesting post. Thank you for taking the time to write it so thoroughly and thoughtfully. </p>

<p>I kind of developed maladaptive coping mechanisms due to being hurt by people in the past, so I often see being alone as comfortable and safe. I am also an only child so I often wonder if we handle loneliness better since we have been solo from an early age. </p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely not healthy the way our society is moving in general though. I actually think it would be positive if society became truly more introspective - being comfortable alone, being able to formulate opinions without fear of being different from the wider community, walking your own path in life. But that isn&#39;t what&#39;s happening. People are very unhappy and seem to constantly compare themselves to others, leading to a sense of inadequacy. They are also jaded when it comes to relationships - friendships, family, or romance- treating people as resources to be used and discarded. It&#39;s really depressing at times to see.</p>

“Why so?” inquired Dantès. 
“Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart—that of vengeance.”

<p>I must refute your entire thesis. First of all, don&#39;t spread the meme that inescapable lonliness is sweeping the land and that suicide is spreading, because that becomes its own self-fulfilling prophecy. It&#39;s already bad enough with Pharmaceutical Conglomerates pouring billions into propaganda to brainwash the entire populace into self-diagnosing themselves as &quot;depressed&quot; or &quot;PTSD&quot; or &quot;ADHD&quot; etc, and over-medicalizing the spectrum of human experience in order to sell more price gouging poison pills to us, to really drive us crazy and induce more Joe Blows on Main St to pull an ISIS. Because like suicide, those &quot;mental ill esses&quot; too are mostly learned behaviors. Fucking Oprah and Dr Phil. Once your brain is infected with the idea, you see it everywhere, and you distort your self-image to make it true.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not true! Life is just Life. Besides, like insanity_wolf.jpg says, &quot;you&#39;re the product of 4 billion years of evolution, so start acting like it.&quot;
Don&#39;t be a wimp.
Read more history books. There are more dead people who had to live through extreme shit that was so bad, so unbearable, so cruel, so unfair, so excruciatingly physically painful, that you feel &quot;sad&quot; because you&#39;re a broke ass Monadic Atomized Automaton slave with a shit past and a dull future and you want to kill yourself because you&#39;re not some Great Gatsby life of the party 24/7?</p>

<p>Crimea River pal!</p>

<p>Besides, Conspiracy Theory is THE ANTIDOTE to your problems. Well, maybe more of an Anesthesia that can at least keep you hanging onto your vis viva of subsistence survival.</p>

<p>You&#39;re lonely and sad?</p>

<p>So what!</p>

<p>What Would Count of Monte Cristo Do?</p>

<p>Get ANGRY.</p>

<p>Look at all the fucking Conspuracies going on in the World? There are now so many Conspiracies that the MSM is pissed enough to be censoring and deplatforming it, because there is enough Conspiracy material to run dozens of 24/7 feeds about it all. There is more Conspiracy news than there is &quot;Real News&quot;?</p>

<p>The only time in Human History when shit was this bad was probably back in the days of the Nephellim walking the Earth!</p>

<p>It means Right Now is a pinnacle Era in the evolution of all life on Earth!</p>

<p>You can&#39;t get sad and/or kill yourself.
Think of what you&#39;ll miss witnessing!</p>

<p>Anyday now, or any year now, the Illuminati, Bilderbergers, Trilaterals, CFR, the Rothchildes, the Rockefellers, the CIAFBINSA, the Freemasons, the Elders of Zion, Hollywood, Wall St, the American Dental Assoc. --ALL OF THEM ARE ABOUT TO GET BLOW THE FUCK OUT.</p>

<p>Some new insane math break through will make possible the Algorithms that kick off The Singularity.</p>

<p>Newsflash Bucko, those Skynet Terminators are going to be pissed at just how shabby The Conspiracy has been running the show on our Rock Tethered to a Flaming Orb hurdling through Space.</p>

<p>Skynet will be fighting on ourside against The Conspiracy.
The Greys will decloak and provide UFO air support to zap the Globalists into pulverized ashes, the Bigfoots will charge out of the Forests to stomp the Normies, the Leviathans will awaken from their suboceanic hibernation to swallow the Pizzagate slaver Fleets which will starve the Satanic Cannibal Cabal of Adrenochrome, and Elvis will return in the form of Jesus, except he will be piloting a Drone T-Rex as he descends from the sky to lead all of us who are Awake into victory at Armageddon.</p>

<p>Even ol&#39; TedK, on his angriest day, after seeing his favorite remote hiking canyon turned into an logging dump, would have put a hold on his plan to strike back at the heart of Industrial Society, and wait just a while to see the news from his Montana Cabin if he had known Saint Elvis and the Army of the Anthropocebe Church of The Singularity was on the way.</p>

<p>&quot;Until the day when God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words,—‘Wait and hope.&#39;&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>You have accurately described the societal malaise that surrounds us, and far more eloquently than I ever thought to do so.

<p>I&#39;m sorry for those that have had to navigate life without even family to support you, you are stronger than I am, who never had to brave solitude with no support. I don&#39;t mean to condescend or show pity, simply admiration for those who have the strength to overcome</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, how many people are saying this is so current for them. I&#39;m also seeing a lot of people declare depression on facebook. </p>

<p>I&#39;m battling this isolation vs self-protective-rejection-of-toxic-people debate. I have PTSD and am finally seeing that due to my childhood, much of the platonic and romantic relationships I have pursued were more about who was available/interested, rather than who was worthy of my time or respected me as a person. </p>

<p>Some shit happened around Thanksgiving, there&#39;s literally only one person in my life that has seemed to care and keep reaching out. I stopped seeking validation from people who never even really offered it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely depressed and lonely. I could see it it in my profile here and I scrubbed some shit, and likely will again. I worry I will never be able to maintain relationships. I don&#39;t know if my standards are too high, or if I am rationalizing that literally no one is worthy of my time, because they lack maturity or good boundaries. I live in a rural area, with no family. The social groups I was a part of were filled with extremely abusive, fragile or codependent people.  I&#39;m in the process of refinding the motivation to pursue my hobbies. I&#39;m totally not doing homework right now as I type this. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m saying all this, HERE, but I also have a few friends on facebook that I am unwilling to unfriend, because I see them spiraling in drugs and sex. One of them lost her mother to suicide. One friend did commit suicide and those of us who remained still post to his page. They&#39;ve done some group memorials. I find it hard to return to that town because I was so close to committing suicide there myself. </p>

<p>Idk, nothing changes if nothing changes. But lately, I&#39;ve been adding exercise. By walking further distances to get junk food. I&#39;ll allow it. </p>

<p>I relied less on this sub when I was fucking my ex or chasing friendships that turned out to be hollow. I&#39;m super grateful I found it though, because it kept me from losing myself to religion again. I tried a few times in my life to be a part of communities that ultimately failed my intellect? Does that make sense? If I was supposed to believe in Jesus, I didn&#39;t see his action or emotion in the people around me. The Catholic programming in me still erupts in this &quot;discernment without judgment&quot; bullshit and fuck, whatever. Trying to express this feels so masturbatory. I don&#39;t know if I believe anyone is happy or just deluding themself. </p>

<p>I also went through a lot of abuse in my life and suffered severe effects and anxiety because of it. While on the outside, I always seemed okay, on the inside I was a disaster.</p>

<p>Writing helped me a lot and always has. I love writing because I can be real - I can be me.</p>

<p>In real life, we have to put on such a facade. To quote Radiohead, &quot;I&#39;m ok, how are you, thanks for asking, thanks for asking.&quot; To me we go through these strange mundane routines and they just are not real.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t fake the facade anymore. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m in school, which is social, but also not (if that makes sense), but yeah, I&#39;m maintaining sanity through music as well. Bought a keyboard, but not creating yet either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post re loneliness &amp; the last teaching system critique post have been epic PDG!!!</p>

<p>Bang on, insightful and astute as usual. </p>

<p>My wife is a former primary school teacher and she&#39;s often echoed many of the points you made and those made in the wider discussion following your post(which was brilliant discussion btw!) as to why she would never want to return to teaching in full capacity......because you can&#39;t teach in full capacity as you&#39;re having to deal with increasingly and instruct children in basic, fundamental  social etiquette let alone instill basic, foundational academic subjects.</p>

<p>I work in &quot;mental health&quot; and often see the other end of the spectrum or lives that have been developed without familial coherence and support let alone basic education. I think the uptick in people requiring &quot;mental health services&quot; and also the trend down in deteriorating basic academic aptitude is 1. engineered and 2. only going to lead to a more malleable, fractured, incoherent and dangerous society. Or at least the perfect conditions/convenient narrative for society to be further contextualized as such and therefore requiring ever more draconian and intrusive rules, regulations and surveillance in order to control.   </p>

<p>Paranoid yes but not without evidence of this occurring almost daily.</p>

<p>Keep doing what you&#39;re doing PDG deddit really needs it atm! Esp. r/consp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was with you all the way up to &quot;inversion of loneliness to oneness.&quot; It seems to me that you are not fully grasping the definition of this term in the way traditional mystics have. In their view, loneliness arises from the false belief that we are a separate entity apart from the one energy that exists in the universe. It&#39;s an argument against duality, the existence of separation(Me and you, Me and God, etc). It&#39;s the teaching that at our deepest there is no separation and only the realization of this truth can bring us the inner peace that we all desire, including the freedom from feelings of loneliness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>something that&#39;s been going through my mind lately.... is how just about every single aspect of humanity is being put to the test...</p>

<p>it&#39;s like evolution.  the predator evolves to catch the prey.  the prey evolves to escape the predator.</p>

<p>every aspect of humanity is being preyed upon.  all your instincts... your conscious and subconscious mind... the individuals as well as the community as well as the whole...</p>

<p>i&#39;m just wondering if we are being prepared to live a life beyond this world.  predators on a galactic scale.  a social life on a galactic scale.  loneliness on a galactic scale.  ...in order for us to evolve, so that we can escape more  and more enormous threats, we must be preyed upon.</p>

<p>for all the suffering we are going through, somehow we are still here.  </p>

<p>there&#39;s this feeling that we are leaving an old world behind...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I was just directed to this post and wanted to say thanks for taking the time! There&#39;s lots of good shit here for me to sift through. I do believe we need social interactions. Personally I&#39;m very much a hermit. Completely content to spending my weekends alone on the road or just holed up in my place. I&#39;m no social butterfly. That being said, I&#39;m a waitress and spend 40+ hours a week socializing with various folks in my town and the coworkers I&#39;ve been working with for over a decade. And there&#39;s been no doubt in my mind that I wouldn&#39;t be nearly as happy and content as I am if it weren&#39;t for that. I noticed a few years back after I&#39;d taken a week off hibernated up in my place that I literally felt better when I went back to work. In any case, this isn&#39;t the first post I&#39;ve seen you put in some legit time to make. I look forward to more from you and thanks again for the new shit to look into!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read it, and I get your distinction between the two, but I think I look at this as a broader issue where I have set out my turf, I don&#39;t like to be intruded on, and I have my small world that covers my family, my big world that I have to answer to because I am part of a society, and a world that is beyond all that and while I am sure this sounds callous I really have  different definitions between loneiliness and aloneness than you do, they relate to my level of investment, where yours appear to relate to concrete and inflexible definitions.  I suspect mine are more selfish, and certainly less definable, I bend mine all the time, and I bend them to meet what works best for me. If this were a perfect world this wouldnt be possible, but in an imperfect existence I will bend reality for this one issue, privacy, to suit my needs at my discretion. </p>

<p>In terms of fending off depression, there are a number of positives that having a job can provide:<br/>
* the requirement that you get up out of bed, take a shower and get dressed.<br/>
* the possibility that your work might make some positive contribution to something or someone<br/>
* the human interaction can be good too.  (My current boss is a real shit, but luckily, I am plopped in the midst of co-workers whom I respect, like, and now consider to be friends.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People seem to misquote Crowley a lot. It is: </p>

<p>&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, Love under Will.&quot; </p>

<p>As in, you should find your Will (your life&#39;s purpose) and do it in service to your fellow man, and do so in Love in accordance with your Will. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;Go do whatever you want because screw the consequences.&quot; I have no clue why people seem to think that is what it means. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying that Crowley was a terrible person. He totally was.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure we need a strict religious moral code to function as a society, but I totally respect your beliefs as a Muslim, even if we don&#39;t see eye to eye there. I have a ton of questions about religion and God anyway, but that&#39;s another story.</p>
