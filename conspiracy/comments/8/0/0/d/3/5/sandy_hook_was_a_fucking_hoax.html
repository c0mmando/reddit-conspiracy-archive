I feel like eventually society will slowly start to figure it out... there&#39;s a lot of damning evidence, and you know how these things start... one guy tells another guy something, then he tells two friends, and they tell two friends, and they tell their friends, and so on, and so on... You know how it goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several web sites, including The Last Great Stand and Fellowship of the Minds, have reported that, by using the Wayback machine (which enables earlier versions of web sites to be accessed, even though they are not current), it is possible to demonstrate that Sandy Hook Elementary School had no internet activity from 2008 until late 2012 in striking contrast to other elementary schools:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where I diverge. Reported =/= proved. I also see highly compressed  screen shot, which could be doctored in all of 5 minutes. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s a nice claim to make for the narrative, but so far no one has proven this internet search history claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re going to run into the same problem. They make claims, but every time I try to verify the information, it&#39;s all easily faked or the &quot;sources&quot; don&#39;t pan out. </p>

<p>And here&#39;s my takeaway from that: If the majority of the claims and sources can&#39;t be verified, there&#39;s not story. </p>

<p>I can look at something like the Mueller investigation, or even Watergate, and you can see how difficult it is to cover up large operations. Too many eyes, ears, and documents. </p>

<p>So when I see something like the Sandy Hook shooting being claimed as a fake, I need only look at the sheer volume of people that would have to keep quiet, and all the doctored documents that would need to be released to make it a real story. </p>

<p>And not one of them fails. The only counter claims are like this one about the internet search history, which <em>can&#39;t</em> be proven. So just like all the others I put it in the &quot;maybe&quot; pile, but just because I don&#39;t understand all the ins and outs of the questions posed (like why they had closed caskets: I CAN THINK OF A FEW REASONS) doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a conspiracy. </p>

<p>In the mean time, no one needs to be touting their claims as truth until they have hard evidence. The victims don&#39;t deserve that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right? And honestly the whole argument that &quot;You are a bad person for saying that children didn&#39;t die at Sandy Hook&quot; is kind of hilarious. I&#39;ve asked people what they think my motivation would be to lie about Sandy Hook being a hoax and have received the response that I hate children in general so I am trying to disrespect the dead children and their grieving families by saying they didn&#39;t die. In other words they think I HATE children so much that I am saying that they are ALIVE and NOT DEAD, just in order to spite them... Makes sense!! They fact that they are resorting to ad hominem attacks rather than addressing your point speaks for itself.</p>

As someone who claims to be a teacher, you should know how broken some of the individuals that we deal with are. Also, you should know how broken some of the actual schools are.

    <div class="md"><p>For all the naysayers, there are many unanswered questions in regards to the Sandy Hook &quot;Massacre&quot;. This list was taken from <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/12/33-unanswered-questions-on-sandy-hooks-3rd-anniversary.html">https://www.activistpost.com/2015/12/33-unanswered-questions-on-sandy-hooks-3rd-anniversary.html</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Why was a &quot;R.I.P. Victoria Soto&quot; Facebook webpage for the alleged dead teacher Victoria Soto of Sandy Hook Elementary School posted before the event occurred?</li>
<li>Why was the United Way charity webpage for Sandy Hook posted before the event occurred?</li>
<li>How did the Arlington Red Devils website post the book on Talking With Children/Students About the Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting on 12/10/2012 (which was contained in the page url), 4 days before the event occurred? If this were some kind of technical glitch, then how did Google’s bots manage to record a cached page for 12/13/2012, still 1 day before the Sandy Hook shooting happened?</li>
<li>How did John Trentacosta (whose house was next to the Lanzas with a lot of activity occurring there at the time), who was CEO of the local Newton bank, start a victims’ fund on the same day so quickly after the event, after receiving in his words “countless requests” to do so? Is it just a coincidence that Trentacosta was also a member of a new council of the New York Federal Reserve, the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council?</li>
<li>According to various researchers, why was the Newtown community seeded with new families in the years leading up to the event?</li>
<li>According to Wolfgang Halbig, why were 16 state troopers pre-positioned 45-60 minutes before the alleged shooting?</li>
<li>Why did the media keep switching its narrative as the story unfolded regarding the actual weapon used? Finally they settled upon a rifle. But how could a rifle kill 26 people in such quick succession?</li>
<li>Why did known actor and Sandy Hook witness Gene Rosen keep changing his story about how he encountered the 6 kids who allegedly came to him? In different interviews he variously claims he found the kids just after feeding his cats in the loft, just after going to breakfast and just after coming home from breakfast. His testimony completely conflicts with that of the school bus driver and the official report. There is also video of him near the fire house walking around slowly, plus a video of him rehearsing his lines with the cameraman …</li>
<li>How was a skinny 19-year-old boy with no military training capable of killing 26 people clean while injuring none? (Trained military veterans have claimed it was highly unlikely or even impossible for someone with the weight of Adam Lanza to execute that many people in so short a time.)</li>
<li>Why was there no evidence of blood? A total of 26 fatalities (children and adult) would produce at least at a conservative estimate 20 gallons (75 liters) of blood. Thus would require a concerted blood cleanup (blood is considered a biohazard in this type of situation), yet when Sofia Smallstorm asked who did the cleanup, all the departments were ignorant of it and even claimed that no one did the cleanup.</li>
<li>Where are the alleged 600+ children of Sandy Hook Elementary School? Why is there absolutely no photo or video evidence of any dead bodies? Why did coroner and chief medical examiner Wayne Carver say the following?: &quot;Uh, we did not bring the bodies and the families into contact. We took pictures of them, uhm, of their facial features. We have, uh, uh—it’s easier on the families when you do that. Un, there is, uh, a time and place for the up close and personal in the grieving process, but to accomplish this we thought it would be best to do it this way and, uh, you can sort of, uh … You can control a situation depending on the photographer, and I have very good photographers. Uh, but uh—&quot;.</li>
<li>According to Wolfgang Halbig, why do the records show no social security numbers for the dead students?</li>
<li>According to Wolfgang Halbig, why do the records show no report of actual shots fired?</li>
<li>According to Wolfgang Halbig, why does the Sandy Hook shooting crime not exist on the FBI 2012 crime report?</li>
<li>According to Wolfgang Halbig, why does the tax accessor’s website shows the victims’ families got free houses on Christmas day when all Government offices are closed? This video shows many Sandy Hook “victim’s” families having their mortgages magically paid off on 12/25/2009!</li>
<li>Why were all the ambulances parked at the fire house away from the crime scene (except one on Dickinson Dr. which was also too far removed to be helpful)? Why were so few EMTs (Emergency Medical Technicians) allowed in the school?</li>
<li>Why does the iconic image of the teacher leading kids out of school contain evidence of Photoshop doctoring and fakery?</li>
<li>Why does the Sandy Hook Timeline of Evacuation not match the video evidence from the trooper’s car stationed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School car park?</li>
<li>Why was there a big electronic sign erected at the entrance to the Sandy Hook Elementary school stating “EVERYONE MUST CHECK IN” if the event were real and not a drill?</li>
<li>Why was there an active shooter drill at around the same place and the same time as the Sandy Hook event? Every recent false flag since at least 9/11 has had this element.</li>
<li>Why are people walking around the Sandy Hook fire house in circles like a movie set? Why was there such a lack of urgency in the emergency personnel who were responding for many hours after 10am when people were still unaccounted for (e.g. nurse Sally Cox who claims she hid in a closet for 4 hours until 1:15pm)?</li>
<li>If Sandy Hook Elementary School was a legitimate and operational school at the time of the event, why is there evidence that the school shut in 2009 due to asbestos, was reinspected in 2011, and was flooded again with Hurricanes Irene and Sandy? We know FEMA and the US Federal Government supplied money to Newtown to revitalize it. Why does the local business Apex Glass claim they were using the school premises for their glass business (apologies but the interview revealing this information has been taken down by YouTube [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9vLEzNsI00%5D">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9vLEzNsI00]</a>)?</li>
<li>Why were the entire school grounds of what we were told was “Sandy Hook Elementary School” demolished and rebuilt? Does this remind you of how the metal scraps from 9/11 were immediately shipped off to China before they could be examined for evidence?</li>
<li>Why did Newtown Town Clerk Debbie Aurelia and Connecticut State Attorney Kevin Kane refuse to release the death certificates and the names of the “victims”? Why did Connecticut officials conspire to pass an unprecedented bill banning FOIA requests and access to death certificates and other information, normally part of the public record as a matter of course for centuries? Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy signed the bill on June 5th, 2013.</li>
<li>Why were there so many black and silver (Government-type) cars around the school and fire house in place before the event?</li>
<li>According to Sofia Smallstorm, why were the exact number (26) of Christmas trees for the memorial already sitting outside the fire house before the event occurred?</li>
<li>Why do so many of the victims’ family members appear to be acting, smirking, giggling, snickering and outright laughing after the event, such as Robbie Parker?</li>
<li>How does one explain the highly strange behavior of coroner Wayne Carver? Why did Carver say that “you can control a situation depending on your photographer, and I have very good photographers”? Why did Carver say that “I hope the people of Newtown don’t have it crash on their heads later”?</li>
<li>Why did Lieutenant Paul Vance threaten to prosecute as a crime anyone who reported information that contradicted the official narrative?</li>
<li>Why did the Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy say that “The Lieutenant Governor and I have been spoken to in an attempt that we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state”?</li>
<li>Why did no one sue the school or the estate of Nancy Lanza?</li>
<li>How is it that no parent wanted to see the dead bodies of their children in the school?</li>
<li>Why were all the funerals conducted with closed caskets?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a simple question for you: why would the government that kills children daily, funds terrorists, orchestrates attacks, etc. care to fake the event instead of just hiring someone to actually just kill the kids?

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was CGI? i mean, you have to just be stupid to think that all the people who eyewitnessed the buildings falling are all lying (not to mention all the firefighters who died from the collapse). Whatever stupid theories there are out there about 9/11 being a conspiracy, to claim that the buildings never fell? or that they were brought down in another way, which was covered up by CGI is beyond &quot;open minded&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy Hook is the only event I’m convinced wasn’t what it seems. I’m not a big believer in conspiracies, I do however like to read other peoples theories about events. While I tend to think events like what happened last week in Florida did occur as explained, Sandy Hook has never made sense to me. I don’t recall anyone ever coming out as a friend or former friend of Adam Lanza. I’ve only ever seen one photo of the guy. In this day and age you mean to tell me there was only ONE picture of this guy? </p>

<p>The biggest flag to me that it isn’t what it seems is the fact they tore the school down. Now I understand wanting to forget the events that happened but to demolish an ENTIRE school? What are they trying to hide? </p>

<p>When I was a sophomore in high school I had a classmate who pulled a gun out in a class my cousin was in and waved it around. All the kids in the room ran out the door and the teacher tried to talk to the guy with the gun. When she got to the door she also walked out and when she did the guy put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. </p>

<p>Now, we didn’t miss any school that week. It made the news of course, this was 1995 so way before Columbine or the major school shootings. The room was taped off with crime scene tape and naturally no once could go in the room. However within a week the room was being used again. From what I hear blood was everywhere. Wall, floor, ceiling. My football coach who taught next door to the room was a Vietnam veteran and he was the first to go in after the gunshot. I remember him saying how awful the sight was. </p>

<p>But the school is still there. The room is still being used to this day. It’s creepy as fuck to walk by and has been for 23 years. </p>

<p>My point is even though something horrible happens you don’t tear down an entire school. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s not that simple. It depends on how old the school was and what sort of condition it was in. The older it was, or the worse a state of disrepair it was in, the easier it would be to convince TPTB to tear it down after a shooting occurred there. My own high school was demolished and a new one was built in its place, no shooting required.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that that was what happened in Sandy Hook, mind you, as I haven&#39;t looked into this case in particular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything but &quot;A Sheep No More&quot;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another &quot;article&quot; from that site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the afternoon of Mon. Feb. 12th, 2018, portraits of both Barack and Michelle Obama were unveiled at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, which is a historic art museum located in Washington, D.C. However, upon further glance of these portraits, there are some deeper messages hidden right in plain sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it also a surprise or coincidence, considering how these portraits were shown to the public directly two days before the “incident” in Parkland, Florida, as of Wed. Feb. 14th, 2018? — On the same day that’s commonly known as Ash Wednesday and Valentine’s Day?</p>

<p>Not to mention how this portrait event also coincides with the release of Marvel’s newest film, “Black Panther” — scheduled to be released on Fri. Feb. 16th, 2018. This film will also be released on the exact same date as the Chinese New Year — this upcoming year being “Year Of The Dog,” and only weeks following the rare Super Blue Blood Moon that occurred back on Wed. Jan. 31st, 2018: an event that had not occurred for over 35 years.</p>

<p>With all of these events occurring so close together, along with the Illuminati symbolism depicted in the Obama portraits, is all of this a “mere coincidence?” Who are they REALLY depicting, and how could this all relate to the END TIMES?!</p>
