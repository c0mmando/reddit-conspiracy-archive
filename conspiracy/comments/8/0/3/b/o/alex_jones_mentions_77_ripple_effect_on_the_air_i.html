       Don't mention you're afraid, authorities feed on your fears and play them against you. They want you to think the slightest thought-crime will seal your fate. They want you to fear a SWAT team one day abducting you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ask yourself in a calm and collected state of mind, what right do they have to spy on you? None. In addition to being unethical it is against the Fourth Amendment. Laws bypassing the Constitution can be overturned or nullified just as easily as they were passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know what they're doing is wrong and they are the ones who are afraid. They fear one day they will have to answer to an angry public for their legal and simultaneously criminal acts. If that scenario ever happens most would sell each other out in a heartbeat if it meant saving one's skin. They are
       <em>
        just following orders.

       If the DoD were remotely smart, they would be watching this video and others to learn what kind of people the bastards are whom they work for are...AND what they have in store for the cops and people who "think" they are helping this nation by serving them.

       for 7/7 wouldn't it be the Ministry of Defence shutting you down &amp; not the Department of Defense? Think about it realistically, it is just a torrent, &amp; I know I've dl'd a lot more subversive stuff than that with no problems. Chill, take a walk, &amp; look at this stuff with an objective eye or it'll start to control you.

       Now try downloading something else.  Alladin or Ann of Green Gables.  See if DoD is denied again.  I'll bet they are.  "Department of Defense" is  huge block of IPs that peer guardian filters out.

       I got ICMP pinged simultaneously from four 11.11.1.x IPs (more DoD) last night and utorrent wasn't even open.

       I should be OK with this?

       Yeah, I find it highly unlikely the majority of snooping would come from recognized IPs.  Peerguardian only works by taking known bad IPs and blocking them.

       It seems more like a scare tactic than anything.  If they were watching you, you wouldn't know it.

       It seems more like some one form AJ's staff was hosting the torent with a spoofed ip.  That's just me believing conspiracy theories though.
