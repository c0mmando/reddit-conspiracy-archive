        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Does anyone feel the same? What&#39;s going on here? These changes do not seem organic to me at all. Just let me preface this by saying that I think there is virtually no difference between the GOP and the DNC, just like Trump/Hillary are, I reckon, two sides of the same coin. </p>

<p>Before, during, and immediately post-election this sub was basically <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> 2.0. Every anti-Hillary post would get upvoted heavily. Trump&#39;s tweets were reaching the top of the sub. Now, this is basically <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> 2.0: Russiagate this, Russiagate that, Mueller shilling etc, with a little bit of 9/11, CIA, false flag conspiracy posts thrown in from time to time. Obviously, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not that much of an echo chamber, but still. </p>

<p>Let me give you an example. Here&#39;s a random web archive snapshot of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, from summer 2016 </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706140415/https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/">https://web.archive.org/web/20160706140415/https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>For the record, this is one of my favorite subs, I love the people here, and I browse it every day. I have made this suggestion before, but what I think would really help <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are flairs and filters. For example, take a look at <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>. You can browse categories (Security, Hardware, Society, Net Neutrality, AI...) and navigate the sub like that, which basically allows you to personalize the &quot;hot&quot; queue and discuss what you want to discuss. </p>

<p>I’m speaking to the fact that there is no practical way to actually separate out politics from conspiracy. To say there is “too much politics” is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of conspiracies and the way they tend to manifest.</p>

<p>Yeah it&#39;s almost like people immediately judge us based on our username. Wild right? I&#39;m sure /pm-me-ur-tits has a lot of backstory too.</p>

<p>The issue isn&#39;t too much politics it&#39;s too much mainstream. Most came here as a shelter from the totalitarian media/reddit to discuss ideas against the grain. This place has now been astroturferd by the political parties in power as you said: so that it&#39;s closer and closer to that sham r/politics everyday and discussion is quelled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can’t think of anything more misguided than assuming you can judge someone based on an Internet handle. You have no way of knowing if the name is ironic, referential, or self-describing. The name can range from an accurate descriptor, to the opposite, to entirely unrelated. If you put stock in something you have no way of actually knowing anything about that says more about you than the person’s username.</p>

<p>And again, there is no practical means by which to sort out people discussing the current politics through a lease of ongoing or possible corruption and those who are just extremely partisan. </p>

<p>How do you distinguish between:</p>

<p>A republican who thinks the democrats are conspiring to overthrow democracy and thus feels compelled to expose the democrats.</p>

<p>A republican who wants to manipulate you into believing the democrats are corrupt so that they can win the next election.</p>

<p>You can’t. You also can’t shut down any conversation of party A or B being corrupt and still pretend you aren’t censoring view points and potential conspiracies. My point was a general comment on the nature of how allowing discussion of politics is essential for allowing discussing of conspiracies. </p>

<p>I disagree with Mistigia adding to anything I said because his point:</p>

<p>1) was not even along the same lines as my own (so certainly wasn’t building off of it</p>

<p>2) The tone reads as one of disagreement so in context is comes across as if they are asserting what I said somehow goes against the notion Astro turfing exists, which is a point that was not raised at all within my comment. </p>

<p>As for the other bit it&#39;s not GoP vs Dems or left vs right. The conspiracy party and conspiracies we followed before during and after election were all well in place before this shitshow of sub subversion (Russians/altright etc) which was actually a reaction to us getting too close to home- Poison the well tactics and look who moved in.</p>

<p>If you had followed the political debacle pre russiagate you would see that the conspiracy which was already in place debunked Russian involvement from the start; which I mean that whole story was retroactively fitted anyway.</p>

<p>But as always it&#39;s not the content but how loud you say it so yes; the astroturfers win; that&#39;s what OP is bitching about. And generally what is killing reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not really a grand secret, it’s just a nod to something I enjoy. It’s a reference to my favorite anime. I was a very big fan of Gundam Wing as a child and I was especially fond of the movie Gundam Wing Endless Waltz. One of the main characters in that film is referred to as Her Excellency Mariemaia Khushrenada. While the character herself wasn’t particularly endearing I liked the name as it was a subtle reference to something I have an appreciation for. </p>

<p>I’m not denying Astro turfers exist, my response to Mastigia was simply to address what appeared to me as unfounded criticism. I read Mastigia’s post as an attempt to counter the point I raised with an irrelevant point. Mastigia’s beliefs or the notion that Astro turfing is prevalent here was never in contention. </p>

<p>My stance on Astro turfing is that the reason it is so insidious is that is essentially impossible to root out.</p>

<p>The reason I feel it’s irrelevant is because you’re basically dealing with Poe’s Law. There is no way to distinguish between someone who genuinely believes something you find stupid and someone who is just posting things to sow division. </p>

<p>But I would rather deal with Astro turfing than be in a position where some authority gets to decide which conspiracies they think are valid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you guys feel that way can we lift that speak-no-shill rule?</p>

<p>I mean we all know they exist. The best thing to do would be let the userbase sort it out; leave mods out of it that way they can&#39;t interfere.</p>

<p>That way when the accusation is made users could check post history and see who has more tenure in r/conspiracy etc</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the rule serves any purpose but to disarm long term sub users. Since discussion couldn&#39;t get any shittier as is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn’t disagree more. I mentioned earlier that there is no way to distinguish someone who genuinely believes something from someone who doesn’t, so why would I support derailing conversations for unprovable accusations?</p>

<p>If you want to point out someone suspicious post history or multiple accounts go ahead, but if the idea is just to open the flood gates of screaming shill at each other, no thanks. You can all evidence without having to actually call someone a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I get called a Trump shill or Russian bot or some other name I’d like to say that I’m not a fan of Trump although I can see why people voted for him as he was positioned as the candidate with no ties to the establishment. I don’t believe that’s true based on who he picked for certain jobs but Clinton was 100% establishment so people weren’t left with much choice. Personally I’d love to be able to vote “None of the Above” in any election and then if that has enough votes it’s then up to the people to select another candidate until they get enough votes.</p>

<p>Anyway I’ve rambled enough, but the reason why people are unwilling to pay much attention to the Trump is owned by Russia claims is that it’s all coming from the mainstream media. Trust in the mainstream media is at an all time low according to the last polls I saw. If they’re the ones pushing a narrative then it’s totally understandable why people ignore it. </p>

<p>Do you want every election the US has tried to influence to be looked at to the same degree no matter what “side” they’re on or are you here because you feel like your “side” was cheated out of the election? If you’re thinking that your “side” has your interests at heart then don’t worry the establishment is bought and paid for so you’ll get the policies you want eventually. The left wing and right wing both belong to the same bird. This sub used to understand thesis, antithesis, synthesis was the control system. While you’re fighting a different aspect of the same entity research labs and universities are finally unveiling tech and science that was known to the elites in the 70s (ontogenetics, acoustic holography, EEG and RF manipulation, neural nets etc). Look at the CIA reading room and some of the “recent” discoveries and see how “recent” they really are. Then look into places like the Royal Society and read their papers on “likely” outcomes in the future. The best magicians keep you focused on the trivial. </p>

<p>If you really want to make lasting changes that benefit humanity then politics isn’t the answer. In fact, politics is the answer to the questions of 30 years ago. I don’t want to sound condescending but if you expand your horizons beyond politics you’ll find that the brightest minds in the world have come to discoveries that have implications that could unite people of all backgrounds to work together. That may sound like empty hippy nonsense but if science that is practical and repeatable proves that hippy nonsense is true then maybe the truth is worth pursuing. Politics is Newtonian and we’ve got answers that are quantum and holographic </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But seriously, where is the evidence? Why can&#39;t we see one single piece of direct evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to influence the election?  </p>

<p>Regarding pizzagate, there is actually huge amounts of evidence in the form of primary documents and personal social media accounts which we can see with our own eyes. We can look at public records confirming the connections made between people associated with the theory. We can look at concrete FBI documents which demonstrate the validity of the unusual symbols found connected to these people.  </p>

<p>With Trump/Russia collusion, we literally have to trust the analysis of unnamed sources and wait until something concrete drops. We have concrete reasons to believe that the very people who are making the accusations were themselves covering for their own wrongdoing. We have text messages, we have direct connections between Fusion GPS, the Obama State Department, and the funding of the dossier, and we have reason to believe that there has been a coordinated smear campaign to misuse this supposed intelligence for political purposes. We have evidence of collusion between the Obama administration and Putin with the Uranium scandal. We have messages between WikiLeaks and Trump associates which turned out to be intentionally misrepresented, unless you believe some journalists, whose job it is to check facts and report on them, just happened to get those dates wrong.  </p>

<p>Show me one single piece of concrete evidence suggesting Trump colluded with Russia and we can have a different conversation.</p>

<p>I’m not going to conflate the two issues as if it’s one or another, both sides are corrupt af. However, there are gross amounts of circumstantial evidence and clear examples of lies pushed by the trump administration about this whole fiasco.  At the beginning it was claimed that there was no time they had contact with russians, but the goalpoasts have been on wheels ever since.
Trumps Florida property sale seems like blatant af money laundering, Trump tower properties owned by Russian criminals, Trumps kid saying they get all the funding they need from Russia, coincidental appearances of oligarch jets in cities where trump was rallying, email communications concerning intel on Hillary, Trump Tower meeting, papadopoulas involvement and indictments, carter page, both dismissed as coffee boys despite photo evidence of them being included in round table meetings with his closest advisors, GOP Ukraine stance change, refusal to enact sanctions, manafort choice as campaign manager, McConnells “act of partisan politics” display to prevent public knowledge, evidence from foreign govts, and this is all just public knowledge stuff. </p>

<p>And I know that none of these are damning, but it should <em>at least</em> be enough for the fuckin conspiracy subreddit to get on board with and do some real digging like they did with pg8 (like some of those connections are obscure as fuck but they were still theorized and put together because a lot of the sub was involved). But instead threads are just as filled with “UH UH NO PROOF STOP SHILLING” as if just because it wasn’t the Democrats there’s no way there could be anything to it. As if both sides were only fucked until trump came along. That is what frustrates me—and I’m sure many other users on this site—the most. Then once in a while a salient point is made and a bunch of others who feel like I do will support it, only to be greeted with contest mode and shilling accusations, which only serves to push people further to the side they already take. </p>
