        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yeah I know we&#39;re all tired of this subject:</p>

<p>Anyone notice the change in 9/11 rhetoric this passed decade? Even just a few years ago I feel questioning was largely tolerated and everyone had their own theories or at least weren&#39;t sold on the official story.</p>

<p>Recently though I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s quite taboo to mention those things in most public forums like Reddit. Bizarre because Reddit used to be at the forefront of the Truther movement. You&#39;d think it would still be general knowledge. Rip Aaron.</p>

<p>Regardless I feel that this taboo- the emotional censorship that is so popular today with tragedy; to grieve and forget without ever daring to ask a question;  was actually given rise by the current gen of highschool/Reddit users most of which were barely out of daipers at the time. </p>

<p>I think this mindset was accelerated and enforced by other shootings, tragedies and false flags (which happen quicker than you can keep up with.) I feel sandy hook was the icing on their cake that finally proved if its tragic enough no one will allow discussion; even in pursuit of justice.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

Even I who doesn&#39;t sign on to many conspiracy theories am willing to accept that there was something really fishy about 9/11.  Just too many coincidences.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is being more acceptable, not less:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What they learned is more than half of all Americans believe the government is concealing information about the 9/11 attacks; as well as the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Another 40 percent believe the government is hiding information about extra-terrestrials and global warming;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel somewhat sorry for Bin Laden, dude was trying to wake americans up to the atrocities he saw happen to fellow muslims (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver">as stated by him</a>) and hoped it would make people question their foreign policy and reduce the US&#39;s influence in the middle east and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Instead it was a blank check for 2 wars, an ever continuing drone war which has yet to abate, combined with the biggest curtail of civil liberties in the name of preventing terror. It threw many things under the bus, people are orders of magnitude more likely to die in a car crash (9/11 killed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/05/september-11-road-deaths">1,595 americans</a> because of the immediate fear of flying leading to more road deaths) but given the <em>fear factor</em> of terror, it gets so much more attention.</p>

<p>Everyone in the US underestimated the intelligence of their enemies, assuming because they hate them they were not capable. It also bred a distrust in American Exceptionalism, nobody could understand why anyone would do this (ignorning the decades of imperialism) leading to the 9/11 truthers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your view seems very twisted to me.  The truthers are by and large cynical with regard to American imperialism.  They are not the most unable to comprehend people wanting to attack the united states.  And the US has been ignoring Saudi evil for a very long time, long before 9/11.  That&#39;s one thing that did not change at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it twisted? Truthers are just unable to fathom that a group of ~20 foreigners, some barely able to speak English, were able to hijack planes and kill 3000 people in a single day with $400-500K. They directly caused <a href="http://www.iags.org/costof911.html">$100 billion of damage</a> and near incalculable losses. 
That&#39;s a 250,000X return on terror investment, probably economically the best ROI of any terror attack in history.</p>

<p>If Truthers did unite to come out to oppose American imperialism / Saudi Ties by rejecting oil and pressuring politicians, they&#39;d be able to make a difference. Instead they retreat to the internet to the ridicule of everyone outside.</p>

<p>Another difference is that although Americans might have been triggered by Pearl Harbor, but the majority of the population was ready to accept the &quot;Saving Democracy&quot; narrative, and really did support the war effort in WWII. The US population lost faith in the Middle East War on Terror only a few years in. It&#39;s still going on. It&#39;s as if 9/11 crossed some war-making boundary that the electorate cannot pull back to any kind of peaceful &quot;status quo&quot;.</p>

<p>It was a lot more taboo then because, according to our collective thought after WWII, America was infallible. Nothing like that could ever happen on our soil. We were the safe country in the world. The most advanced. (We did it to ourselves occasionally, like Oklahoma City, but the thought was no outside forces would invade.)</p>

<p>But it did happen. It was confusing and shifted our worldview. Suddenly we were fearful, when we never were. We needed to trust our government to protect us. </p>

<p>So now that we’ve seen how things played out with patriot act and beyond, and now that we are at a different stage of grieving, we can have more frank, logical, evidence-based conversations. </p>
