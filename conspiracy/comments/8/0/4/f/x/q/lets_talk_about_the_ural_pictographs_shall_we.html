<p>The mystery here is how in the hell could a civilization in the years 3000-2000 BC have had knowledge of advanced chemistry?</p>

<p>Some of the compounds identified have included antibiotics, common 20th/ 21st century plastics like polyethylene, PVC (polyvinylchloride), and graphite.</p>

<p>The video also points to strange pyramidal structures in the Ural region which is a total wildcard and of which there seems to be little information online. I searched r/conspiracy for the word Ural and zero results came up. </p>

<p>Anyway, what do you think? Just some stupid caveman drawings, or perhaps evidence of ancient scientific knowledge? Aliens, maybe, like Vladimir Avinsky thinks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a theory that seems to be gaining some traction, that we as a civilisation are the end product of 200,000 years of gradual development, and that there were advanced civilisations before the end of the last Ice Age. </p>

<p>We have very little knowledge of what mankind was like prior to approximately 11,800 years ago, when the sea levels rose around 400 feet with the melting of the glacial ice caps. It would seem that there were very advanced astrologers who knew all about the stars, and knew of the Earth&#39;s precession which occurs in cycles of some 27,000-odd years. They were also able to work rock in ways which we still can&#39;t guess today, not if we presume accepted Stone Age-levels of technology. </p>

<p>Just how much knowledge got wiped out? Have we in fact spent just a few thousand years starting all over again with our development?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed 100%. But claiming that these drawings on rocks represent chemical compounds is more than a bit of a stretch. You&#39;re claiming that not only did an ancient civilization (which would have to be more than 5000 years old for us to not know about it, since in that case it must have disappeared before the last ice age) also discovered atomic structures, but used the same graphical system to represent organic molecules as we do. 120 degree angles do not necessarily mean sp2 carbon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, that’s easy.  You see, after mankind reached a high level of advancement around 4,000 years ago, they became thoroughly wicked and violent.  Due to this, they were wiped out in a catastrophic world-wide flood.  Post-flood, the few remaining people tried to salvage/preserve (for future generations) what useful knowledge they could.  However, without paper (or at least a steady supply of it) or digital means of doing so, they were forced to use more archaic means, such as: stone tablets, carving on stone walls, etc...  Surely, as much info as possible was passed down orally, but due to the damaged environment of the Earth, people became smaller and dumber (smaller brains) over time, so this method was quite limited.</p>
