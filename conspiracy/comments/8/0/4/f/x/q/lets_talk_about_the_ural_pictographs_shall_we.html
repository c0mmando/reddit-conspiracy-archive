       The mystery here is how in the hell could a civilization in the years 3000-2000 BC have had knowledge of advanced chemistry?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the compounds identified have included antibiotics, common 20th/ 21st century plastics like polyethylene, PVC (polyvinylchloride), and graphite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video also points to strange pyramidal structures in the Ural region which is a total wildcard and of which there seems to be little information online. I searched r/conspiracy for the word Ural and zero results came up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, what do you think? Just some stupid caveman drawings, or perhaps evidence of ancient scientific knowledge? Aliens, maybe, like Vladimir Avinsky thinks?

       There is a theory that seems to be gaining some traction, that we as a civilisation are the end product of 200,000 years of gradual development, and that there were advanced civilisations before the end of the last Ice Age.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have very little knowledge of what mankind was like prior to approximately 11,800 years ago, when the sea levels rose around 400 feet with the melting of the glacial ice caps. It would seem that there were very advanced astrologers who knew all about the stars, and knew of the Earth's precession which occurs in cycles of some 27,000-odd years. They were also able to work rock in ways which we still can't guess today, not if we presume accepted Stone Age-levels of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just how much knowledge got wiped out? Have we in fact spent just a few thousand years starting all over again with our development?

       Impossible to say how much knowledge has been wiped out. It's certainly fun to speculate. I think we agree with the hypothesis that more knowledge was wiped out then history currently has discovered.

       what you refer is about the most recent layer of inhibition (after 8000bp), it did not say that it was buried, says it was backfilled for agricultural purposes...

       Having looked again at my original statement I can see that I left out one key word that totally changes what I was trying to say.

      <p>
       It should read "we as a civilisation are
       <strong>
        NOT

       How many destruction cycles have humans survived? Maybe we're some kind of gigantic livestock farm and every time we get to a certain point where we become knowledgeable enough to actually be a threat to whoever is farming us, they push the reset button and start over.

       I think there's mounting evidence that the last destruction cycle was the Younger Dryas period, 12,900 to 11,800 years ago, which was the cataclysmic end of the last Ice Age and the 400 foot rise in sea levels. I don't think it was a deliberate act by anyone or anything.

       Off the coast of India, there is a huge underwater shelf moving around most of the peninsula. Before the sea levels rose it was all above water. Over the last decade sever long lost cities have been found there, some being identified as stories from their mythology.

       Agreed 100%. But claiming that these drawings on rocks represent chemical compounds is more than a bit of a stretch. You're claiming that not only did an ancient civilization (which would have to be more than 5000 years old for us to not know about it, since in that case it must have disappeared before the last ice age) also discovered atomic structures, but used the same graphical system to represent organic molecules as we do. 120 degree angles do not necessarily mean sp2 carbon.

       The stick drawing is simply the easiest way to represent a molecule that captures both atoms and electronic bonds. I think It could plausibly be developed independently multiple times in history. Maybe even on different planets if an extraterrestrial civilization used symbolic language.

       I’m not sure what you are trying to contribute. Are you saying we’re not allowed to speculate on the meaning of cave drawings from thousands of years ago because we might be wrong? Or just that it’s cool to speculate, as long as we don’t step outside of the official explanation by mainstream archaeology.

       You literally said “the meaning that you are ascribing” when all I did was say the argument was plausible. I didn’t even say I agreed, just that it was a plausible argument. How the fuck else am I supposed to understand that?

       Oh, that’s easy.  You see, after mankind reached a high level of advancement around 4,000 years ago, they became thoroughly wicked and violent.  Due to this, they were wiped out in a catastrophic world-wide flood.  Post-flood, the few remaining people tried to salvage/preserve (for future generations) what useful knowledge they could.  However, without paper (or at least a steady supply of it) or digital means of doing so, they were forced to use more archaic means, such as: stone tablets, carving on stone walls, etc...  Surely, as much info as possible was passed down orally, but due to the damaged environment of the Earth, people became smaller and dumber (smaller brains) over time, so this method was quite limited.
