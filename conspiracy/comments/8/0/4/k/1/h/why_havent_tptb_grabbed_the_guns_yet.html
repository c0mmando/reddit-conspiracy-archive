        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Obviously this last week has been very shooting versus false flagged themed for r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>So let me start by saying; I&#39;m somebody who is really on the fence regarding Sandy Hook, absolutely thinks something is wrong with the official narrative of LV, thinks Parkland/Florida seems legitimate, and is absolutely lost as to why nobody even bothers to mention the Orlando nightclub, Sutherland Springs Church or even Umpqua Community College anymore.</p>

<p>Tell me the basis for the conspiracy again?</p>

<p>If the narrative behind these events being false-flags by TPTB or a rogue element of the alphabet agencies, why has there never been any REAL push for gun control?</p>

<p>Now before everyone froths at the mouth, downvotes and yells, highlight to me REAL lobbying effort to increase gun control. TPTB can kill thousands of Americans with some planes, drop whole buildings to create a trillion dollar machine, they can use propaganda to veto military actions against sovereign nations. </p>

<p>They can pretty much do what they want, yet have never put in solid effort for gun control. If gun control was the true goal, we would, at the very least, have had Bills make it to the Senate. </p>

<p>This is where the false flag narrative regarding mass shootings breaks down for me. </p>

<p>Question 1: Please, explain how, after the decade(s) since Columbine, Virginia Tech, etc TPTB wouldn&#39;t have at least got close to passing Bills?</p>

<p>Question 2: If the purpose isn&#39;t for gun control, then what is it? LV is the most suspicious of all.mass shootings I&#39;ve looked at, and the most compelling and realistic argument I find, is the prospect that an arms deal or drug deal of some sort went wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody ever overthrew an oligarchy with pistols. The weapons that concern the oligarchy are semi-automatic rifles, which is why the dreaded AR-15 is part of every mass shooting since SH. </p>

<p>Q1: Because the majority of Americans don&#39;t want to be disarmed. In a red state, voting for gun control is political suicide. The teevee uses the NRA boogeyman to obfuscate this because they are attempting to circumvent democracy. </p>

<p>Q2: The goal is to ban combat capable weapons. LV was different--they couldn&#39;t get it out of the news fast enough. It wasn&#39;t  a made for teevee event, like SH or Florida.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. In the last few days I&#39;ve seen highly upvoted &quot;common sense&quot; measures suggested such as: </p>

<p>Creating a federal tax for a victims fund and costly annual mental exams for license and registration renewal (so, poor people can&#39;t have a gun?) </p>

<p>Restricting anyone that has ever been treated for a mental or drug problem (there goes anyone that has been treated for ADD or depression.) </p>

<p>Restricting anyone that has taken an SSRI unless the doctor will sign off that the person is stable upon completion of the med (what malpractice insurance would ever even let a doctor sign something like that, regardless of the risk?) </p>

<p>So, there goes the 2nd amendment for a huge portion of the country for seemingly &quot;common sense measures&quot;.</p>

<p>Add to that, another generation practically begging to be saved from guns- actors or otherwise. I&#39;m giving it 10 years before we ask TPTB to &quot;relieve&quot; us of our 2nd amendment right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taking the guns from everyone isn&#39;t the goal.    </p>

<p>They need gun crime to justify more police.  They want armed citizens who agree with the totatalitarian agenda. &quot;Unofficially&quot; state sponsored vigilantism ( and other domestic terrorism ) is an important tool in the totalitarian toolkit.</p>

<p>What they want is the public to agree to them restricting and or taking away guns.  Then they can implement a system to &quot;identify threats&quot;.  <strong>This system is what&#39;s being created now.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not after the guns. At least not yet. They want to fatten their wallets by getting us to buy more guns. And deepen the divide between people. See page 4 of <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">this pdf.</a> To quote the key parts of it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[They] will tell me that one side or the other must be right. Given a certain question, they can&#39;t all be wrong, can they? </p>

<p>Well, if they are all paid to be wrong, they can. This is easiest to see from the so-called debates we
watch on TV. Whether it is political debates between candidates or manufactured debates on news
programs, we always see the question divided two ways, and the people on both sides speaking
nonsense. The truth is always avoided by both sides, as if it is a virus. Let&#39;s take a topic, say, gun
control. This is probably the hottest topic of the past two years. My knee-jerk reaction is to be against
gun control, if only because the governors are for it. If the government is trying this hard to sell me
something, I know it is not worth buying. The government has proven over and over it can&#39;t be trusted,
so I do the logical thing and refuse to trust it. But that doesn&#39;t mean I have gone out and bought a gun.
I am not a hunter so I have no use for a gun. I don&#39;t really think a gun is going to even my chances
against the government. But this is exactly what the pro-gun side seems to be arguing. And it seems to
be what the audience is hearing, since the audience is going out and buying guns like they are about to
be discontinued.</p>

<p>Here is what you never hear in the gun control debate from either side. This is what I would say to the
government when it sent in some stuffed shirt to promote gun control:</p>

<p>&quot;Look, I have no need for guns. Most of my neighbors have no need for guns, unless they are hunters. If you
want us to quit buying guns and ammunition in such outrageous numbers, why don&#39;t you quit scaring the shit out
of us with all these faked murders like Sandy Hook and the Boston Marathon? Why don&#39;t you quit arming the
police with tanks and machine guns? Why don&#39;t you quit using the army and National Guard to run suspicionless
checkpoints? Why don&#39;t you quit running drills in schools and small towns, with black helicopters and live
ammunition? Why don&#39;t you quit tasering people to death for minor infractions? Why don&#39;t you quit building
private jails to house people who have done next to nothing? Why don&#39;t you quit turning the DHS into a Gestapo?
Maybe if you guys quit acting like Nazis, we would quit buying so many guns. Has that ever occurred to you?&quot;</p>

<p>But you never hear that. You often hear some variation of the argument that the Constitution gives
people the right to have arsenals of AR-15&#39;s, to protect themselves from the government. That isn&#39;t any
more sensible than the government line. If we are going to debate the topic (rather than just allow that
what is, is what must be), we might want to make some rational suggestions, such as that it isn&#39;t
necessary for the government to be at war with its own people. We got along fine as a country for 225
years without a Department of Homeland Security, and it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to turn back the clock
just 14 years, to before 2001. None of this is necessary, neither the arming of the citizenry nor the
militarizing of the police force. If we got rid of a few bad people at the top, it would all end tomorrow.</p>

<p>As it goes with that topic, it goes with most others. Neither side is ever telling you the truth, because
they are both trying to make a buck off of you. The gun control people are trying to get more taxes for
“Homeland Security,” while the gun advocates are hoping to sell you a gun. Just imagine the total
market for domestic arms sales in the past five years. It boggles the mind. Which means the
government is probably playing both sides, as usual. I would be willing to bet that most of the money
spent on guns in the US since Obama took office has gone into the pockets of the same billionaires who
are profiting from Homeland Security. It is doubtful that most folks have ever thought of that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paper then goes on to show how a HUGE spike in gun sales have profited the biggest investment firms. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are screwing you from both ends. The people they are hiring to debate gun control in the
media on both sides are working for the banks. The escalation benefits them from all directions. </p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time o this reply, but I hope to offer a few thoughts,  first I get the suspicion that the real PTB  have their fingers a little bit of everywhere.  Human-slayer manufacturing corporations make a shit ton of schmangles from selling us their phallus-adjacent power fantasies.  They also profit nonphysically from the death, fear, anguish that these devices create.  I think the discourse about it all is a schismous Because I think they aren&#39;t quite settled with their POV.  On one hand they have a lot to gain by creating a world where everyone is paranoid of each-other because everybody owns an ape-slayer.  They would also stand to gain much, however, by ensuring only their chosen apes were equipped with ape-slayers.</p>

<p>Either way, the many FF and MS they keep bandying about on blood+guts programmingTM feels ritualistic to me.  Especially LV.  Mass sacrifice/collective negative focus type rituals.  Just my thoughts,  I&#39;m not someone to get lost in the detailsdetailsdetails, but I have a solid intuition and keep my eyes on the big picture best I can while I tend my garden.</p>
