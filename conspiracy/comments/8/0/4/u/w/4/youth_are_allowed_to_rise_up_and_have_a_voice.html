    <div class="md"><p>Yep. You can pretty much compare the budgets of the defense contractors and Wall St (OWS targets) to civilian arms manufacturers to see why the media falls in line the way they do. Also, this song and dance about gun control has been going on so long the outcome is pretty much certain: at most, Congress will pass a few token laws maybe concerning bump stocks, background checks, or reporting requirements, none of which will have an effect on the gun manufacturers&#39; bottom line. But in the meantime, sales of ARs and other semiautomatic rifles will increase due to the perceived fears. </p>

<p>All the big money players win from this: gun makers have increased sales, political parties get increased donations to either pass or stop gun control, CNN appears relevant. Neither party nor the interests that own them have much to lose with this being publicized, and it serves as a useful distraction for other issues. OWS was specifically targeted at those other issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t understand is why the NRA is being made out to be the villains here, when they are also advocating for increased background checks and the banning of bump-stocks. As a matter of fact I don&#39;t think there is anything they <em>could</em> do that would make them not be cast in a negative light, short of conceding to every demand being made on &quot;gun control&quot;(banning the AR-15 and similar weapons), or shutting down as a whole.</p>

<p>I think the goal is simple: make the NRA into a toxic entity that anyone who imagines a political career wouldn&#39;t want to have their backing out of fear of public backlash. In addition, various companies and groups would divest themselves from the NRA in exchange for &quot;justice points&quot;, as I&#39;ve come to call them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Questionable history. OWS was originally a relatively grassroots movement. When it started to pick up steam it was subverted by Soros and was granted news coverage. &quot;The 1%&quot; was an allegory of those who controlled the financial system in an unfair way, but was quickly transformed into &quot;eat the rich&quot;. The original message of shady financial/deep state agents working against the good people soon became advocation for literal communism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO the way TPTB dealt with OWS was to have the mainstream media continually focus on the crowding, the unsanitary, the nuisance, and the inarticulate fringe in order to progressively trivialize the entire thing to the point where the news of it became predictable.  Shortly after the public&#39;s approval and focus on it waned to a statistically safe level the cops were sent in to drive them out without repercussions. </p>
