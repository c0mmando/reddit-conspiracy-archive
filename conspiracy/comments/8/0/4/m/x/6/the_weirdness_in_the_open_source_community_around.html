       So I was googling around about how to build a ground penetrating radar system without having to buy/rent, so that I could see what was beneath my recently deceased mom's house.   Why?  Because when I was there for a couple of months I noticed a bunch of wifi signals, whilst scanning the area, whose signal strength seemed to move from well away to as strong as the local radios I was using.  And since it was a typical suburban street, knowing who was around me, the only place I could surmise the signals were coming from was directly beneath me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, enough with the background.  What I found was that there were in fact some open source ground penetrating radar works done.  There was a guy who got some positive feedback from Hackaday who seemed to get it done -
       <a href="http://embedded-lab.com/blog/open-source-ground-penetrating-radar/">
        http://embedded-lab.com/blog/open-source-ground-penetrating-radar/
       </a>
       .  But all of his work has been scrubbed.  This is weird.  Generally nerds who do cool shit and get acknowledged for it don't remove their work.  Googling around some more I noticed that every single example of open sourced GPR work, outside of the software domain, was scrubbed.  Here's another one -
       <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vgeoradar/">
        https://sites.google.com/site/vgeoradar/
       </a>
       .  Note his comment: "I do not share/offer/sale circuit and building information".  If you start down this rabbit hole you'll see that much of this information has been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This begs the question?  What is it about GPR that prevents nerds from sharing their findings?  Is it that this tech could be used to identify otherwise hidden underground structures?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a weird rabbithole, and I encourage anyone who is interested in this subject to see for themselves that there are no schematics and designs for rolling your own system that are available in the public domain - even though this information was once available from a few different sources.

       If there was an advanced civilization from, say, 50K years ago, how much evidence would exist from that civilization, and where would it be? I’m talking a civilization at least as advanced as ours. So there would have been cars, laptops, iPhones, guns, you name it. The vast majority of this stuff would have either been ground to unrecognizable bits by glaciers, or dissolved by several thousand years of salt water submersion. Anything else would be buried, probably deep enough that casual excavations would not have revealed anything much in the past 500 years or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe, if someone discovers something out of place, the first thing they do is take it to a gatekeeper (museum or university) to validate it or find out what the heck it is. At that point, if all the gatekeepers are owned, and plausibly speaking this would be a conspiracy of maybe a few hundred people world-wide, it wouldn’t be too hard to keep these things suppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe TPTB are worried that if GPR got into everybody’s hands like metal detectors, the gatekeepers would be overwhelmed and knowledge of our true hunan roots of civilization would get out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe people are just greedy as fuck and don’t want random people exploiting mineral deposits under their houses?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe it’s more common than you think for the government to tunnel under things and they don’t want everybody being able to find it?

       Dr. Richard Sauders books on d.u.m.b.'s are worthwhile.  While that may be a stretch for the matter at hand, his work, the research, data, presentation is extremely damning to there being extensive hidden facilities.  Speculation from there becomes exceedingly exotic. Be that as it may, with the bizarre level of conditions currently underway, more and more the stranger ideas have relevance.

       The guy who did the hackaday build used an amplified tv antennae (UHF,VHF ranges) for his signal generation.  Given the ubiquity of signals in this spectrum I don't think there's a dangeous EMF issue, or there is one and we've all been living with it for years, unaware of it.

       How interesting! If GPR isn't an option, how about wifi triangulation? This software might be all you need:

       If it's a really big deal, you can use one or more SDRs to triangulate all emissions across the microwave bands.

       The tech you are interested in is probably deemed classified for reasons of national security. This is why the info is scrubbed. The reason is because there are tons of underground tunnels  / bases belonging to the government that are supposed to be kept secret.
