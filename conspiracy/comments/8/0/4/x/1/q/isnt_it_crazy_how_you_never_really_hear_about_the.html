<p>Do we just not ever try to hack anything? Are we just THAT good at it that we never get caught? Or is it that we hack whatever we want, and then leave a digital trail that leads right back to our enemies? My guess is the third option.</p>

Everything we see today makes 100% sense (lack of tangible evidence, furious finger pointing, lazy online social media attempts to bolster one-party/deepstate agendas that are anti-populace being blamed on foreign parties) when you accept the possibility - with reference to what we already know from Vault 7 - that these types of actions could be performed by the CIA (or even Israeli agents that we give laissez faire freedom to do whatever they want with our resources) and then made to look like they were done by Russians.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>From what I remember, Vault 7 came from wikileaks, but no one know the source who leaked it.  I&#39;ve heard many people, and I belelieve Bill Binney was one, who claim It&#39;s a new whistleblower.  It&#39;s why I think the media ignored it.  The MSM normally tries to shoot the messenger, but since they can&#39;t make the story smearing the anonymous leaker and have already smeared wikileaks, they just ignored it completely for the most part.  </p>

You seem to equate &#39;civilization&#39; with conservative USA, which is it definitely not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from what everyone&#39;s mentioned about US media not covering it to insulate the US IC from criticism, I think another important point is that foreign nations and corporations wouldn&#39;t exactly want to broadcast that they got hacked. For Russia and China, it would make the governments appear weak, which is a much bigger deal to them in single party countries; they have no one to shift the blame to like we do here. </p>

<p>In addition, attribution is such a damned hard problem. Most of the APT29/Cozy Bear attribution, at least what was released by the IC, was essentially: &quot;They&#39;re using tools and methods consistent with APT29, and utilizing servers they&#39;ve used in the past.&quot; Since a lot of these tools and methods are known, at least within the industry, it&#39;s not terribly difficult to make it appear that another actor carried out the attack. </p>

<p>The US (or factions therein) only publicize foreign attacks when they have a political or geopolitical advantage to gain by doing so. I imagine it&#39;s a similar calculus for foreign nations, and they just have less to gain by accusing the US of specific attacks. </p>

<p>I find it fascinating that the US rarely seems to ever get caught doing things like this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they were caught, who would report on it? Would it be the media in the target nation or the media in the USA? And what media do you read? You&#39;re assuming that the US rarely seems to get caught because you don&#39;t see many stories about it in the Western media. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s in the interest of the Western media to report on every US hacking attempt.</p>

<p>Are you aware that Russia and China develop their own CPU&#39;s and other computer hardware specifically so that they can have trust in them? Doesn&#39;t that imply that they don&#39;t have trust in CPU&#39;s and hardware made by US companies? That attitude is either based on extreme paranoia or experience.</p>

<p>The US hacks the world. The world knows it. The Western media doesn&#39;t bother to report on it because we have to maintain the illusion that we are the good guys.</p>

<p>I’m sure we do, and yet, I also wonder if we are simply don’t have the massive resources dedicated to this that Israel and Russia and probably China do. So our attacks are more targeted and more finessed and so we actually don’t hear about them as much due to lower frequency, impact, and visibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve worked in computer networking and software for a long time and all of the most brilliant minds I&#39;ve encountered in those fields have been Eastern European or Russian. I have yet to meet an American or Western European who was on that level. That&#39;s very curious and it could be for any number of reasons. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there are less brilliant minds in the USA compared to Russia and recently I&#39;ve started to wonder if the brilliant minds in the USA don&#39;t make it into private industry at the same rate as e.g Russians do. And if they don&#39;t, where do they go? </p>

<p>Unfortunately I didn&#39;t go to university in the USA so I don&#39;t have any experience of how recruitment by intel agencies happens there. But I&#39;m aware of an approach that was made by a Euro intel agency to a friend of mine in the UK. So I do believe Western intelligence pays close attention to graduates in certain areas.</p>

<p>Whether that translates into Western intel agencies being staffed by the brightest and best, I can&#39;t say. It&#39;s appealing to think so. </p>

<p>I really doubt that the scale and frequency of attacks by the USA is less than that of China or Russia. And I say that solely because the majority of the computers in the world are running US-developed operating systems and software. As a result there are more attack vectors available to the USA. The rest of the world has to reverse engineer the software and play catch-up. But the USA has the hacks in it&#39;s pocket before the software is even released. We know the USA is mass surveilling millions of devices and billions of network packets this very second. We suspect China and Russia are but there is literally no way for them to match the scale the USA is capable of. They don&#39;t have the same level of access to the developers and manufacturers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the additional examples. Now I’m interested in looking back into those as well, knowing now what we do about hacking tools from the intelligence agencies. How’d we get caught? Who are the sources? Is there a beneficial reason those companies had for letting the story become public? Is the way we were caught similar to how we’ve caught the Russians/Chinese/Koreans in more recent years?</p>

<p>So many interesting questions now.</p>

That&#39;s also in addition to all the hacking that the CIA and FBI and other US intelligence agencies get up to on their own.</p>

<p>Any accusations the US makes about anyone else hacking anything or anyone else is a joke and no proof has ever been offered for any of those claims besides the unverifiable say-so of some the US agencies that are doing all that spying on everyone else themselves.</p>

<p>Now none of those agencies or any of the people in the know in them or in the US government told us about anything about all that illegal spying on all of us and everyone else anywhere else on the planet. </p>

<p>In fact they repeatedly lied their asses off about it. So if we can&#39;t trust or believe whatever they have to say about their own activities how can we possibly trust whatever they have to say about anyone else&#39;s?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia got caught hacking America because Israel was hacking America during JCPOA. Obama cut Israel off from the Iran deal bc they were trying to sabotage it and feed America false intel. Research Stuxnet 2.0. Russia used Israel&#39;s backdoor to spy. Israel got mad and turned Russia in, exposing themselves. I&#39;ve made several posts about this you can find. So if Russia was hacking voter databases, so was Israel. Everything we are blaming on Russia was really Israel and Russia, and most likely many other global players.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s another plausible option that seemingly no one has brought up: Authoritarian states are much less likely to admit to any kind of weakness because it undermines their authority / legitimacy. </p>

<p>Propaganda works differently in &quot;democratic&quot; and &quot;authoritarian&quot; countries. With the former fear is the common trope with the latter tending to use an image of strength/omniscience. Makes sense when you think about it. Fear is more likely to get you votes/legitimacy needed for legislation that undermines democracy, whereas the latter is centered around fear/respect of the ruling body and anything that lessens that takes away legitimacy.</p>

<p>Hi, feom Ausyralia and well, basically the rest of the World.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve heard of the things you have done. There&#39;s documentaries and text on it everywhere. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be offensive when I say, perhaps you aren&#39;t searching hard enough. Many of you claim to &quot;research&quot;, but the US MIC conspiracy is well known around the globe. From the deliberately late involvement in the European theatre during WW2, through Vietnam, Korea, Guatemala, Panama, Nicaragua, Indonesia, Iran, Chile, Guyana, So Salvador, Lebanon, Yom Kippur. These are just off the top of my head.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not throwing shade at the US, I&#39;m just suggesting that maybe Americans aren&#39;t actually being taught or researching their military interventions, clandestine or otherwise, around the world.</p>

<p>&quot;The Coming War with China&quot; is a great doco for current state of play between the US and China. </p>
