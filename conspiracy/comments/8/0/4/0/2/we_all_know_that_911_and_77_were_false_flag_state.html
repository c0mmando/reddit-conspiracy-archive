    <div class="md"><p>The truth can be concealed, it can be disguised, it can be overwhelmed, it can be denied and it can be delayed...but it cannot be destroyed. Some people just don&#39;t get that. Such people perceive that &#39;truth&#39; is what the majority believes to be true - which is a fallacy, of course, because the &#39;real&#39; truth (no matter how insignificant or minute) has an everlasting influence on this physical universe. We exist in a universe driven by causality. </p>

<p>No, &quot;they&quot; didn&#39;t expect the truth to come out. They did in fact go to great lengths to deprive the world of the facts, but &quot;they&quot; underestimated the general (world) population&#39;s ability to recognize truth from half-truth/fiction. &quot;They&quot; are men of great power and influence, and will use this to selfishly protect themselves...so don&#39;t expect that they will be brought to justice just because the truth is coming to light.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that the point? Don&#39;t they want to get away with it without being suspected of a crime?</p>

<p>But they have gone to pretty great lengths to disprove it. </p>

<p>Maybe you read my question wrong. Why did they make their involvement so obvious? That&#39;s what I&#39;m asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of people, like it or not, don&#39;t feel their involvement <em>was</em> obvious. They believe what they want to believe.</p>

<p>As such, your views make you an outsider to the majority. Therefore, you get to be the crazy one.</p>

<p>Nothing against you. Just saying that&#39;s how it is.</p>

<p>I think they&#39;ve gone to great lengths to validate that the official story is the one that everybody recognizes. But I don&#39;t think they <em>have</em> spent much effort in attempting to discount all the conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s something akin to, if you kill someone, and get away with it, but then go and change your entire identity, you&#39;d cast suspicion by changing your identity. If you acted no differently than before, you might never be found out.</p>

<p>So, if they continue to act as thought nothing is amiss about 9/11, then, in the view of the majority, there must not be. In spite of what you read on Reddit and elsewhere, the number of people who <em>disbelieve</em> 9/11 is very low. The people who have questions is a bit higher, but, for the most part, people just go along with what they were told, for fear of being thought crazy, even by themselves.</p>

<p>So, the answer to you, they <em>didn&#39;t</em> make their involvement obvious. You only think it&#39;s obvious. (I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not, though. But &quot;obvious&quot; is a relative term, you see.) </p>

<p>Did you ever see that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pK0BQ9CUHk">video</a> where they&#39;re all passing the basketballs? It&#39;s sort of like that. (Maybe.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Edit:</em> In thinking more about this, I&#39;m seeing that maybe I did misunderstand you. I see you&#39;re not asking why they haven&#39;t bothered to <em>cover it up</em> more, you&#39;re asking why it was allegedly done in such a way that it <em>could</em> be uncovered.</p>

<p>I guess, presuming the rogue-government theory, it would be easier to achieve with a lower level of complexity. Where ultimately, you just need a catalyst to set everything into motion, and it ultimately <em>doesn&#39;t</em> matter if people believe you or not. Think PATRIOT Act and Afghanistan and Iraq War.</p>

<p>At some point, it doesn&#39;t matter how many people disbelieve it all, so long as the majority of people are blinded by American flags. Or even if they&#39;re not. (I take no official stand either way. -- I think some die-hard conspiracists are nutty, but I recognize that, at the very least, the Bush administration was very opportunistic after 9/11. I have my doubts on the official story, but sometimes I can&#39;t wrap my head around it being deliberate, even in spite of Operation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Northwoods</a> and all.)</p>

<p>So officially, no matter how complex or un-complex it has to be, there will always be people who say, &quot;No, that couldn&#39;t possibly be.&quot; There will always be plausible deniability, just like JFK. There is no <em>one</em> accepted JFK conspiracy theory, even if most people don&#39;t think it was what it was. We&#39;ll probably never know the <em>actual</em> truth, even if we currently know that some of it was a lie.</p>

<p>So, when you can&#39;t tell people, &quot;This is exactly what happened,&quot; to cancel the official story, the official story will still stand. Anyway, as I said, the population doesn&#39;t have to <em>keep</em> believing it, so long as they were convinced of it at one time, long enough for you to accomplish what you needed to accomplish.</p>

<p>But, all in all, not everyone will believe as you do, so, as such, their involvement, or alleged involvement, was as non-obvious as it needed to be. In a way, like any lie, it doesn&#39;t need to <em>not</em> be disproven, so long as it <em>can</em> be believed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still haven&#39;t even touched on my topic at all. </p>

<p>My question is &quot;why did they <em>intentionally</em> make it obvious?&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let a whole swarm of thoughts and biases hit you yet. Just listen to my thoughts, not your thoughts. If you can&#39;t do that, you&#39;re not listening. </p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious to me that they not only made it obvious that it was a conspiracy, but that they <em>intentionally</em> did so. Bringing sanity into the equation will only make me not take someone seriously. We&#39;re talking about the situation, not the validity of someone&#39;s perception. My perception is valid. Just operate under that assumption, otherwise none of this will be constructive. I&#39;m a very intelligent and able person. Trust me.</p>

<p>I knew it was a conspiracy almost from the moment it happened, when I was in high school. None of it added up (talking about 9/11). The tiny hole in Pennsylvania. The tiny hole in the Pentagon. Something just wasn&#39;t right from the beginning. I had had a shocking and traumatizing moment in my life only 2 years prior so the shock and trauma many people felt on 9/11 was not so acute with me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not worried about what the masses believe, or anything like that. I&#39;m trying to uncover their motive for doing things this specific way. It wouldn&#39;t have been hard to crash a real plane into the ground in Shanksville. No reasonable person can look at that &quot;hole&quot; and conclude that they <strong>ACTUALLY EXPECTED</strong> us to believe that was the site of a plane crash. That&#39;s just totally unreasonable. In that way, they stoked the fire of conspiracy theories unnecessarily. And you have to conclude <em>intentionally</em>. Either that, or there was some reason they had to do things that way. Maybe Shanksville and the Pentagon were last minute decisions? I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>And 7/7 is even more baffling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree that they think of us as &quot;the cattle, the rocks, trees, grasses, and air...simply a natural resource that, from time to time, must re-ordered, re-organized, re-controlled...&quot;</p>

<p>They think of our lives as having no real worth/value at all. To put it bluntly, they&#39;re determinists. They think of us as &quot;thinking meat&quot;. And they think of our thought patterns as simple and easy to fool. But they could have fooled us if they wanted to. They could have crashed planes into the Pentagon and in Shanksville. The 9/11 truth movement would be miniscule if they had done that. But they didn&#39;t, and it&#39;s not. It&#39;s <strong>huge</strong>. Basically everyone from other all other countries knows it was an inside job. It&#39;s only in America where there are such high amounts of people who believe it was Islamic terrorists. </p>

<p>I agree that hubris is their Achilles heel. They underestimate the opposition. They&#39;ve dug their own grave, I think. There will be many more &quot;tests&quot; of our gullibility, but we&#39;re equipped with the critical thinking skills and the suspicion now to sniff out any bullshit trying to be peddled to us. Not totally, of course, but more than ever, definitely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not sure that everything they would have allegedly orchestrated went according to plan. Perhaps the plane that &quot;crashed&quot; in Shanksville was destined for somewhere else. The fact is, none of us can come up with specific details, so all we can do is say, &quot;This looks suspicious.&quot; We can only speculate as to motives.</p>

<p>I guess the real point is, Hitler didn&#39;t care if people figured out he set the Reichstag fire. Did he set the Reichstag fire? What were they going to do? He was Hitler.</p>

<p>He got the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree">Reichstag Fire Decree</a>, yada yada yada. Even now, we can&#39;t conclusively prove one way or another if the fire was deliberate, or if they were just opportunistic.</p>

<p>So, things will always be a shade of grey. Were the things that happened intentional? Was it concocted by a large group, or a small group? Did things fail in their plan? Which things?</p>

<p>But, basically, if it all <em>was</em> planned out, it didn&#39;t matter how it all went down, so long as it was relatively believable, which it was. Whether it was intentionally obvious is debatable, or whether the obviousness was simply disregarded because it wasn&#39;t important in the overall scheme of things.</p>

<p>It really comes down to a level of magnitude. You have to figure that not <em>everybody</em> was in on it, and, obviously, they didn&#39;t want <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot">whistleblowers</a>. So, even with the most powerful people, they had to keep things small. Presumably people connected to the major media networks were involved. Controlling that is more important than the actual course of events they report. It&#39;s just the tone that it gets reported in, and the thoughts they put into people&#39;s heads.</p>

<p>So, why was it supposedly blatantly obvious? I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s so much flaunt-it-in-your-face, look-at-what-we-can-do. But a limitation of their resources. It succeeded because they said it succeeded.</p>

<p>But, walk down the street, start asking people if they think 9/11 was a fraud. See how long it takes to get beaten up. This will be your proof that it wasn&#39;t <em>intentionally</em> obvious. If it were obvious, no one would believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All valid points. I just disagree with your very last one. Scant evidence reported the right way will nullify any obviousness in minds of most people. They trust the media too much. Us knowing about it and not being able to do anything about it is the worst of all. It&#39;s got a devastating effect. That&#39;s why we must always fight our own apathy and inactivism. Here&#39;s a quote from Noam Chomsky that I think is pertinent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What remains of democracy is to be construed as the right to choose among commodities. Business leaders have long explained the need to impose on the population a &quot;philosophy of futility&quot; and &quot;lack of purpose in life,&quot; to &quot;concentrate human attention on the more superficial things that comprise much of fashionable consumption.&quot; Deluged by such propaganda from infancy, people may then accept their meaningless and subordinate lives and forget ridiculous ideas about managing their own affairs. They may abandon their fate to the wizards, and in the political realm, to the self-described &quot;intelligent minorities&quot; who serve and administer power.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What they&#39;re doing is completely stealing our democracy and our ability to be democratic. Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hegemony-Survival-Americas-Dominance-American/dp/0805074007"><em>Hegemony or Survival</em></a> if you get the chance. It&#39;s kind of old (from 2003), but it&#39;s really good. They use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak">doublespeak</a> to perfection. They say certain things when they really mean the exact opposite. And their rhetoric only makes sense when you imagine they&#39;re saying the exact opposite of what they&#39;re actually saying. This, I think, more than anything else, is what tricks people.</p>

<p>In lieu of that, I&#39;m going to take his advice and stop investigating 9/11 and 7/7 and the JFK assassination... I was having the feeling just now before you posted that comment that it&#39;s all just designed to take you on lead after lead after lead... a wild goose chase with no end in sight. The desired effect is the pompous announcement that they are in control. No matter what you do you can&#39;t pin them down. You can&#39;t get any edge on them. This is how they impose their &quot;philosophy of futility&quot; on us. </p>

<p>Luckily, I&#39;ve felt like this for quite some time, and I&#39;ve just written a book that counters their whole ideology. I see their antics for what they are. It&#39;s a way for them to gain control. Maybe they have (and had) some level of control, but these shows they put on for us (that&#39;s all they are: shows) are power grabs. I call it hierarchical meme propagation. They <em>do</em> choose the most prime time venues for their antics because they want to convince us all. 9/11 was to the world what the JFK assassination was to America. You can&#39;t get more of a public venue than NYC. The more cameras the better, I&#39;m sure, is how they think. </p>

<p>Just like they want to impose on us this hysteria that any one of us could be a terrorist, I say we look at politics and big business like any one of them could be a part of the cabal. Hierarchy is the problem, and hierarchists are our enemy. Killing the president is no show of power. &quot;It takes a child to raze a village.&quot; The real power exists with the masses in our ability to resist them and attain peace in the world. </p>

<p>We are the rising tide. These are their attempts to fight back the waters. Let&#39;s not forget who&#39;s on the offensive here. We are winning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>over the past several years, going from the initial <strong><em>shock</em></strong> of the event and the indignation and anger of the realization of just <strong><em>what</em></strong> was so shocking (the world&#39;s most massive and deadly terroristic event, on <em>american soil</em>), to the righteous rage of the beginning cadre of truthers (when some few fiery articles and french author Thierry Meyssan&#39;s very controversial book, L’Effroyable imposture (9/11: The Big Lie) made the press--btw, googling for this title i ran across <a href="http://911guide.googlepages.com/history"><strong>this interesting page</strong></a>), to the slow and painful realizations of waking up to the truth, i&#39;ve asked what you are asking, cometparty...</p>

<p>the scenario that makes the most sense and, at the same time, the <em>least</em> sense is that the actors <em>wanted</em> us to know, to <em>see</em> what they were doing, because they wanted us to be aware that there <strong><em>is</em></strong> a conspiracy, one so large that even <em>they</em>, the actors, cannot escape it--a vast majority of the public is needed to actually fight back, to rout the scoundrels behind the scenes...</p>

<p>i&#39;ve tried to put bushco and others into the part of true patriots, a conspiracy within a conspiracy...behaving so brashly greedy and heinously destructive, that the people would have no choice but to rise up against the obvious machinations of the despots and reassert their place, at the top of the pyramid, rather than the bottom...</p>

<p>the offensive and self-serving attitudes of many of these individuals, coupled with the neo-con philosophy, turn me away from this thought experiment...besides, <strong><em>if i, or anyone, can see that counter-conspiracy, so can the original conspirators</em></strong>, and i think they would stop at nothing to squelch that inner rebellion--i mean, c&#39;mon!, they knocked down three of the largest, most conspicuous buildings in the world and murdered thousands in doing it...killing a president, his cabinet, and some un-few military, political, and other power-types would not stop them--would it???...</p>

<p>anyway, that&#39;s one idea i&#39;ve had as to why &quot;they&quot; would be so obvious (obvious, for me, in hindsight, i admit--on my awakening i asked myself, &quot;why didn&#39;t you see this all along?&quot;--and that is another good question; one which leads, at first, to self-doubt in this conspiracy theory...and then one realizes, of course, that the evidence is, still, right there in front of us all...)...</p>

<p><em>i apologize if this seems rambling and incoherent--it&#39;s early...i wanted to get my thoughts down, here, because i&#39;ve never even thought to present this idea, in this forum, as cometparty has done; more the fool, me...</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good place to talk about these things. I&#39;ve asked and answered this question (and similar questions) in my head so many times that I don&#39;t know what the real answer is. I&#39;ve never found a suitable answer. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me. </p>

<p>If I think back, all of these revelations were coming about around 2004-2005. This is about when YouTube came about. Living in Austin, I had the luxury of watching The Alex Jones Show on public access television, so I got exposed to these ideas pretty early on. But this is about when broadband internet was becoming more and more prevalent/normal/commonplace. A bunch of us started <em>really</em> researching these things extensively. This research led a lot of us to broach a whole plethora of subjects. Since 2005 I&#39;ve learned more about... everything... than I&#39;ve learned in the rest of my years on this planet combined. </p>

<p>Basically, it coincided with the real birth of the Information Age. It may have even caused it to accelerate a thousand-fold. If it hadn&#39;t been a conspiracy, would all that have happened? Would we have learned so much so fast? Would we have radicalized so much?</p>

<p>I&#39;m at a place ideologically where I couldn&#39;t have imagined being back in 2001. I&#39;m so (peacefully) radicalized in opposition that it&#39;s not even funny. This only makes it even more confusing because I know there are <em>many</em> people like me; many people who have been equally radicalized in opposition to their new world order as the result of their obviousness. Why would they make it obvious on purpose if it would only make it harder for them? You could argue that the majority of Reddit users are radically opposed to them at this point, and we (in concert with Digg users) control the content of the internet. Everything that gets a lot of votes on Digg gets a lot of votes on Reddit and a lot of votes on Stumbleupon so that we&#39;re all seeing the <strong>same content</strong>. We&#39;re inventing a whole internet culture online (and IRL) that&#39;s IN OPPOSITION to their nefarious actions. And only THEY ARE TO BLAME.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m paranoid, but the only thing I could conclude is that they wanted to draw a line in-between us, differentiating people in opposition and people in support. They&#39;re data-mining the internet and dividing us up into those two groups. By combing through our online activity, they can find &quot;thought criminals&quot; and they&#39;ll know who&#39;s who when push comes to shove. </p>

<p>In the end the Party would announce that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%2B2%3D5#Orwell">two and two made five</a>, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable—what then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it would be handy for them to know, but I still think your original statement is ridiculous. To say that this was all some kind of sociological test by the government, so that they can plan future false flags better?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a novel idea, how bout they do it right the first time if they are so all powerful and elite, and have been planning this forever?

    <div class="md"><p>That statement is assuming so much though. </p>

<p>Your assuming that information would be valuable to them. You are also assuming that 9/11 was for fact an inside job by the government. On top of that, you are also assuming they left evidence on <em>purpose</em>, linking the government firmly to 9/11.</p>

<p>That is a very large stretch. If 9/11 was an inside job, it was the most heinous atrocity that any government has ever committed.

<p>Exactly, then what? The crime was so big it&#39;s impossible to prosecute anyone in our government for being involved. Anyway, they knew what evidence they were leaving and it wasn&#39;t too much. It was just enough. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been asking. I think it was a necessary step. They&#39;re not embarrassed about their involvement. They&#39;re brazen. They feel like they don&#39;t care who knows, because there&#39;s nothing we can do about it. They want us to know who&#39;s involved because they want us to know who&#39;s our master.</p>
