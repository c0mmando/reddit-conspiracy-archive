       On a law-enforcement level, police have no problem abusing the rights of citizens, and those who defend themselves are both few and far between and rarely successful. In the case of deliberate ramping up of laws and police enforcement, gun ownership is a fairly minor obstacle. I might even argue that in the 'big picture' armed resistance would be beneficial, since a rising police state could paint its agents as martyrs fighting against a violent element in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to weakening potential large-scale rebellions, the idea that a world power could be overturned by a violent civilian coup has been fairly unlikely for decades. While it would certainly be
       <em>
        easier
       </em>
       to defeat a rebellion if they had to rely exclusively on foreign-sourced or stolen weapons, automatic small arms just don't seem to me to pose a serious enough threat against a modern mechanized force.

       This shows how useless guns are at resisting  tyranny. All these populations were originally armed, and it did nothing to help them. As history shows, the government will always be better armed than you.

       of the examples listed there, the only one that I think is comparable to the modern united states or another developed country is Germany, and I don't even think germany needed to do it. The near universal indoctrination of the population into nazi ideology would make the formation of a viable structured resistance difficult, armed or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that disarming the population in underdeveloped countries is an important step to securing a regime, but only because the government itself is usually weaker and less organized, making resistance a much more viable option even for small, poorly-equipped groups.

       heh, nobody bats an eye at the number of German, soviet, Chinese, lives lost in the millions over the last century .... and 1/2 a dozen million throughout Europe is a drop in the pond compared to the conscripts and draftees sent to their deaths for worshiping the state :/
 idk. holocaust was a terrible thing. state worshiping disciples who went to war for national reasons was even more terrible. and the latter caused the former. root of problem, national exceptionalism and superiority complex.

       In Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite Revolutionary Guard simply buried their available weapons smaller than a tank, melted into the population, and initiated a 6-year guerrilla war to oust the invaders. The strategy was pre-planned, and it worked, except the ethnic tensions that were already present, but also inflamed and entrenched by occupiers and neighbors alike, made it a very messy affair for all involved, and the overall geo-political issue of Iraq's future is still unresolved.

       I absolutely agree with this opinion.....The Afghanistan/Iraq war has provided our military the opportunity to fine tune the ability eliminate anything or anyone that brings attention to themselves. Having a closet full of AR-15s Would do nothing to change the end result. What I see as a more reasonable threat and need for firearms is some sort of attack of the power grid that shuts down delivery of food.....protecting a fifty pound bag of rice and twenty cans of soup will require deadly force....people will abandon all civilized rules of behavior as soon as thier children are starving.

       no, those are events where gun control happened before tyranny. There's nothing there that indicates that preventing gun control prevents tyranny.

       gun control prevents tyranny?  Yeah.  Actually I wouldn't disagree with that.  Preventing gun control

       prevent tyranny.  That seems to be rather different than your OP title, however.

       The point I'm trying to make right now is that just because tyrants have disarmed their populations in the past, disarming a population now does not indicate a rise in tyranny, nor would failing to disarm the population be an obstacle to tyranny.

       Similar to how social causes taken over by a central government is required before tyranny. Not that proper services can't be rendered, but once a monopoly is established in any power structure, it opens the potential for abuse.

       “And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.”

       True. It was an attitude of hopelessness that enabled the Gulag.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where exactly did the hopelessness come from? Solzhenitsyn focused on that question, and as far as I can tell (correct me if you have a better answer) it was faith in oneself, and faith in God - both remarkably assailed by Bolshevism.

       OK, issue that everyone seems to be missing:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare">
        <strong>
         Asymmetric warfare
        </strong>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course a modern army could defeat a bunch of "patriots" with AR-15's and 500 rounds: if they all obligingly came together in a large concentration to contest the hostile takeover, they'd be squashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the millions of ragtag "patriots" went everywhere the hypothetical opposing modern army was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       securely positioned, hit and run style, the occupation could be made intolerable for the invaders (see Iraq for a recent example that has been somewhat obscured by our US media).
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Revolution was in many ways an example of asymmetrical warfare, even though Washington tried very hard to assume the trappings of a standard european army. The contrast can be seen in these two wikis:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what Washington needed to get European, primarily French, military intervention:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is what actually enabled the permanent separation from Britain:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_(United_States)#American_Revolutionary_War_(1775%E2%80%931783)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_(United_States)#American_Revolutionary_War_(1775%E2%80%931783)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the 2nd Amendment can be seen as a signal that the founders knew the reality of how a ragtag group beat the greatest military power in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, just as in Iraq, the issue with any war-game scenario of Americans resorting to their AR-15's instead of other, and far preferable, standard political measures short of rebellion, is the status of the very large number of trained veterans, and the arsenals that separately store munitions and heavy weapons. I urge you to think about that carefully, and respond if you have an intelligent spark fly.

       I think you underestimate the significance.  The current wars show the limitations of drones and that is in mostly open desert.  It also shows that occupation still requires boots on the ground.  Look at the mental illness that our soldiers suffer from after being in the Middle East
       <em>
        even with
       </em>
       the mental protection of killing “others”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now try to translate that to our own people.  A single sniper can demoralize a large number of troops.  Killing people demoralizes them.  Ambush harassment demoralizes them.  Attacking their own citizens especially will.
