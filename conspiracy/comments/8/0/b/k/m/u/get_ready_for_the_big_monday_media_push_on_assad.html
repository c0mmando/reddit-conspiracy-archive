<p>I&#39;m sure this has nothing to do with France&#39;s latest declaration that if Assad used chemical weapons again, France would have to take action.</p>

<p>Also...gotta love those &quot;White Helmets&quot;...always around to help out with a chemical attack...every single time.</p>

<p>On a side note..can someone help me locate where Shefoniya actually is? I&#39;m having trouble finding it.</p>

<p>Just speculation on my part..but I&#39;m not going to be surprised if it&#39;s near Rastan. I saw a video that was supposedly filmed there not too long ago that made me suspect Syrian rebel forces (FSA) were getting ready to conduct a chlorine gas attack to cause public outrage and encourage international intervention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>News Media is literally incapable of accurate reporting on anything associated with Israel.  Based upon their past error rate, a reasonable reader would be justified in questioning whether anyone in the news media could even identify the &quot;state&quot; of Israel on a map.  On the topic of Israel the news media (in its entirety) actually has <em>less</em> than zero credibility and the beginning presumption must be that not one single word they publish is even accidentally correct unless confirmed by independent non-media sources.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll believe the media about anything Assad (or any other person in the middle east) has done or said when that person confirms the claim...until then...there is zero percent possibility that the claim is correct.  It is a literal certainty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand how it might seem confusing.</p>

<p>The answer is ...Yes...but <strong>only</strong> if the US News Media reports on it...otherwise standard logic applies and the majority of evidence would dictate which side of a conflicting story is true.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to rely upon either quality nor quantity of evidence when all media is controlled by a handful of companies that act in unison.  When discernment between lies and truth is impossible because the information is controlled...the only remaining options are simply belief or disbelief.  Among those two options, disbelief of allegations is the only one that comports with a presumption of innocence.  Thus, it is always the default in cases where non-media source confirmation is lacking...and you have not personally witnessed the event...and the accused has not openly and voluntarily confessed.</p>

<p>i suggest following r/syriancivilwar for a good look at the conflict with constant updates.</p>

<p>russia warned there would be a false flag from the rebels about 8-12 hours in advance.</p>

<p>seems odd russia would warn us of an upcoming attack if Assad was behind it.</p>

<p>this whole narrative is absolutely absurd. he is winning and the only thing that could possibly change that is an international intervention due to chemical weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It got to the point where the only way Assad could possibly still lose was if he lost his mind and used chemical weapons against his own people, even though it was crystal clear that would give his enemies a pretext to ramp up intervention.
