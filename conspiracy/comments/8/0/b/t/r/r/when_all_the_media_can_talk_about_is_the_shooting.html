       When all the media can talk about is the shooting... its not about the shooting
      </p>
      <p>
       the shooting is cover for other newsworthy items such as:
      </p>
      <p>
       New Schiff Memo re FISA abuse
      </p>
      <p>
       Death of Net Neutrality
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       when they construct these fake news events, the purpose is to divide the public by providing different people with different facts, thus creating friction and fractures a community.
      </p>
      <p>
       they don't care what you say about the shooting or gun control, as long as thats all you are talking about while other things happen in the background unnoticed and undiscussed
      </p>
      <p>
       they deliberately create multiple versions of "the facts"
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, i saw a supposed witness who said "3 shooters... definitely"
      </p>
      <p>
       so we could argue about whether there was 1 shooter or 3 shooters, but it doesn't matter, as long as we are arguing about it
      </p>
      <p>
       __
      </p>
      <p>
       you know how every time theres one of these fake shootings, especially with an AR-15 "assault" rifle, theres all this talk about gun control, which invariably causes gun sales to spike...

       well, what if these fake shootings double as a gift to the weapons makers,
      </p>
      <p>
       kind of like how the CDC helps hype diseases to increase markets for vaccines
      </p>
      <p>
       The CDC has a marketing "recipe" for the flu shot. It involves creating a perception in the media to increase consumer demand.

      <p>
       there is something very different about this latest fake shooting, maybe some of you have noticed
      </p>
      <p>
       the difference is that in previous fake shootings, fake news stories, we would spend endless hours scrutinizing and debating every little piece of evidence for days and weeks and months and finally come out the other side and say and say
      </p>
      <p>
       well guys, i think its crisis actors... now what?
      </p>
      <p>
       well this time, we spent less time fleshing out the details of the little people on the ground, and instead went looking for the big fish people behind it

       I like this concept because it makes sense. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because all the TV and cable news shows are part of privately owned corporations. So there's a profit motive that influences how those shows are run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine being on reddit was your job and that your pay was determined by your daily karma score. Now think about what that would do to your posting habits and the content/comments you post.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is part of why news shows give 24/hr coverage of disasters and hurricanes. It's also why they constantly drop old stories and pump out new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you see a story that just keeps going on forever, it's happening for one of two reasons.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The story is getting great ratings (therefore makes the network lots of money)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Someone has a narrative to maintain.

       or using distraction and misdirection as part of a coverup of something else
      </p>
      <p>
       here is something else to think about with these false flag fake shootings
      </p>
      <p>
       they are scripted years in advance, like we saw with Sandy Hook, allowing children to age before fake-killing them and presenting the real kids as their older siblings at the Super Bowl in some sort of in-your-face show-of-force, or proof of life, idk
      </p>
      <p>
       so this fake shooting in florida was probably planned years in advance, and would have gone on regardless of who won the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       as they say in show business, the show must go on
      </p>
      <p>
       so imagine of Hillary Clinton would have won, how she would have went to Florida on Air Force One and met with some victims families and put some flowers on a memorial, and then get up on stage somewhere and give some speech about how enough is enough and its time we do something about these guns
      </p>
      <p>
       and CNN would mix in a audio sample of cheering and crowd noise from a sporting event to make it seem like the public was really behind her
      </p>
      <p>
       but it doesn't matter if they get gun control this time or next time, or even the next administration
      </p>
      <p>
       they play the long game, and they have their agenda (gun confiscation), and they have their method (atrocity propaganda), they have their motive (global enslavement)

       This is correct. The Las Vegas event was also scheduled far in advance--the date, the name of the event, the targets, etc.. All planned and "The Show Must Go On," as you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine how the aftermath would've gone if Clinton won? This event might've been the last straw.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, both shootings were shit show productions. Vegas, I think, was supposed to be much worse--maybe the gas tanks were supposed to blow? The Florida story is falling apart in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are good guys on the ground working against the narrative. Nothing's finished, the civil war continues to rage, but Trump--as big of a fucking jerk he is--in the White House is the right guy right now simply because he's not Clinton.

       The real story is Uranium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uranium 1 Clinton and Podesta group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert "The Mule" Meuller bring a sample of Highly enriched Uranium to the Russians on a runway. (See Wikileaks emails).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about the earlier "Megatons for Megawatts" program from Bush 1/Bill Clintons presidency and lots of $$ because Uranium is more valuable than Gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more than enough evidence now to indict lots of people considering Uranium is considered constitutionally vital for Americas self defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lot's of distractions but the story of the century awaits.

       generally speaking, a false flag is when a crime, often terrorism, is committed in such a way as to make it look like someone else did it
      </p>
      <p>
       often, these false flags also hoaxes, in the sense that they are mass casualty drills and nobody really dies, but the "crime" is pinned on some lone wolf lone gunman

       we seem to be living in this bizarro world where the media gets to lie to their audience day after day, and when they get caught lying, its dismissed as an accident, and the audience is supposed to go right back to listening and trusting the media and ignore the lies
      </p>
      <p>
       thats not the world i live in. in my world, if i catch you lying once, ill call you out and allow you to explain. ill give you a shovel and let you dig as deep as you want. but if you can't come up with a very good reason for the "mistake", i will never trust you again. i still hold grudges from when was about 5 years old

       IF Sessions is investigating anything that involves Obama, Bush(es) or the Clintons, how much reliable staff does he even have available?

       I like the part of your theory that includes the motive for the shooting as them wanting to ramp up gun sales. Not only does that line the pockets of gun manufacturers, but if we're being manipulated into a civil war, then it makes sense they would want to start flooding our country with guns in anticipation of greater destruction.
