       I think my job is an MKULTRA experiment. It's a seemingly normal business, an office but there are military figures around, folks who have been in the military for a long time. I don't want to be to specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's either a psychological test, to test either trauma, psychic abilities or both, or it could be a racial experiment to examine what happens when you do certain things in the workplace to African Americans. I also think it could be a pre-planned false flag attack, where they set up a seemingly normal business and stage a mass shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance most of the people have quit, three quarters. Because of the level of gas lighting that went on. People scream at the job, then threaten to kill the manager. I sat at my desk yesterday and vaped the entire day and no one noticed or said anything to me. Essentially it's just this large office with all new stuff, total freedom and great aerial views (like from a helicopter, circling above, not because there are windows, there are not many windows.  And it's large, but not in a sense that it was built to be large for a small number of people, but it's more like built for a lot of people like a large flat room with a low ceiling, where the people are just in one little lit up space, but you can see the rest of the desks are vacant in the expanse ) where 11 people come each day to scream at each other, plot openly against one another, be gaslit, what have you. And it's all on camera. Maybe 30 cameras, everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is it's like it's pre-planned, everything in the place seems staged to be the most unfair, the most openly insane. We get an order, then they change the order and we were doing it wrong, then we were doing it wrong again so we have to go back and do it the first way.
      </p>
      <p>
       All from people we don't see who watch us on camera's and sometimes talk to us through the computers. In the class where we learned how to 'do our job', they would teach us the wrong information, quickly, and without emphasis and repetition at all. Just read through material one time, and we also don't have access to copies of the material.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they just give quizzes each day on material we never learned. So that everyone fails, they give the quiz each day and never change the questions and they rarely go over the answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes they give us questions on the test like a math problem but without an apparent answer, where there are multiple possible answers to the question, like rounded up rounded down, this many days for this, this many days for that, any answers you give could be correct, and are mathematically sound but they never had a question. There's no guidance on what answer they want in the form of a question, and they may or may not tell you what result they're looking for. It's like they give you a question like this: 1) 36 47 79 46 23 And that's the end. Of course in our field it's applicable to the subject material so we have an idea of what we're doing but given those numbers we have at least 15 possible things we could do with that code. See what I mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it's a small government contractor which is a notorious CIA hiding place. I also took a survey one day and everyone reported psychic experiences or abilities, and not only that they all think, even the higher ups pretty much think something just very strange is happening there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for awhile it was okay, now yesterday and today I left work feeling completely numb. I feel sometimes that I'm in shock, like I just got into a car wreck because of all the screaming, threats, intimidation, humiliation, weird shit is happening in this place, but you would just never know unless you were there. I'd like responses other than "run", because I'm the responsible one now and what good would it do, also I have a car payment. But if you do feel the need to say "run", tell me what's going on.

       IDK.  I can't quit. I can't look away.  More I just wanted to post this because of all the MK experiments back in the day, that no one knew about, so that someone can figure this shit out.   If I quit, I'm never going to know and no one will ever know what happens to these people.  I asked my boss today if it was a psychological experiment and she kind of shuttered.  I don't know what the f is going on, but everyone should.   Also maybe this is normal, read 1984?  Maybe this is our life. I don't know, but I can't quit because my boss is relying on me to do all the work, and it's just the situation.  If you were in it, you would understand.  I more just want to know what is going on, that's the purpose of the post.  I know full well I'm not going to quit this second. All though I know your right, and thank you for the moral support.  It's also not the bosses who are screaming at the employees on many occasions, it's the employees, screaming at the boss, threatening to kill the manager etc., but are never fired, so they work themselves up so badly and do more and more unacceptable things and nothing happens.

       Well, I guess just be aware that you're in a dangerous situation no matter what with violent threats being made by coworkers, and if it is some kind of experiment/study/false flag setting/whatever you're doing exactly what they want you to do despite being intelligent enough to see through it, which is... kinda lame..

       Hey guys, highjacking top comment, because I lurked this ladys history and found something interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       She's previously posted about something called ACIM. Googling it leading to a janky 90s-esque website eschewing the value of this 'method'. Take a look at their 'program' and tell me it doesn't seem like some obvious brainwashing shit:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got a background in psychology. This does not seem like a therapeutic method. The poster responded to me mentioning 'the course' was how she learned about the CIA. Read the origins of how this thing developed. It has spook-shit written all over it.

       I'm currently "running from" the Course.  You sly dog.  Anyways, that book is awesome, it's the kindest piece of literature in the world.  Nothing wrong with reading a book that's mostly read by old people with dated web development skills, but it does seem crazy.  However, we're on a planet orbiting a sun in a vast black empty place.  It really strikes me how quick and sure people are about what they would call strange!  Have you ever seen a mole up close?  Something very strange is going on in this place, the world, probably more strange than what's happening at my job.  Nice try bucko.

       I grew up in Northern CA. The 'New Age' ideas of the 70s were often underwritten or informed by CIA ops. The hippies that raised us were useful idiots. The children I grew up with were (sometimes) the victims of these experiments. Seems you're somehow wrapped up in this vortex.

       I've thought through this in a lot of different ways.  I love the book, I hate the book, but I can't deny what I've learned from it that is true.  It's impeccable, although I haven't looked at it in quite a while.  The thing is they way the book is set up, even if it was written by the CIA it would still be true because it teaches that all people are the Christ.  So some of the thoughts I've had about it are that it was possibly a device designed by the CIA to help us forgive them, an institution that was so awful and heinous it would take a miracle for anyone to forgive them.  Just one of many thoughts I've had about it, because it changed my life and mind forever, and I love the ideas in it.  It's a fact that the CIA is composed of people, people who even though we might want to blame them for everything, are not the cause of all the horrible problems in the world.  More than that they aren't the cause of a place like this, this planet.   So if there is a group of people who've taken a lot of liberties from the government to study psychology and conduct experiments in the world, maybe they are not all bad, maybe they're just trying to figure this place out.  It's ironic that anyone who mentions the term 'CIA' is considered insane, given that the CIA funded the discipline of psychiatry in the US, basically by itself.   That's probably just a sidenote, anyways what I'm trying to say is I understand that I'm in the world. I understand physical concerns.  I understand identity and values, but it doesn't make my physical report of my current situation less honest.  I'm not making claims that it definitely is an experiment, I'm making statements and saying I fear that it may be an experiment.  Anyways yes, I've read so so much about the CIA and the Course, to much, because I was afraid of what I had gotten into mentally.  If you really wanted to follow Jesus though, say if you were a Christian and you only wanted to obey the words in the Bible that were said by Jesus, you would have the same exact issues.   The Course really spells that out for you.

       This speaks volumes. IDK. Top nazi scientists were 'forgiven' in operation paperclip....look where that lead us. Can we not all agree society as it is now is completely fucked up? If these alphabet agencies have had a hand in guiding our culture since god knows when, are they not culpable for how things are to some degree? Are the nazis innocent because they were 'just following orders'?
      </p>

       I don't know the answers to these questions, only that when perpetrators dictate the conditions of their persecution, you won't get real justice. Although, 'good' 'bad' 'truth' 'justice' are invented, human ideas that are always subject to change.

       Hey I didn't say definitively that the CIA wrote the Course, and it actually seems quite unlike them.   No one's ever going to know though if they did or didn't because they just destroy all the documents, whatever.  I hate that fact.  But punishment is our problem, it's our disease, get rid of it and you've fixed most of the worlds problems especially in the US.  I mean the walls are closing in everyone's a criminal now.  I'm just saying I'm not defending hurtful things being done to people, and neither would the Course, ever.  So don't take the wrong idea away from me.   The thing is I don't normally get this much interest about my reddit posts. I was feeling fucked up at my job, and I wanted to go, vent on reddit.  I didn't foresee this becoming a thing, so don't get the wrong idea.

       I'd like to reply to this from a worldly perspective.  A very worldly and after giving it a lot of thought and research perspective.  The Nazi's were conducting a war.  They were on the front's in Russia dying of the cold.  The Nazi's had put the Jews into the camps.  I've read Mein Kampf and I stopped, midway because I was afraid I was Jewish at that time and I was upset by the physically upsetting, shaming visualizations and the sensations that Mein Kampf eventually brought out, as Hitler was increasingly degrading of the Jews.  He made one logical error to liken and blend the Jews with the people of this other political group which he hated.  He really, really hated this other group I don't remember which one.   Anyways what they don't really tell you in this saga of hate toward the Nazi's was that the country was obliterated by bombs from the UK.   The residential areas, all the remaining Germans were being bombed to obliteration during the time when they had these Jews stored away in the camps.  Physically, then I can see why they might not have been as focused on the camps as they should have been, enduring lack, death and starvation themselves they might not have been as attentive to their prisoners.  This is all from video's I've watched because I was afraid of being Jewish, and at that time and continuing on, I want to research and understand 'anti-semitism', for my own protection of course you can understand.  Anyways, if indeed the UK perpetrated this event of total destruction on the Germans, during the time of the holocaust, I would estimate it had something to do with national currencies.  That is some kind of word salad I'm offering to the viewer I guess.   Anyways, if the US took the German scientists away from that, I'd estimate it was some kind of apology.  Idk.   That's what my mind has come up with.  I'm not crazy.  I take the information I'm given, I take the most truthful information, I discriminate who I will trust in the media, then I think about all I know about human nature and then make some kind of guess.  It isn't crazy to think.  Even if you assert that I will never accept that, because I love to think.  Anyways I thought I would offer that, one little dissertation from some crack head out in the universe, for you.  Love ya!

       I learned that just by digging around on the internet and in declassified documents, to a far lesser degree (because they destroyed them all) about the relationship between the Course and the CIA actually.   So if you wen't back and looked at their explanations you would see that the CIA had fronts everywhere.  Given that fact it's probably not that fetched that I am overly conspiratorial in my thinking about my job.   So, I don't know, hopefully I am wrong, wrong about everything. Good luck

       Honestly, I don't give any kind of fuck about this to explore it...I already have too much on my plate as it is. Link me links or STFU and learn to enjoy being abused by the government and made to go insane for the sake of someone else's knowledge.

       If you really think you're in a MK ultra experiment, and you know the CIA had a hand in the creation of this method that you bought into, why the fuck are you a) still participating b) posting about it here?

       Shit, something doesn't smell right to me on a street corner, I get out of dodge. How are you allowing yourself to be brought deeper into obviously sketchy stuff? Links or GTFO. In the absence of this, you're either a) mind controlled already and completely fucked or b) straight bullshittin'.

       Just between you and me and all of Reddit things are getting pretty fucking weird in this comment section and in my message box .  There are some pretty subtle, yet direct references to the painful stupid things that have been happening at my job in this comment section. Not by you.   Anyways, I got a text message today and it said " (My name),  I'm hiring for (business name) in (the city and state that I live in).  Are you looking for a new job?  We start at (my wage) + per hour.  Reply to learn more! - Thanks, Cassie!  Also the most screwed up thing is the references and inferences that are being used are the inferences to my darkest most shameful secrets that I would never share on reddit or with anyone.  So I'm done with this.

Not for days, sometimes weeks, but they could come back at any time, no firing.   It's somewhat normal I guess because there's no one there anymore.  Maybe it was just some weird freak event where a race war got carried out in a small workplace controlled by military people, and then I don't know.

       This is something, a lot of information and possibly an art form I'd have to dedicate some time to and practice, and that I'm thankful for.  Thing is I started drinking after work today, because I was screamed at and I'm full of cortisol (I feel, sincerely that I didn't want to, but that I've been driven to drink)  I sincerely, formally thank you though for this information.  That's exactly why I submitted this post.

       That sounds like a pretty cool place to be if you can keep your wits about you OP! Do you have any interesting stories about daily workplace antics?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you actually do for work there/what is your position?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think you could get away with filming or recording what's going on without getting caught?

       Maybe I would try to film it, and maybe not.  Unless I was sure it was what I think it is I wouldn't want to violate other people's dignity by filming them flying off the handle.  There have been a lot of interesting group fights.  It really is fascinating.

       Is there any way you could be descriptive without being too specific? I'm really curious as to what's going on but it's hard for me to understand when you aren't able to elaborate any further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, keep yourself safe, if I were you I'd prepare a "deadmans switch" of sorts, in case something goes sideways. Keep as much information as you can, privately, and have it on a time release for a certain amount of time, if you don't check in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents though. Stay safe out there bud

       Sure. Feel free to PM me if you need to talk. It sounds like, though this job would be an interesting experiment to participate in, would be a nightmare on your mental health, as I feel you've indicated, though I might be wrong.

       Yes it is and yes it is.   The thing is there's no where to run to.  Even in other countries the US controls the environment, technically I have some semblance of some rights here in the US, so even though posting this is a risk, I guess I wanted to do it for others, but me personally I feel I don't have any choice.  So this is probably not about me at all.  But I love the attention, it's really validating to see that others can see.   And thanks!

       I don't know, I'm posting it on the off chance I am right because others will see it.  So that if they're doing experiments on the public today as they did in the past people might find out early and save themselves.   It wouldn't hurt anyone to read it obviously I'm the one in the most danger by writing it, but you never know, which is why I wrote it down.

       I don't think you actually have a job.  You're suffering from a delusion and they are going along with your delusion because previous attempts to convince you that you've been admitted to an asylum have caused you to become extremely aggressive to the point of requiring sedation.

       No not at all, but I'm not sure audio would be enough, over time maybe.  Audio visual would be better, but you wouldn't be able to monitor anything like if one of the members of the group were given a drug, etc.  There are a lot of factors, that's why I'm sure this kind of activity is so difficult to prove, and why this string is called conspiracy and not 'a group of detectives'.  No one even acknowledges the experiments the CIA has done and has confessed to doing on the public in the not so distant past.  Imagine how difficult it would be to prove that something was happening in the present.  I don't know, seems hopeless.  I just wanted to give my report to people who might be able to use it for themselves, but no one else would believe it, seems certain.

       I'm not going to humiliate people publicly, that's bad.  If they're freaking out, maybe they shouldn't necessarily be public fodder.  I'm not doing it.   Not that it's a bad idea, but I'm in a close knit community now with 11 super frazzled others who have rights, at least according to me.  The camera watchers, I don't know, I'm doing further research but there's no way for me to know, yet if any of it is legitimate or not, other than that I have a suspicious mind.

       I'm currently the worker, I get quite a lot of stuff done.  In that sense I don't think it's a conspiracy, because the manager at least believes the job is a real money making business that needs to produce, but I'm the go to person now.

       That's exactly what I think this is about.  There are African Americans and Hispanics myself included, and they are almost completely marginalizing the blacks.  That's what I see in this place, the complete brewing of a race war, and it's not because of the people, although African Americans have maintained different dialects to the extreme that they are languages, for a long time, and they can't write grammatically correct reports, that's exactly the way it's divided.  African Americans not allowed to do any work, Hispanics forced to do all the work of African Americans.  The African Americans  being subtly and covertly insulted by the lack of work, and seeing it go directly to the Hispanics, are infuriated.   So, yeah, within the business it makes sense, not the gaslighting - the gaslighting is what made me think CIA, and the camera's etc, but the racial discrimination, which is totally obvious to be seen, but is completely explainable based on grammar ability in these circumstances.  Yeah that's what makes the whole thing tick, the racial dynamics.  Even though we're friends.  i still think it's the CIA though, because they so expertly trigger the reactions with the rules, guidelines, decisions that are passed down through the camera.  But yes, that's it.

       The direct manager is career military.  The people who watch on the cameras I couldn't tell you.   The orders are to make reports and to some extent falsify them. I'm aware that they're in my name, but they're somewhat falsified.  The situation disorganizes my perception, and I and some others are forced to work super quickly, while others do absolutely nothing.  No never spoke to anyone who left, though one woman I was close to went to work for the NRA.

       The thing is, I couldn't tell you though if it's true or not true.  If it's true I'm probably going to die, and if it's not true I have no idea.  I wanted to make this report, to people, in case it was true.  Honestly I have no idea.  The things I've said are true, but the conclusions I've drawn, hopefully are not true.   I'm just trying to give an honest report of a situation, because it's aroused my suspicion even though there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't.  So, hopefully this isn't the case and I'll come back here and eat crow, as the legitimate golden child of a small office in the US.  Because that's what I hope is true.

       It's quite easy to find a somewhat satisfying explanation to your suspicions. If some of the management really are former military, then they'll obviously base their organisational model on military HR doctrine, even though the company in and of itself might most likely  be civilian. They'll use the same tactics to pit people against each other and break up group cohesion in order to be able to delegate and micro-manage without having to fully supervise. In the military, there is no trust or brotherhood, contrary to what they'd like you to believe from all of the hogwash propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The continuous formation and aptitude testing are also very indicative of the military model. They function in a hierarchical vacuum, so other rules apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm European, been to the military, worked in two US companies and just regular EU ones. One of the US companies was a major player in data encryption for banks, the US Air Force etc. The other one was insurance administration oriented, but applied the very same strategies and tactics with regards to HR. I didn't like working for either one of them as I also had the notion of being profiled continuously. This general feeling of distrust and company omnipotence made me feel very uneasy and caused me to become paranoid as well; like I was being held at a low-security detention camp or something. The passive-aggressive undertone permeating even the innocuous water cooler conversations, was so exhausting I took it with me everywhere and couldn't shut my mind off work until only late at night.

       It's all conceived to make you slave for every nanosecond you are there and well beyond. They have no right to do that. You simply shouldn't take it as a human being. It's dehumanising, perverse, counter-productive, mentally and emotionally sapping and quite frankly horribly childish.

       How'd you get involved or hear about ACIM?
From looking through their online presence, it seems weird AF and it definitely looks like some sort of door for MK Ultra.
Military people aren't generally new-age types, are they?
How did this come across your radar?

       What I was saying about the helicopter was a part of my conspiratorial thought that it might be a set up for a false flag event.  The idea that the aerial views would be good, as in a helicopter circling around after the event would be able to see all of the doors, etc.  I don't know why I thought that.  As far as access points I guess I wouldn't feel comfortable saying, it is a compartmentalization though, and I understand what you mean.  It's medical, hospitals, doctors, clients.

       It sounds possible to me, that you're having or developing some kind of break with reality. Sometimes smoking or vaping feels good, but it can make these sorts of problems worse. I highly recommend that you look up a number in your area for a Distress Line, or similar support line, and say that you are experiencing high levels of stress at work, and that you need to talk to somebody to find a way to manage it. Badly managed stress can lead to a breakdown; there is no shame in asking for help, we all need help with something, at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes, with these sorts of problems, the nature of the problem is such that we can't admit to ourselves, or we can't have the insight to see that the problem can be our own mental state. This is why it's important to reach out and ask for help anyway, to get an outside reality check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a break from the vaping, find a way to ask for help or speak to a therapist, and if you've been there long enough, ask for a vacation man.
      </p>

        hese sorts of problems worse. I highly recommend that you look up a number in your area for a Distress Line, or similar support line, and say that you are experiencing high levels of stress at work, and that you need to talk to somebody to find a way to manage it. Badly managed stress can lead to a breakdown; there is no shame in asking for help, we all need help with something, at times.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sometimes, with these sorts of problems, the nature of the problem is such that we can't admit to ourselves, or we can't have the insight to see that the problem can be our own mental state. This is why it's important to reach out and ask for help anyway, to get an outside reality check.

       Yeah that's crossed my mind.   I wanted to get some input with this post actually.  Thanks for your concern, and actually I'd rather be going insane.  Ideally the CIA would be just a figment of my imagination and never have existed at all or had a real protective role, protecting me, instead of some twisted thing.  I don't know.  I hope I'm wrong about it.

       I'm a little concerned, because as I read through your responses in this thread, the majority of your responses seem intelligent and well written but there is also a portion that makes me uncomfortable because every once in awhile, there is a sentence that is very difficult to understand. The words and sentence structure sound coherent but when I try to logically follow it, I feel a little lost or confused. It reminded me a tiny bit of word salad, which is a feature of certain serious mental issues. My intent here is not to make you feel bad or attack you, but to encourage you to get some outside feedback from a qualified professional. I am most certainly NOT qualified, never the less, please consider asking for help.

       If it's staged as you suggest, it's possible what you're experiencing is a weird psychological study? Could be a government program, but other organizations do weird psychological studies too. Did you hear about that show they're putting on Netflix where they take one person and try to coerce them into committing murder? Could be a "reality TV" thing, did you sign any releases for the recorded footage to be used on TV?

       That said, MKUltra was a drug-centric mind-control program. If this was anything like that, you'd be getting drugged and tortured, not subjected to strange, hostile working environments. It might be some kind of government program, but I would say that this sounds nothing like MKUltra. Either way, if I was you and it's as hostile as you make it sound, I'd probably get outta there. Why put up with the bullshit?

       I said MK ULTRA because I have no better term.  Also it was a lot more than you think.  The program funded tons of small offices around the country that's why probably my suspicion is heightened because I'm aware of that.

       I used to work at a popular Canadian big-box store at the customer service desk. Once in a while a lady would come in and, if you got her in your line, would go on and on about how her landlord and the police and her doctor and the local MP were all working together to break into her house and steal from her. She said they put cameras all over her apartment and she was convinced they were watching her through the security cameras we had at the store. She  carried two reusable bags that she said held all her valuable items, like gifts the Queen had given her.

       Everything you just wrote sounded exactly like the way she put sentences/thoughts together.

       I doubt that would help me.  It's serious what you're saying, I've said the same thing about someone else myself.  I'm aware of my personality, I have a decorative, amusing way with words.   I can't help you with your doubts, but in the real world I've learned to be quiet.  Here in this post, I'm trying to do something that I haven't really seen others do, which is report what's going on, but I can't deny that I have aimed for literary pleasure.  Anyways, that's just how my mind is, I don't think I'm insane at all.

        Usually subcontracted government jobs hire agencies which hire people from all kinds of backgrounds but you get explained supposedly what reason you're all being paid to be there for, even though it may be vague.

       Temp agency.  There was nothing really significant at all.  Except I took pictures of the documents I had to sign when getting hired, because they disturbed me, I thought I could somehow be forced to be fired, it was a _ year contract.  The name is a pure acronym, it just stands out in it's blankness I guess.  I don't know.  Now I don't know, maybe maybe not.  Everyone has quit.  It's just 5 people, mostly who hide in separate areas of the building.  I don't know.  Also I love my boss now, who did A Course in Miracles also, ironically.  I hope this helps someone.

       Correction, I thought I could somehow use the contract in the future maybe to avoid being fired.  Maybe that's the case, since no one is fired no matter what.

       They aren't doing any workshop, it's a book that's a self study.  It's as if to people had read say, the Bhagavad Gita and they happened to work together. It's a great book though.  I studied it for years, years ago on my own, and the others most likely did as well.

       Don’t take this the wrong way, but are you sure you aren’t admitted into inpatient psych/ or residential? Depending on the level of acuity, some inpatient facilities allow access to internet, and access to personal items. You say there are cameras everywhere and people screaming at each other. Psych units have many cameras and patients do tend to scream at each other. Sounds more like you are in some type of psychiatric facility to me...

        ldly and after giving it a lot of thought and research perspective. The Nazi's were conducting a war. They were on the front's in Russia dying of the cold. The Nazi's had put the Jews into the camps. I've read Mein Kampf and I stopped, midway because I was afraid I was Jewish at that time and I was upset by the physically upsetting, shaming visualizations and the sensations that Mein Kampf eventually brought out, as Hitler was increasingly degrading of the Jews. He made one logical error to liken and blend the Jews with the people of this other political group which he hated. He really, really hated this other group I don't remember which one. Anyways what they don't really tell you in this saga of hate toward the Nazi's was that the country was obliterated by bombs from the UK. The residential areas, all the remaining Germans were being bombed to obliteration during the time when they had these Jews stored away in the camps. Physically, then I can see why they might not have been as focused on the camps as they should have been, enduring lack, death and starvation themselves they might not have been as attentive to their prisoners. This is all from video's I've watched because I was afraid of being Jewish, and at that time and continuing on, I want to research and understand 'anti-semitism', for my own protection of course you can understand. Anyways, if indeed the UK perpetrated this event of total destruction on the Germans, during the time of the holocaust, I would estimate it had something to do with national currencies. That is some kind of word salad I'm offering to the viewer I guess. Anyways, if the US took the German scientists away from that, I'd estimate it was some kind of apology. Idk. That's what my mind has come up with. I'm not crazy. I take the information I'm given, I take t

       In order to figure out if #1 is true, you need to completely rule out #2 and #3. Do you have a history of any kind of mental health or mood issues? Have you ever had a reason to doubt your perception of reality in the past? Do you take any legal or illegal drugs? Even with drugs you haven't used recently, this is still extremely relevant.

       Only if you can rule out #2 and #3 should you even begin to contemplate the possibility of #1.

       I'd take your advice but it seems unlikely that you're going to find some CIA experiment that hasn't used drugs or had "mental issues" or questioned their perception.   It seems quite unlikely you're ever going to to find a straight laced, pure witness, given the history of the CIA, or else I would take your advice.

       It seems to me you're not well versed in ideas surrounding the CIA but simply well trained in psychology.  I can confirm for you that I'm not without guilt, but that was the ENTIRE POINT OF THE POST.  The CIA, has figured out how to control people with guilt and shame.

       Say this, say I was molested as a child, abused as a child.  Critically injured.  I would then immediately be given a diagnosis of PTSD.  Then I am not competent. I'm not fit to explain what happened to me, hey I might not even be fit to testify in court because I'm mentally ill.  That's basically what you're saying to me.   I'm not mentally equipped to report my surroundings in a reddit post and yet I am functionally surviving in the world.  I know I am sane.  I know I can identify objects, in my surroundings.  I know I can identify and describe memories that I have about tests I've been given. I know that I can count, camera's in my field of vision.   Those basic realities are all I'm trying to say. I don't know, what I am seeing. I'm presenting, what I am seeing, to others, BECAUSE, it worries me.   BECAUSE, I want input.

       I'm currently "running from" the Course.  You sly dog.  Anyways, that book is awesome, it's the kindest piece of literature in the world.  Nothing wrong with reading a book that's mostly read by old people with dated web development skills, but it does seem crazy.  However, we're on a planet orbiting a sun in a vast black empty place.  It really strikes me how quick and sure people are about what they would call strange!  Have you ever seen a mole up close?  Something very strange is going on in this place, the world, probably more strange than what's happening at my job.  Nice try bucko.

       I learned that just by digging around on the internet and in declassified documents, to a far lesser degree (because they destroyed them all) about the relationship between the Course and the CIA actually.   So if you wen't back and looked at their explanations you would see that the CIA had fronts everywhere.  Given that fact it's probably not that fetched that I am overly conspiratorial in my thinking about my job.   So, I don't know, hopefully I am wrong, wrong about everything. Good luck

       I'd take your advice but it seems unlikely that you're going to find some CIA experiment that hasn't used drugs or had "mental issues" or questioned their perception.   It seems quite unlikely you're ever going to to find a straight laced, pure witness, given the history of the CIA, or else I would take your advice.

        ldly and after giving it a lot of thought and research perspective. The Nazi's were conducting a war. They were on the front's in Russia dying of the cold. The Nazi's had put the Jews into the camps. I've read Mein Kampf and I stopped, midway because I was afraid I was Jewish at that time and I was upset by the physically upsetting, shaming visualizations and the sensations that Mein Kampf eventually brought out, as Hitler was increasingly degrading of the Jews. He made one logical error to liken and blend the Jews with the people of this other political group which he hated. He really, really hated this other group I don't remember which one. Anyways what they don't really tell you in this saga of hate toward the Nazi's was that the country was obliterated by bombs from the UK. The residential areas, all the remaining Germans were being bombed to obliteration during the time when they had these Jews stored away in the camps. Physically, then I can see why they might not have been as focused on the camps as they should have been, enduring lack, death and starvation themselves they might not have been as attentive to their prisoners. This is all from video's I've watched because I was afraid of being Jewish, and at that time and continuing on, I want to research and understand 'anti-semitism', for my own protection of course you can understand. Anyways, if indeed the UK perpetrated this event of total destruction on the Germans, during the time of the holocaust, I would estimate it had something to do with national currencies. That is some kind of word salad I'm offering to the viewer I guess. Anyways, if the US took the German scientists away from that, I'd estimate it was some kind of apology. Idk. That's what my mind has come up with. I'm not crazy. I take the information I'm given, I take t
