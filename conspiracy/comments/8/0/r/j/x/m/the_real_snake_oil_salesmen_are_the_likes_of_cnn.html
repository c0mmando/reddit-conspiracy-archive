    <div class="md"><p>Both sides offer &quot;cures.&quot;  Is it any less snake-oily when Trump says &quot;We gotta look at video games and we need to have a rating system on movies!&quot; as if that is any kind of real solution?  We already have a movie rating system and we have done studies on the effects of violent video games and, turns out, they don&#39;t make people shoot up schools.  In fact, believe it or not, we aren&#39;t the only country on the planet that has violent video games or violent movies and yet other countries don&#39;t have mass shootings every couple months like we do.  Maybe we better look for something new to blame...   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we need to blame video games even though studies show they contribute nothing to violent tendencies and we need to get a movie rating system even though we already have one?  And never mind that every developed country on earth has violent video games and violent movies but nowhere near the amount of mass shootings we have?  So the one thing that does make us unique (our amount of guns and easy access) isn’t worth doing anything about?  Let’s look at video games.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you can certainly propose that as a solution.. that&#39;s a better proposal than saying &quot;we needta look into these violent video games and movie rating systems.&quot;  That is as much a non-solution/deflection of the issue as I can imagine.  The only thing missing is blaming rock and roll music and then we can officially be back in 1999.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can all issues not be focused on at the same time? It kind of feels like your trying to derail the discussion and point it in another direction by bringing up completely unrelated death statistics. The discussion is gun related deaths. Not diabetes or deaths in war. </p>

<p>Would you go into a thread discussing reckless driving and peoples attempts to reduce deaths related to it and say &quot;yes but diabetes kills more people each year so this isn&#39;t an issue.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you can certainly propose that as a solution.. that&#39;s a better proposal than saying &quot;we needta look into these violent video games and movie rating systems.&quot;  That is as much a non-solution/deflection of the issue as I can imagine.  The only thing missing is blaming rock and roll music and then we can officially be back in 1999.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reckless means to take an action which out care for the possible dangerous outcomes. This could mean either driving irresponsibly of the conditions (snow, rain, wind), or driving dangerously (Racing another car, Drifting, passing illegally). Either way, its bad driving that didn&#39;t intentionally cause harm, but the driver ignored the risks and eventually caused it.</p>

<p>Shooting someone is a deliberate action to cause harm.</p>
