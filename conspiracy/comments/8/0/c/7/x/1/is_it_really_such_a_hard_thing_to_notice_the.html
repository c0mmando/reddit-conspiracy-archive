       Her contingency plan was activating a Trump-Russia hysteria narrative if she lost. I think a person like Hillary only cares about revenge on the person who beat her. Pence would simply be an after-thought in the matter.

       If Donald Trump wasn't utterly incompetent, then your theory might hold water. It is undeniable that Trump doesn't really understand his role in government so I'm not surprised people are attacking him.

       It's so funny that people think there's a conspiracy to discredit DT, as if they completely forgot the complete shit show his first few months were.

       Remember the crazy press conferences? How insulting he was to our allies? His crazy speeches to the US and while abroad? The whirlwind of staff being replaced/appointed? The unconstitutional executive orders he kept trying to do? The insane tweets he continues to send out? There's too much to mention, he truly baffled us with bullshit.

       Who knows what would have happened. Trump probably would have seen the blatant Russian meddling band would have called it all 'Rigged'.

       Any investigation probably wouldn't be open like now (unless Republicans would have driven it, which I don't put past them), but I doubt the investigation into Manafort and Russia's influence in the election would have stopped had Hillary gotten elected.

       I don't get it, when you become president you are immediately put under extreme scrutiny. That's quite normal, why didn't they stop this before? Because no one thought the egotistical buffoon would win, and before he won he was just an idiot with big ties to russia, but when you become the president the song changes. I don't know how that's so hard to fathom, it's not about Hillary losing, it's about him becoming president with this baggage

       <p>
        In the second part of the scheme, between approximately 2015 and at least January 2017,
when the Ukraine income dwindled after Yanukovych fled to Russia, MANAFORT, with the
assistance of GATES, extracted money from MANAFORT’s United States real estate by, among
other things, using those properties as collateral to obtain loans from multiple financial institutions.
MANAFORT and GATES fraudulently secured more than twenty million dollars in loans by
falsely inflating MANAFORT’s and his company’s income and by failing to disclose existing debt
in order to qualify for the loans.

        Let's not ever forget people that Manafort and Trump have known each other for a long time, since at least the early 2000's when Stone was Trump's first presidential

         law firm together
        </a>

         apartment in Trump Tower since 2006
        </a>
        . And last, but certainly not in the least, Manafort's own daughter said this in a text to her sister:

       I don’t know where this narrative comes from. Eyebrows were certainly raised when Manafort came on, as he has very well known ties with powerful Russians and other authoritative governments, and was an odd choice to head a campaign.  The episode at the Republican convention, with the change in policy on Ukraine being the only thing in the party platform that the Trump team seemed interested in and their weird denials afterwords, caused the first widespread speculation that something weird was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were also many on Reddit who questioned why the front page of r/politics was dominated by stories from Sputnik news, RT news, and even Breitbart that were virulently pro-Sanders and attacked Clinton, often with what we have now come to call Fake News. Not to say that there aren’t plenty of things to attack Hillary for, but these articles typically went far past the realm of face and into blatant misinformation. Strangely, they all disappeared the moment the Sanders campaign shut down.
