I would think the best course of action would be to continue doing what they are doing. Flood the market with weapons and opiods. Let the lower classes kill each other and fight amongst themselves. Because what are guys going to do with AR-15s really??? You don&#39;t actually think you could start an uprising and win do You? The GOP wants you guys to have guns because it keeps everyone controllable. Then they parade events like these and rub your faces and show you how everyone is trying to take the guns. Then everyone acts predictable and around we go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um...374 is NOT &quot;less than 300.&quot; Also, &quot;AR15s and similar semis&quot; includes semi-automatic handguns and we&#39;re not just talking banning &quot;assault rifles.&quot; Further, you ignore the 4000 &quot;other weapons/unstated weapons&quot; and &quot;Firearms, type not stated&quot; that are in the report in 2016. You also neglect the exponential increase in rifle murders in 2016 compared to 2015 (a 45% increase in one year). We&#39;re also talking about reevaluating our entire system of gun regulation and production—why everyone shouldn&#39;t have access to things that can kill quickly and easily. It&#39;s just one thing we can eliminate and there&#39;s a pretty clear correlation between access and exocution. Simmer down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t show that the US is as bad as the UK. The UK right now is the gold standard for casual violence in developed nations. Violence in the US is often misrepresented because people fail to understand basic criminology and the sheer size of the US and the nature of the most common crimes and the laws. In other words, everything. </p>

<p>To be completely honest, I don&#39;t have anything against the UK, but liberalism produces some seriously stupid and pathetic people, and the Europe&#39;s liberalism produces the cringey type of creepy spineless social justice warrior you just saw commenting above me. I only talked shit because it was acting like those antifa criminals who harass random people. They always give me this child predator vibe. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t ever pin the problem on one thing. We both had single incidences and the underlying cause of the crimes are very complex issues and don&#39;t correlate perfectly to determining how safe either place really is, and our own lack of familiarity with the places can cause us to walk into danger in ways the people from the country never would.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, I would rather be within 50 yards of a man with acid/knife than a man with an assault rifle (see Las Vegas shooting.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Original text of what was to become the Second Amendment, as brought to the floor to the first session of the first congress of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Notice that &quot;Armed&quot; and &quot;Regulated&quot; are both mentioned, as to indicate that they do not mean the same thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federalist No. 46 is an essay by James Madison</p>

<p>States had control of the Militia. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall have the power to: provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Article I, Section 8 (the Militia Clause)</p>

<p>The Fed can take control of the Militia. </p>

It’s the same one that people use against homosexuality by saying it will lead to pedophilia and beastiality.  With this fallacy you are trying to discredit the middle ground by bringing up a hypothetical extreme.  </p>

<p>For instance, you bring up the car example suggesting that we should stop driving cars or maybe the government should take them away. In reality, cars have been made safer throughout the years by adding safety features, limiting dangerous versions, and creating national and state minimum licensing and registration guidelines. </p>

<p>A lot of gun control activists simply want to make sure that A. people are both capable and informed on how to use them before being given a license for one and B. have the guns registered to the person with a title that connects them to the gun.  Just like with cars, you have to prove you can drive one and, if you get in a hit and run and flee the scene, it’s easy to find out who owns the car. Some people just want guns to be treated more seriously, like cars.  So you can’t just jump past take our guns to a curfew.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your acting under the ingrained, propaganda entrenched belief, that guns kill people. They don’t. A gun is a tool. Much like a hammer, it will do absolutely nothing but rust until a human being picks it up.  What is done with that tool depends entirely on the mind controlling the hand. We Americans have major sociological issues. Removing guns would be akin to popping a lesion on a leper, it removes a symptom, but it does nothing to solve the root problem. You’re also forgetting that this sub is r/conspiracy where the point is to deliberate alternative narratives.  Why is the cabal so hell bent on removing firearms? Why are they so focused on doing this?  Why are there so many unanswered questions and oddities around all of these shootings? If “they” don’t exist at all and we are all paranoid why do kids kill kids?  Why aren’t families in America loving their children enough so this doesn’t happen? Finally, based on your username you live in the UK. Good for you and us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your question, nuclear weapons have the capability of destroying all of civilization and all living creatures.  Why we as a species should care is that it doesn’t take many of them to cause massive death. Even a few modern nuclear devices detonated atmospherically would kill an estimated 1.5 billion due to starvation caused by crop failures resultant from nuclear winter. A singular nuclear device detonated 300 miles up over London would be almost invisible to the human eye, and would kill no one. However, due to the resultant EMP, it would time travel the whole of the UK back to 1850 rendering all electronics, most automobiles, and electrical infrastructures useless.  How would western civilization fair without any electricity today?  Your comparing apples to hand grenades. Here are some more “great” comparisons. </p>

<p>Why don’t we eliminate all automobiles?  They kill more people than guns. My previous analogy, a hammer. It’s pretty much a mace....maces have killed tens of thousands of people over the last few thousand years. Shit, sharp sticks...millions have been killed by these over the millennia in the form of arrows and Spears!  Cut your trees and hedgerows down!  There are dangers everywhere!!!  Yes I know, these are absolutely fucking ridiculous comparisons, as is yours. </p>

<p>If our media, deep state, FBI, CIA, NSA, religious organizations, parents, teachers, and civic leaders focused a 1/4 of their energy and resources on promoting mental health and providing a loving environment versus removing a tool, a vast majority of these events would disappear. In addition, our country could actually become a great place. With this in mind, I’ll ask again, Why are they still continually focused on disarming the populace???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that for many people guns serve no purpose in 2018. For some they do. Reading your posts I gather we come from very different backgrounds. I live in what is referred to as a “fly over state”. While you know no one that owns a firearm, I literally know no one who doesn’t. The fly over states (MT, WY, ID, ND, SD) have the highest gun ownership rate per capita in the country and the lowest level of violent crimes. If the presence of firearms had any correlation at all with the level of violent crimes; it would be a blood bath here. As stated previously, the root cause of these shootings is something much deeper. Mental health issues, lack of family values, lack of love and compassion, or yes possibly some nefarious conspiracy to disarm a populace. As stated I agree that very few have a need of a firearm today, but what does the future hold?  I lack the trust necessary to believe that my fellow man won’t at some point be desperate enough to cause my family harm to feed theirs, or that our leaders have my best interests at heart. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t absorb conservative media, I don’t identify as conservative and I don’t believe it is entirely propaganda. About a decade ago the ATF senate subcommittee introduced a bill that would change the explosive category of ammunition to that of TNT. Seems innocent on the surface, and it had heavy traction. It would have completely eliminated retail sales and shipping of ammunition. It was estimated, by a friend that wholesales ammunition, that it would have increased a box of ammunition from $15 to over $350. Basically the rich and the military would be the only entities that could afford to fire weapons. No, you did not see this in the media. If they weren’t interested in disarming why would they do this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I don’t understand how being a citizen that owns a firearm makes America a mess?  The wording here is important. By citizen I mean a law abiding citizen. There is a reason that over 97% of these mass shootings since 1977 have occurred in areas where firearms are banned. Law abiding citizens follow the law and don’t bring firearms into these areas. Criminals don’t give a fuck what the law states. Psychopathic criminals hell bent on causing as much death as possible aren’t going to open fire on a populace that may return fire.

    <div class="md"><p>-I wasn&#39;t providing Bloomberg as an alternative to mainstream media, just stating who funded the study. Also, literally meant Bloomberg the person, not his company, and he&#39;s a centrist.</p>

<p>-false, literally titled &quot;mass shooting analysis&quot; , I like how you pretended you clicked on the source though <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/reports/mass-shootings-analysis/">https://everytownresearch.org/reports/mass-shootings-analysis/</a></p>

<p>-this implies you&#39;ve responded to every question and point I&#39;ve made, which you haven&#39;t. I was demonstrating that your 98% number is fabricated  and pointed out how ridiculous it is to state we shouldn&#39;t have laws because they&#39;ll be broken. Why is America different from all the countries that have banned guns or heavily restricted them and have significantly less mass killings/shootings?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn’t click on the link you just provided because it wasn’t provided....besides after your first two “references” what was the point?  I’m not saying guns don’t end up in the wrong hands. I’m also not saying that more effective gun control may help curb the number of mass shootings. What I’m saying is we have deeper issues that won’t be resolved, even really curbed, until we address the root problems.  Why does America have more mass killings?  The more I read and understand the viewpoints of those advocating for elimination of firearm ownership by law abiding citizens the more a nefarious agenda becomes the only logical conclusion.  It has become an irrational zeal not founded in logic. This defines propaganda and it’s ultimate purpose. Look to within our own borders for proof. I’ve referenced it before, the states with the highest gun ownership per capita have the lowest violent crimes. This Flys in the face of the argument for disarming. Why do states with some of the largest voting bases have the highest amount of mass shootings?  Would it be to sway the popular vote at all?  Would our government or an agency thereof orchestrate the killing of its own citizens to gain support for an agenda...like blowing up the world trade towers?   Not all mass shootings are false flags most definitely. I would argue however that the additional mass killings we have over other developed nations are false flags. </p>

<p>Study your history about populace’s that were banned the ability to take up arms. This is a true study in mass killings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The leaps of logic here, entire misunderstanding of the burden of proof, inability to differentiate correlation and causation, and misunderstanding of what &quot;logic&quot; means, make this an entire waste of time.</p>

<p>The validity of your view point is based on &quot;more guns less shootings&quot; yet evidence to the contrary are links you can&#39;t be bothered to read or false flags. It&#39;s insane how narrow your perspective is; I don&#39;t want guns in society because their only purpose is to take life and I don&#39;t see a purpose for that. The volume of mass shootings just reaffirms that, it wasn&#39;t the root of that idea, and the evidence for guns=safety, is way less cut and dry than you&#39;re making it out to be.</p>

<p>Which either means you&#39;re intentionally lying, only acknowledge sources that fit your own narrative, or are just ignorant. Either way, waste of time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been around firearms for 43 years. Everyone I know owns and operates firearms. NO ONE I KNOW HAS EVER KILLED ANYONE. Quite frankly that is all the proof I need. Have you spent any time around firearms besides what is attached to a video game that glorifies mass murder?  I have not read all of your links, because quite frankly they’re bullshit. I’ve agreed with some of your points and now agree with another. This is a waste of time because you are not willing to entertain any other thoughts or concepts other than what you are being told to believe. Your proving how/why propaganda works by displaying information created by official sources. Who in the fuck do you think official sources are???  Grow up and actually formulate your own opinion about something through actual knowledge or experience versus regurgitating bullshit that is spoon fed to you. </p>

If you convince someone that everyone ELSE believes this, theres plenty of people who dont think for themselves and will follow right along. This is accomplished by the media having an extremely small overton window, as well as social media filtering out beliefs that are unfavorable to the elites.

<p>They are both guns. They are both designed by the same person. They are very closely similar in design. There are changes you could make and understand that I would never make a different grip that you could change an AR to M16 very easily. It would actually have many different firing options and a lcd screen. I could make the trigger pull less than you could see with a naked eye. The gun wouldn&#39;t fire again until the next round completely chambered(won&#39;t jam). I&#39;m still surprised no one&#39;s done it because it&#39;s really simple. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a young person, and I had the privilege of not growing up with constant stress and pressures to conform and be a pacifist about every damn thing. The little bit of that shit which is considered normal now, I absolutely dread.</p>

<p>People my age are strong as hell for dealing with the amount of stress they have, but it eats away at common sense I think. They&#39;re a lot more focused on mentally surviving day to day and getting the tremendous amount of shit done that they have to, and it leaves very little room for the effort required to develop an adequate bullshit detector. Education, especially the way they do it now, seems to make it worse, since the spirit and the implications of the things they learn are completely removed from the process.</p>

If the government is so powerful that it takes many mass shootings, why doesn’t it have the power to do anything about it?

    <div class="md"><p>IMO &quot;gun grab&quot; will go the way of abortion via &quot;TRAP&quot; laws. You don&#39;t outlaw something that would result in such backlash. You chip away with seemingly minor regulations and restrictions to allow something to legally stay on the books but become practically inaccessible. </p>

<p>E.g. in Florida after you have been &quot;Baker Acted&quot; you are prohibited from purchasing guns. There are currently calls to expand the Baker Act so that police (rather than mental health professionals) have authority to deem someone mentally unfit, in need of involuntary detention and treatment, with zero evidence of threat of harm to self or others. Sheriff Israel is specifically campaigning on give police the right to detain/treat before there is any evidence of harm. </p>

<p>If that goes through, then police can Baker Act anyone and they will lose all rights to purchasing guns. Previously in the early Obama era it seemed to be more of a focus on the no fly list as being a reason to ban a person from having guns. The manufactured islamic terror threat lost its potency however and since then there seems to have been a switch to domestic mass shooter chaos to instill fear, and ever since Sandy Hook there has been a huge emphasis on changing &quot;mental health&quot; policies (without ever actually addressing sound mental illness treatment/prevention, rather the talk is always about rights of involuntary detention, treatment, the gun rights of those individuals, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 2nd amendment is 227 years old....No fucking shit if you look at gun control over the last 5 years you wont see anything being done. California is a great example, going from the “wild west” to bureaucratic land of laws and limitations. </p>

<p>You need a state permit and proof of residency to purchase a firearm, all firearms require the state to retain purchaser and seller information complete  with finger print identification for any transfer. There is a law against assault weapons and another restricting magazine size down to 10 rounds. Carry permits are required and Open carry has been reduced to only the county issued in and is at the sole discretion of the county sheriff. The waiting period for purchases has gone from 1, to 5, to 10 days. And background checks are required for private party transfers. </p>

<p>They are never going to “take your guns away”, that would be a civil war. They are going to make buying, owning, maintaining, and transferring ownership harder and harder for the average citizen to keep up with until people begin to give up their constitutional right. Thats why they dont care when their bill for this year doesnt pass. All they need to do is slowly but surely chip away at what you can buy, when you can buy it, and who has the right to buy. </p>

<p>You need a state permit and proof of residency to purchase a firearm, all firearms require the state to retain purchaser and seller information complete with finger print identification for any transfer. There is a law against assault weapons and another restricting magazine size down to 10 rounds. Carry permits are required and Open carry has been reduced to only the county issued in and is at the sole discretion of the county sheriff. The waiting period for purchases has gone from 1, to 5, to 10 days. And background checks are required for private party transfers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All more than reasonable rules to promote responsible gun ownership and cut down on guns falling into the hands of people who shouldn&#39;t have them. Now add some red flag laws that allow the police to disarm people with a history of violence and mental illness and we&#39;re making progress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>School shootings will continue to happen because we have 300+ million guns in this country, that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t look at common sense legislation to cut down on the number of people who die every year to these types of mass shootings. If I have to wait a week to buy a new gun or pay a fee to maintain my carry permit or not have access to large capacity magazines to help save even a few lives every year I&#39;m perfectly fine with that. Those things don&#39;t restrict my right to own guns and protect myself and my family. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a natural consequence of a nation with too many fucking guns.  </p>

<p>I know being accountable for your actions can be hard when you really like the thing that&#39;s cause your problems, but come on!</p>

<p>America is like a child sitting on a thumbtack, crying about the pain while arguing they have the right to sit on it.  </p>

<p>When guns are everywhere, how can you be surprised that your police force becomes militarized?</p>

<p>When you can get an AR15 more easily than a Canadian can visit a doctor, are you really surprised that some mentally unstable person goes and shoots up a school?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The future looks grim</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The future looks grim BECAUSE YOU&#39;RE CREATING A SHITTY FUTURE, and the majority of the world is watching this and wondering what the fuck is wrong with you guys.</p>

<p>You fuckers elected Trump!  You suffer from almost complete regulatory capture, and you did it to yourselves!  Year after year, you trade your rights and freedoms for &quot;safety&quot; you need from your own SHITTY DECISIONS.  Just look at your FOR PROFIT healthcare!  How ridiculous a concept it that!  </p>

<p>Another example of you fucking yourselves over - 9/11.  The official story makes no sense at all, but we can all agree it sucked.  In response, you go with security theater and erosion of rights.  The terrorists literally couldn&#39;t have done better at sticking it to the average American.  They did more than &quot;win&quot; - they made America tea-bag itself.</p>

<p>Damn near all your problems come from the inequality you so dearly enjoy.  Racial inequality.  Financial inequality.  Social inequality.  Human vs. corporation inequality.  Legal system inequality.  Gender inequality.  Sexual inequality.  Fixing your BIG PROBLEMS starts with having a heart and dealing with your SMALL PROBLEMS.  Having compassion for your neighbour for example. I&#39;m not religious, but damn, American Christians are the fucking worst.  Preaching the bible, while selectively practicing only the parts that further your individual hate-based agendas.  Don&#39;t feed the homeless. Fuck those gay people. Let the sick die, no insurance. </p>

<p>You can gradually make change though your own choices and actions, but here&#39;s the real kicker - as bad as it is now, and as bad as it is slowly becoming, <em>you&#39;re not going to do anything to bring systemic change in your lifetime</em>.  The most powerful thing you could do would be a general strike, but let&#39;s face it - American&#39;s don&#39;t have the fortitude for that any more.  Look at Occupy - only your youth really participated in any number.  Were YOU there?  Were your parents?  Americans in general are far too comfortable to <em>really</em> protest, or <em>really</em> strike.  You&#39;re got too much to lose, and while it&#39;s easy to say that&#39;s because some nefarious powers that be keep it that way with their bread and circuses, the fact of the matter is change takes sacrifice, and apathetic American&#39;s don&#39;t give enough of a shit about themselves, their neighbours, or their country to do something about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you can go ahead and attack me all you want but what you are saying is not what I was trying to get across. </p>

<p>When I say the type of people who would rather watch the bachelor, I am not only referring to the bachelor but other things along those lines l.  Reality tv, gossip shows, kardashian stuff, big brother, the real world, mtv etc.  People who would rather play video games than go outside, would rather surf the internet than go camping. So bringing up how many people watched the bachelor when it first aired is comical to say the least. </p>

<p>And when I say people who believe everything they see on CNN I mean CNN and other MSM.  You don&#39;t have to watch cable tv all day everyday to see clips from CNN, NBC, CBS, FOX or any of these news stations.  They come up on facebook, youtube, reddit, twitter, etc. So again relating the amount of millennials watching cnn on tv is ridiculous. </p>

<p>And also I never said having guns equals higher intelligence or more free thought.  The ability to use your mind to determine that this isn&#39;t a black and white issue is though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But usually the other mass shootings don&#39;t cause a nationwide push for gun control because people know it&#39;s not an epidemic. It&#39;s just something that happens occasionally for specific reasons. Most reports of gun violence in school aren&#39;t mass shootings anyway so to make it seem like a bigger threat than it is, they need to manufacture the right crises with the right victims and the right weapons.

<p>Thank you. Everybody&#39;s so worried someone&#39;s gonna take their precious guns while they militarize the police, surveil every street corner, and now want to start getting children used to being trapped in the custody of armed public servants as early as kindergarten. </p>

<p>Seriously, the pistol someone keeps under their pillow isn&#39;t going to help for shit against the police state being built. The only thing it&#39;ll be useful for is helping you exit this world when it becomes too much to bear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This didn&#39;t start with shootings. It started with the Patriot Act. That was the true erosion of our rights. Then, once they saw how easily they could get us to bend to what they wanted using fear tactics and buzzwords, they ran with it. Thus, starting the mass surveillance program. Then, when Snowden released it, they started a mass campaign of him being a traitor and people agreed. Yay. The main reason I got from people thinking he was a traitor was, who cares if they are watching us, I have nothing to hide. This type of surveillance keeps us safe. They also didn&#39;t care that Clapper lied about it and that most of the surveillance is on us, not terrorists. That to me is the biggest tell. They are collecting data on us to see how they can mold us to what they want. They are like a giant FB, Google, Apple, etc... Gathering data to learn how to sell things to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>da fuq? Are you trying to say that gun control is stripping you of your rights? Maybe if your nation could figure out how to not shoot everyone because for some reason you believe your life is worth more than someone else&#39;s you wouldn&#39;t have anything taken from you. The average American is a child that throws a temper tantrum because you MIGHT get your toys taken away from you. Your toys that you can&#39;t learn how to play with appropriately and continuously kill innocent people with. When a child hits another with a stick you take away the stick from the child. If millions of children start hitting other children with sticks, you stop giving access to sticks for all children. It&#39;s so fucking simple. Leave your emotions out of this shit and use logic to realize that enough is enough. There are tonnes of countries that have gun control and all kinds of freedoms too. Asking to have tools designed solely for the purpose of killing other humans from a distance is not stripping you of your rights. It&#39;s smart. Gun control is not a conspiracy.</p>
