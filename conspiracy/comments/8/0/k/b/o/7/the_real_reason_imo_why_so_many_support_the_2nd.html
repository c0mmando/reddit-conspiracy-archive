       The US is made up of immigrants, no? Yes, we are. I am personally of Polish, Russian, and German descent. My main bloodline (heritage) is Polish. My ancestors left their homeland, to make this country their own, and be a part of the idea of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       A nation which was supposed to recognize Natural Rights (something my ancestors fought valiantly for - looking at you, the winged Hussars). We Polish people have constantly fought for our independence, life, liberty, property, and were constantly thrown around by either the West or East.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many left, but, many stayed (quite a few of my ancestors were assassinated by the Russians - raped - kidnapped - hence my Russian bloodline), and I love my Polish brothers and sisters, but shit... You need to wake up (as hundreds of thousands of you are, now - I digress). It's not an "American thing", it's a liberty thing. We all have a right to life, liberty, and property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Americans have it so good, they do not even realize what actual persecution is. It's all hidden, yet, in plain sight... Cops can kill you, for no reason other than: "they were afraid for their lives".  What about my life? What about my rights? Don't matter, and you people calling for restrictions and laws are playing into all of this. It's madness, imo...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, this was just a rant, and I suggest you fully read what I've said. Anyone coming from a background of actual persecution: China, Russia, Poland, England, Middle East countries, etc etc. There is a reason we are firm on this. They are not "toys" to us. We know what is possible, and don't want this shit to happen again. America is suppose to be a country of the Free. I know that experiment failed, but, understand, it's not completely. We can move on, with lessons learned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace and love...

       How long after the next inevitable school shooting will you be calling for more gun control.. and more gun control after the shooting that happens after that. And so on.. and so on

      <p>
       I’m for sensible gun control too. But let’s be honest.. many Democrats end goal is to severely limit the second amendment. Always has been.

       There shouldn't be any school shootings in the first place. It's not all or nothing with trying some new tactics for gun control. There shouldn't be hundreds of students dead over the course of a year because of mass shootings.

      <p>
       Since 1980 there have been right around 800 people killed in all mass shootings in this nation.

      <p>
       Compare that to over 600 people killed by firearms in Chicago, just last year.

       800 over 38 years, or 600 a year?

       So it's pointless to safe guard our constitutional rights because the state has the monopoly on violence? I don't understand that sentiment.

       I understand what you mean though. Guns aren't going to save the oppressed from the technologically advanced oppressors. But would you disagree that if you are going to be killed by evil you might as well be doing it standing up and fighting instead of lying down and crying?

       Oh boy, I feel you. Large cities are not to place to be when people get hysterical and desperate. You make a good point as well. The 2nd amendment serves a purpose to defend yourself against a violent community. It reminds me of the Koreans sitting on the roofs of their businesses defending themselves from the Rodney King riots.

       I’ve seen how they act when there’s a gas shortage because of a hurricane. If they can’t have their luxuries, the world is over. Even if it’s because somewhere else in the United States at that very moment, someone is suffering. “STUPID HURRICANE! I HAVE TO GO ON MY VACATION!”

       "Automatic military style"-- it is extremely expensive and difficult (thorough background and multiple references check) to own a fully automatic weapon. The AR-15s the media is hyping are semi-auto. They look like the military version but they don't fire at the same rate. In fact, they fire at the same rate as a typical (non revolver) hand gun. AR-15s ARE NOT assault rifles. Assault rifles can fire at a fully automatic rate.

       Great post OP. I come from a Polish/German background and my grand parents always told us stories of how awful life was when they were growing up and how grateful they were to come to America and live the dream of living free without your next door neighbor rating you out to the secret police for what ever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are so lucky to live here but the sad reality is freedom is being withered away in the name of safety and no one gives a shit because it doesn't effect their everyday life at this point.
The day will come....and it is coming where the US turns into an Israel Palestine land.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day will come where police come to your house and say...you have to leave...this is no longer your home it Belongs to us because a book of fairy tales says so.
If Israel can just take over a group of people who they call dogs and less than human who's to say the US isn't next?
I don't know how the rest of Israelis sit around and watch their leaders commit genocide without blinking an eye...their leaders have them brain washed into thinking what they are doing is Nobel and just.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cry about the Holocaust and don't let a day go by without using it as a crutch when just a couple decades ago their own people were being gassed and burned in ovens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel are the biggest hypocrites on the face of the earth and I would embarrassed to call myself an Israeli...
How many more videos do w need to see of IDF gunning down 11yo girls at a check point...
How many more videos of unarmed Palestinians being gunned down without any repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck Banjo netinyahoo and his band of thugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just have to look at the TSA when you go to the airport.
What a giant waste of money and resources.
You have these morons who are dumb as a box of rocks feeling up your 11 yo daughter for bombs when real items get through...."sir...I need you to step away from that 16oz. Bottle of water" and also...those toe nail clippers are not approved.
I just need you to take off your shoes and socks just to make sure it looks like were actually doing something...otherwise we're just glorified doormen.

       If you think your AR15 is going to defend you from the the US governments F16's you are crazy. Current gun laws are superficial and are the main cause for US citizens feeling they are "free". Fact is, if the the government wanted to take us out they would have little fight to do so. Gun owners are weak individuals and full of fear. I live in the the US, a free country, and have no desire to possess weapons as if I was in a hostile country. Gun owners are causing the the rift. Period.
