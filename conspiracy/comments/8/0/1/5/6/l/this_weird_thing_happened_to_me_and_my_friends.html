       Okay, so yesterday me and my friends found this guy who told us about a apocolypse and he wanted us to join his cult and he knew alot of personal information about us. He called him self "THE WATCHER" and he joined our discord server as "1494/1559" and he told us about his cult and the "apocolypse". He said a war is near and we should join him. We thought nothing off it at first but
he returned today and sent us a website "
       <a href="https://1494rebirthcult.com">
        https://1494rebirthcult.com
       </a>
       " and his discord was linked and we joined and texted with him. He told us our real names, our age etc. He later deleted the discord and he says he will return. I have some screenshots you can look at here, he dm'd my friend. This story may sound really weird and stupid but we actually don't know this guy and I'm actually quite scared. We don't have pictures of his server because he deleted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the pictures:

       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Update: The guy joined again with a new account and told us to delete the post, we banned him again. He knows that we are talking about him. I gave him a role so he could speak then after he said 
"3:02 AM] 1494/1559: take the post down" I banned him.
      </p>

       Here are the pictures:

      <hr/>
      <p>
       Update 2: He came back today as 1494/1559, I gave him a rank so he could speak and he sent us a ".batch" file. I downloaded it and I pressed edit because I didn't want to open it because of my safety and it said this
      </p>
      <p>
       start ""
       <a href="https://1494rebirthcult.com">
        https://1494rebirthcult.com

      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is out there.

      <p>
       Cosa ha rovinato la famiglia?
      </p>
      <p>
       We entered his site again and it was edited and he had changed the picture and a couple of the lines. Please help us with any info on what this can mean and his picture on the site. After he sent the ".batch" file he left and went offline. You can look for yourself at his site or look at the pictures.
His website: "
       <a href="https://1494rebirthcult.com">
        https://1494rebirthcult.com
       </a>
       "

       Edit: The site is down, we haven't heard from him yet.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Update 3: He joined our server again but this time with another person called "1494REBORN" who was apparentaly a member of the cult. He wanted my friend David to join, and we still don't know how they know his name is David. They also said that if David doesn't send a email wanting to join and "changing his name"? he would come back. And of course David didn't send him an email, I have pictures of the conversation.

      <p>
       Edit: David sent an email acting like he's wanting to join the "1494 Cult" and he wrote this, "Ok, so if I join your cult will you leave my friends alone? I can join I just want to know more info about the cult itself you and the apocalypse." we are currently waiting for a response.

       We think that it's someone from our discord server, but I still don't know why the person would do all this, from deep conversations to creating a website dedicated to him and his cult.

       Why not put a password on your discord and only give it to people you know arent him? If you have any doubt about it being someones alt, dont give them the password. Then slowly give it out to less trusted people and see if he reappears.

       The fact that he gave your private information after you visited his site and not before, to me sounds like his website was created just to get access your IP address..

       I'm not sure about that, because when you enter the site, the connection is secured. And he gave us information about friends that didn't even enter the site.

       I’m not very well versed in IT, but I didn’t think a secured connection meant a site owner couldn’t see the IP’s of site visitors, I thought that had more to do with outsiders trying to look in? Maybe someone could clarify this?
      </p>

       Also once he has one or two of you guys he could easily just use your own social media to start naming off friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       you should have tried telling him he was wrong and seen what his response would be...
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: or to test him, you could create another account and talk to him though a vpn and see if he can still identify you

       The thing is I have a vpn on at all times, and he got information on my friends little brother who is not in the discord, and I don't think he has social media. The guy said that he had been watching us for a long time and he wanted us to join him. He could still have gotten my friends ip's, because they don't have a vpn on.

       Well then to me it sounds like someone you know is trolling you, have you or your social circle pissed anyone off recently that would be determined enough to go through all of this trouble just to freak you out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: and I just googled 1494/1559..... needless to say I’m fairly confident it’s a reference to the Italian Wars, not sure if that’s useful at all but maybe some where to start digging?

       We have not pissed anyone off and I don't think anyone of the people in my discord would make a website and do all of this. We also searched up 1494/1559 and we also found "The Italian Wars" and he talked about a upcoming war.

       Using various clues, you can piece someones real identity together from a bunch of places, but he may be someone you know irl.
      </p>
      <p>
       His website being a secure connection means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should scan all of your devices for malware and specifically for rootkits, in case his site is specifically set up to infect your device and use a RAT to get all your info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, is your VPN a real one or a piece of spyware disguised as a free VPN like so many are?

       Hmmmm, those dates are during the Roman and Venician High Renaissance. That painting is Raphael's
       <em>
        School of Athens
       </em>
       . That's Plato pointing up in the middle (modeled after Leonardo Da Vinci) and Aristotle with his hand spread. Plato was into metaphysics and Aristotle the Earth Sciences. Michelangelo is the guy sitting down, in the current clothing, writing a poem, totally thrown in because Raphael loved his work so much. Raphael's self portrait is tucked to the far right, hidden with the mathematicians.

       Your screenshots are very low resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this quote accurate?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "The chaos starts in 14941559 seconds"?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like that's his claim. So 173 days from whenever he wrote it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this means his name has a lot to do with measurement in seconds. His discord name added "/1559" to the site name, maybe as an extra measure of precision. 1559 seconds means that his name can reach "/9999" before it becomes silly. 9999 seconds =  2,7775 hours. So he had to write his stuff inside the time-frame of 9999 seconds... or else his name would change to 14950000... you agree?
      </p>
      <p>
       *
       <em>
        If he wrote it today, and we count 173 days ahead, that gives us the date 16th august 2018. *
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there's a coincidence in his claim to be from an Italian cult, and the Italian Wars (1494-1559)
       <em>
        "series of violent wars for control of Italy. Fought largely by France and Spain but involving much of Europe, they resulted in the Spanish Habsburgs dominating Italy and shifted power from Italy to northwestern Europe."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What have we learned from this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's an actual date counted from now, 16th august
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The cult is Italian and refers to the Italian Wars which involved much of Europe.

       Ok guys look i am a personal friend of Shojou(op) and this may be a cool little thing to think about but i am 99% sure this is someone we know. I know he is trolling because i struck back at him with annoying  shit i never took him seriously and even though he talked kind of cryptic you could see that he was out of things to say and that he was getting annoyed. At last he said "I have a member who is a friend of yours" that is when he blew it. That "member" who gave him all his info is not real because he is that member. Sorry Shojou if i ruined the post i know you we're really scared and i promise i will give this guy a hard knock message if we find out who he is.

       I advice against this. It gives him extra reasons to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless he outright threatened any of you (in which case you need to document everything and find pro help), you should pretty much just go along for the ride or ignore it. If you decide to "waste some time" on his messages, try to get some concrete info from him. Like, how many members do they have, how did they think it made sense to contact you, what is their religion, what are their sources, etc.

       sounds like social engineering. he's using what info he has to gauge your reaction to it. or maybe trying to get you to confirm info about yourself.

       Hello everyone, this user is actually a friend of my brother and i wanted to clear up some of the confusion in this thread. I am currently studying computer science and i have a pretty decent understand as to how things work. My brother told me about this incident and i wanted to help as much as i could and the solution was pretty simple. I simply did a who.is search of the website posted here in question and got the information about who created it. Showed it to my brother and he said that it was the address of
       <a href="https://reddit.com/u/Shojouu/">
        /u/Shojouu.
       </a>
       My brother confronted him and he confirmed that he did this as a prank.

       created fake accounts and a website to troll his friends, thats why he know the name of everyone in the discord.

       We think that it's someone from our discord server, but I still don't know why the person would do all this, from deep conversations to creating a website dedicated to him and his cult.
