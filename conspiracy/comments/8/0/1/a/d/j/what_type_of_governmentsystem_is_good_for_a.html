       Why? It's a business that provides a service like any other. They have to pay to keep your money "safe" via the physical building, website (and other online infrastructure), taxes, utilities, employees, security contractors, etc etc.

       Money should be used to do business, it should not be a business itself. That's  exactly what's wrong with America today.

       "Your money" was never yours to begin with when it's created from debt. Someone else owns that credit rendering your physical money inept.

       Um, that's not what a banking business actually is. A bank is to keep your money (that you acquired generally speaking via transacting
       <em>
        in business
       </em>
       ) "safe" and to loan out money. It's a service in which they should be compensated for, if you choose to do business with them. You're wrongfully conflating a local credit union with the likes of the Federal Reserve. Which should be abolished, imo.

       Banks don't make money keeping your couple hundred bucks "safe". They make money with loans and mortgages.  Now come up with a compelling argument why a man should  pay seven  fold  for the right to raise his family in a sheltered environment and I'll actually listen to what you have to say.

       WTF, does this have to do with banks or my comment about a banking business? You're conflating, once again. Your real beef is (or should be) with fiat currency via the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve Notes), not banks in general.

       Exactly, the problem is fiat currency, not banks. You're going to need a bank just as well, if you have gold you want protecting.

       A mixed economy similar to the European social democracies with a strong social safety net would be ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       There needs to be a degree of capitalism to incentivize progress in technology and civilization, but it should be tempered as we do live on a planet with finite resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my opinion. I think we are too advanced to have people living on the street while others hoard immense wealth in private banks. Wealth inequality is to be expected in such a system, but it doesn't have to be runaway capitalism where CEOs are making
       <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/20/ceos-make-271-times-the-pay-of-most-workers.html">
        270 times
       </a>
       the amount of the employees. Less than 60 years ago, the pay gap was 20 to 1 between CEOs and employees. Something along those lines seems far more fair to all of society.

       No government. Although I'm not entirely sure how a radically libertarian anarcho-capitalist society would prevent the inevitable forming of an enterprise monopoly out of which some form of government would arise.

       A hybrid syatem. Little of this ism, little if that ism. No pure isms. Pure isms tend to not have proper checks and balances to combat corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corruption, bribes, greed seem to be the downfallmof most. No matter what ism you subscribe to if corruption is not put in check the  it erodes whatever tenants that kept things together.

       Who knows honestly pretty much every empire falls at one point or another regardless of the government they keep. I will say, I would quite like the tribe mentality, a moral and well meaning chief or Cheifess and a council of elders lol who cares for each individual member of the tribe and each tribe member contributes equally to the quality of life assuming their capabilities. I guess that’s socialism huh? Can’t lie though the ancients had it right, some people hunted for everyone, some people farmed for everyone, some people made clothes and pottery, and some people taught and took care of the children , some cooked the food, some did spiritual work or healing and everyone shared the burden and they all worked together and helped each other live harmoniously, and it worked, and they survived until the brutal men with their Christian ideals came and slaughtered them all and their peaceful way of life :)

       It's not about the system.  It's about the beings in that system.  Really any system will work or not work depending upon the people involved in the system.

       What that means is that Capitalism, Totalitarianism, Fascism,
       <em>
        Whateverism

       ...they would all work if the people handling them were good or fail if the people handling them were bad.
