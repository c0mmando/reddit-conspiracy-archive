I&#39;ve been &#39;awake&#39; for quite a while (was a sophomore in high school when 9/11 went down and had a fairly conservative upbringing, so I bought the whole story at first, but as I followed the developments over the next year or so nothing made sense...) but I have red pilled people who didn&#39;t buy conspiracies at with only that doc.

<p>Yep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several individuals, thinking that psychiatrists might help to alleviate the extreme stress associated with their harassment, were accorded “treatment” which clearly pointed to cooperation between their psychiatrists and members of the U.S. Intelligence community. One such psychiatrist, in fact, bragged about being a member of the U.S. Intelligence “inner circle,” informing our contact that her harassment was a “Pavlovian Experiment,” intended to “break” her. </p>

<p>The exception to this is when elderly parents and young children in the family become targets for apparent purposes of intimidation. This situation has been reported in eight of our cases, to date.</p>

<p>One individual (driven to extremes of stress by ongoing electronic harassment focusing on her children) killed one child in an effort to protect her from further pain.[2] It appears that lasers were being used in this individual’s case. The targeting intensified after she called the Soviet Embassy to report the harassment, which she believed to be U.S. Government-sponsored. It became even more deadly when, in a further show of defiance, she then called the representative of the Iraqi Government to portray the U.S. Government’s war in the Middle East as “hypocritical.” She is now hospitalized in a midwestern psychiatric facility, where, apparently, the experimentation is now continuing. </p>

<p>I still contend that a super, ultra-mega, hyper-mental, enhanced torment program that can force a complete breakdown of someone&#39;s personality resulting in a schizophrenic break that can potentially lead to suicidal and/or homicidal actions, even towards their dearest loved ones does not equal torture.

<p>&quot;Fucking msm (and their shills) acts like r/conspiracy is a den of half-witted, tin-foil hat theorists that don&#39;t count for shit. Yet everytime a political story breaks they&#39;re here in force telling us how stupid we all are. If the shills really believe their own bullshit, then their behavior is the equivalent of me going down the street to the local asylum and jumping in for activity time then just walking around bitch-slapping all the inmates, calling them retards and insisting that they should play checkers instead of chess.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And another aspect to it is that v2k alone is not painful. There&#39;s a slight expansion of the brain due to heating which is producing the effect of audible sound but that isn&#39;t painful. It was proposed as a method for deaf people to hear (without a hearing aid). It&#39;s other remote neuro weapons that inflict pain. </p>

<p>In the sense they use v2k 24/7 to constantly talk to the target (using AI bots) so they can&#39;t sleep then that sleep deprivation is a form of torture.</p>

<p>That they use v2k to issue death threats, threats against family, verbal abuse, it&#39;s torture.</p>

<p>But yeah v2k by itself wouldn&#39;t be torture.</p>

<p>These technologies are called by some &quot;no touch torture&quot; because they can leave no permanent physical damage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just one little foot note to what you said here:</p>

<p>&quot;And another aspect to it is that v2k alone is not painful.&quot;</p>

<p>Assuming we are talking physical pain as opposed to mental or emotional pain, do u know if it&#39;s painful if used extensively for long periods of time? Does it cause any side effects such as muscle twitches or cramps or anything like that which could become painful after extended periods if exposure? Because if I splash u with a drop of water you wouldn&#39;t consider it painful but if I strap you to a chair and administer Chinese water torture it&#39;s gonna hurt. I can&#39;t imagine extended periods of brain expansion would feel all that innocuous. </p>

<p>The issue is that there are a variety of technologies and they are used in a variety of ways on a target.</p>

<p>HOWEVER,</p>

<p>so people being manipulated by these technologies ARE TOTALLY UNAWARE OF IT. ie. there is a capacity for the technology to go totally unnoticed. A great way to do that is to manipulate the target while they are asleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine a nightmare future where behavioral modification devices become the prisons of the future. People who are profiled at a young age for being a risk get a little implant. This implant acts as a &quot;coach&quot; and keeps you on track. Encourages you study and participate in societal traditions. This implant discourages behavior like drug use or watching too much porn and listening to heavy metal or gangsta rap. Not many people really understand the depths of the technology and it&#39;s constantly being updated, but few ask questions, if they are aware enough to ask questions at all. Violent and otherwise overt physical crime rates have plummeted and not many want the trouble anyhow. If some people are hearing voices or plagued by tormenting thoughts, oh well, at least a huge portion of the people&#39;s tax money isn&#39;t going to keep them fed and housed in a brick and mortar prison. Heck, maybe there are societies where most people don&#39;t really know it&#39;s happening at all. After all, most of the new &quot;inmates&quot; appear to be free and are still contributing to society. They hold menial jobs because they can&#39;t function well enough under the stress of the behavioral modification program to hold any sort of job which would require a higher level of thinking, but they don&#39;t deserve it anyway, now do they. A lot of the inmates will choose to tell people they love that they are suffering from treatable mental disorders like depression or bi-polar disorder or drug addiction, because if they speak the truth, they fear being locked in an asylum and having what little freedom they still have taken from them. All this also serves to save face for the families of the inmates of this new prison, because while it may be difficult to have a loved one who never succeeds or has a mental disorder, it&#39;s certainly less embarrassing than having to admit a loved one is serving time. If the inmate decides to commit further transgressions, like masturbating too much or talking sass back at the program, things just get worse and everyone breaks at some point. If the subjects behavior become really troubling, never fear faithful citizen, the New World Order just hits the terminate button.</p>

<p>Now obviously this scenario is unlikely to see fruition on a massive scale any time soon, I hope. But if someone was suffering from electronic harassment, from a top level mk ultra type program or just some gang bangers who put together an LRAD from radio shack parts and doped the subjects morning coffee with LSD once in awhile, this hypothetical scenario would be quite a mind fuck. Control could tell the subjects some people know and don&#39;t care and laugh at them, like your shrink or the bullies at school. Control could tell you some people know and are to scared to say shit, like your family. If the subject attempts to speak up too much then the family suffers for your sins. Control could tell you your girlfriend or wife knows all about it, and everytime you go to work, control tells you girl where to find a fat chunk of meth or heroin hidden in the garden out back and that a few strapping young lads will be by soon to fuck her into a state of ecstacy the subject can never match. Why would she say no and suffer when she could accept the inevitable and find pleasure beyond her wildest dreams?</p>

<p>Now as implausible as this sounds to the average citizen, if you&#39;ve been hearing crazy voices and more, after awhile, you&#39;re not gonna know how to think your way out of a wet paper bag, let alone an advanced behavioral modification program. Even if you do, what are you stupid? Accept the inevitable for the good of society sinner, otherwise maybe your daughter spends her life getting raped and turned into a drug whore just like your wife.</p>

<p>What does the FBI have to gain from the Russian Boogeyman nonsense? The same thing, they are advancing the agenda of the oligarchy. </p>

<p>Yes, that is the &quot;incompetent not corrupt&quot; narrative. We saw it after 9/11 and in 2008, to obfuscate the fact that our government only serves the wealthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Used to work in the Cincinnati area and knew the manager of the apartment complex that Cornell lived at, shortly after he was arrested the manager told me she thought he was set up because for one she didn&#39;t think he had the mental capacity to pull off such a complex attack on the Capitol and number two he didn&#39;t have the money for weapons and his parents could barely pay their rent , the kid had some part time restaurant job.   And if I remember correctly the FBI worked with the gun dealer to make sure they sold him the weapons, it was a flat out setup</p>
