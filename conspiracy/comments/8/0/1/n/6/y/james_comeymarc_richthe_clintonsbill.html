<p>Putin is selling uranium on the black market that is originating out of Novosibirsk&#39;s chemical plant.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton helped set up Putin&#39;s black market uranium trade.</p>

<p>The powdered uranium is easy to trace.</p>

<p>I hope everyone is finally starting to understand what is going on, here.</p>

<p>VCS mining, Rosatom, Rusoro, either of the two Uranium Ones, Giustras mining concerns in Colombia, etc.</p>

<p>Human trafficking is the common denominator.</p>

I know many here do not care for T_D but if you are interested i posted this there this AM &amp; there are users there that shared additional info.  I feel this implicates both parties - how could the Bush Admin not pursue this if they were not in some way involved or blackmailed.  This could have a web of connections i have not yet uncovered that is of great interest to all.  To anyone here that can offer additional insight please share.</p>

<li><p>I just finished watching the Magnitsky Act: Behind the scenes which is a documentary about the sanctions placed on Russia by the United States - the film is banned in the US/EU but the creators are assisting anyone interested in these areas with accessing it if interested. </p></li>
<li><p>The steps i had to take are strange. It is weird. Never had to do anything like this to watch a film. If you are willing to risk it email this guy &amp; he will give you the instructions - <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/torsteingrude">https://mobile.twitter.com/torsteingrude</a> - it does require you provide whatsapp/sms/few other options for them to send a password to you. You will be given access to the film associated with a watermark throughout the film connected to you. I personally have no regrets. I just watched a movie &amp; they didnt ask for money. If anyone knows another way to watch it without taking these steps feel free to share.</p></li>

But i&#39;ve done my best to provide as many different sources to at least validate some of its claims.  At the end of the day... Browder is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to HSBC... Same can be said for the Clintons.</p>
