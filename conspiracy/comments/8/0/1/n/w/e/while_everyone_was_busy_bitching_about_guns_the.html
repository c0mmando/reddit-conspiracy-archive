    <div class="md"><p>You used the word clarify to completely change your statement from the FCC decision in December to covering nearly a years worth of time and not just the decision itself. Not only does this insinuate that the topic of gun control was never a primary talking point for almost the entirety of 2017, but it also would no longer even pertain to my reply about the fickle nature of general public opinion. Now if you go and look up the definition of the word clarify you may see why the way you used it was indeed interesting. If not let me know and I&#39;ll help you with the reading comprehension.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original statement was that gun control was not a talking point when the FCC decision was made in December. There was no mention of March or how long this has been an issue. My comment about the Vegas shooting was directly related to the decision made in December. I do not disagree with net neutrality having been an issue for a long time, let alone March. Can you truly not see how the statement was not only changed, but then had my original comment compared to it as if it was still applicable for some reason? The large amounts of confusion that you seem to be having really only makes their clarification even more interesting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From an email from Fight For the Future: 
BREAKING NEWS: Yesterday, Ajit Pai’s all-out attack on net neutrality was officially published in the Federal Register.</p>

<p>That means we now have just 60 legislative days to pass a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution in the Senate to block the FCC repeal. The clock is ticking, but the good news is that we just need one more vote to win. That’s how close we are!</p>

<p>So we&#39;re pulling out all the stops. We’re planning:</p>

<p>Operation: #OneMoreVote—a massive online protest with participants like Tumblr, Reddit, and Etsy helping flood the Senate with phone calls, emails, tweets, and meetings.</p>

<p>Simultaneous in-person rallies at key Senate offices across the country.</p>

<p>A new tool to mobilize small businesses to pressure Congress.</p>

<p>And a way for millions of Internet users to easily take action through text messages.</p>

<p>But all of this urgent and mission-critical work—every rally, every new tool, and every call we connect to a member of Congress—costs money, and we’re in danger of coming up short on the funds we need to finish it in time.</p>

<p>You may have read headlines today screaming, “Net neutrality is officially dead!” But that’s not true.</p>

<p>For the moment, net neutrality protections are still in effect. But now that the countdown has started, it’s more urgent than ever that we mobilize a massive public outcry to secure the final vote we need to pass the CRA in the Senate before time runs out.</p>

<p>And the closer we get to winning, the more money Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T are pouring into corrupt lobbying, fake studies, and misleading ads to put the final nail in the Internet’s coffin.</p>

<p>The stakes are high, but we have huge momentum. We need to remind everyone right now why net neutrality is so important. This isn’t just about how fast our videos load, it affects the very fabric of our democracy.</p>

<p>Without net neutrality, giant corporations will have complete control over everything we see and do on the Internet. They’ll decide where we get our news, how we can listen to music, which websites we can visit, and which apps we can use.</p>

<p>More people are talking about net neutrality than ever before, but we need to turn that awareness into effective action that puts real pressure on the members of Congress that matter most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So about that video (I didn&#39;t watch the whole thing but I got the gist) there are a few points that need to be identified as erroneous</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Google, Facebook, and any other content provider have a right to limit their platform how they see fit.  There are alternatives to these.  As such, they are completely in their right to be bias (same as any other network).  Bringing them up is a red herring since they have nothing to do with net neutrality.</p></li>
<li><p>Since we can&#39;t foresee how ISPs are going to utilize this authority, then there is a threat here to freedom of speech.  Unlike the content providers, many people have no alternative to there current ISP.  So IF they decide to block a site there will be no other way to get it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I stopped watching at this point because the bias on the video was clear and I couldn&#39;t stomach anymore.  But there are a few other things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Net neutrality is unneeded if we had a free market... but we don&#39;t and the FCC is making that harder to make a reality through other rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Net neutrality has one fallback: you would have to make ALL content free (even if there was code designed to utilize all the network traffic all the time... Which would be unfair to the ISPs.   But the (former) rules already accounted for this and allowed rational restrictions that were evaluated on a case by case basis.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

And before you say &quot;ad hominem&quot; it is relevant because it reveals where his biases are coming from. His initial criticism of websites not caring about free speech because they have rules on their privately owned platforms so the removed the parts of the neo nazi element leaving him with a personal vendetta against them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t let the term &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; give you the notion that it is good. A true conspiracy theorist should never take things at face value and always look at the men behind the curtain.</p>

<p>I will just say two things made me question it from its inception.  First, the large multibillion dollar corporations that backed NN. Second the historical evidence that a government policy that has a nice reassuring name always has verbiage counter intuitive to what it is supposed to regulate.  </p>

<p>You should draw your own conclusions. If mine is worth anything I would say that it was probably a good thing it was killed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So about that video (I didn&#39;t watch the whole thing but I got the gist) there are a few points that need to be identified as erroneous</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Google, Facebook, and any other content provider have a right to limit their platform how they see fit.  There are alternatives to these.  As such, they are completely in their right to be bias (same as any other network).  Bringing them up is a red herring since they have nothing to do with net neutrality.</p></li>
<li><p>Since we can&#39;t foresee how ISPs are going to utilize this authority, then there is a threat here to freedom of speech.  Unlike the content providers, many people have no alternative to there current ISP.  So IF they decide to block a site there will be no other way to get it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I stopped watching at this point because the bias on the video was clear and I couldn&#39;t stomach anymore.  But there are a few other things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Net neutrality is unneeded if we had a free market... but we don&#39;t and the FCC is making that harder to make a reality through other rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Net neutrality has one fallback: you would have to make ALL content free (even if there was code designed to utilize all the network traffic all the time... Which would be unfair to the ISPs.   But the (former) rules already accounted for this and allowed rational restrictions that were evaluated on a case by case basis.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
