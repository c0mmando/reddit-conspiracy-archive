        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve been noticing a lot of argument about this, and for the life of me I can’t understand why people would be against allowing teachers to arm themselves. I could maybe understand the argument against actually arming them, putting a weapon into the hands of someone who otherwise wouldn’t have one, but allowing a teacher who is already a trained gun owner to carry one with them to work doesn’t make sense to me.</p>

<p>If a teacher wanted to carry out a shooting spree, they can already bring their gun from home. Nothing is currently stopping them.</p>

<p>Why shouldn’t we allow teachers to carry their guns with them to school? What am I missing here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because they are not trained for combat or to take a life if necessary. Teachers are not paid enough and have way too much to worry about. They don&#39;t need the added pressure and responsiblity to potentially take the life of a student if called upon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not suggesting we &quot;arm the teachers&quot;, but presumably some of them are already armed and trained right?</p>

<p>What&#39;s the drawback of allowing them to bring their weapon to school? The only thing I could think of is if a student steals their gun and uses that in their spree.</p>

<p>Or maybe if the teacher is trigger happy and goes into a rampage and decided to shoot some students, but teachers could already do that if they wanted to.</p>

<p>Or maybe the teacher has the gun and some kid is on a killing spree and the teacher could stop it but they&#39;re afraid and then everyone hates them for not taking action.</p>

<p>That&#39;s about it as far as I can see where drawbacks and risks are concerned though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought I was pretty clear, but here goes:</p>

<p>That is allowing teachers who own a weapon and perhaps who hold a concealed carry permit to bring their weapon with them to work (school).</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m suggesting. If you want to call it &quot;arming them&quot; then okay, that&#39;s fine with me.</p>

<p>What are the drawbacks though, aside from what I listed above? As far as I can tell they are drawbacks, but they don&#39;t seem to be prohibitive. They are really non-issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, allowing teachers to bring a gun to school is arming them and those are clearly not non-issues. Again, if necessary, professionals should always handle the job.</p>

<p>On another note, if you really want to stop these shootings, then repeal the Smith-Mundt Act which made it legal for the government to use weaponized propaganda against its own citizens in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t just semantics. They are different concepts. Arming teachers is making it part of their job. Allowing a teacher to be armed voluntarily is a totally different thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which goes back to my point. Teachers are not paid enough and have more than enough responsibilities. You want to train them for combat and taking a life? Now we are arming and training them as a cop. Why not just have an armed officer? Your argument is not very strong as it all boils down to the same principle: arming a teacher and training them for combat whether they are already bringing one with a carry and conceal permit or they are given one by law enforcement. Let the professionals handle the job if necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I want the ones who are already trained to be able to use their training. If that means not many teachers end up carrying guns to school, then so be it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, why put that responsibility on teachers? And how many teachers are trained for combat/taking a life? Knowing how to shoot and doing so against a moving target who is also firing back are two very different things. On top of that is the emotional trauma of having to take the life of a student. It makes no sense to put that on a teacher when there are plenty of officers or even retired military vets who could use a security job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol wow dude this is crazy, you keep misrepresenting my position and at this point I’ve clarified for you multiple times.</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting we put any responsibility on anyone. If a teacher doesn’t own a gun and/or is not trained, nothing would change. For those teachers who do own and are trained, little would change.  They’d simply be able to bring their weapon to school, just like they can bring it anywhere else when they have a concealed carry permit.</p>

<p>No one would be forced or expected to do anything. So you can say “well what if we force or expect this and that”, but I already agree, so it’s a bit pointless to argue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s pretend for a minute that the officer failed at his job instead of actually being told to stand down because an active shooter drill (as reported by numerous students and faculty) was taking place and he had to take a fall because they were caught so he was given early retirement and a full pension for failing at his job due to his &quot;cowardice.&quot; This was an officer who had numerous years of experience and was actually trained for situations such as this and yet failed to do his job.

I don&#39;t want an untrained novice with a gun defending my kids. But we could let them write off the concealed carry and defensive shooting courses in their area maybe? There would be training requirements if this was implemented. The teacher is already going to be huddled up and praying, let it be about them not having to kill someone instead of praying not to die or watch their students die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I believe officers are more than capable. I don&#39;t believe for a second any of the officers at Parkland were cowards. I believe they were told to stand down due to the planned active shooter drills which multiple students/faculty spoke about and are now taking a hit for not doing their job they were told not to do during a false flag event. </p>

<p>My argument is it is more logical if a real school shooting occurs to have a trained officer or security guard on the school 24/7 rather than arming teachers and asking them to go Tom Berenger during an active shooter situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not familiar enough with the drill stuff, and will have to read up on it. </p>

<p>I agree in regards to an on site police officer or armed security guard(s?). But let&#39;s say a teacher at the school has a ccw, and wants to just wear it at work as OP suggests. Liability lawsuits being a real bitch, let&#39;s say they have to be certified by someone, the aforementioned paid security/officer perhaps. </p>

<p>How is that not better than just the cop?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here, I&#39;ll share with you what I shared with another commenter:</p>

<p>&quot;This was already discussed by the OP but here are a few pretty good write-ups:</p>

<p>&quot;What are the chances of an armed, trained, literally-cool-under-fire social studies teacher taking down a gunman? The odds are much higher of an accidental discharge during study period, or a disturbed student disarming the teacher. Worse, we picture an angry teacher on a bad day pulling a gun on a student with an attitude. And if there were a shooter in the hallways? Given the chaos, terror and suddenness of an attack, chances are an armed teacher strikes a bystander, or gets shot mistakenly by law enforcement rather than disarming or disabling the bad guy.</p>

<p>Even contemplating this scenario presupposes that faculty members would enlist. We expect many would reject the idea of being armed. They wouldn’t want the responsibility and see the folly. These are teachers, after all, who recognize the dystopian lesson: Kids, you live in a dangerous world you can never hope to improve through peaceful means. So let’s lock and load.</p>

<p>Teachers and administrators do important work, as do police and other first responders. Let teachers educate children, and leave the protection of civilians to other professionals.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-arm-teachers-guns-schools-20180223-story,amp.html">https://www.google.com/amp/www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-arm-teachers-guns-schools-20180223-story,amp.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;This approach would require us to be placing guns in schools now—guns that could easily be used inappropriately. Don&#39;t for a minute think that a secured gun, stored in a school, would be inaccessible. For a gun to be available for defense, it needs to be accessible. That means it would be accessible to more than just the principal or teacher. This will become an even greater concern should more states pass gun laws that allow people with valid pistol permits to also carry them in schools.</p>

<p>Although in New York state, where I am a principal, it is illegal to bring a gun into a school, more than two dozen states have passed such laws, and seven of those states allow teachers and school staff members to carry guns, according to an NBC report from September. Earlier this month, a 6th grade teacher in Utah wounded herself at school when her handgun, which she was legally carrying, accidentally discharged. An isolated incident, perhaps. But what if a child had been nearby? If more states jump on the bandwagon, more guns will be in schools and accessible to more than just the legal user.&quot;</p>

<p>Countless law enforcement and school safety experts believe schools that arm their staff are inviting an unacceptable level of risk. Guns could be secured by students, or a manageable situation could easily turn deadly, for example. Proponents argue that staff would undergo extensive training to avoid these kinds of incidents, but critics respond that educators aren’t in school to be armed guards and no amount of training is going to change that.</p>

<p>“Suggesting that by providing staff with 8, 16, 40, or even 60 hours of firearms training on firing, handling, and holstering a gun somehow makes a non-law enforcement officer suddenly qualified to provide public safety services is a high-risk to the safety of students, teachers, and other school staff,” said Ken Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services.</p>

<p>The potential for an accident or a misjudgment was an overriding concern at a recent hearing in northern Idaho where a local school board is considering a measure to arm school staff. Social Studies teacher Tyler Haynes told the board that one bad decision or impulse by a member of the staff could easily result in an unnecessary injury or death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Armed teachers, not an army of teachings. One concept implies buying guns, training teachers, supplying guns, and ammo. The other is letting teachers who have conceal and carry licenses carry on site, all of which the teachers would have to seek out on their. More of permission to carry, not a mandate to carry. The difference is incredibly vast and thus not semantics in any way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One armed guard, on school duty which isnt super highly prioritized. And if you wanna get into parkland what do you know about that counties complicity between the educational branch and law enforcement to lay low in schools. Also, that cop didnt follow protocol, not all schools have an officer. Also dont act like police training isnt an issue. Or the effect a school officer interacted with adol scent minds all day. Theres no neat package here that sells either concept. And if youd been paying attention and havijng a conversation insead of looking for agreement with your statement, you would feel differently(also not for you, for those reading(FTR))</p>

That&#39;s just not how teachers are built.  </p>

<p>To be honest, if the 2nd amendment allows me to concealed carry, with proper training and certification, pretty much anywhere but my job, but my job has been a hotbed of mass killing or could be the victim of a copycat, it seems to be pretty unfair that to be able to do my job, I have to give up my personal right to self defense.  Do I not have children that I want to go home to as well?  If a shooter walked in to wal-mart and I was carrying and I took him down, people would be yelling that I saved lives and how good it was that a good guy with a gun was there, but now I&#39;m at my job and am not allowed to do the same?

<p>Yeah, which is why adequate training would be necessary. But I don&#39;t think many teachers could/would be able to handle a gun in high-pressure situations. That&#39;s the kind of training we&#39;d need. Not just your basic handgun safety course. </p>

<p>Never mind the idea of some teacher having to confront and shoot some armed student turned killer when there&#39;s just as much of a likelihood of a teacher shooting one that isn&#39;t but that&#39;s tried their patience just one too many times or wigging-out and going on a shooting rampage in a classroom themselves. </p>

<p>There is no good argument against this.  When shit goes down, who do we call?  We&#39;ve all heard the saying, &quot;When seconds count, police are minutes away.&quot;  It&#39;s true.  With that said, there should be stringent requirements for teachers to be able to carry on campus.  They should be required to train with local first responders for tactical, stress conditioning, and IFF purposes, and it should be done on a volunteer basis.  Another thing that should be done is to require guarded, single point entrance.  This would stop school shootings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s many:</p>

<p>First, it&#39;d be expensive, and the same politicians calling for it tend to be the ones who don&#39;t want the government to pay for school supplies.  </p>

<p>Second, it&#39;s unlikely to be effective: there was an armed guard at Parkland who didn&#39;t stop the shooting, and there have been 10,000+ armed guards hired since Columbine, none of whom have stopped a shooting, despite having better training and fewer distractions than teachers would.  </p>

<p>Third, it&#39;d likely cause new casualties, as tempers, mental health issues, and the mass chaos that dozens of children tend to cause would create numerous opportunities for unintended discharges and gun theft.  </p>

<p>Fourth, it&#39;d likely just be a corrupt payday for whatever company made the guns or hired the guards.  </p>

<p>Fifth, its implementation would almost certainly worsen racial inequality.  The thousands of guards hired since Columbine (who haven&#39;t stopped shootings) have arrested tens of thousands of predominantly non-white students, and there are innumerable cases of even well trained armed officers shooting black people without consequence, including at least one high profile legally armed teacher (Philando Castille, whose death, btw, was not acknowledged or protested in the slightest by the NRA shills now pushing to arm teachers like him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990,  It was not  uncommon for at least one or more  teachers in the  school to  have firearms, in fact several coaches and  students commonly  had  hunting rifles in their  trucks when I  was in high school.   Statistically speaking,  fewer shootings happened on school property before that law, than after it.   It  should also be noted,  none of the  shootings prior to 1990 where carried out by  an educator. </p>

<p>I disagree that there would be  a  great expense to this proposition.  Allowing a school employee ( not necessarily a  teacher)  already licensed as CHL  or equivalent to carry on  school grounds would  likely cost nothing in many rural districts  where there is  likely  already someone willing to do so.   If a  district  had no such people then I see some  cost to the  district.  As someone who has served on a  school board, I disagree that  budgets could not be  adjusted to compensate.    </p>

I am all for stricter controls on who can purchase or continue to own weapons. I think there’s a false equivalency here though where people take my suggestion as implying “more guns” when that isn’t really the case. </p>

<p>We already have far too many guns, only right now we’re in a situation where it’s mostly the bad guys walking around with them. I’m not suggesting we ask for the good guys to buy more guns, but that we allow those who own them and are trained in their use to... use them for their intended purpose, which is to protect.</p>

<p>And I see this as something they would never need to use unless there is literally a student in the classroom with a gun, ya know?</p>

<p>So the biggest risk is they have the gun and try to stop the student and harm someone else in the process. This is probably the main reason.</p>

<p>And no, I’m not asking for anyone to be put into a position. People already put themselves in this position, no one is forced to.</p>
