All I see on Facebook/IG are memes from both the left and right using gross simplification of complex and impactful issues.  They for the most part leave little room for discussion and become serious talking points that most of the population willingly and religiously regurgitate as fact.  </p>

<p>I see so many friends and acquaintances being heavily influenced by the constant streams of memes.  They are heavily polarizing and seriously simplify these issues.  I don‚Äôt see any discussion anymore is just attacks and blaming and zero productive answers from either the right or left.  </p>

<p>I know this isn‚Äôt a big huge conspiracy, but it‚Äôs crazy how memes have influenced people and left them incapable of critical thought and discussion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they are two separate issues. A meme can convey things that words can‚Äôt. Language is direct and to try and have a conversation (not saying it‚Äôs bad obviously) you have to use words to pull yourself towards a meaning and still maybe never get there. Memes encompass a different type of language that can convey something more eloquently, but there‚Äôs that room (just like art) where the user/seer can have that same idea, but have it draw from each persons own unique experiences so it goes a little deeper. 
Listened to a podcast with an expert in hieroglyphics speaking in this manner and it changed my entire outlook on memes. 
Of course, subject matters. </p>

<p>So true, and i&#39;m guilty of it. I just bought a lathe, and the old man gave me an encyclopedia of machining. These books have so much detail and knowledge in them I could literally know everything, but instead I search youtube for &quot;how to grind lathe bits&quot; and basically only learn 1% of the info.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most &quot;news&quot; is truncated into meme-sized format now too. People get the headline or tweet and run with it at face value and take it as fact, regardless if the article explaining the headline might actually contradict said headline.</p>

<p>Take the &quot;shithole&quot; comment from a few weeks back. It was alleged that Trump said &quot;people come here from shithole countries&quot; in a closed door meeting. Then that one line was plastered all over the internet and people accused Trump of racism and many launched online campaigns to refute his alleged statement and decry his supposed racism. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/trump-say-immigration-meeting/">Nevermind</a> that his comment was never said on record, the only person who says he said it that way was Dick Durbin (the only Democrat in the meeting), and his comment was apparently about the state of the countries, not a race or ethnicity being bad. But, when you just take the 140 characters (well, more now) as your news, it works really well to divide and conquer the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here.  While memes can be mildly entertaining, it&#39;s frightening how so many people treat them as fact when in actuality they are nothing more that suggestive propaganda.  I too have been bothered by this shit for quite some time.   If you think about it, perhaps it&#39;s the perfect way to keep us divided by compartmentaizing issues that are far beyond black and white.  The general lack of attention span in our various cultures is being taken advantage of.  In my opinion, it&#39;s all part of a much darker picture to undermine critical thinking in order to keep the populace engaged in conflict.   Shit is only going to get darker from here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Rampant extremism is the perfect recipe for perpetual conflict.  Everyone stays distracted and unable organizing against the &quot;one true enemy.&quot; This really is the great &quot;dumbing down&quot;.  Shit is especially scary because most of us are falling for it hook line and sinker.  Disinformation is king.  You create a society of cushy conveniences and people will eventually want to remain content.  Give them digital forums and social media to get their poisons out while effectively creating echo chambers for them and all their friends.  Everyone becomes stuck in microcosms of ignorance, hate and resentment.  Stir the pot with memes and engineered news then before you know it, after everyone is dumbed down to grotesque levels of stupid, it all becomes our undoing.

    <div class="md"><p>See, and I think memes can be used in such a way as to get real points across very quickly.  People out there get the arguments being made but as people are, don&#39;t want to hear the argument itself.  In some more specialized cases, they can be quite efficient in getting a point across.  I can see how that can be a negative thing but at the same time memes are or can be a way of communicating very efficiently.  </p>

<p>As what is posted above, I agree that police won&#39;t and cannot be there to protect you as personal body guards.  No one should expect such a foolish thing.  Thus, the argument is ridiculous to say that if you turn in your guns, your responsibility to protecting yourself is rightly in the hands of the local police.  Memes such as this instantly get that point across.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sold on the idea that memes reduce us somehow.  If you post a meme and someone challenges you, then you should be ready to step up with more than just a picture.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing that Universities should accept memes from their students as equivalent to year end masters papers but here on the &quot;internets&quot;, it&#39;s about efficiency and speed in getting information across.  Sometimes it works well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely agree with this. I&#39;m not a huge conspiracy person, though I tend to read through them because a lot of conspiracies are quite interesting.<br/>
I do agree that the spreading of memes seems to be out of control and the internet is absolutely saturated with them, but now it&#39;s even leaking into real life.<br/>
I have seen it myself with my two brothers, one of which lives and breathes memes, everything he says or does has to be related to some kind of meme. And it&#39;s gotten to the point where I do agree that people nowadays, even those that don&#39;t meme, are affected by the oversimplification of many things. I&#39;m not politic savvy, so I won&#39;t even try, but I know that a lot of things that are both horrible to say or do are made acceptable as long as it&#39;s under the preface of being a meme. And people laugh about it, make jokes, and spread it.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s funny because i find the (ex)establishment sucks big time at producing memes, but they are experts at crafting walls of meaningless texts that sound intelligent but really are just a steaming pile of fallacies... the (somewhat) new establishment rode memes to victory successfully but have since lost much of their spicyness.</p>

<p>I actually think it&#39;s the opposite, meme are the pinnacle of intelligent thought, which is why shills have such a hard time with them... they are the maximum amount of information in a very small medium, often with humor and wit, and for this they have become the most appealing and efficient form of information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a really good and thought-provoking post. I have this odd feeling that has been bubbling in my head for a few months that Americans have become irreparably broken, but I can‚Äôt define it exactly or say exactly how we are broken. I mean this in more than a sense of everything was awesome in ‚Äúthe good old days and now it‚Äôs gone to shit‚Äù. </p>

<p>I can see bits and pieces of it, like: </p>

<p>-the social media echo chambers on both sides that promote extreme you‚Äôre-either-with-me-or-I hate-everything-you-stand-for-ism, </p>

<p>-the weirdly obstinate way large bunches of people cling to certain ideas of how to make things better (build a literal wall around the border, ban AR-15s but ignore literally every other similar kind of gun, etc.) ‚Äîwhen those ideas are either obviously unworkable or only really work for one ‚Äúside‚Äù, and if you try to question the idea you‚Äôre immediately banned from participation in the conversation </p>

<p>-the way people go into attack mode immediately if you ask them a question about their ideas or ask for details,</p>

<p>-extreme dismissal of contrary opinions based on dogma (I.e., You‚Äôre wrong because: science! Or you‚Äôre wrong because: liberals!)</p>

<p>-A weird obsession with bringing people to extreme justice for relatively minor infractions (She lost her shit about sitting near a baby on an airplane, she should lose her job!). </p>

<p>I could go on...</p>

<p>I really think meme culture fits into it somehow.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=1792s&amp;amp;v=aaG23Zv_-_8">https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=1792s&amp;amp;v=aaG23Zv_-_8</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve had an ongoing theory about how people are essentially &quot;turning&quot; into the troll. What starts off as an edgy 4chan esque racial slur pro trump supporting joke snowballs into the individual actually believing what they are saying. I&#39;m kinda buzzed right now so maybe it doesn&#39;t make sense or I&#39;m being too vague but basically our up and coming generations are being dumbed down Idiocracy style. Scary shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree strongly. You want serious discussion, yeah, everybody wants that. But perhaps you have noticed that this serious discussion has been banished completely from the mainstream media. There&#39;s only a discussion within a set of &quot;allowed&quot; opinions. How can you get your voice heard if you are never allowed to step up to the podium and speak? What if all you can do is shout something from the back row? Memes are those back row shouts. They condense a complex thought into a single punch.</p>

<p>heavily influenced by the constant streams of memes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stremes.</p>

<p>Call it streaming thought. Except you&#39;re not really thinking anymore because a meme is an idea. So what people do is learn ideas by being exposed to the continual flow of memes.</p>

<p>A few people will consider a meme from more than one angle. But the average (weak-minded) person will tend to catch the idea and enjoy the entertaining and clever way in which that idea was presented to them.</p>

<p>Their mind then comes into resonance with the idea because they&#39;ve been distracted by the emotion of enjoyment.</p>

<p>A meme cuts both ways though. It can be a bit of truth/wisdom, or it can be a piece of crap. Which is why you need to think about the idea contained in a meme... and decide for yourself which it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm telling you guys. </p>

<p>If we just deleted <em>comments</em> as a whole from social media, humans might start thinking more.  </p>

<p>The ability to comment on everything on social media does nothing but create chatter amongst the masses with nothing to come of it. It‚Äôs brainwashed people into thinking that simply spewing their short formed opinions is considered enough for legit discussion and only search out other comments they agree with. </p>

<p>This results in nothing being done.</p>

<p>(I don‚Äôt mean forum talk)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree- and Im reposting my response from a similar thread, if you don&#39;t mind--</p>

<p>I was also thinking this about memes and the true but ignored potential of the Internet last night: </p>

<p>We have devices in our homes and pockets that can answer any (non-hypothetical) question a person could have. There are classes and videos by dedicated people that can teach you anything you&#39;d like to learn. There&#39;s limitless inspiration and making new friends and alliances has never been easier-</p>

<p>Yet we use the Internet for chuckles and entertainment, dank memes, dividing ourselves into subgroups and angry tribes. Language is devolving to meme speak, like -&quot;when you be ________ but you also ________&quot; - and kids don&#39;t even have the proper language Or interest to seek out the millennia of information, art and science that is stored at their fingertips.</p>

<p>The Internet, and most people, have successfully been subverted of their potential.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m trying to change my own distracted usage of the Internet- I want to learn. I want to improve myself and my slice of the world. I&#39;m tired of just browsing life.</p>
