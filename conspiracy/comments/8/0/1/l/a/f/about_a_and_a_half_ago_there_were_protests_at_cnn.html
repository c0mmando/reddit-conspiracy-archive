        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So first let&#39;s just start with some basic reminders:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Being anti CNN does not mean being a Trump supporter.</p></li>
<li><p>Criticising left does not mean far right.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a conspiracy sub, we talk about conspiracies, sometimes we over reach, but the true users here want access to true information. </p></li>
<li><p>Believing in certain conspiracies doesn&#39;t mean that person believes in every single whack job conspiracy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now that we got that out of the way... I really can&#39;t tell anymore. I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s paid shills, or the effects of shilling/outrage culture has warped people perspective. This used to be a place that understood that the enemy is up top, not left or right. The amount of people throwing people to the other side over minor disagreements is astonishing. Again, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s manufactured division, or the result of over exposire to manufactured division. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s what I have to say to the brigaders and the left wing crusaders. I honestly hope, for your sake that your shills. I hope for the countries sake that&#39;s all it is. Because if these are genuine reactions it troubles me. So many of you, just 1 year ago shared similar views to the ones you are bashing. What the he&#39;ll happened to your fight the power mentality? So many of you made a complete 180 from just a few simple headlines. If you are not shills, then congrats, you&#39;ve let them turn you into the info/speech silencing aggressors you&#39;ve constantly claimed to be against. I hope you&#39;re fucking shills, because if people can truly be manipulated this hard, then I&#39;m losing faith in the battle. </p>

<p>I was at the west coast protests.  We got burnt out after a year or so</p>

<p>Obama actually reduced our war footprint by ending Iraq (100,000 to 5,000) and reducing Afghanistan to below 10,000 (from 130,000).  Not sure what point you were going for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More troops did not die under Obama than Bush and anyone with even a rough idea of American history since 9/11 would know that.</p>

<p>According to iCasualties.org <a href="http://icasualties.org/">4,856 American soldiers were killed while Bush was in office</a>, as opposed to just <a href="http://icasualties.org/">2052 soldiers killed</a> while Obama was president. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t agree with many of Obama&#39;s policies, but to say that more soldiers died under his administration than W&#39;s is simply absurd.</p>

<p>I mean W was the one that originally <em>sent</em> hundreds of thousands of Americans off to go fight in Iraq, not Obama, so obviously the lion&#39;s share of casualties also occurred then. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not rewrite history here. </p>

<p>Oh you poor babies. That must have been very hard on you standing around holding signs on and off for what? Over a year? </p>

<p>There is a lot more than 10k soldiers in afghanistan. And were you protesting the numbers in country or the suffering caused? Because Obama launched more drone strikes and had other wars going on too. I bet you havent been to 1 protest over yemen. </p>

<p>The main focus of the anti-war protests was really anti-republican protests in disguise. As soon as a black guy gets into office that shut up 99 percent of that shit. Or as you called it, &quot;burnt out&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CNN fanboys have been more active here since that one guy made a gif showing CNN getting slammed in wrestling. CNN actually got so butt hurt, they actually dug&#39;d through his post history to find a way to discredit him to help their sensitive image (They were going to doxx him if he didn&#39;t confess his sins).</p>

<p>So this sub reacts by stating that CNN will not be linked directly, in order to remove some ad revenue. And what do the CNN fanboys do? Cry... Just crying censorship. Crying about how this place is T_D 2.0 (despite CNN articles could still be posted through an archive). The CNN narrative was still, if not more, dominant in the comment section.</p>

<p>Any other subreddit would have gotten a pass with the CNN trolling; but when <a href="/r/conspiacy">/r/conspiacy</a> starts getting a hard on for the MSN narrative... That raises some red flags. </p>

<p>The commenters here started becoming masochists, with top post hating on the entire subreddit and users. Because thats normal for a subreddit to just suddenly do.</p>

<p>tl:dr <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has always questioned the MSN narrative; not endorse and love it overnight. And this subreddit actually did something that could cut into CNN&#39;s revenue (something that could have snowball&#39;d). They&#39;ve been trolling here ever since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s perfectly reasonable for them to call out unsubstantiated claims. Lies should <strong>always</strong> be identified as such. Otherwise they spread and convince impressionable people.</p>

<p>You clearly don&#39;t understand how burden-of-proof works, so lets explore. What evidence could hypothetically be provided to prove OP&#39;s statement wrong?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not moving the goalposts. Ive said that both are reasonable. OPs post is <em>irrefutably</em> unsubstantiated and <em>probably</em> bullshit.</p>

<p>You are probably correct. I never said I believed the OP. My entire point was centred around me thinking there is no need to call him a liar unless you can prove him wrong. His statement comes from a weak position with no evidence, why get down and fight about the validity, unless you actually have your own evidence that PROVES he is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m probably not the best person to talk about this shit because I have gotten a bit partisan the past couple of months, but I still want to voice my opinion. For nearly a decade I just simply didn&#39;t follow politics whatsoever. And CNN was my jam. Yeah they were a little left leaning, but they didn&#39;t only cover politics. If there was some kind of event in the world, and earthquake, a shooting, whatever, they were right there covering it better than anyone else. They used to cover things aside from politics, that&#39;s why I&#39;d tune in. But they really did change their game during the 2016 elections.</p>

<p>We have them on at work, so I probably see a good 30-40 hours of their programming a week. Not that I&#39;m listening to it, but I see the taglines, I&#39;m aware of what they are discussing. And it&#39;s been Trump non-stop for close to 2 years now. Trump, Trump, Trump. None of it&#39;s even remotely positive. They have a very clear agenda in my eyes. And it&#39;s disappointing that we no longer have a news network that covers things aside from politics and Trump in particular. I think their ratings are fairly indicative that I&#39;m not alone in this line of thought. It is what it is. Maybe they&#39;ll figure it out. But my guess is that won&#39;t happen until Trump&#39;s outta office.</p>
