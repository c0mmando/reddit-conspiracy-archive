       Let me preface this by stating I hardly use any social media. It creeps me out so I only use Facebook, because I am required to manage the club at my college I am president of, and Instagram because of my photography freelance work. I would ditch even these if i could. Also worth noting I'm rather careful with what my apps have permission to use.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first time this happened I had a long conversation with my Dad one night about different colleges and options for my future. My phone had been sitting next to me, unused for the duration of this conversation. Afterwards I pulled up Instagram only to see an advertisement for one college my dad had kept bringing up throughout the night.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second time I noticed this was after a phone call with my dad. We had been discussing an upcoming project we are planning, a digital night vision system, and discussed how we also needed a helmet to mount it on. After the phone call and again on Instagram I saw an advertisement for a guy using an armored helmet with night vision mounted on it. The ad was specifically for the helmet, which is also the one part we haven't ordered yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to share not only to see others thoughts but also to perhaps bring some more awareness to how far Big Brother actually reaches. It is far outside just the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: My phone listened into "private" conversations and displayed targeted ads to me.

       Using android version 7.0
I figured that the government was listening in for sure, I just did not expect so much of the private sector was as well, and to use it so blatantly. Although the government and private sector are in bed together so it does make sense. Just a shock at first I suppose

       I have an android as well. Settings/privacy and emergency/app permissions/microphone will let you see which apps are using it. Mine showed 9 apps were using the mic, including FB messenger, a couple of games and even the memopad.

       iPhone all but admits that they listen to you, with the “listen for ‘Hey Siri’” option. There’s only one way it can listen out for that - it needs to be listening all the time. And it’s on default. You can turn it off but if there’s no way to turn it off via the hardware, you should assume that it’s listening to you all the time.

       If you used the same email as the one you have on your iPhone’s Mail app, it would have synced up with your iPhone’s calendar and created a reminder. My iPhone puts reminders for delivery dates when I receive confirmation emails from Amazon all the time. It’s a feature that can be disabled.

       Similarly discussed a specific product while logged in to Reddit, e.g. computer monitor with particular specs. Ads appeared on reddit for "monitors with those particular specs" every 10 posts.

      <p>
       When discussed with somebody else they asked "are you sure you didn't type it in?" Psyop successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, saying "I already bought the monitor" removed the ads.

       I have a home phone.

      <p>
       Something I've noticed lately are programs that ask for a cell phone # to text a verification code to. I normally do that with a friend around so I can have it sent to their phones.

       Actually, I noticed last time I was trying to buy tickets to a hockey game they would not send you tickets. The tickets were sent electronically and weren't valid if printed. I thought "well what good is that?", and someone told me you pull it up on your smart phone and they scan it at the enterence. What a stupid concept.

       Plane tickets are like that too now. They still print boarding passes if you want them but most people show their boarding pass on the phone and that’s what gets scanned.

       Many options:
      </p>
      <p>
       Switch to web wrappers and disable or uninstall the main app (tin foil, carbon, slim social, many others)
      </p>
      <p>
       Use desktop site only
      </p>
      <p>
       If your phone is rooted, install app ops and disable camera and microphone access
      </p>
      <p>
       I only let my camera app have camera access. No apps have microphone avvess, not even my keyboard since I'd rather privacy than text to speech.

       Doesn't surprise me. If someone else you live with or a friend you know doesn't go bonkers with security they'll still be able to track conversations you have with them/near them without any issue. We just muddy our statistics by having our account signed in to an old Android phone running through a vpn and constantly listening to the local news.

       I doubt it. This is one of those things that so many people swear blind is happening but not one has shown any evidence that it's going on (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0SOxb_Lfps">
        this cut, cut, cut video isn't evidence
       </a>
       ). It's the kind of thing that security researchers would be all over and would have exposed in no time at all. It would be very easy to see this going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to experiment yourself then buy a prepaid Android phone that you can root and install something to monitor which apps activate the mic. Don't enter any of your details or use WiFi with it of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could also revoke all mic permissions from apps on your current phone, but then you may be bias against noting coincidences.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this isn't to say that it's not possible. Although it would take some serious malware to deliver its own ads across different apps. Data mining is something that intelligence agencies and legit companies like to do, those who write malware that isn't aimed at intelligence gathering aren't in a position to run tailored and targetted ads in the first place.
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/media/alphonso-app-tracking.html">
        But aside from the odd bit of spyware some apps have been caught listening in to collect viewing data.

       I don't have the Facebook app installed. Day before yesterday I was discussing the NRA out loud near my phone and now any Google linked ad service including YouTube is throwing me NRA and gun ads, whereas I've never gotten one in my life. Have had various android smartphones since 2008.

       I’m guessing that they just use really sophisticated algorithms to decipher your search history and predict what you’re going to buy. Facebook can also track your movements and use the places you visit to target ads to you.

       Funny thing is, I'm not subscribed to this website. And I get emails from Quora featuring questions that other people have asked regarding similar topics.

       I've had a similar experience to OP. I deleted Facebook years ago because it's evil and needs to be stopped. I use Instagram for memes and to post some of my artwork, but never geotag or post photos of my face. Lately, I've been seeing ads in my Instagram feed about things I'd discussed with friends in person, but never over the phone (eg travel plans to Philippines and then a host of Filipino ads). I think I'm gonna have to delete Instagram

       Did you use the Wifi at your dad's house?  Had he been searching for schools?
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't need to listen to know what you are up to; if you share wifi or have location turned on then they know where you are and who you are with, and extrapolate what to advertise to you based on what your "friends" like.

       Talk to it. Freak it out. You know that it's listening to you, so let it know that you know so it knows that you know. Might as well freak it out as much as it freaks you out.

       this has been happening to everyone regarding their social media traffic for at least a solid year n a half now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, moving forward, be subtle with how you try to explain this creepy shit to normal folks. A lot of people don’t want to ever think this is possible so they get aggressive with you very fast which can cause you to not seek more truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t trust the people that think this isn’t real.

       I will always be sceptical of this for one reason.. there are a lot of hackers out there, a lot of people who reverse engineer apps - sometimes to hopefully find stuff like this and break news. If this were something that was happened, IMO people would have found the code, or packets, or some sort of evidence of this. But I don't think there is. In theory if a phone was monitored 24/7 and the network was inspected, something would come up. Even if it were encrypted packets. The data has to be sent. But I want to believe, I think I see ads for items that I don't think I have searched online.

       p.s. all these comments talking about "Facebook" or "instagram" like literally any app couldn't do this with the right permissions. Who would give up all of this data? Always assume your data is being sucked up, because it can be used to create accurate predictive models to generate profit. That's why data is digital "oil."

       Yep same here. It’s happened to me several times. Most recently I was talking to my girlfriend about Disney world. Showed up on my Instagram feed the following week. Maybe a fluke.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most obvious one was that at work I was talking about the Dyson hair dryer with two ladies.  I am a guy, I have never ever searched for a hair dryer, definitely not a Dyson one. TEN minute later it showed up on my Instagram feed.

       You can disable the microphone and camera on your phone if you're worried about this kind of spying. Some electrical tape over both should do it, although then you'd have to plug in headphones or use bluetooth to actually make/receive calls.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, I think we're basically to the point where people just accept that this happens even though the companies don't generally admit to it and we lack absolute concrete proof of it.
