       The sphinx is one of the world's bigest enigmas. Why was it built? When was it built? Who built it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Egyptologists link the sphinx to Khafre, giving it the same age as the great Pyramid, around 2580 BC. But we can all agree that Egyptologists have their own agenda and act very secretively. They don't encourage more research on the Pyramids or the Sphinx. Most of the times they don't even allow it. 
Zahi Hawass is head of the egyptologist and he defenitely is a weirdo, who is not open for discussion:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/8Ziu2ygE_Wc">
        https://youtu.be/8Ziu2ygE_Wc
       </a>
       He did not even know about Gobekli tepe and does not believe in radar:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/q4NnCAZcxHg">
        https://youtu.be/q4NnCAZcxHg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, there are more theories about the age of the Sphinx. I know some of you have read Graham Hancock's books and know about the water erosion theory. 
Water erosion theory according to Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <p>
       "From his investigation of the enclosure's geology, Schoch concluded the main type of weathering evident on the Sphinx enclosure walls was caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall.[1] According to Schoch, the area has experienced a mean annual rainfall of approximately one inch (2.5 cm) since the Old Kingdom (c. 2686 – 2134 BC), such that, since Egypt's last period of significant rainfall ended between the late fourth and early 3rd millennium BC,[6] the Sphinx's construction must date to the 6th or 5th millennium BC.[7][8][9]"
      </p>
      <p>
       The last part of the text from wikipedia states that the construction MUST date to the 6th or 5th millennium BC. This is however not true, because it means that the Sphinx is AT LEAST more than 8000 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Graham Hancock and John Anthony West theorize the Sphinx was built around 10.500 BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the questions, why was it built? 
Egyptologist say it is a depiction of Pharaoh Khafre. However, Bauval and Graham Hancock theorize that the Sphinx's lion-shape is a reference to the constellation of Leo, because they think the Sphinx was built around 10,500 BC. The sun was in the constellation of Leo at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet another question we cannot answer for sure..
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it might be fun to discuss this strange structure. Who built it and why? When was it built?It is said that there might be a chamber inside of the Sphinx. What could be in there?

       Pretty sure that's not an organic opinion that people actually have; it's a forced meme spread by shills to discourage watching him because he's an impartial host who has a lot of dissident guests.

      <p>
       Outside of people who straight-up rant about shit (which does nobody any favours and won't convince anybody who isn't already in line with you) Rogan has gotta be the least sell-outy podcast I know.

       Also, where was it built? There's no evidence that the Sphinx was actually built where it sits today. Given the ancients' aptitude in moving large stones, it would have been quite plausible for them to have built it elsewhere and then moved it into place.

       Zahi Hawass is an obvious gatekeeper.   Why are there unexplored tunnels still to this day below the Sphinx?  He denied them for years, then just switched to 'nothing to see here'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also disappointing is there was something stolen opposite the boat they found underneath it on the other side.  The two caverns were discovered and someone cleaned one out right away in an overnight thievery.

       I think this is disinfo. I almost bought it myself, but the rock is too soft to have an anubis/jackal head in the Egyptian proportions. Also jackals face the other way :)

      <p>
       It may be too soft now, hence the laughable "restoration". But, back when it was originally done, the material could've been different or the was reinforcement. The proportions make perfect sense. It wasn't a lion, it clearly was a dog. The paws say it all.

       They are images of the lion. If you look close you see squiggly trails emerging, like a lion's mane, among other oddities.

       It wasn't a lion. It was a jackal -- Anubis -- representing the Dog-star, Sirius. Sirius is our Sun's binary star. Their spiral orbit around each other as they both orbit the galaxy is responsible for the Great Year, as evidenced by the precession of the equinoxes. This is one of the very biggest secrets out there.

       I'm hypothesizing that the Sphinx, as many other ancient megalithic structures on Earth, 
was built by an earlier pre-diluvian advanced
civilization. It is very much open for discussion whether this earlier 
civilization had some external origins. As of late, I'm entertaining
the thought that this civilization might have been like the 
one described by Aldous Huxley in his book; "Brave New World," i.e.
they were living in an advanced utopian society. It can be argued that this civilization was global. The reference of Atlantis certainly is relevant.
This civilization may have destroyed itself by misusage of their
technology. Their 'order' got corrupted over time and resulted in a large 
scale conflict. A thermonuclear war is definitely a possibility. To make things worse 
this caused great cataclysms on Earth; a Pole shift is suggested, which hurled the human species
into an extinction level event. Another, yet again, external theory involves a 'rogue' body/planet, 
maybe even a 2nd Sun; as many other constellations do feature binary stars, 
the theory holds that there is a rogue body inside our solar
system which makes a very long elliptical orbit around the Sun, some have claimed
3600 years, others claim the time it takes way longer. As this
body makes its fly-by through our solar system, it could affect the planets gravitational
pulls and could cause serious cataclysms and upheavals on Earth.
If this 'body' has always been in our solar system or got 'pulled in' in some distant past, 
is also up for debate. Bode's Law holds that there 'should' be a planet between Mars and Jupiter, 
the area where we now find the Asteroid belt. After the supposed last Ice Age, the human species
re-emerged and got 'rebooted.' The place where they converged and rebuilt civilization was the area of the Middle-East.

       Yes, they aren't mutually exclusive. I would have to make a slight adjustment in the text to make this clear. I do speculate an old af (pre-dilluvian) civ built structures all over the world. After cataclysmic events, whether anthropomorphic or external or both,  the survivors converged in the Middle-East and restarted civilization there. This 'rebooted' civilization, having much lost of their technology and knowledge, just refurbished these structures that were already in place. Many other cultures all over the world do tell the story how their megalithic structures were already in place, that they were 'built by the Gods.'
      </p>
      <p>
       I also note that there might have been a 'break-away' civilization that avoided these cataclysms whether by taking refuge into the Earth, or by going into space. Who then, when the Earth was stabilized, went down/came out of the Earth and were seen and venerated by the survivors as 'Gods.' They then jumpstarted civilization with the goal of advancing human civilization to the point where they could recover their lost technology. This point being not so far off from the present day advancements.

       On why it was built, we can speculate for hours. We have the notion that these
structures line up with celestial constellations (thousands of years ago that is,) as the pyramids seem to
line up with the Belt of Orion, as does the Sphinx with Leo. Other structures like Angkor Wat also seem to allign
with the constellation of Draco, as Graham Hancock suggests. There is belief that the 'Hall of Records' might
be under the sphinx, or somewhere in the area of the Gizeh Plateau; ground penetrating radar has 
shown there are some huge structures underneath the sand.

       Here you can see a rare picture of a 'hatch' on top of the head of the Sphinx.

       Imo sphinx = lion = Leo = Rothschild crest.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were endowed with whatever knowledge is hidden in pyramids and left to rule over us by a more advanced society and/or aliens...that's why their shield matches the sphinx.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Explains why Rockefellers (i.e Rothschilds) dominated the globe with fossil fuel oligarchy and then infiltrated all western education to assure that we would move into the future still dependent on oil (instead of understanding how pyramid technology can generate "free energy")...it keeps central banking viable, and keeps our species as a whole under the control of dependency on money and non-renewable energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all comes together if you look at the research that talks about ancient African gold mines. Whatever free energy tech that existed seems to be highly dependent upon monatomic gold and/or superconductive material that is theorized to exist in the ark of the covenant. It also makes sense why Tesla's work was all burned by arson, that info can't be allowed to proliferate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans were genetically engineered for slave labor by a higher species ("aliens") from the most advanced primates on earth at the time (as shown in the "genetic disk" which zachariah sitchin talks about) for the purpose of mining gold to help the higher species with whatever goal they had...then at some point they left earth after getting what they needed, leaving a small group of people (Rothschild dynasty) to control our species as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes the tale from bible/torah of moses escaping Egypt with the ark make lots of sense...they escaped with the key superconducting piece of the pyramid, and now that technology is "lost"/hidden...because if it were available, there would be no means to control us with banking/oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       That may sound crazy...but when you consider how humans are the only species that seem unable to live in harmony with the rest of the planet...it sort of makes sense that we were artificially engineered to be here, and then left to our own devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes sense why there seems to be such a mountain of evidence regarding a small group of people controlling human progress through the ages...and why we still have no missing link in conventional evolutionary theory...maybe because there isn't one, and we aren't a natural part of evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably crazy...but just how I view the whole pyramid thing

       Michael Tellinger has alot of information on the African continent.
He talks about millions of old ruins, that seem like they were harvesting the 'energy' of the Earth through the usage of a specific stone, and a specific lay-out. But I'm sure you are aware of his work.

       The best explanation is that it was origially a statue of Anubis, the head got damaged and what remained repurposed/resculpted as human head. Here is short article with pictures. Recommennd reading it.

       The only thing I know about the sphinx is that it is composed of a man/angel, bull, eagle, and a lion. These are also the four holy creatures.

       I have seen the sphinx in person and it so obvious the head is too small and carved out of something else. The Pharaoh was just a dick and decided to put his face on an old existing statue.

       When you say things like:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "But we can all agree that Egyptologists have their own agenda and act very secretively."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That hurts everything that is said afterwards because there are a great deal of people who are archaeologists and linguists and historians and so on that are deeply invested in the study of antiquities and ancient cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you go on to talk about some people who are highly questionable in their intentions and who use the "out there" approach to support themselves selling books and videos and gaining large followings of peolpe as if they are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will never in 1000 years understand this kind of reasoning.

       Let's see your pics and videos? I don't see how that's the level of evidence he has to meet but you can post a random jpg. And you haven't even done that little.
