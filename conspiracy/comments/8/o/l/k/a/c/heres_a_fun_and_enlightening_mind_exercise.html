        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s a fun and enlightening mind exercise!</p>

<p>1.Go to a few of the posts concerning the alleged human trafficking camp found in Tucson. </p>

<ol>
<li>Within the comments of those posts, find the comments of people doing vociferous damage control.  Their comments downplay the whole event,  insisting it is nothing but paranoia and using phrases like, </li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;I was wondering when the new LARP was coming out,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Police have already investigated&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;This is just a normal homeless camp&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What,  we&#39;re  just supposed to believe random people now because they&#39;re  Navy Seals&quot;?</p>

<ol>
<li> As you come across these people who are offering similar phrases in an attempt to discredit the post, look at their post history.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>I have been doing this for an hour now,  and I am finding many similarities between these accounts. Generally,  I&#39;m finding that the people insisting that &quot;the police have already investigated, you&#39;re  letting your imagination run away with you and there is no evidence&quot; don&#39;t post in r/conspiracy other than to denigrate the sub or do damage control on a specific topic, then disappear for weeks at a time. Regular posters in TopMindsofReddit are also represented.</p>

<p>The &quot;human trafficking in Tucson&quot; posts are being vote brigaded by an outside group doing damage control and TMoR is involved or at least capitalizing on the momentum created by this rogue influence. </p>

<p>Have fun! The more histories you view,  the more obvious the pattern becomes. I8</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering what groups could be astro-turfing this....probably Cartels, right? They&#39;re definitely sophisticated enough to have PR firms to comb through the internet and try to suppress things. I saw in another post, a user mentioned he had a bunch of down-players tagged as &#39;pedo-defenders&#39; from other threads. In your brief investigation, did you notice a theme in the types of threads these commenters post in? Is it all just general conspiracy posts (maybe army?), or is there a specific topic they seem to latch onto?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! I really wish more people would realize that it is ALL ads! Every single bit of reddit. If you see it on the front page, it&#39;s an ad. Or it&#39;s a topic being brought up, so their buddies can comment with ads in the comments. Every time you see a brand name mentioned, whether in a good or bad light it is an ad. Every time somebody is frustratingly dishonest in a conversation, they are likely PR (aka ads for people and organizations).</p>

<p>Of course I&#39;m being slightly exaggerating- obviously there are plenty of real people discussing what they want (especially in niche subs). But one is much closer to the reality of reddit if they just assume the content was posted by a PR shill.</p>

<p>Lives are destroyed.</p>

<p>I have not followed this story in detail but I truly hope it is being seriously investigated by honest people.</p>

<p>Too many in the media, law enforcement and authority figures in general seem to fold around stories so horrid that people choose to believe it doesn&#39;t happen and make them go away.</p>

<p>Others politicize the worst of human behavior and that is just stupid. </p>

<p>Psychopaths and their gormless followers can be found wherever humans gather.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, just because this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t mean that people aren&#39;t allowed to analyze and critique your conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>This one in particular makes little to no sense at all.  While I do acknowledge the grim reality of sexual abuse and human trafficking, if this &#39;site&#39; was used for these purposes by highly sophisticated pedophile networks, then they would they do it all out in the open and leave evidence behind where people could find it?  Surely they have access to a more secure, private area?</p>

<p>Secondly, this conspiracy seems to have originated and gained the bulk of its traction on <a href="/r/greatawakening">/r/greatawakening</a> and that sub is filled with people who practically worship the President and a 4chan troll as dieties.  Their association with this topic sours the entire thing and makes it very hard for outside observers to take it seriously.</p>
