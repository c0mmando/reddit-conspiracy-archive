       I thoroughly enjoy ideas that are uncommon or don’t conform to society. I think the people on the fringes are always the most interesting, which is why I constantly find myself reading about conspiracy theories and esoteric philosophies. But I just have a hard time accepting them or advocating for them because of their deemed status from society.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I am curious how many of the mainstream ideas or concepts that were once considered “conspiracies” or “pseudoscience”. Anybody help me out?

       There is no corroborating evidence that anything goes back more than a few hundred years.

       And I've agreed with you time and time again yet you continue to think we're at odds. Did I not call graham a distraction? Along with the mainstream that have once pretended he was their enemy and have since "vindicated" him.

       The point is their research is published for anyone to see. If you or someone else is able to proof them wrong just do it. This is how science works. There are people out there with even bigger egos and most likely higher education than yours and mine who opposed these new findings at first. Wouldn't you think they would have proven that research to be false if just for personal fame if they had the chance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is not about dogmas like religions, though some people try to do this. People do not just make a claim and it is accepted without evidence. Every claim being made has to be proven by evidence. Now show me that guy walking over water...

       The NSA tracking everyone's emails, texts, and phone calls was very firmly entrenched in the realm of "tin foil hattery" until around 2013, when the establishment itself "leaked" this information.

       Then a few true patriots did what they could to vindicate all those who were made to look like fools.

       Rest In Peace to the credibility/sanity of those who came before us and did there best to get the information out.

       There was a big news story in the early 90's about AOL being in trouble with the FBI because they couldn't figure out how to install "Carnivore", the FBI's email filtering software.  A bunch of people in the late 90s (including me) would send emails and make forum posts containing the entire list of key words being searched for by Prism.  This shit is only new to those who have a VERY short memory and / or weren't paying attention (or weren't born yet).

       Yep and it goes all the way back to the 70s. I first heard mentioning of the 'NSA Lineeater' in the late 80s/early 90s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly the Emacs email client had a (optional) built-in function to try and fool/overload the lineater by adding certain keywords (like 'bomb' etc) to all outgoing emails.

       This was total tinfoil-hat territory at the time, so to anyone else listening: I fucking told you so!!! dagnammit.
