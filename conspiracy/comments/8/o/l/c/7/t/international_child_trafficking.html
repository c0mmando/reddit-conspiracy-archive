        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those just looking into the Tuscon incident, this shit is very real, extremely widespread and is carried out by those in extremely high positions of power. I would like to share my first hand experience with the same bastards that the vets in Tuscon are battling currently. They need as much awareness and help as they can get.</p>

<p>My personal journey down the rabbit hole bega. about five months ago I started researching the elsagate videos all over youtube. They consist of thousands of videos sharing common themes such as child pregnancy, injections, kidnapping, urination and defecation. The common theory is they are intended to normalize such behavior to young kids. Colors and popular figures such as spiderman, hulk, elsa and joker are used to attract kids and as symbolic teaching tools. Color association is also central to the teaching process. Spiderman and red represents the pain ego that the child is meant to identify with, the joker is the kidnapper or fear, the hulk represents the dominat male, etc.... These videos get millions of views and the views are artificially manipulated so they trigger the autoplay alogrithim so kids will be fed them while their parents are busy.</p>

<p>Under these videos were sometimes hundreds of comments repeating nonsense comments similar to something like &quot;xxxxccc,,ss&quot; or just &quot;bbb&quot;. Just seeming nonsense. Some thought they were bots meant to fool youtube and trigger the autoplay alogrithim while others thought they were just children mashing keys. Neither theory seemed to make much sense to me when I started looking at the profiles and comments. Most profiles had pictures and if the profile had an english sounding name it usually had a picture of white guy, if it was korean it would have a korean guy in the picture, etc... Pretty in depth for a bot account. Also, some of the comments had like 40+ comment threads of pure gibberish, making it unlikely it was children.</p>

<p>So I began clicking through any channel commenting in gibberish and started to find a bunch of &quot;home videos&quot; of children linked to the accounts. These videos fit a general profile of the following characteristics:</p>

<p>-the date uploaded as the title</p>

<p>-one primary &quot;target&quot; i.e. the child</p>

<p>-duration of 10-100 seconds</p>

<p>-the filmer remained silent only interacting with the child when the child talked to them.</p>

<p>Here is an example of one of the maybe 50-100 I found over a two day period:
<a href="https://youtu.be/gLaywoHRYWc">https://youtu.be/gLaywoHRYWc</a></p>

<p>I initially posted my findings under the username opco10 about five months but deleted the account when a troll sent me a message in thai saying &quot;stop digging&quot;. My post was archived and I reposted it. If you want to look at it, it is the first post I made on this account. </p>

<p>Anyway, where it gets wierd is when I went to drug rehab at a facility in pensacola, Florida a few days after finding all this stuff. From what I could tell these guys were primarily active in the SE united states (funny enough look at where all the CEMEX locations are). At the rehab I found three paper machete masks stacked on top of each other in the common area. A child sized spiderman mask, a medium sized joker mask with the word &quot;aware&quot; written on it&#39;s chin and a man sized hulk mask. Someone had made them and left them for others to see, possibly me but I honestly doubt it.</p>

<p>I started asking local guests if they had ever seen anything suspicious in the area and one ex-military guy told me that he had found a bunch of rope, baby diapers and toys in the tunnels under an old abandoned civil war era fort. We actually happened to take a trip to the same fort and I found pedo symbols scrawled on the walls in diferent locations. I asked a counselor at the facility if he knew anything about anything wierd happening there and he said that the park service actually had to deal with a group who had been supposedly performing ritual animal sacrifice and leaving markings on the walls.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly convinced that much of the southeast united States is littered with hidden child trafficking sites such as those found in Tuscon and the potential sites here in pensacola. We have a few Cemex locations here as well. Everyone should donate to the op in Tuscon and keep your eyes open for more shit like this. I wanted to share my story in case other people have similar experiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome, this is obviously not going to be addressed in any meaningful way by the authorities. Twenty or thirty years back they discovered six children being trafficked in Tallahassee and the case got dropped like a hot potatoe. Same thing seems to happen every time. I&#39;m on mobile otherwise I would link it but it&#39;s a fairly well known article by NYT on the finders and six feral children.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>These videos fit a general profile of the following characteristics:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After you posted about that I went looking and also found a lot of videos that fit the pattern you describe. Lots of accounts that posted nonsense comments had a small number of videos of kids and no other videos.</p>

<p>I kept links to many of the accounts and then when I went back a few weeks later many of them had removed the videos.</p>

<p>It definitely seems like there is something shady going on (probably partly masked by appearing similar to similar but innocent behavior), and that it is/was linked to this behavior, but I&#39;m skeptical that it&#39;s related to physical child trafficking or blackmailing of global elites (or the lower tiers of people who would serve them, whatever). It seems like it might be more likely to be organized but low-level digital trafficking (regular non-elite pedo people sharing over the internet).</p>

<p>For example, there are many darknet pedo sites that connect people for various services (archive access, trading of self-produced material, live cam shows, etc) and they have various levels of membership exclusivity. It&#39;s possible that some require users who are creating new accounts (or advertising cam shows or whatever) to post a video of the child they have access to (possibly with a certain element in frame as proof that they generated the video). The verification system could do something like &#39;upload a short video of your child to a youtube account, then go to video vM59Oes2v9 and comment &quot;m,j eee ,,de&quot;&#39;. Darknet links can be very, very slow, so uploading video can be prohibitively slow. Posting videos publicly like that means that the site admin/mods can pull the data across the faster public internet instead, with no way for the poster (even with law enforcement resources) to know where the viewers are.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just one possibility. In any case, it seems that the wealthy global elite would mostly have more sophisticated and hidden ways to do what they want. Just the volume of children required would seem to make it unnecessary to use YouTube for finding kids. They&#39;d do things like making low-level flunkies bring in their own children, or host child beauty pageants, gymnastics, cheer events, and etc in low-income areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think that it could be a medium for advertising digital cp before meeting in a private, encrypted chat. However, I believe that the people making these videos are the ones organizing the large scale trafficking due to the money+organization required to produce such videos. That makes the user&#39;s communicating in code in the comments aware of such trafficking(to some extent at least). I&#39;m assuming that it&#39;s all interconnected and they use the same infrastructure, digital and non digital.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. As I mentioned, I don&#39;t think the elite need to operate this way. They are much better at covering their tracks and controlling information than this, and I doubt they need to throw such a large net to collect children. At least, not for their own personal purposes. It doesn&#39;t seem likely to me that the global elite are masters of a large-scale child trafficking system. I think their system is much smaller, quieter, more selective, and targeted to their own internal use.</p>

<p>I suppose they could be at the top of some general-purpose child trafficking systems, but I think there are definitely other players that they don&#39;t control, and that what we see in the elsagate stuff is the business of those other players, not the elites.</p>

<p>I think them aim of the core group behind the elsegate videos (and the elements of psychological manipulation) is to help create a richer market and more demand by encouraging low-level child trafficking comprising mostly part-time parent/guardian-produced digital content. I suspect that in addition to the online evidence we see, there are probably paid people &#39;on the ground&#39; distributing knowledge the system and possibility for earnings in targeted low-income parts of the world. They work to raise awareness and normalized the behavior, creating the belief that that sort of online exploitation is easy, safe and lucrative, so parents/guardians will be more likely to bring children into it. There would be a variety of marketing techniques there, from directly telling adults who patronize child-trafficking establishments about it (and probably recruiting them to spread the message) to astroturfing by paying people to spread rumors that they are making lots of money doing cam shows with their kids.</p>

<p>By creating a bigger, richer market the core group behind the elsagate videos benefit everyone involved. Some of those people can see how they benefit, and so they add their own elements to the mix. That&#39;s part of why it&#39;s hard to reconcile all the bits we see with the idea of a powerful central authority planning things out for their own benefit. What we see are bits and pieces of a community action, with many different people putting in their own actions in ways that benefit themselves.</p>

<p>You know, I&#39;m not gonna claim to have found a camp or anything but all of this is making me reexamine my childhood because I absolutely found tons and tons and tons of weird, ritualistic shit out there in the woods. Like, we all knew there were cultists out there, but it&#39;s Louisiana and voo-doo is a real religion in some places - but...I definitely found a human finger in a bag once, female with a ring - yes I reported it to the police.</p>

<p>Found a giant pentagram in the middle of the woods with a deer on a post in the center of it. Also saw burnt crispy dogs on the side of the road once.</p>

<p>They are making some efforts, many elsagate-type channels have been and continue to be taken down, but YouTube is a global operation and the (IMO, small group of) people making and publishing most the videos are very good at automating account creation, upload, and youtube recommender optimization.</p>

<p>Until YouTube puts some top engineers and resources onto addressing the problem, it&#39;s unlikely that they can do much to stop it.</p>

I think most of the take-downs we&#39;ve been seeing are just the result of community-level action and there isn&#39;t yet any higher-level organizational response beyond making sure the community-level tools work (there was a long-standing problem with reporting of inappropriate comments on videos that meant that pedo comments on videos posted by young ladies stayed there for months. Reportedly that has been fixed and now you&#39;ll see that most of the pedo-titillating videos posted by kids will have comments disabled as a result of community action).</p>
