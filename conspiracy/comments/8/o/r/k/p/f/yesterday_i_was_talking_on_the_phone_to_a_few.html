<p>If you don&#39;t wanna see the ads, get adblock. If you don&#39;t want facebook doing stuff like this, don&#39;t use facebook. And for what it&#39;s worth, facebook isn&#39;t the only company that does this. Any big company that&#39;s providing you a free service is probably doing this. </p>

<p>just dont have it on your phone as an app, that&#39;s where they hook in to the mic and listen to everything. Have on your laptop/pc and download (if you&#39;re using chrome, vivaldi, etc) extensions that block all of FB&#39;s trackers. I use &quot;Facebook Disconnect&quot;, ublock origin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last night I was sitting at the table eating dinner with my family. My son asked a question about the holocaust after hearing about it in school and not understanding what it was. A few minutes later my son changed subjects and started talking about the Titanic which led to a dinner table debate over what year it had sunk. I pulled out my smartphone and googled the answer, 1912 if you couldn&#39;t remember yourself, and right above the search results is a link that said &quot;People also search for: the holocaust&quot;... what are the odds?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar story.  My buddy and I were driving and he mentioned some very obscure junior hockey team from texas he used to play for.  That night had a facebook ad for jerseys from that team....an under 18 team 5 states away from us.  Now you gotta know that if it&#39;s picking shit like that up it&#39;s probably keeping tabs on other stuff you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>Imagine 10 years from now you go in for a job interview, they pull your file and say &quot;welp, sorry can&#39;t hire you.  Back in 2018 facebook detected that you said something about (input anything &quot;offensive) and sang the explicit version of Where Da Hood At, N word and all, 19 times&quot;</p>

I never said a word about him on Facebook. Another creepy incident is that my daughter pediatric specialists started popping up on my suggested friends, again I’ve never talked about them on Facebook. I deactivated and deleted both messenger and Facebook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to a lawn and garden show earlier this year. There were several displays for different brands of little helical pile driving rigs. I couldn&#39;t figure out the purpose of these machines. They seemed too small for a house, yet overkill for a deck. Out of curiosity, I lingered at the displays without talking to anyone or filling out any draws.</p>

<p>The next day, the ads for helical drill rigs came up on my targeted ads. The next day my ad feeds were back to the usual slutwear and lingerie. </p>

<p>That could mean that my phone had located me pausing at specific booths in a trade fair - impressive precision and analysis.... or was it just locally targeted marketing connected with the trade fair?</p>
