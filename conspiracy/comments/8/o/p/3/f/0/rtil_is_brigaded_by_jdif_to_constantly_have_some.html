       Right now there is f.ex. 3 stories in the first page of the Hot section:

       I think their idea is to make sure the Holocaust is constantly on peoples minds and being talked about.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something that happened 75 years ago! It's not organic that 3 posts make it to Hot section frontpage at any given time (even 1 post at a given time would be abnormal imo)
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe an obvious observation but still worth to keep in mind. TIL is compromised (like to many other subs and reddit in general).

       There's a common marketing trick to repeat stuff as much as possible. With TiL, they constantly post articles about the Holocaust, Nazis, Hitler, or WW2 in general.

       Like the avoidance of a revolution f.ex.  If most of the population have fond memories of the royals (or others in power) and have learned to idolise them and follow their lives in a tv-show manner etc etc. they will be MUCH less likely to pull out the guillotines when shit hits the fan.

       Regardless of it being organic from the OP's perspective, the only reason left for the Royal Family is propaganda. You can be the one pushing propaganda or the one reposting it. Either way, it's propaganda.

       Not only TIL it’s a lot of other subs. Nobody gives that deep a fuck about perpetuating holocaust awareness aside from JDIF. If folk were genuinely interested to the extend they’d upvote it en masse, surely you’d see such rabid enthusiasm expressed more frequently in other areas of life?

       Exactly. Well put. Nobody I know gives a fuck about what happened/didn't happen 75 years ago. And given the demographic of reddit it is extremely unlikely there should be this much interest.

       Have you looked at his post profile? It's just a bunch of reposts of varying topics, 3 TIL (which are the easiest to repost), 1 askreddit, and 1 pics. I'm not referring to the topic of this thread (Holocaust posts), but rather just one reposter. So yes, I think it's very likely it's just a reposter looking for karma and not some propaganda bot.

       I said "Nazi-adjacent" specifically so you wouldn't try this strawman, oh well. Thinking that any mention of the Holocaust is Israeli propaganda doesn't make you an anti-Semite, it just means you're echoing their narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your idea of Israeli propaganda were articles or comments obscuring or lying about the policies and actions of Israel then I'd agree with you. But "mentioning the Holocaust is propaganda" puts you next to a different camp.

       Why would someone start criticising Israel after hearing a fact about the Holocaust? 🤔

      <p>
       Ironically accusations of anti-Semitism are used to deflect criticism away from Israel, over here one of our politicians was accused of anti-Semitism for spending Passover with a Jewish group... because this Jewish group was critical of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what actual Israeli propaganda looks like, not Reddit posts about the Holocaust.

       Complaining about Israel on posts about Israel, especially obvious pro-Israel propaganda, is standard.

       Complaining about Israel on posts about the Holocaust isn't.

       Most people don't believe internet posts about the Holocaust are a result of Israeli propaganda, so if you start crowing on about Israel in posts about the Holocaust you're going to look like you're pushing an agenda.

       Now that you mention it, the last time that I had a conversation with someone about the holocaust was while walking through a park near a holocaust memorial. And even then the conversation was brief.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust was very very sad and stands as an example of just how horrible humans could be to on another. But so do the Great War,  the Armenian Genocide,  Mao's Great Famine and... sadly this list could go on and on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they all happened so long ago that it's something we learn in school and never focus on again. We have more to live for than obsessing over the sins of our forefathers. It's more important to stop atrocities currently taking place than fixate on the ones in the past.

       As someone who is a citizen of one of the main perpetrators and  had family members who were proud NSDAP members: No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just No. And I don't even know where to start? At the point that the Holocaust ist recent enough that we still feel it? At the point that the Holocaust was so deeply ingrained in people that the wound it caused (not the least: Israel/Palestina) is still bleeding?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore we won't ever learn from history unless we are able to accept the duration of healing it takes to restore basically teh self-destruction of europe. And if we are willing, and able, we could go into the minutes which made it possible that the holocaust (or other genocides) could happen. Umberto Eco wrote a wonderful piece on proto-fascism (
       <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/">
        http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/
       </a>
       ) and if you have a moment read trough it and tell me that you don't recognize those very rethorics in todays politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody starts with declaring: I want to kill 10% of our citizens. Nobody. But somehow we were able to end up at just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore the holocaust is important, therefore it is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       important to be reminded. To keep us aware of the dangers which lurk down that path.

       As I said events like the holocaust serve of reminders that humans can be cruel. These reminders help us avoid atrocities from taking place in the future. We can look at the actions of Mao or Hitler or Stalin and say "these can act as a warning, if we see people act like these men then we should not let them seize power."

       Again: No. We don't need an reminder that humans can be cruel, we need to know the rethoric which convinces us that cruelty is a good choice. Mao can teach the cruelty of forcing an economic system without regard of human live (and his isn't the only one which could teach this lesson), Stalin can teach us the price of paranoia but the third reich stands alone in the bureaucratic precision of racism.

       The internet campaign is apparent but the influence in the corporate media is glaring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time a story about Israel massacring Palestinians, Syrians or whomever they are stealing from comes on the news it is framed as "self defense" or a "reaction to" never just reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it will be followed EVERY TIME by some obscure "holocaust" story. (You know context for Israel's pathological need to attack those who have what they want).
      </p>
      <p>
       The missing "Anne Frank diary" pages just happened to get "discovered" and widely reported at the same time Israel was gunning down unarmed Palestinians in cold blood in the latest Zionist massacre.

       So now we have 6 million 'dead' in Germany. 
6 million in Russia.
6 million in Israel, present day.

       You're not wrong: it definitely wasn't state capitalism, that's closer to what the Chinese deploy now -- though, it should be important to note that no real political system is as pure as the words we use to describe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it wasn't actual communism: true communism can't occur while there are still nationstates. I'd probably call the USSR as we remember it 'authoritarian socialism'.

       National socialism is a term permanent tainted by the Nazis -- burn it and move on. There's far too much connected to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, it would imply a nationalistic bent of socialism, where as the Nazis opted to focus quite strongly on the nationalism, to the point of trying to establish themselves as the empire nation of Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be generally suspicious of anyone who advocates any form of nationalism: the flag-waving and overt patriotism tend to be a mask something far more sinister than just enthusiasm for one's country.

       'nationalism' isn't 'national socialism', which is the comparison that I am interested in. Did Nazi Germany have its power held strongly at the top? Was the USSR 'nationalistic'? Was the USSR 'genocide-y'?

       Yes, which is why I think the accurate term for their style of government is fascism and not actual national socialists. The term national socialism is now tainted: anyone who uses it is either an edgeless shitlord or a Nazi pretender.

       Not nearly to the same degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Implementations are never pure: the nature of being a nation implies at least a meager amount of nationalism. However, after the end of colonialism, there is no opposite end of the spectrum with which to compare.

       A little bit, yeah. Pretty much every culture has come across another culture and decided only one of us was walking away. History is pretty ugly.

       But once again, not nearly to the same degree as Nazi Germany: they industrialized it, while the rest of us were just doing dickish cultural extinction as warring tribes. They did it as a "civilized" nation, which is particularly fucked up.

       The USSR and China were never communist: they are/were socialist republics. They had/have communist parties.

       Pure communism explicitly rejects nationalism -- it requires nationstates to be more or less extinct before it can exist.

       It's because people are starting to learn the truth in that the numbers were skewed heavily and that Hitler might not have been as bad a person as history wants us to believe especially when propped up against Communist Dictators like Mao and Stallin who are praised by, you guessed it, the Democrats...

       It's hilarious the more you look into judaism, the occult and the holohoax.
Apparently six is very symbolic for the jews, they use it all the time.
The famous "six million" is literally just something they pulled out of their assholes and the whole holocaust nonsense is nothing more than propaganda used to silence people who question the media's narrative on the truth behind the National Socialists, it's also now their scapegoat to hide behind anytime you put jews in the spotlight "b-b-but m-muh ancestors d-d-died during the HOLOCAUST! SIX MILLION INNOCENT JEWS DIED!" Nevermind it's been proven that not only would that be physically impossible to murder that many people at the cited containment camps, but there weren't even any actual gas chambers.
This is the age of truth, the time when people speak out and question everything.

       Yep, it seems like every time Israel's war crimes get exposed there seems to be a rush of posts online about the Holocaust, trying to turn attention away. The Holocaust was a real event and its a tragedy unparalleled in human history, but it still doesn't excuse the actions of Israel today and its pitiful how Israel exploits it to get away with horrible acts.

       I agree that most terrorists are backed by the U.S. in some way or other, but pushing Wahhabism isn't good for Islam in general. Just look at the backlash Muslim citizens in the West are facing due to terrorist attacks; I don't see how they're benefiting besides being attacked. The U.S.'s support of Saudi Arabia doesn't mean it supports Islam; Saudi Arabia is a bastardization of Islam. Btw, Trump brags about the $1.1 billion Saudi arms deal, so is he a part of the modern agenda too?

       We'll never cure the sickness that is modern Western society. It's best to take the advice of much wiser people like Henry David Thoreau and remove ourselves, as much is possible, from participation with this sickness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't pay attention to "all" or "TIL" or "topminds" or "thedonald" any other sub that is full of utter nonsense, bullshit and propaganda. Don't vote, because if voting mattered, they wouldn't let you do it. Don't engage with idiots, don't breed with them. Keep your list of friends small, the one's who only talk videogames or sports or pop culture are useless mouth breathers.

      <p>
       Don't spend money on trivial things. Money is the root of it all. Save, bet on yourself, learn skills your great grandfather knew. Grow food, cook, read old books, pirate audiobooks. Exercise your mind, entertain uncomfortable thoughts and talk to people who are interested in challengin their own views.

       Smoke a joint once in a while and listen to music that makes you think, question and research.

       Zionists will always want protection - and if you look at the state of society, Zionists remain in power as a high percentage of almost all executive branches of Government and corporate/banking and other industries.. This story is as old as the Roman empire and the creation of Christianity. For such a small ethnic group there is no other explanation for being such a high level of them in positions of power. One day it will most likely be illegal to question any group of people, especially based on ethnicity and whether they gained their fortunes lawfully or lawlessly. It's kind of ridiculous, in most of Europe if you talk bad about Israel or the plethora of Zionists who remain in seats of political and economic power all over the world you'll be labeled an anti-Semite..

        The holocaust was very very sad and stands as an example of just how horrible humans could be to on another. But so do the Great War, the Armenian Genocide, Mao's Great Famine and... sadly this list could go on and on and on.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But they all happened so long ago that it's something we learn in school and never focus on again. We have more to live for than obsessing over the sins of our forefathers. It's more important to stop atrocities currently taking place than fixate on the ones in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who is a citizen of one of the main perpetrators and  had family members who were proud NSDAP members: No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just No. And I don't even know where to start? At the point that the Holocaust ist recent enough that we still feel it? At the point that the Holocaust was so deeply ingrained in people that the wound it caused (not the least: Israel/Palestina) is still bleeding?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore we won't ever learn from history unless we are able to accept the duration of healing it takes to restore basically teh self-destruction of europe. And if we are willing, and able, we could go into the minutes which made it possible that the holocaust (or other genocides) could happen. Umberto Eco wrote a wonderful piece on proto-fascism (
       <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/">
        http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/
       </a>
       ) and if you have a moment read trough it and tell me that you don't recognize those very rethorics in todays politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody starts with declaring: I want to kill 10% of our citizens. Nobody. But somehow we were able to end up at just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore the holocaust is important, therefore it is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       important to be reminded. To keep us aware of the dangers which lurk down that path.

        As I said events like the holocaust serve of reminders that humans can be cruel. These reminders help us avoid atrocities from taking place in the future. We can look at the actions of Mao or Hitler or Stalin and say "these can act as a warning, if we see people act like these men then we should not let them seize power.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again: No. We don't need an reminder that humans can be cruel, we need to know the rethoric which convinces us that cruelty is a good choice. Mao can teach the cruelty of forcing an economic system without regard of human live (and his isn't the only one which could teach this lesson), Stalin can teach us the price of paranoia but the third reich stands alone in the bureaucratic precision of racism.
