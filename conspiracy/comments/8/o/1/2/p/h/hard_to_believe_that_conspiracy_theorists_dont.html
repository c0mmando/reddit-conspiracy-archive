        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trigger Warning: The following post may disturb you if you are currently participating in sexual liberation.</p>

<p>I am reading Sex and Culture ebook of Unwin. It came out in 1934. I never found the structure of sexual liberation convincing. But I must say I shook when I was going over the study of Unwin. This is my first time discovery of what is coming in the future despite being a conspiracy buff for years. I am quite amazed that it is not discussed by conspiracy theorists. So many critical thinkers could have been saved if only it was given importance. But let me give a quick list of what Unwin&#39;s book has and my comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The tribes and civilizations of his study followed exactly the same pattern we are following: History keeps repeating itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Sexual liberation usually starts to become a norm in prosperous societies. </p></li>
<li><p>There is no way to undo sexual liberation: I think one of the best examples of this I found in my cultural anthropology book. There was this village in China which had no marriage. Incest became common. It led to STD&#39;s and other issues. Chinese government eventually wanted to do some cleanup through programs. The effort to promote marriage to the village turned rough because the villagers refused to change. I don&#39;t know whether their government was successful.</p></li>
<li><p>People living within sexual liberation eventually begin to lose the urge to prosper and that starts to affect all. Men&#39;s urge to excel has link to sex. 
`</p></li>
<li><p>We will die either because of our own anarchy or an invader who is more driven than us.</p></li>
<li><p>Monogamy is the one that helps prosper: Some people point towards middle east to show that to be untrue. But here is the interesting thing, Arabs do criticize themselves for not individually contributing to world. What they say is that they surely have money, but not a single bolt of a car they drive is made in their countries. Secondly, they can still be taken as &quot;newly&quot; liberated from British imperialism. I lived in Dubai for a while. Plenty of male teens there are sexually active. They just don&#39;t talk about it.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultures, whether liberal or conservative are always coercive to those who participate in them. I am for individualism which unfortunately is diminishing within our sexual liberation driven society. I myself is a female, but it hurts me to see how young men are forced by their peers to lose their virginity in exchange for status in their circle. That is indirect kind of rape.</p>

<p>That urge is common to females too. In a society like ours, only after the marriage, the actual value of virginity is realized. It has nothing to do with religion, but love and bond.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Manipulation is what it is. </p>

<p>Take the woman that married a rapist cop. She had sex with her husband for years. Each time it was consentual.</p>

<p>She found out that he raped women while on duty, and now she could never see herself having sex with him again. </p>

<p>Just because she feels ashamed of herself for sleeping with him in the past, and for not being able to see what he was, does not make all the times they had sex rape.</p>

<p>You cannot retroactively say that you were raped after giving consent. I don&#39;t care how many moves that guy used to convince you to let him fuck you, and it&#39;s pretty fucked up to suggest that.</p>

<p>Oh, I would like to elaborate on that. I formed the conclusion based on my public policy studies. As we know, men lose their virginity to gain status. If they don&#39;t  take the action they are declared ugly, gay, loser, dumb and patient of low self esteem by their peers. As per our workplace law, that&#39;s sexual harassment:
here:<a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/whatissh.pdf">http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/whatissh.pdf</a></p>

<p>The word to use here is unwelcome. If that is your point of view then all the comments made by your peers about your sexuality can be considered sexual harassment. Too bad, it is not available to general public.</p>

<p>How does sexual liberation decrease individualism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what came out of my research:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We are told sex is a personal choice, but that is not happening.</p></li>
<li><p>There is something eerie about the psychology of sexually active people. They seem to have a need to do virgin shaming. It greatly affects young men. They become desperate to lose their virginity. In short, they are not listening to themselves but the society. Do check the sub link I gave earlier. It has wonderful evidence of the hell they go through.</p></li>
<li><p>For women, there is usually no U turn once their virginity is given away. Men love to make fun of born again virgins and get offended when they hear their dates will not do it in the current relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>I had this one study according to which most women aren&#39;t losing virginity because they want to, but to keep their boyfriends.</p></li>
<li><p>The sexual liberation bible has impossible to follow verses, but the society still wants people to abide by them. We are told how women are liberated through sex, but then again, men run away from them saying their huge number of past partners is too much to handle. They say those who stay virgin have low self esteem.They say those who are promiscuous have low self esteem.</p></li>
<li><p>Sex usually involves feelings, but people are told to deny them.</p></li>
<li><p>The final stage involves realizing how a simple &quot;no&quot; to the sexual liberation could have made the marriage worthwhile with a bed free of ghosts of the past sexual partners. It is the time when real value of individualism is realized. People suffering from it are usually avoided by our society. Men usually suffer in secretly because of the stigma associated with marrying promiscuous women.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You enter marriage with no sexual baggage and artificial romance. You get to remain who you are. You don&#39;t have to struggle with a stone heart. You don&#39;t have to overdo anything to prove to your mate that she or he means more to you than your past partners. In the marriage, we get to realize that sex is a privilege.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>coercion exists but it can be minimized if the system is design to allow for people to select to places where the coercion doesn&#39;t exist - if you don&#39;t do this you are encouraging conflict.  and if you have a society that implicitly encourages avoidable conflict - it shouldn&#39;t be surprised if it finds itself on the back end of this uneven exchange if hermetic laws are to be believed anyway.  anyhoo.  the kind of culture you are talking about that current exists is itself coercive - yet another argument to avoid this mechanism and instead offer choice.  </p>

<p>this is probably the same kind of argument the &quot;pro any lane&quot;-side used to ridicule the &quot;pro each direction has its own lane&quot;-side back before people didn&#39;t figure out to self-organize traffic this way.  coercion is a fractal phenomenon and we can see its effect throughout society to know how effectively it works.  rephrased: do you think kids learn more effectively when someone is beating them or do you think it&#39;s when the teachers are good communicators?  sort of answers itself right?</p>

As soon as people start accepting common myths there is going to be coercion, laws, punishment etc.  There is always going to be a strong man that takes charge, kills his challengers and tells everyone else what to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s one model otherwise known as hierarchy.  </p>

<p>and there&#39;s another model that works too - phi.  that&#39;s when you see services pop into existence to provide the collective with some value, be this mail, or fire houses, or whatever.  aka the bazaar.  services provided in layers.   this one&#39;s been working well for a while too.  </p>

<p>the strong man in your model is a service.  the question you should ask yourself is, when you build a hierarchy of services and it gets all brittle n shit, and you need a strongman, don&#39;t be surprised when &quot;keys&quot; show up that can rattle or resonate the fuck out of your brittle ass rigid hierarchical system.  and then we&#39;ll see who is laughing.  or you can say hey hierarchy is shitty lets build shit in layers according to a scheme we can all agree on and put some design around this mess.  then everyone is laughing cos shit is better.   </p>

<p>This is why I just dont argue much about anything.  We can no more change the course of human nature than we can change the course of Jupiter.  We are going to do what our genes tell us to do and we cannot do anything else.</p>

<p>We, the west, are in decline. We will be replaced.  Its only a matter of time.  If you really want your genes to make it into the next millennium, youre going to need to move to the developing world and have a family there.</p>

<p>I am quite concerned about the decline. Men are already showing signs of not wanting marriage because they can get sex from anywhere they want. After marriage, i came across another damaged group.

<p>Triggered? What&#39;s bad in having a contract paper between a man and woman? We do not seem to have any problem when it comes to declaration of partnership, limited liability and so on for businesses. We do not see anything wrong in having birth and death certificates. They are legal requirements. Then why when it comes to a relationship between a man and woman should should not have a certificate?</p>

<p>No, in our time, it is the result of Kinsey&#39;s fraudulent study and feminists who take douches as their role model. But according to Unwin. it is always the prosperity that brings the thing to a society.</p>
