        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What was your first thought when you read this title?</p>

<p>I saw two images when I first thought of it. The first was that of the Democratic and Republican parties as they currently exist, and how they seem to act as fake adversaries while being paid and controlled by the same (or similar) hidden factions. It&#39;s not that the parties are the same, but for important decisions, they serve the same interests. </p>

<p>The second image was of the bird not embodying our political systems, but that we the people ourselves were the bird. A bird can only fly if its wings work together; when they work against each other, the bird will fall out of the sky. </p>

<p>We the people, the actual constituents of each wing of the bird, are mimicking the fake fights between the paid actors in government office and on TV reality shows. (In this sense, Donald Trump is not an aberration of the American political system; he epitomizes it.) We the people are fighting each other and like this we cannot fly, while those orchestrating the melodrama don&#39;t care because they have airplanes. They don&#39;t need the bird to fly, but each of us do. </p>

<p>Increasingly I&#39;m noticing both in online and real life conversations, people from each wing hoping that their wing will &quot;beat&quot; the other wing. Do they not realize how foolish this is? A bird whose wings are unbalanced, which are not working towards the same goals, cannot fly. One wing &quot;beating&quot; the other only ensures that the bird falls from the sky.</p>

<p>But we really aren&#39;t birds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but we are a super-organism. What each part of that super-organism does affects every other. When the parts work against each other, the whole fails.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simple fact. Once you hand over a right, such as gun rights or rights to be secure in your possessions... You&#39;ll never get it back without bloodshed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you. The right to self-defense is something so necessary to a functioning society. Many liberals agree with this as well as conservatives, and we should not back down. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The liberals are so willing to give up these rights just to will virtue points that it makes me ill. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Some</em> liberals are willing to give up these rights, just like <em>some</em> conservatives are willing to give up freedoms in exchange for &quot;security&quot; from the state. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m 100% against doing anything with government that we can&#39;t easily undo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this as well. The sad fact is that almost all government action is hard to undo, and usually more restrictive of our freedoms as citizens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shit goes both ways. There’s a huge portion of conservatives that think we should be ruled by biblical law. We have separation of church and state for a good reason. Not all liberals want our firearms taken away and not all conservatives want biblical law. The more we fight over our stupid party affiliations the more we over look the real problems facing us Americans. Our government is bought and paid for by the wealthy. They keep throwing propaganda from both sides so we are so busy fighting each other, they can do whatever they want. </p>

<p>I think it almost assuredly will, but what we do after will determine our destiny. Power structures crumbling has led to great rebirth, but also much suffering. Still, I will smile along with you when it happens. </p>

<p>“If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?”</p>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains ... an unuprooted small corner of evil. </p>

<p>Since then I have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world: They struggle with the evil inside a human being (inside every human being). It is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety, but it is possible to constrict it within each person.”<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going for something a bit different in this post, though I don&#39;t think I really captured it. Obviously from a partisan political perspective, the right and the left and mere strange attractors or sheep dogs, pick your metaphor, ultimately bringing people into line with the synthetic thread that undergirds both sides of the phony divide. </p>

<p>It might have been one of my r/c_s_t posts that fleshed this out a bit more, but I think the left and right as presented work as dual columns of the state because they <em>do</em> speak to a deeper psychological truth; they just pervert it enough to suit their own ends. Yeah, it was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/8vpx03/the_right_says_let_me_keep_the_fruits_of_my_labor/">this post</a>. (I&#39;ve added you as an approved submitter to CST in case you want to participate there, too. If you want). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right says: &quot;Let me keep the fruits of my labor&quot; — The left says: &quot;Let us provide for the most vulnerable&quot; — The lie is that we must choose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe both of these precepts. I want to keep what I earn and I want my fellow humans to live good lives. The right/left divide makes us believe we must choose, and leaves us with a system where we, the common folk, get neither. We still have 30+% of our labor forcefully taken, and the least among us cannot really make it, not to the standards they should. (And this is without even taking the monetary system into account).</p>
