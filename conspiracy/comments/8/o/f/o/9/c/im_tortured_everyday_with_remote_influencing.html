<p>It seems A.I controlled cuz they can use specific conditioning when a target gets near specific people, and cuz I&#39;m tortured 24/7 exactly when I&#39;m doing specific things, like they induce more pain for more important things. Constantly analyzes my brainwaves and has certain triggers programmed to cue when it shows I&#39;m in a certain state. </p>

<p>They can change the settings like for a short while they set it so as strangers or cars would pass me I&#39;d hear a voice in my head, they induced voices of my neighbors as I passed their door/window, close relationship with them so I told them about targeting and asked them about it ofc they didn&#39;t say the stupid shit this tech creates and I can&#39;t hear them from outside their home anyway, and they would induce pain whenever a stranger looked at me outside.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sick of seeing posts about mk-ultra and &#39;trauma based mind control&#39; without any mention of electronic mind control. Worst is hearing how &#39;MK-Ultra was a failed operation&#39; when it&#39;s very obvious to me they wanted to understand the mind better with that research to be able to implement electronic mind control on a wide scale. I believe most people are implanted and don&#39;t know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the suggestion, btw making people focus on short-term solutions and selfishness is one of their aims. </p>

<p>Many people are being tortured worldwide illegally and our answer shouldn&#39;t be to &#39;get a faraday cage&#39;, there&#39;s also been organized harassment and crime by physical people against my family for over 10 years.</p>

<p>Organized psychopaths control every aspect of society, politics, education, media, healthcare, etc, few targeted individuals getting some peace in their room isn&#39;t very relevant atm given our situation. (Sometimes I wish people had a little less peace to understand how bad things really are globally.) </p>

<p>Plus I don&#39;t understand why anyone would want to use poisonous pharmaceuticals when there are much healthier natural alternatives, by taking a trip to a psychiatrist you meant to get prescribed drugs correct?

<p>I could say the same thing about mental illness, just cuz people believe there&#39;s something wrong with someone&#39;s brain without any physical evidence doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, but are mere opinions and speculations.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked up Dr. Barrie Trower and watched one of his facebook videos about wifi, microwaves, etc... He mentioned warfare, but didn&#39;t get into it.  It was enough information that I can suspend disbelief for you and play along.</p>

<p>Few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why you?  What circumstances render you as a target? Who are you? Who does Number Two work for?</li>
<li>Who are &quot;they&quot; that are targeting you? Agency/Department? Are people assigned directly to you, or is this like a wide net operation?</li>
<li>From where are you being targeted? Followed by a van? Blimp? Handed off tower to tower as you travel? Satellite? Guy in the bushes outside your window?</li>
<li>How large is your target area?  Just your brain? Is the person standing next to you in danger? How wide of a net do they cast just to get you?</li>
<li>Sinces it&#39;s an utterly fruitless endeavor that causes you pain at every turn, why do you go on the internet to rant about this? I&#39;m sure there are more rewarding ways of hurting yourself.</li>
<li>Whether you bumped your head, suffered an aneurysm, of they are shooting microwaves at your brain, your faculties have been compromised and you should seek help. A professional that understands your situation would be your best advocate.</li>
</ul>

<p>On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did this hurt?</p>

<p>They developed technology and kept it hidden from public. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>When you know your mental health is totally fine and you&#39;re being tortured everyday for doing specific things you just know. I grew up as a normal person with no major traumatic events that would have an effect like this, no hereditary problems so it&#39;s just not natural for me to feel pain everyday like this.</p>

<p>Lol how can I prove I&#39;m not mentally ill when the general consensus is that mental illness can develop later in life with no physical indications and the symptoms are the voices/hallucinations that are created by this technology. All I can say is my brain is fine and people should research about the whistleblowers who have come forward on this subject.</p>

<p>If I was sick wouldn&#39;t I want to get better, why is it so important to so many targeted individuals to get this information out. I don&#39;t care about all these people calling me schizo and I just want people to know these technologies exist. It&#39;s strange like 5 people in this thread claiming I&#39;m schizo when I know these technologies are being used on civilians worldwide and doctors told me I&#39;m fine. Doctor opinions&gt;random redditor opinions.</p>

<p>Some whistleblowers/activists on this subject: Dr. Barrie Trower, Dr. John Hall, Dr. Matthew Aaron, Dr. Katherine Horton, Dr, Daniel Lebowitz, Dr. Robert Duncan, Dr. Eric Karlstrom, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe, Karen Stewart, Cheryl Welsh, Melanie Vritschan, Mark Phillips, Carl Clark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you have mentioned perfectly fits the below criteria. I have a friend with schizophrenia, and you sound just like he did before his diagnosis. He now lives a peaceful happy life and receives the help he needs. I&#39;m just saying, you fit the criteria with that kind of talk. Just go speak to someone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Individuals with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech that is not understandable known as word salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.[21]</p>

<p>Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one&#39;s thoughts or feelings are not really one&#39;s own to believing thoughts are being inserted into one&#39;s mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m open minded about the serious claims of Targeted Individuals. I take your statements seriously. Try to keep in mind that people do care about you, and you should take their suggestion to get help. &quot;Don&#39;t beleive everything you think&quot; is a great piece of advice for everyone. </p>

<p>My question: What do you think is the reason for the harassment starting? </p>

<p>I do believe talking with a psychiatrist is important to rule out other causes and provide a witness to what you experience.  </p>

<p>When the going gets wierd like this, science is your friend.  </p>

<p>The faraday cage experiment is a good idea although I don&#39;t know how easy this will be to find for experiment. </p>

<p>tptb also post fakes that look like this to try to sniff out who is onto them, things like &#39;biggerthansnowden.com&#39; are honeytraps, that this even exists is a scandal in itself that proves something is going on.  </p>

<p>laziness is going to be an obstacle in your situation...</p>

<p>sounds like you should try to get an interview with jesse beltran</p>

<p>in your situation you have a lot of questions, and you can find answers at least for yourself</p>

<p>so make a list of questions, then put them in order of most important to least important, then start getting answer, let me nkow how it goes.  </p>

<p>the steemit blockchain and other blockchains are your friend as you don&#39;t want to be censored.  </p>

<p>Catherine Austin Fitts sums up how I feel about bitcoin/blockchains right now really well: When you have a government structure that&#39;s invisible, doesn&#39;t have integrity and is controlling you through physical force, there&#39;s no such thing as a &#39;financial solution&#39; to that. Because if I control the physical world, the hardware, train tracks, cables that go underneath the ocean, the satellites in the sky...<em>I&#39;m in control</em>.   </p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, I&#39;m not looking for interviews or reaching out to other TIs right now I just want to make more redditors aware of this inhumane program, our justice system is corrupted and that&#39;s all I need to know.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fwiw for the record, I am a targeted individual, but so far I have no proof or reason to believe it is of the emf-&gt;biology variety.</p>

<p>I have been followed and harassed by people trying to bait me into crimes, fake friends, fake girlfriend, fake roommates, fake coworkers.</p>

<p>My car&#39;s computer was somehow destroyed twice in a year, the second time on an icy road in traffic, which threatened my life.  And it cost around 2600 dollars.  I suspect israelis may do this to people they consider supressive.  </p>

<p>Other strange internet and phone occurances are so common I could never list them all, although I go through some of it over at steemit, ie analysis of a comprimised system.  </p>

<p>But you should read my privacy workshop over at steemit, I hope it is at least informative and that my can-do attitude is contagious.  </p>

<p>lmk if things get wierder.  also, you can&#39;t know it&#39;s the united states, i believe the current israeli regime would do this to people it didn&#39;t like in a split second.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One question that hasn&#39;t been answered here, and I&#39;m generally curious, as I guess with current technology, most anything is possible. </p>

<p>Why would they target you and your family? Was there a particular event where they decided, &quot;better fuck this guy and his whole families shit up&quot;? </p>

<p>Some people are generally curious here... and I don&#39;t think the answer &quot;lots of people are targeted&quot; is any kind of answer or reasoning. Do you know why you&#39;re targeted, or do you just feel like you are?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In in the same boat with you. I don&#39;t get tortured much with pain, but the voices etc... Are around almost all day saying nonsense phrases. My brain has been mapped, that&#39;s how they do the pain/pleasure from saved pain in your past through the brain. I basically no longer can think for the most part because they are ahead of my brain.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve told me that ... I forgot what I was typing (happens alto when I have any profound thought.)</p>

<p>Its basically witchcraft and Satanism mixed with tech from the devil himself. Being mapped digitally on an atomic level is a scary thing. They change my body around too, including bones. I woke up once and I looked healed of all ailments and then watched myself deteriorate back.</p>

<p>It has something to do with the djinn as well. The people doing this are ahead of time and use the same tech they torture people with to talk to eachother and swarm people with no verbal communication. There is no race involved either. Ive been stalked by black/white/Asian/Jewish/men/women/gays etc... Its worldwide. </p>

<p>Watch A Beautiful Mind now that you know about this stuff. He wasnt a schizo  either. Watch some docus and intetbiews with him. He says the Olly thing that will be able to save us now is a miracle.</p>

<p>I could say the same thing about mental illness, just cuz people believe there&#39;s something wrong with someone&#39;s brain without any physical evidence doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, but are mere opinions and speculations.   </p>
