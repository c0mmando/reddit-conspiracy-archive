        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What is gaslighting?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target&#39;s belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People will gaslight you when they want you to move away from the very thing they&#39;re hiding.</p>

<p>Abusive people for example may abuse someone and then when confronted about it, they&#39;ll pretend like it never happened.</p>

<p>This can happen on the individual and institutional level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An article by Tuesda Roberts and D. Carter Andrews specifically focuses on African-American teachers, and attributes the severely low percentage of African-Americans in the teaching profession to &quot;macro-level and micro-level laws and policies [that] have historically and contemporarily positioned the black educator as &#39;outsider&#39; and as &#39;on the margins&#39;&quot;, competent to teach Black students but not White students, a form of gaslighting reinforced by &quot;the exodus of White educators from predominantly non-White schools&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting#Racially_aimed">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting#Racially_aimed</a></p>

<p>One of the key aspects of gaslighting is wearing the person down. People may believe something but through continual reinforcement that it is not true, they may give up and accept the alternative.</p>

<p>We in this subreddit must research, use our intuition and draw conclusions for ourselves whether something is real or not.</p>

<p>There is child trafficking happening in the United States. There are missing children in the United States. There are real cults dedicated to abducting children. Do the research and see which areas have the highest amount of registered sex offenders, the highest amount of missing children, and the most likely to have corruption within the local government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it was very much that kind of sadistic glee, only much darker. I think they talked about murder, maybe cannibalism (this could be a false memory association from all that spirit cooking hoopla), or sexual abuse? I can&#39;t really remember but I do recall thinking that this was a group of toxic people who had very much lost their way. Dead baby jokes are rather uncouth. It takes a hard heart to leap beyond that into &quot;torturing children&quot; jokes. And I don&#39;t think they were all jokes... D:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree. Despite obvious manipulation on some level this sub has become a real destination for me. 
As an amateur researcher, former radio and podcast guy, and free thinker, I enjoy the posts and interactions and conversation here. 
There aren&#39;t many message boards left that are halfway intellectual or measured.
Facebook tends to be a wasteland. Twitter is not a format for any real discussion.
I think a lot of things that need further critical examination gets it in the comments here.</p>

<p>Most importantly I find there are people at all stages of knowledge and info. I have posted basic comments that led to someone researching something they had not been aware of. The same has happened with me seeing a well done grouping of sourced information like the 2001 Bin Laden death posts. That was excellent.
I hope this sub only gets better moving forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love that the word research is used so much around here. It evidently means something very different than scientific research, e.g. forming hypothesis and predictions and testing them against reality. Here it seems to mean watching YouTube videos and making far reaching extrapolations from very sparse evidence and then <em>never testing it</em> against reality. It’s the last part that I have a problem with.</p>

<p>Theories and ideas are fine, but they are not worth anything if reality doesn’t agree with them. If it’s not tested, it’s not research. </p>

The system does take much more from them than citizens, but there&#39;s a reason they&#39;re willing to accept this oppression rather than stay home--maybe it&#39;s just the money, but I have to think they aren&#39;t complaining about the rest of it!</p>

<p>Anyway, my point is America&#39;s immigration policy sucks for immigrants and working class American citizens a whole hell of a lot more than it sucks for the people employing those immigrants. That&#39;s why it will never be improved. Those employers also &quot;employ&quot; our Congresspeople.</p>

<p>This is what Trump does every day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reality couldn&#39;t possibly be more the opposite. Why do you think the most known evil people in the country are against Trump? Why do you think the entire establishment -- the MSM, leftists, the corrupt wing of the Republicans, the CIA, the FBI, known international scumbags, Soros, Hillary, basically everyone who is evil -- is terrified of him and is aligned against him? Because he&#39;s not one of them, and thus he must be destroyed at all costs. The gaslighting propaganda campaign against him is literally the largest, most intensive quite possibly in Earth&#39;s history. Why? Why are they so desperate to destroy one man?</p>

<p>We absolutely know that the Russian narrative was manufactured wholesale to frame Trump. This has been established fact for almost two years now, but is only now finally catching up in the mainstream, and the IG report is going to show it definitively. But make no mistake -- the evidence has been clear for a long, long time. And this is only the tip of the massive level of fascist corruption in our government.</p>

You really think they can’t control the presidency but somehow can control every other aspect of reality? He is literally just another puppet thrown into the limelight with illusions of different political views and underdog mentality. He’s there to put the people against the people, just like obama. He is a huge distraction. They give him the illusion that everyone hates him so the right hates the left for hating him and then the left hates the right because that is what they’re told to do.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but What has he done in office that changes any of the corrupt normalcy in our country? He seems to want to help huge corporations regularly that all presidents before him helped. Yes it seems like everyone wants his destruction but what has really come out of it, other than accusations and most likely false outrage? Idk man, it just all looks really fishy to me and it makes sense for the left to act like they are outraged because it keeps them true to their audience, while at the same time really pissing off the rights audience. I really think it’s best to stay in the middle of this situation looking around rather than choosing a side to look from. It really obscures perception </p>

<p>I agree there haven&#39;t been major changes yet as far as corruption goes, but that takes time. The FBI, CIA and DOJ were completely corrupt under Obama. A lot of that had to be ripped out before we can start seeing progress.</p>

<p>I think the IG report is going to be the start. Keep in mind there are tens of thousands of sealed indictments sitting out there, which is a historically huge number. Something is going on. Personally, the thing I care about the most is that the insane corruption gets ripped out. Trump&#39;s Presidency is either a success or a failure on that basis. We&#39;ve had fascism in our government for decades, if not all the way back to the 50s (some think since 1913).</p>

<p>All I need to know about Trump is that the most evil people absolutely despise him. There are rumors that Trump has survived over a dozen assassination attempts, much of them from the CIA. That has to mean something.</p>

Also, the nearest bridge to Canada is about an hour and a half from Toledo. In 2002 I was in high school and saw a special about it on TV. I never saw anything or heard anything about Toledo again regarding sex trafficking.  Fast forward to moving to Cleveland and visiting friends in Chicago. I came across many people who had family friends that were found in Toledo after being abducted or they had there own stories which involved Toledo, OH. Nada on the news about it anymore. It is a central location for it. Major hub for this stuff for sure. Doesn&#39;t seem like there is any coverage on it anymore.</p>
