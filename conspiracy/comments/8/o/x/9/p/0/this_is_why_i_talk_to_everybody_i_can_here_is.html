       Back in the not too distant future everyone knew that if a person spent $10,000 cash for a car or other retail goods. The store taking the cash was to report it to the government. I think later on it got reduced to $3000 in cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking to the people at the bank the other day (Usually we talk about movies) and one of the girls who took my deposit mentions to me that they have a new rule that anyone making a payment for their credit or debit accounts depositing $500 cash has to be reported.

       TPTB really want to know everything about everyone &amp; to make sure no one is amassing too much of anything.

       You can interpret this how you want, but I thought people should know.

       that's the whole point. crypto = cashless society. Quantum decryption makes crypto scary. on a whole different scale, what happens when the internet as we know it is gone or a weaponized CME brings down the grid and we can't access our money. BUY RURAL LAND NOW.

       Yes it would. This is a nuclear option. If someone tried to take over the network then pow change is a must. What will happen is that hash rate will come from all the video cards out there mining other coins to bitcoin. Luke-Jr has been thinking/talking about this for years. When that time comes, we must do what we have to. It will be Chaos for a while.  The price will go down. But we'll end up with a even more resilient chain. Anti fragility

       Lol no. Satoshi is an old Cypherpunk, not to be confused with the sissy cyberpunks. Probably Hal or Nick. Or both. Learn about the Cypherpunks. They have been trying to make something like bitcoin since early 90s or even earlier.

       That sounds absurd to everyone who understand that cryptography is literally math. They might as well make algebra and trigonometry illegal too while they're at it. You'll say they would if they could, and that's exactly my point. They

       They could easily control it, that's what whales do; if you own enough you can dump large amounts and crash the price, if you have the money you can buy and hold to raise the price. You can even short it now so some people want the price to go down. The US government has been stockpiling Bitcoin, Soros is getting into it, and a big one: Satoshi Nakamoto (?) still has a wallet that hasn't been accessed, but does anyone control it? No one knows.

       I wonder how much reporting traffic that is going to generate. It seems like moving cash in such amounts wouldn't be unusual. There are all sorts of pretty boring person-to-person sales that a $500 limit would catch; vehicles, guns, antiques, used electronics. That's a lot of data.

       Socialism, totalitarian state, universal income can only work when the system in its entirety is accounting for every single cent being generated, every goods and services balanced out. The economy (by the definition of careful management of available resources), can only work by accounting for every aspect of human needs and wants. Bloat of unvetted capitalism is over. US printing money and giving out endless debt is over, that experiment has been deemed a failure. So the world is moving towards a different system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever wondered how hyperinflated currencies such as Russian ruble Zimbabwean dollar, chinese/asian currencies provide enough enough wealth for people to have stable lives? These systems are not a byproduct of careful analysis, they are all experiments on how to best control human population in a civilisation. The hyperinflated currencies, where goods and services cost thousands of digits, so a 1000dollar phone is like 10000. Food is like 300 credit points, instead of 13.99.The hyperinflated currency allows for better estimates of value as larger numbers promote smarter spending(psychological fact), meaning economy of controlled spending and balanced budgets work better than bloated all you can eat dollar store economy of last century western based one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the bank regulations, governments, the system lords if you will, have to know who spends what when. Money going in, money going out, idle wealth. For the best most prosperous build in star craft 2, the RTS video game, the strategy isnt to build up wealth and go on a spending spree, but to creat a build that maximises income earned from mining minerals (getting resources), and outputting production and army units(spending resources to generate value). This efficiency ensures fastest builds that do not allow for idle time, that are planned, and still versatile to be able to respond to changing playing field. This analogy is good, as it allows us to understand that the world is changing, away from free market capitalism as US has done it in the last century.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way of life is over, now the world is shifting towards a slower growth phase.  Where economies of markets, civilisation and population control of resources for NEEDS and wants, can be balanced out. After all world I think has almost reached a point where socialism is not only wanted but it can work on a larger global scale. Even US the leader in not wanting communist ideals, is on the verge of universal healthcare, possibilities of universal income free education etc. Who knows what will happen in the next 100 years. But this monetary policies arent only in US. Australia recently made transactions over 10000 in cash illegal! like here we are at an impasse, where the digital cashless society is the future within our generation.

       This is certainly what they think, like every single other central planner before them. From Amenhotep to Stalin, Cleopatra to Obama, Alexander to Mao, Caesar to Louis XIV, Mussolini to Clinton. And like every freak sociopath before them, they are wrong. Human behavior
       <em>

       . That's why neoclassical macroeconomics is a pseudoscience btw.

       We can hasten their failure by refusing to participate in their fake system, and by endeavouring for the separation of money and state. May the neurotic control freaks understand the beauty of emergence, the natural quality of spontaneous order, and the morality of liberty.

       I agree with you that humans cannot be boxed in and need freedom to express themselves through sheer liberty and will power. Unfortunately for the majority of life, a few things are constant for everyone. Health, education, sustenance, shelter, and now basic access to utilities such as internet, electricity and water. Those things can not only be streamlined, but private sectors as well as public municipalities that do take on the burden have been very effective at eliminating waste, and streamlining supply chains to keep stock on shelves for only short period of time maximising profit turnaround in shops etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So although we are still away from true cashless society and communism as stalin tried in in ye old USSR, we are there with health, education and municipalities. Everything else the marriage of capitalistic practices and freedom for human behaviour can marry the two together. personally i think the world will forever remain in a state of conflict between private corporate offerings and larger social providers. because even in space eventually if humanity will survive long enough to become intergalactic, a coalition for human survival through robots and automated systems will eliminate the need to hunt and gather food int he woods so to speak.

        Back in the not too distant future everyone knew that if a person spent $10,000 cash for a car or other retail goods. The store taking the cash was to report it to the government. I think later on it got reduced to $3000 in cash.

       That's the legal threshold requirement but the rules also encourage/permit banks to report anything they deem suspicious at any amount.  To wit; they are obligated to report what they deem might be "structured" transaction designed to evade the reporting threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each bank sets their own policies in this regard, and we can easily determine that millions and millions of SARs are recorded each year (Suspicious Activity Reports).

       I feel like the banks are a little bit more curious as to whats going on with me and my money. For example, when I go to the bank teller, they always ask me questions like "so what is going on with you?" "What are your plans for the weekend?" On the outside, these seem like innocent questions, Im just wondering if they are logging my responses into their system: Customer withdrawing $200 and going out of town this weekend.

       I might just be paranoid.

       Former teller at a major bank here; $10,000 is the magic number. It’s used to track possible money laundering. Anything below that isn’t reported to the government and no paperwork is filled out. That particular bank may do internal checks in cash deposits but it’s a bank policy and not a government law. 
And from a personal point, it would be a huge waste of time for them to do that.  I know at my branch, 3k cash transactions were highly normal. And $500 credit card payments were a daily thing.

       This just isn’t true. The rule is still $10,000. I have 2 banks and one is an online bank with few brick and mortar stores. I regularly will drop by to deposit cash over $500 into that account. You should probably stop telling people this before hey actually start believing you. It’s just wrong.

       I recall reading something recently that stated that money you put in the bank no longer belongs to you.  Yeah, you can go do a withdrawal, thus giving you the impression that you're taking YOUR money out.  However, should there be a banking failure, the bank gets to keep YOUR money and will give you stocks in the bank instead.  Any truth to this?

       No. When you put your money in the bank you are giving them a loan that you can call in at will rather than a structured repayment schedule, and you receive interest. They take that money and give loans, make investments etc, and that's how they're supposed to make money.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you go to withdraw your money they're just giving you money they have,
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       money payed for someone's house, the money you're receiving may be the mortgage payment for that house.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the bank collapsed and couldn't pay you, you be reimbursed by the FDIC.
