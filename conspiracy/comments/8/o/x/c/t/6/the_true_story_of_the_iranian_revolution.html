    <div class="md"><p>You are asking the right questions. I am actually doing some research on this topic and will publish something in the next couple of months on it. I&#39;ll be sure to post it here when I do. But I&#39;ll make a long story short:</p>

<p>The answer is basically this: TPTB were transitioning from dividing and conquering the world and controlling us by fear through the Cold War and the capitalism vs. communism charade to dividing and controlling us through the Islamic terrorism charade. They had been in control of Iran since at least 1925 when the first Pahlavi shah was installed by the British with Russian approval (actually the people who were <em>really</em> in control of both countries were one in the same, so those national differences don&#39;t matter that much). Anyway, they put Khomeini into position (they had been working on burnishing his reputation for quite awhile), moving him from Iraq to outside Paris where they could more easily <a href="https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/Ayatollah-Khomeini-at-Home-in-France">promote him with media attention.</a> Then they organized some mass protests in Iran in order to create a smokescreen behind which they could switch the Shah with Khomeini. </p>

<p>What do I mean by smokescreen? I mean that the Iranian revolution was not a violent one. There were a lot of protests. You would think the Shah and his vicious SAVAK would have cracked down on them, but they didn&#39;t. They just rolled over, and the Shah abdicated and left the country on his own accord. Huh? What? Why would he do that? Because that&#39;s what he was told to do. He had lived an incredible and very lavish life as Shah of Iran but now the script called for a new leader, and he exited, stage left. But the protests allowed them to be able to say that the Shah was &#39;overthrown&#39; when in fact he wasn&#39;t overthrown. He gave up in the face of some protests. (And BTW, one of his closest advisers who was also high up in the SAVAK hierarchy remained in his post at SAVAK after the revolution. Though of course you would expect that a revolution against the SHAH would have entailed getting rid of the vicious bastards in the SAVAK who were hated by the Iranian people.) </p>

<p>And then the interim government (which was NOT pro-Khomeini) for some reason allowed Khomeini to come to Iran by plane. Why would they do such a thing? That&#39;s what they were told to do. It was part of the script. They needed to install the next bogeyman, the harbinger of radical Islam. What&#39;s interesting is that if you look at current commentary on the Iranian revolution, they link it rhetorically with 9/11. Well we know 9/11 was a false flag. So was the Iranian revolution. </p>

<p>Of course the Iranian revolution was not the first stage-managed revolution in world history. If you look closely at the <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/frev.pdf">French</a> and <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/lenin.pdf">Russian</a> revolutions, what you find is that they were remarkably bloodless. In other words, the people in power hardly seem to have put up a fight to stay in power. The American revolution was also managed from behind the scenes, but there was more bloodshed. </p>

<p>Someone here commented that the last Shah was put into power after the whole Mossadegh affair, but that isn&#39;t true. You can look it up. The British put his father in power and they put him in power as well, and they remained in control the entire time, with the Shah as their pawn. The whole Mossadegh &quot;coup&quot; was theater, since at that point the Iranians weren&#39;t sovereign anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>England and the US are under the control of wealthy bankers and industrialists, whose power is (or was at that time) concentrated in the City of London and Manhattan. The Bolsheviks were all sponsored by Wall Street financiers, and the USSR was financed by Western banks throughout its existence. There&#39;s more to it but that&#39;s the basic gist. The point is that communism was a front for bankers and industrialists going back to its original formulation by <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/marx.pdf">Karl Marx.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Marx appeared to be against the bankers and industrialists. But he was controlling the opposition. You can&#39;t take people at their word. Don&#39;t listen to what they say, instead look at who they are and what they do. Marx&#39;s mother was from a very wealthy industrialist family, the Pressburgs. Her sister married into the very wealthy industrialist Philips family (you may have heard of Philips electronics -- same folks). The man she married, Karl&#39;s uncle-in-law, supported Karl financially while he was off leading a communist movement devoted to destroying bourgeois capitalists like his uncle. There is also strong indication that he was related through marriage to the Rothschilds. Karl married the daughter of one of the wealthiest German aristocratic families. And yet we are told they spent most of their lives living hand-to-mouth. </p>

<p>Karl allied with Engels, who himself came from a wealthy family and during their partnership was an owner of a sweatshop textile mill in Manchester. </p>

<p>Whatever organization Marx got involved in always got mired in petty squabbles and derailed by endless philosophical debates. He also worked as a columnist/correspondent for major mainstream American newspapers with ties to wealthy industrialists, bankers and intelligence operatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, basically. It&#39;s an age-old control strategy of divide-and-conquer: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep people angry and fearful of each other (keep them fighting among themselves). </p></li>
<li><p>Control them through fear. As Hermann Goering is supposed to have said: &quot;Naturally the common people don’t want war. But after all, it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy, and it’s always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Profit massively from defense spending, war spending, etc. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Rinse and repeat. It has been going on for a long, long time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to believe, but yes, Wall Street and London bankers were behind the communist revolution. You can get all of the details in Tragedy and Hope, or read Joe Plummer&#39;s <a href="http://www.joeplummer.com/">summary</a> which is a good deal shorter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as Quigley points out, the power structure that he exposed isn’t loyal to Communism, or Socialism, or Fascism, or capitalism. The Network is happy to exploit the rhetoric of any movement or ideology, prop up any dictator or tyrant, and support any economic or political model, provided it serves their one overarching aim. That aim, to bring “all the habitable portions of the world under their control,” is as old as the lust for power itself. The death and suffering that their policies have already caused in pursuit of this aim are incalculable. Allowing them to continue as they have will only bring more of the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mounting social discontent in the 1970s in Iran, which culminated in revolution at the end of the decade, had several crucial dimensions. Although petroleum revenues continued to be a major source of income for Iran in the 1970s, world monetary instability and fluctuations in Western oil consumption seriously threatened the country’s economy, which had been rapidly expanding since the early 1950s and was still directed in large part toward high-cost projects and programs. A decade of extraordinary economic growth, heavy government spending, and a boom in oil prices led to high rates of inflation and the stagnation of Iranians’ buying power and standard of living.</p>

<p>In addition to mounting economic difficulties, sociopolitical repression by the regime of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi likewise increased in the 1970s. Outlets for political participation were minimal, and opposition parties such as the National Front (a loose coalition of nationalists, clerics, and noncommunist left-wing parties) and the pro-Soviet Tūdeh (“Masses”) Party were marginalized or outlawed. Social and political protest was often met with censorship, surveillance, or harassment, and illegal detention and torture were common.</p>

<p>Many argued that since Iran’s brief experiment with parliamentary democracy and communist politics had failed, the country had to go back to its indigenous culture. The 1953 coup, backed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), against Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, an outspoken advocate of nationalism who almost succeeded in deposing the shah, particularly incensed Iran’s intellectuals. For the first time in more than half a century, the secular intellectuals—many of whom were fascinated by the populist appeal of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a former professor of philosophy in Qom who had been exiled in 1964 after speaking out harshly against the shah’s recent reform program—abandoned their aim of reducing the authority and power of the Shīʿite ulama (religious scholars) and argued that, with the help of the ulama, the shah could be overthrown.</p>

<p>In this environment, members of the National Front, the Tūdeh Party, and their various splinter groups now joined the ulama in a broad opposition to the shah’s regime. Khomeini continued to preach in exile about the evils of the Pahlavi regime, accusing the shah of irreligion and subservience to foreign powers. Thousands of tapes and print copies of Khomeini’s speeches were smuggled back into Iran during the 1970s as an increasing number of unemployed and working-poor Iranians—mostly new immigrants from the countryside, who were disenchanted by the cultural vacuum of modern urban Iran—turned to the ulama for guidance. The shah’s dependence on the United States, his close ties with Israel—then engaged in extended hostilities with the overwhelmingly Muslim Arab states—and his regime’s ill-considered economic policies served to fuel the potency of dissident rhetoric with the masses.</p>

<p>Outwardly, with a swiftly expanding economy and a rapidly modernizing infrastructure, everything was going well in Iran. But in little more than a generation, Iran had changed from a traditional, conservative, and rural society to one that was industrial, modern, and urban. The sense that in both agriculture and industry too much had been attempted too soon and that the government, either through corruption or incompetence, had failed to deliver all that was promised was manifested in demonstrations against the regime in 1978.</p>

<p>Revolution
In January 1978, incensed by what they considered to be slanderous remarks made against Khomeini in Eṭṭelāʿāt, a Tehrān newspaper, thousands of young madrassa (religious school) students took to the streets. They were followed by thousands more Iranian youth—mostly unemployed recent immigrants from the countryside—who began protesting the regime’s excesses. The shah, weakened by cancer and stunned by the sudden outpouring of hostility against him, vacillated between concession and repression, assuming the protests to be part of an international conspiracy against him. Many people were killed by government forces in anti-regime protests, serving only to fuel the violence in a Shīʿite country where martyrdom played a fundamental role in religious expression. Fatalities were followed by demonstrations to commemorate the customary 40-day milestone of mourning in Shīʿite tradition, and further casualties occurred at those protests, mortality and protest propelling one another forward. Thus, in spite of all government efforts, a cycle of violence began in which each death fueled further protest, and all protest—from the secular left and religious right—was subsumed under the cloak of Shīʿite Islam and crowned by the revolutionary rallying cry Allāhu akbar (“God is great”), which could be heard at protests and which issued from the rooftops in the evenings.</p>

<p>During his exile, Khomeini coordinated this upsurge of opposition—first from Iraq and after 1978 from France—demanding the shah’s abdication. In January 1979, in what was officially described as a “vacation,” the shah and his family fled Iran. The Regency Council established to run the country during the shah’s absence proved unable to function, and Prime Minister Shahpur Bakhtiar, hastily appointed by the shah before his departure, was incapable of effecting compromise with either his former National Front colleagues or Khomeini. Crowds in excess of one million demonstrated in Tehrān, proving the wide appeal of Khomeini, who arrived in Iran amid wild rejoicing on February 1. Ten days later Bakhtiar went into hiding, eventually to find exile in France.</p>

<p>Aftermath
On April 1, following overwhelming support in a national referendum, Khomeini declared Iran an Islamic republic. Elements within the clergy promptly moved to exclude their former left-wing, nationalist, and intellectual allies from any positions of power in the new regime, and a return to conservative social values was enforced. The Family Protection Act (1967; significantly amended in 1975), which provided further guarantees and rights to women in marriage, was declared void, and mosque-based revolutionary bands known as komītehs (Persian: “committees”) patrolled the streets enforcing Islamic codes of dress and behaviour and dispatching impromptu justice to perceived enemies of the revolution. Throughout most of 1979 the Revolutionary Guards—then an informal religious militia formed by Khomeini to forestall another CIA-backed coup as in the days of Mosaddeq—engaged in similar activity, aimed at intimidating and repressing political groups not under control of the ruling Revolutionary Council and its sister Islamic Republican Party, both clerical organizations loyal to Khomeini. The violence and brutality often exceeded that which had taken place under the shah.</p>

<p>The militias and the clerics they supported made every effort to suppress Western cultural influence, and, facing persecution and violence, many of the Western-educated elite fled the country. This anti-Western sentiment eventually manifested itself in the November 1979 seizure of 66 hostages at the U.S. embassy by a group of Iranian protesters demanding the extradition of the shah, who at that time was undergoing medical treatment in the United States (see Iran hostage crisis). Through the embassy takeover, Khomeini’s supporters could claim to be as “anti-imperialist” as the political left. This ultimately gave them the ability to suppress most of the regime’s left-wing and moderate opponents. The Assembly of Experts (Majles-e Khobregān), overwhelmingly dominated by clergy, ratified a new constitution the following month. The new constitution created a religious government based on Khomeini’s vision of velāyat-e faqīh (Persian: “governance of the jurist”) and gave sweeping powers to the rahbar, or leader; the first rahbar was Khomeini himself. Moderates, such as provisional Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan and the republic’s first president, Abolhasan Bani-Sadr, who opposed holding the hostages, were steadily forced from power by conservatives within the government who questioned their revolutionary zeal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fara Mansoor has all of the dirty details if you want to look into it. Here is a <a href="http://transmissionsmedia.com/a-rigged-revolution-how-the-shadow-cia-mi6-network-put-khomeini-and-militant-islamists-in-power/">summary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>President Jimmy Carter fired George H. W. Bush as Director of the CIA along with 800 CIA operatives who were essentially a government onto themselves. After the CIA’s assassination of President Kennedy this secret group had taken control of America’s foreign and domestic policy, so being fired by Carter was a huge slap in the face.</p></li>
<li><p>Former CIA director Richard Helms was the U.S. ambassador to Iran from April 1973 – January 1977. He was a close friend of the Shah and General Hossein Fardoust, who was the head of SAVAK, Iran’s intelligence and security agency, for ten years. All three men went to the same school together in Switzerland so they had a long relationship with each other.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>During his stay as Ambassador, Helms discovered through Fardoust that the Shah had cancer. The political and security implications of this news were too big to announce to the public. The obvious question arose: Who would succeed the Shah?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Helms went back to his colleagues in the shadow CIA with the news that the Shah was going to die soon. The shadow CIA, led by Bush, did not inform President Carter of this news. They were still mad that they got fired. So they decided to take the course of revenge by humiliating Carter on the international stage and removing him from the White House.</p></li>
<li><p>A top-secret plan was drawn. The shadow CIA and MI6 helped Khomeini become the main opposition leader against the Shah by raising his public profile through the BBC. Also, some false flag attacks were committed in Iran by Islamists, backed by CIA operatives, that were blamed on the Shah to further discredit his regime and embolden the opposition to hit the streets. Eventually, the historical tide turned in favor of Khomeini.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, Khomeini didn’t disclose to his brainwashed followers that the CIA and MI6 were manipulating the historical currents for him from behind the scenes. His main motivation was to take power, not to bring freedom to Iran or resist the “Great Satan.” He was happy to shake hands with the devil.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One of the shadow CIA operatives that Mansoor says helped bring Khomeini to power is Professor and author Richard Cottam (1924 – 1997) who worked in the Department of Political Science in the University of Pittsburgh as a scholar of Iranian politics. He also played a key role in the 1953 coup against Mohammad Mosaddegh by the CIA and MI6. </p></li>
<li><p>The Iranian hostage taking was politically staged and instigated by the operatives in the shadow CIA. Mansoor says this was done by the Bush loyalists in the CIA for two reasons in particular: consolidate power for Khomeini and make him the unquestioned leader of Iran, and humiliate President Carter as an act of revenge for firing 800 CIA operatives, and put George H. W. Bush in the White House to carry out the new world order agenda.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>On the day Reagan was elected President, Khomeini was ordered to set the hostages free. And as soon as Reagan became President, Vice President Bush took control of the White House. Two months into Reagan’s presidency, Bush hired John Hinckley, Jr. to assassinate Reagan, but he failed. The connections between the Bush family and the Hinckley family are well known. Visit this website for more detail.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Both Khomeini and George H. W. Bush were made leaders of their countries by illegitimate and secret means. They are among history’s biggest traitors, mass murderers and liars.</p>
