I don&#39;t want to link to any News articles cause they are all garbage but if you Google the theories are flying from even well known outlets &quot;The Guardian,&quot; and &quot;CNN.&quot; But one of my friends posted this and thought I would share, I wonder what&#39;s going on here.... I didn&#39;t even know she was &#39;in the hospital?&#39; </p>

<p>Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, not for the upvotes just wanted to create a healthy conversation. She&#39;s an intelligent quite woman, you can see from body language she isn&#39;t a bitch so in my head I truly feel for her and hope that the surgery was health and not a suicide attempt. I&#39;ve only seen videos of her being very cordial with everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll check this one out. Thanks for sharing. I guess a lot is going on... </p>

<p>What a crazy world we live in, where people can make shit jokes and get away with it or be as evil as hell as they want behind a screen. </p>

<p>Topic aside, I&#39;ve been reading other posts in here today and some have been creating SOME good conversation. I just wish things that were posted to generate conversation wouldn&#39;t get an automatic downvote. Like u/PickUpTheBass said it&#39;s wild how Assange has gone missing, etc. I never downvote in here, everyone just wants to have a decent conversation based on topics that interest them.   </p>

<p>Just looked at that link and yeah, that would seem to fit a lot better than the rest of the title posts I&#39;ve been reading, I hate giving news outlets that click that they want... I just hate it so I read titles but I refuse to click the shitty ones that you know are phrased to get you in... </p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>She was seen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/us/politics/trump-korea-detainees-pompeo.html">May 10th</a> at Joint Base Andrews and according to The Hill, she was <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/390497-melania-trump-plans-to-attend-event-with-gold-star-families-on-monday">seen May 19th</a> in public.</p>

<p>She&#39;s expected to attend Gold Star event today so I guess we&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically your assuming everyone hates her for being there? Kim has done a lot of wonderful charity work. My point was if Kim is seen at the White House, pretty sure the wife would of loved to be there as well. Again, she just had surgery, celebrities are seen (once again, I hate using that word because they are just normal people like us) but there are always pictures everywhere. Kanye gets out of a rehab center and pics everywhere, Selena has a kidney transplant, pictures everywhere. It&#39;s called concern, wondering if the person is okay, I saw this on my timeline, found it interesting and was hoping for an intelligent response from some people that may have an idea.  </p>

<p>News always like to report shit for money. I don&#39;t read the stupid negative media. I posted it out of the &quot;WTF is she okay,&quot; mindset. Like I said, I didn&#39;t even know she was not seen since May 10 (or whatever). It&#39;s just a conversation. We don&#39;t know everything, we don&#39;t know the details but the community here is about discussing and that&#39;s fine.   </p>

<p>Calm. </p>
