       I woke up to my Facebook wall filled with different posts from people suggesting that Melina Trump is missing? I don't want to link to any News articles cause they are all garbage but if you Google the theories are flying from even well known outlets "The Guardian," and "CNN." But one of my friends posted this and thought I would share, I wonder what's going on here.... I didn't even know she was 'in the hospital?'

       Thoughts?

       Well, a person just had surgery and people are talking about it, whether they care or not shouldn't matter. It's IS SHE OKAY, don't take this to a whole new level for no reason. If any celebrity has had surgery (AND I HATE USING THAT WORD) they are always seen, there are always pictures. It was on my timeline, I found it interesting, therefore, I shared it.

       You said she disappeared from cameras for 4 months. That's not true. Not holding a press conference does not mean that she wasn't photographed day in and day out for the entire campaign.

       It's not really a procedure you need 3 weeks to recover from. I'm not really worried about it but it's definitely odd that people haven't seen her at all. And that weird as fake tweet from her twitter that was clearly written in Trump lingo.

       Is this the new agenda out of all the shit kicking off really? Trumps.missus of all things when she's just been in hospital for a operation. Why not where the fuck has assange gone or why paedophile posts get instantly downvoted on this sub? You wrote trump and instantly got 5 upvotes under one minute when everything else in new gets downvoted?

       Yea, not for the upvotes just wanted to create a healthy conversation. She's an intelligent quite woman, you can see from body language she isn't a bitch so in my head I truly feel for her and hope that the surgery was health and not a suicide attempt. I've only seen videos of her being very cordial with everyone.

       While we haven't seen her in a while, that's true and when we did see her she was smacking his hand away...

       It's still a little too early to be really worried if you cared to be. Getting away from the media completely for a month sounds like a nice vacation.

       As far as we know, she could be struggling and doubt besets her when her husband was on video saying he can do whatever he wants, "grabbing bitches by the pussy", because he's famous. Or about Stomy D.

       There's a lot of theories. Official statement is kidney surgery. Trump beat her. She was a leaker and got caught...

      <p>
       But if I had to choose a theory... it's either nothing or she is with her rumored lover for a month.

       What a crazy world we live in, where people can make shit jokes and get away with it or be as evil as hell as they want behind a screen.

      <p>
       Topic aside, I've been reading other posts in here today and some have been creating SOME good conversation. I just wish things that were posted to generate conversation wouldn't get an automatic downvote. Like u/PickUpTheBass said it's wild how Assange has gone missing, etc. I never downvote in here, everyone just wants to have a decent conversation based on topics that interest them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just looked at that link and yeah, that would seem to fit a lot better than the rest of the title posts I've been reading, I hate giving news outlets that click that they want... I just hate it so I read titles but I refuse to click the shitty ones that you know are phrased to get you in...

       So basically your assuming everyone hates her for being there? Kim has done a lot of wonderful charity work. My point was if Kim is seen at the White House, pretty sure the wife would of loved to be there as well. Again, she just had surgery, celebrities are seen (once again, I hate using that word because they are just normal people like us) but there are always pictures everywhere. Kanye gets out of a rehab center and pics everywhere, Selena has a kidney transplant, pictures everywhere. It's called concern, wondering if the person is okay, I saw this on my timeline, found it interesting and was hoping for an intelligent response from some people that may have an idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       News always like to report shit for money. I don't read the stupid negative media. I posted it out of the "WTF is she okay," mindset. Like I said, I didn't even know she was not seen since May 10 (or whatever). It's just a conversation. We don't know everything, we don't know the details but the community here is about discussing and that's fine.
