<p>Oh. Well in that case, flat earth must be a pys-op. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so funny, it&#39;s usually the same people that demand evidence and sources before believing anything. </p>

<p>When it&#39;s comes to flat earth. They just know it&#39;s a pys-op and it&#39;s based on nothing other than opinion on what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>So basically it holds up as much as flat earth does. Which, depending on your point of view, is not at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My army? Will you tell them that because are not listening to me.</p>

<p>Me neither. At this point. It could be a pys-op, it could be flat. It probably is globe shaped.</p>

<p>Anything other than that is just annoying. To some kind of the outside meaning I&#39;m not that into science or religion. When people just know shit because they were taught it in high school, its not too far away from people who know shit because the big book says so.</p>

<p>Check this is out</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eDNXh2j6U_w">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eDNXh2j6U_w</a></p>

<p>That is crazy. Notice the seating? It&#39;s in the flat earth model. Antarctica going around and North pole in the centre. That had that seating for the whole show I imagine. So 10 weeks for that 2 minutes rant. Sure, that could be part of the pys-op. </p>

<p>Listen to and watch this.</p>

<p>Owl city firefly </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=psuRGfAaju4">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=psuRGfAaju4</a> 
Listen and watch this. </p>

<p>That is a flat earth song. What are you seeing? The train track is in the shape of flat earth, the snow globe, the numerous spinning globe things, rockets, space, dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Listen to the lyrics </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
It&#39;s hard to say that I&#39;d rather stay awake when I&#39;m asleep
&#39;Cause everything is never as it seems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That came out in 2009, I was only a kid. It was long before I knew anything about flat earth. Again it could be part of the pys-op.</p>

<p>And finally, there has been too many things from NASA that make me think they are full of shit about something.</p>

<p>If there isn&#39;t something to hide like flat earth or hollow earth or something else entirely why are they so snakey? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it is flat. I don&#39;t even look into it anymore. Like I&#39;ve seen enough. Now I&#39;ll just wait and see what happens. Not going to say I&#39;m positive it&#39;s a globe because I&#39;d feel a right spoon if it isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an open-minded conspiracy enthusiast.  </p>

<p>If I am presented with an idea, no matter how far fetched or even how offensive the theory might be, I am absolutely willing <em>and interested</em> in openly discussing the theory.</p>

<p>The holes in flat Earth theory are basically</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why is Earth the only flat planet?  You can go in your backyard and watch the other planets be spheroids with a telescope.</p></li>
<li><p>How do stars fit into the theory?  Is the Geocentric model of the universe correct?  Even if it does, how do their motions make any sense?</p></li>
<li><p>If the Earth is flat and the sun and moon move around the surface, how do the motions of the planets (that we can watch with that telescope in our backyard) make any sense?</p></li>
<li><p>What about all those YouTube videos of people strapping goPros to weather balloons and videotaping the round Earth from launch?  Why not do that and prove the Earth is flat?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you ever been in an airplane?  Tickets are about $100 and you can see the curvature of the Earth from cruising altitude.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These basic questions not only don&#39;t have answers (not even conspiracy answers), but anyone who sincerely believes in this not only should have already considered them, but should have serious doubts in their own theory because of them.</p>

<p><strong><em>OP&#39;s conspiracy theory on the other hand.</em></strong></p>

<p>Makes vague sense in the thinking of lumping conspiracy theorists in with &quot;those nutjob flat Earthers&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to the theory that PizzaGate was a false flag to misdirect attention of child trafficking away from Washington DC.  Now whenever a Democrat is accused of pedophilia, PizzaGate is evoked and derailing arguments are had.</p>

<li><p>Stars are just holes in the firmament that allow some kind of cymatic light to come through, they are not actually round. The geocentric model is not correct because the other planets and the moon are fake.</p></li>
<li><p>All the cameras showing the curvature use fish-eye lenses to fake the curviture and airplane windows are curved to do the same thing. </p></li>

<p>I fully believe that the “flat earth is a psyop” is a psyop because researching flat earth leads into finding the deception of scientism not just the shape of the earth, tying into things such as the moon and mars rover landings. </p>

<p>We are told to believe everything from people like Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson with out asking any questions. But, once you start asking for undeniable proof of their extraordinary claims, you find that a lot of their claims have as much “proof” as the “flat earthers” have.  </p>

<p>I’m a photographer. I deal with barrel distortion correction every day.</p>

<p>If you attach a GoPro to a weather balloon, the fisheye effect would invert itself once the horizon goes lower than halfway down the image. It would appear to curve upwards on the edges, and the effect would become more pronounced the closer you get to the bottom of the image. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if a satirical Flat Earth theory promoter wanted to mess with you, it would be absolutely trivial to autocorrect a curved image of a horizon and make it look flat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah basically. Though that’s a pretty extreme fisheye, and would overpower whatever natural curvature the earth has.</p>

<p>Whenever you see a picture of a curved horizon from a weather balloon, and the horizon is either in the middle of the frame or the lower half, then it cannot be barrel distortion that’s doing it. Because that isn’t how barrel distortion works. </p>

<p>The fact so many users are attacking you means you’re right</p>

<p>Flat earth is attacked constantly. Nobody attacks hollow earth, ever. All shapes and sizes and alternative Earth theories are allowed, discussed without mudslinging, except for one shape...... flat. For <em>some reason,</em> it&#39;s one of the most attacked conspiracy theories. If it&#39;s a CIA psyop, they better learn about the Streisand effect because the endless attacks are drawing quite the attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a flat earther uh, I just find it very interesting to nuance the debate and see how the real science works instead of just relying on what is said to be true. :)</p>

<p>Actually the Eratosthenes experiment would work wonders in a flat earth model, but would give you the earth-to-sun distance instead of earth&#39;s criconference. But you would in fact face the exact same observations.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t really prove a model being right 100&amp;#37;. In science, a model is right until it&#39;s proven to be false :) Thus, for those two reasons, the Eratosthenes example is not a good starting point to prove the earth is round, especially if cited alone and without linking it to other concepts or comparing it to other models.</p>

<p>From a pure zetetical point of view, your argument is not much different from a belief. :)</p>

<p>Long story short, the FBI seized a large Child pornography server then continued to run it with the intent of downloading malware onto a user&#39;s computer. In doing so, they greatly increased the amount of child porn available on the web. Also, it was prolly so that they could blackmail anyone powerful who downloaded it.</p>

<p>I watched a few people involved in conspiracies on YouTube posting about this around 3 years ago and the ran a honeytrap to catch a bunch of bots to further investigate. It&#39;s an intelligence agency as it&#39;s just not human the crap they comment out. Or it&#39;s a bot-farm in India or there&#39;s a lot more idiots out there than I could&#39;ve ever imagined.</p>

<p>i was initially very skeptical of the hollow earth as a possibility until i saw this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxyfiBGCwhQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxyfiBGCwhQ</a>
this imho means it has to be considered as a possibility. though this would require earth to have had a much faster spin initially (though a slow down after formation could be explained by the moon formation theory with another similar sized planetoid impact.)</p>

<p>you assume the theory (which is what it is until they have direct evidence) is 100% complete and all of the math does work out, which it does not, all of this deep earth science is theoretical  just because you know how a wave comes out the other side does not mean you know exactly what has happened to it along the way.</p>

<p>smfh. how did you make it this far unable to form a sentence?
you also don&#39;t seem to understand much about the physics actually involved in drilling. yes temperature can be related to pressure, but clearly you have no fucking clue how because it doesnt apply in this case.</p>

<p>the reason drilling can only go so deep is it is the motherfucking mantle and its made up of liquid fucking iron thus the drill melt... the pressure has nothing to do with why it cant be done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is a topic you&#39;re actually interested in, a guy named Jan Lamprecht did a computer modeling study which showed that seismology works <em>better</em> on a hollow earth model, with less hand waving and post hoc attachments than our current standard multi-core model.  It&#39;s about an hour (skip to 5 minutes to shave some time :), but it&#39;s very interesting, if this topic is an interest of yours.</p>

<p>Virtually no-one outside the sciences could check the Earth&#39;s curvature for themselves, and I dare say that most of them wouldn&#39;t even know how to begin. </p>

<p>This essay by George Orwell is a bit of a personal favourite, because it shows the level of self-criticism he was capable of. (It&#39;s also refreshing to quote him for non-dystopian reasons for a change.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SOMEWHERE or other—I think it is in the preface to Saint Joan—Bernard Shaw remarks that we are more gullible and superstitious today than we were in the Middle Ages, and as an example of modern credulity he cites the widespread belief that the earth is round. The average man, says Shaw, can advance not a single reason for thinking that the earth is round. He merely swallows this theory because there is something about it that appeals to the twentieth-century mentality.</p>

<p>Now, Shaw is exaggerating, but there is something in what he says, and the question is worth following up, for the sake of the light it throws on modern knowledge. Just why do we believe that the earth is round? I am not speaking of the few thousand astronomers, geographers and so forth who could give ocular proof, or have a theoretical knowledge of the proof, but of the ordinary newspaper-reading citizen, such as you or me [...]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perspective on a flat disk would be n viewing distance where n is an infinite number. There would be no horizon, looking out on the pacific ocean in California would mean you could see all of the Asian Continent, Australia, even the ice wall at the right viewing angle.</p>

<p>The only thing that can cause a horizon effect is a curved surface, by calculating your total sight line on a level surface (around 3 miles for a 6ft tall person) you can then calculate the curvature of the Earth. If the Earth was a curved or bulging disk, this distance would be different depending on location, but it&#39;s not. If you get the same distance to horizon on a level surface regardless of location, then you get a ball or spheroid of some type.</p>

<p>This again you can calculate for your self by standing at any beach.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you have an even simpler test. If the Earth is a disk, then the sun would orbit around that disk, and once it disappears off the edge, you could not see it again for 24 hours.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the case though. If you lie down on a beach and watch the sun set, stand up and you can see the sun set again, if you use a cherry picker or other such elevating mechanism you can have multiple sunsets in a single day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok that’s fair enough. </p>

<p>So we agree you can see and measure the curvature. So why when viewing a mountain from a distance it doesn’t curve downwards ie if a mountain is 70 miles away it should be half a mile curve. Yet it isn’t ?  This is measured in what’s called the mountain experiment. </p>

<p>Now even according to NASA (we have to start somewhere I guess) the curve of the earth isn’t visible until you reach over 50,000 ft. Yet from a plane we see a 200 mike straight horizon with no measurable curve. Yet we see it from the beach ? </p>

<p>Now I’m not trying to be argumentative. It’s genuine curiosity as there seems to be one or two flaws with both models if I’m honest. As for infinite stars ? It’s not the same thing and I have my own opinion of stars but that’s not for now </p>

<p>I am misunderstanding your use of the term curve, do you think everything on a curved surface also has to be curved?</p>

<p>So let&#39;s take mountain X with a height of about 14,000 freedom units. At 70 miles (assuming you&#39;re 6 feet tall) we know that around 3000 freedom units of mountain are obscured by the earth (this wouldn&#39;t equal an angle or a curve, it would simply appear shorter.)</p>

<p>At 70 miles out and approximately 11,000 freedom units you can expect angular size to be about 1.7 degrees, where as with the full mountain without a curve it would only be about 2.2 degrees. </p>

<p>At 70 miles you wouldn&#39;t be able to make out much of the object either way, any fine details would be lost at that distance so you wouldn&#39;t expect to see a curve even if there was one to be seen. Like when you tilt a coke can 22.X degrees away from you on a curved surface like a baseball. The can doesn&#39;t magically become curved, it simply appears shorter.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re entirely misunderstanding so much. If you have a flat surface, you have no horizon, you have absolutely 0 horizon, you can see as far as infinity until something gets in your way. However if you have a curved surface and something small goes over a horizon you start to see it disappear bottom to top. We know the ocean is about as level as it gets, because water rests at the most level point. If water is level, why do ships disappear over the horizon?</p>

<p>People in 4,000 BC could figure this out, why is it difficult for you?</p>

<p>By your own statement you explain why flat earth being a prominent conspiracy theory is a problem for introducing normies into the fold of the conspiracy movement. By flat earth&#39;s logic one cannot determine the validity of either the globe or flat earth theories. Nonetheless, most people are not willing to accept the flat earth theory currently, and refusing to accept that is detrimental to helping people catch onto more meaningful conspiracy theories which people actually CAN determine to be truthful in current time without special equipment through simple researching and reading of declassified documents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone who claims to be a flat earth believer, but I personally do believe it to be true. Primarily because of the inconsistencies in scientific explanations and my personal observations when trying to verify the earths supposed shape and movement for myself. Not to mention the many examples of government/scientific establishment deceptions against the masses throughout history.             </p>

<p>One particular example of their claims not making much sense to me is earths supposed spin on its axis and orbit around the sun. I think we can all agree that throughout our lives, we have been taught that the earth does a 360 degree spin on its axis once a day and a 360 degree orbit around the sun once a year. Seems reasonable right? Well lets take a look at how that would look from a birds eye view.       </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JP6KEeN.jpg">HERE</a> is a link to an admittedly crude diagram of the above mentioned orbital cycle that we were all taught.         </p>

<p>The orange circle represents the sun.<br/>
The blue circle represents the earth.<br/>
The black radial line in the blue circle meets with the black circumference line of the blue circle to represent a constant point on the earths surface.<br/>
The black circle around the sun represents the orbital path, which may or may not be numbered correctly, as I honestly don&#39;t remember if the orbit is clockwise or counterclockwise, but for the purposes of this diagram, it makes no difference.<br/>
And the numbers represent the 12 months of the year. Again, its a crude model, so please bare with my spacing.              </p>

<p>Now, lets say that the constant point on all the earths in the diagram is...idk...Texas. Texas at 12 pm. Number 1 is earths orientation on 1-1-2018 at 12pm.     </p>

<p>Again, as we are taught, the earth will spin 360 degrees on its axis once per day, which means that on 1-2-2018 at 12pm the constant point (texas) will still be facing in the same direction in 3d space as it was the day before at the same time, though it will also be further along its orbital path (black line around the sun).       </p>

<p>So whats the issue with this? Well just look at the earths orientation once its far enough along the orbital path. What the scientific establishment would have us believe is that on 6-1-2018, ( or because of my shitty spacing on the crude diagram, 7-1-2018) Texas would be facing away from the sun...at noon. Can you see how that assertion is problematic considering what we humans have observed year in and year out for generation after generation?     </p>

<p>Granted, my diagram is crude, and granted the time it takes the earth to rotate on its axis inst exactly 24 hours, nor is the time it takes the earth to orbit around the sun exactly 365 days. But even with the exact numbers (which as a side note are not whole numbers), surly it has to be inconsistent with what humans have observed year in and year out for generation after generation. Otherwise our calendar system/seasons would be way way off. So much so that after relatively short periods of time, summers would be cold and winters would be hot.      </p>

<p>This is just one example that helped me come to the conclusion that at the very least, the earth is not a spinning globe. But it is certainly not the only one. For anyone who can read this comment objectively and start to understand why the flat earth community is generally not a troll community, but actually believes what they are saying, I would suggest Eric Dubay&#39;s video book, [200 Proofs the Earth Is Not spinning Ball] if you are interested in learning more. There is a metric shit ton of misinfo for this subject on the web, and legions of shills/trolls that will trip over themselves to regurgitate theoretical &quot;science&quot; and berate all flat earthers with personal attacks, but Eric&#39;s video book is by far the most objective, and a great place to start your research if you are so inclined.  </p>

<p>Just wanted to drop this here, the earth actually rotates in roughly 23 hours and 56 minutes but the extra 4 minutes in our clocks bring the sun to the same position as before (accounting for the distance traveled relative to the sun) so our clocks stay sync&#39;ed with where the sun is. Basically each &quot;day&quot; we actually rotate a tiny bit more than once.</p>

<p>In official doctrine at least. </p>

<p>1: Receivers a bit apart from each other detecting the same signal will detect slightly different frequency shifts.</p>

<p>2: GPS is one way so there is no way for the transmitters to know what is receiving them.</p>

<p>3: GPS software is free and open for you to see and you can test it using a software defined radio yourself. You don&#39;t even need the GPS software.</p>

<p>4: The frequency shift exactly matches a transmitter moving at the speeds the GPS birds are said to orbit.</p>

<p>Everything you imagine satellites doing would be easier, cheaper, and actually based in physical reality by using a ground based network. There are cell/radio/microwave towers nearly everywhere. There are thousands of miles worth of fiber lines running across the ocean floors to connect continents. And the network keeps expanding. There is 0 reason to have a satellite system, even if it were possible....which it isn&#39;t.       </p>

<p>They don&#39;t. They are transmitted from stationary towers and the like. Again, there is some usage of mobile transmitters such as aircraft on a very limited basis, but the vast majority of signals are sent from stationary ground based towers. Think about it man, how does a satellite even have the power capacity to transmit a signal from 22000 miles away, let alone transmit multiple signals to different locations simultaneously? Solar cells? lol...come on.             </p>

<blockquote>
<p>satellite TV.       </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever notice how dishes you see on people houses are pointed at roughly a 45 degree angle? That is because they are pointed towards the ground based tower that is transmitting the signal in the area. They are NOT receiving a signal from something 22000 miles above them.       </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You haven&#39;t provided any evidence of why that isn&#39;t possible.       </p>

<p>There are a number of reasons the will go deeper into the whole flat earth argument. But the primary reason why it wouldn&#39;t be possible with the globe earth model is because satellites would not be able to maintain their orbit, which ties in directly to the cost efficiency of an orbital based network. Not to mention that they would not even be able to get to those altitudes in the first place, as rockets would not be able to generate thrust in a 0 pressure environment, which they would experience at about 20 miles up.       </p>

<p>Some people swear they see these satellites with the naked eye, which is ridiculous. Imagine trying to see something that is roughly the size of a school bus from 20 miles away...now imagine try to do the same thing when it is 22000 miles away....both scenarios are laughable.      </p>

<p>Again, there is nothing about a orbital sat network that would be superior to a ground based network. It would be more complex, more expensive and less effective. It is a lie.       </p>

<p>Except that isn&#39;t true which you can see via the Doppler shift in the signal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No.  Because it varies depending on where they are on the planet.  Shockingly enough the closer you get to the equator the higher they point and one the equator they damn near point straight up.</p>

In case you missed it, <a href="https://youtu.be/EiBJBVBez_w">here</a> it is again. Give it an objective watch/listen. Try to put aside what you &quot;know&quot; and focus on what makes actual sense when considering what you have observed and experienced in our physical reality. I get that its hard to let go of something you have believed for so long, but it is possible. I myself use to find all this flat earth stuff crazy, but when you really start being honest about what you &quot;know&quot;, what you observe and what you can prove, the truth is very clear....globe earth is a lie.        </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t wrong about the dishes...the angles will change depending on the elevation of the transmission tower it is pointed at. Most of them will point at about a 45 degree angle. I have never seen one that is working that is also pointed straight up....      </p>

<p>And speaking of deflecting...what power source do these supposed sats use to transmit multiple signals to multiple targets from ~22,000 miles away? Is it impossible for multiple ground based towers to track the weather by sending signals up, as opposed to your sats flying around a globe and sending signals down?      </p>

<p>Tell me how many times you see the word &quot;satellite&quot; in either of those articles.         </p>

<p>So how much power is needed to transmit the supposed satellite signals? And what is the satellites power source? And since you never answered, how does one generate thrust in a 0 pressure environment? And if the globe model was accurate, how does earths gravity not pull the satellites right back down to earth?       </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why don&#39;t you find the picture and link it? Then show me proof of the location of the picture, and that the dish was working while pointing straight up. Then prove to me the only way that would be possible is if there were satellites floating above us....       </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Correct, but watching and listening to it is. There is a lot of information in there. A lot of it is just Eric quoting Academics throughout history. That&#39;s right...there are plenty of academics, even today, who do not buy into the globe earth model. Again...maybe if you could just set aside what you think you know for a couple hours and actually listen to a conflicting world view, maybe you would be able to see the inconsistencies in the globe earth model and the logic in the flat earth model...        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesnt even matter. If you dont look with a zoom, it doesnt really go over the curve before it is too small to see in our vision. You will only see it when you use a zoom. So when it sinks down the horizon when you are behind the telescope, it has gone over the curvature and a bigger zoom wont bring it back.</p>
