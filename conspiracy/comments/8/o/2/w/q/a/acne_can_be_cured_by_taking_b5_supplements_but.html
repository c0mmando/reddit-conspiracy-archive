<p>Then I stumbled on a forum post suggesting taking high doses of Pantothenic Acid. Sure enough, after years of living with this, my skin cleared up within a few weeks. It&#39;s been clear now for maybe 4 years, with only taking low doses now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took Accutane for 6 months as a teen. At that point i had tried every vitamin, perscription oral, ointment, cream known to mankind. I went from having cronic crater acne that looked like id been burnt to have clear skin with very minor scarring. I suffered for well over half a decade and that stuff was a godsend for me when every other avenue had been exploited to the full.y acne was really really bad. I took 3 courses over a 6 month period increasing dosage each time. I had to get blood work done weekly due to its effect on liver. Was always fine and never a problem and ive had my liver profile taken as an adult mutliple times and everything is within a standard range. I know its hard on the liver but just wanted to give a differeing perspective as that drug changed my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your comment. I can&#39;t believe these guys are attacking me and making out I am an undercover accutane agent. lol I was literally just posting my personal experience as someone mentioned it first. I personally think its a good drug but should only be given to the very worst cases and only once all avenues have been exacerbated. Hardly saying everyone with a zit should start poping a accutane capsule. If you look at my post history that suggestion of me being undercover is so beyond funny and ridiculous. I don&#39;t think they appreciate how bad my actual case was; I wasn&#39;t a teen with a few spots it was chronic. I actually acknowledged the research around that links it with liver damage in high doses and long term. First time ive posted in this subreddit and probably the last now lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. I also took accutane (about 5/6 years ago). Got kicked off it before the end of my course due to liver problems. Luckily, my liver bounced back quickly. It definitely helped my acne, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the risks. Am I glad I took it? Yes. Would I advise others to take it? No.</p>

I literally was just stating my personal experience and acknowledged  the liver links but was accused or being an undercover agent and or paid shill. I would only recommend it in the most severe cases where all other treatment options have been exacerbated and if patient understands research into side effects etc and they make an informed choice.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a dangerous drug, but it does have a purpose. Consumers should go in understanding all of the potential risks. Doctors should be diligent to monitor the patient. My doctor didn&#39;t push me to go on it, I chose to go in it (it had worked well for my brother). She was very honest about all of the potential risks and monitored me very closely. </p>

<p>I think some people are so anti-pharma that they are blinded to the potential positives. I&#39;m very glad accutane worked for you! It&#39;s not an easy drug to take (i.e. bloodwork, pregnancy tests, appointments, and sex ed quizzes - all monthly). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Just the ones who write like that.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry sharing my personal experience and the way i write gets you into such a state. You sound dramatic and crazy. For full disclosure as you still dont get it; I don&#39;t think any pharmaceutical company is amazing. If you had bothered to read everything i have written in this thread you would see i even referenced doctors pushing antibiotics on people when it was unjustified and how worrying this is. As we are facing a crisis where simple infections in the near future won&#39;t be able to be treated as everyone will be resistant. I agreed with another guy about companies pushing meds for money etc. I don&#39;t think you appreciate i wasnt a guy with a few zits. I had chronic acne. Crators. Angry and imflammed (like your posts). Really bad. I have some little scars now but fortuntely they are not that bad at all. I also have said i think it is a drug that should be used ONLY in very select severe cases where all other options have been exacerbated. Not every person with a zit should now pop one because hallelujah its a miracle accutane rules the world. I also acknowledged the scientific studies to high dosage/long term usage and liver damage. Do i still sound like an undercover accutane rep or paid shill. I was homestly just giving my experience. I&#39;m genuinelly sorry ive worked you up so much by just stating my personal experience whilst also acknowledging facts. Today was first time i posted here and prob the last as its depressing getting responses like yours. To suggest I&#39;m  some undercover agent or whatever, you sound like a complete nut job. Goodnight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you man. Sometimes pharmaceuticals are necessary. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t change the fact that they actively suppress scientific research to increase their bottom line. At best, they&#39;re benevolently evil and, at worst, they&#39;re actively hiding cures for shit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not one of those ppl who believes that there&#39;s an aids or cancer cure that the government is actively hiding but shit man, if there was and pharmaceutical companies thought it wasn&#39;t profitable, they would hide that information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t actually disagree with what you are saying at all, was just laying out my experience with that drug. With chronic long term acne I wouldn&#39;t be convinced there is a cure. Researching at the time that appeared the only thing avaliable that even helped, but it cured as well. I know there was some documented links to mental health issues as well although that is always a difficult one to judge. With milder cases I am sure there is stuff that can be much more effective without putting someone on accutane. Also i know alot of docs here in UK perscribe antibiotics like erythromycin for even mild acne. Studies show it is only effective in very small amounts so obviously it is bad that doctors are dishing it out like sweets and backs up your point re: companies and money. Its very worrying when the world is soon going to have a major problem with simple infections as no antobiotics are going to work.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly how I read it. &quot;Like, don&#39;t get me wrong, the drug is really bad for people, and I tried <em>everything</em>(even though thats extremely unlikely in todays age) and this drug <em>totally helped me</em> and even though <sup>It&#39;s</sup> bad on my liver, I just like.. it worked!

    <div class="md"><p>I will post to you what i just replied to the other dude as only you 2 seem to be struggling to get my post.</p>

<p>&quot;You sound heated lol.</p>

<p>Um yes scientifically there are links to some liver damage with high long term doses of vitamin A which is literally what that drug is. Apparently its just a slight alteration of the structure. Anyway that&#39;s why you are tested weekly, like i was when you are on it. Well that was the case almost 20 years ago in the UK, because that&#39;s when it was in my case. During treatment my full liver profile was always fine. Fact. As stated, I&#39;ve had blood work done a fair few times as an adult, and again everything has always been fine. So i took it for half a year with no bad effects. Fact. That is my experience in regards to taking it and the effect on my liver. There was no effect. Fact.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know what i am providing? I will clarify for your benefit, as bar you and 1 other person everyone else seems to get the context. It was my personal experience of a drug that was mentioned. That&#39;s what i was providing. It worked after 5 years of using every other vitamin, ointment/cream on the market, that had failed. My face didn&#39;t just have spots it was very severe acne- like i said, it looked like i was burnt. I even got pulled from class one day at secondary school, as it was so red and inflammed the teacher was worried &#39;if something was going on at home etc.&#39; Looked like someone had held me down and burnt me with an iron or something. So yeah it was traumatic at the time as a 15 year old. No one wants to take pills out of choice, but for me it was having a dreadful effect on my life. As soon as i was refferred to a good dermatologist they put me straight on it. Apart from the acne they said i would be badly scarred if it was left, so i should take it, as there was no other alternative left at that point, as every other avenue had been exacerbated. Yes i know you don&#39;t care about my feelings! lol but I&#39;m just giving the context on why i ended up taking the drug and my experience. My liver is fine; perfect I&#39;ve been told by medical professionals. Fact. The bloodwork backs it up so no one needs to worry about my liver! So it doesn&#39;t appear to have effected me in anyway apart from do the job it was meant to. I can&#39;t speak for others experience. As i say it was a god send for me. The situation vs possible side effects was an easy decision.</p>

<p>As for your last comment i know we are on the conspiracy sub reddit but goodness me what you said is just silly;- I think any person with a couple of brain cells can take a few seconds to check over my reddit account; the huge amount of comments I&#39;ve made and the subjects. By doing this it will become pretty evident to most that I am not an undercover accutane agent in disguise. lol Not sure anyone actually doing such a thing would comment 100&#39;s of times for months about subjects such as liverpool football club, game of thrones, south park, funko pops, lgbt issues, cryptocurrency, politics, etc etc, then just to comment ONCE about Accutane, and after someone else mentioned it first! Oh whoops you got me. Gimme me a break.&quot;</p>

It was my personal experience of a drug that was mentioned. That&#39;s what i was providing. It worked after 5 years of using every other vitamin, ointment/cream on the market, that had failed. My face didn&#39;t just have spots it was very severe acne- like i said, it looked like i was burnt. I even got pulled from class one day at secondary school, as it was so red and inflammed the teacher was worried &#39;if something was going on at home etc.&#39; Looked like someone had held me down and burnt me with an iron or something. So yeah it was traumatic at the time as a 15 year old. No one wants to take pills out of choice, but for me it was having a dreadful effect on my life. As soon as i was refferred to a good dermatologist they put me straight on it. Apart from the acne they said i would be badly scarred if it was left, so i should take it, as there was no other alternative left at that point, as every other avenue had been exacerbated. Yes i know you don&#39;t care about my feelings! lol but I&#39;m just giving the context on why i ended up taking the drug and my experience. My liver is fine; perfect I&#39;ve been told by medical professionals. Fact. The bloodwork backs it up so no one needs to worry about my liver! So it doesn&#39;t appear to have effected me in anyway apart from do the job it was meant to. I can&#39;t speak for others experience. As i say it was a god send for me. The situation vs possible side effects was an easy decision.</p>

<p>As for your last comment i know we are on the conspiracy sub reddit but goodness me what you said is just silly;- I think any person with a couple of brain cells can take a few seconds to check over my reddit account; the huge amount of comments I&#39;ve made and the subjects. By doing this it will become pretty evident to most that I am not an undercover accutane agent in disguise. lol Not sure anyone actually doing such a thing would comment 100&#39;s of times for months about subjects such as liverpool football club, game of thrones, south park, funko pops, lgbt issues, cryptocurrency, politics, etc etc, then just to comment ONCE about Accutane, and after someone else mentioned it first! Oh whoops you got me. Gimme me a break.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna chime in as well!</p>

<p>Had he worst acne in my school middle school.</p>

<p>Summer of 8th grade I started acutane.</p>

<p>Other than chapped lips all the time, it cleared up ALL my systic acne and pimples, and like you stated just left minor scarring from big pustules I had pooped years before.</p>

<p>It was also a legit godsend for me as nowadays no one would know I had acne. And my confidence skyrocketed! This was over 13-14 years ago and I haven’t gotten any acne since! </p>

<p>Blackheads occasionally but jesus accutane was great. Though it did suck getting blood drawn every 2 weeks. </p>

<p>It can definitely be a godsend for some, hopefully in the future they will find a safer way as well. </p>

Also the skin inside my nose got very dry and i had a few nose bleeds as a result.

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why everyone attacked you, my experience was similar. I took Accutane for about 1 year (as long as you could be on it at that time) it worked great. I had tried everything, even this very expensive laser treatment, I had to work overtime while going to HS just to pay for it and it hurt extremely bad, the doctor equated it to getting a tattoo on your entire face. The stuff OP is talking about might work on the occasion pimple but my acne was very bad, Accutane worked great for me, and at the time (I was 17) I honestly didn&#39;t care about any negative side effects. Years later and I&#39;m still fine. You can&#39;t even tell I ever had acne and I never get pimples. I&#39;m cautious of big pharma too but some prescription drugs are good and I thank God for Accutane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about my slow reply. Yes everything you say i agree with as well. Funny you had laser too as i never mentioned that in my other posts but you reminded me i actually did that as well. Literally like i said every other treatment had trually been exacerbated. My parents paid for something called n lite treatment and it didn&#39;t do anything for me except really hurt when they used the laser, especially around the nose and lips. I wonder if we had the same thing? Yeah i am not a fan of drugs and cautious of the big pharma companies like you, but sometimes they do work and are of benefit. Yeah i am so grateful for accutane and for me it was amazing. I didn&#39;t care for any side effects either as i was so truamatized by that point i was happy to try literally anything. My only side effects were really dry crusty lips so i would always be rubbing vaseline into them. Also the skin inside my nose got very dry and i had a few nose bleeds as a result. I ended up using cotton buds with vaseline on them to line the inside skin of my nostrils and use to do that a couple of times a day which sorted out that issue. But yeah apart from those 2 things mentioned no other side effects for me so it all worked out. I have some very light scaring left but its not even noticeable to people unless i point it out. I think those 2 dudes attacking me are a bit crazy. Like i said anyone can look at my account and see the vast content and know im not a paid shill or rep. Ots literally the firat time i ever spoke about this drug on reddit and it was after someone else mentioned it first. I&#39;m in the UK anyway and from what i understand now this drug is only ever given here under very extreme circumstances. Im guessing its prob easier to get hold of in the US. </p>

<p>A couple of thoughts on this...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Since pantothenic acid is a naturally occurring compound (a B vitamin) it can&#39;t be patented and therefore is not profitable to Big Pharma.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;d also guess that the RDA for this vitamin might need to be adjusted upwards. Why? Because chronic acne might very well be a sign of a vitamin deficiency. At the very least, anyone with acne should try B5 for a month or two and see what happens.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if OP is confused about their B vitamins. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3, and niacinamide creams are a proven treatment for acne (though it can sometimes conflict with certain vitamin C skincare products). Pantothenic acid, or B5, has no relevance to skincare except in the form of topical panthenol, which is an alcohol that helps moisturize the skin and reduce inflammation. What&#39;s more, &quot;pantothenic&quot; literally means &quot;from everywhere, as it exists in most of our food and the idea of supplementing with it is silly for someone living in first world conditions. In addition, acne can have all sorts of causes, and while &quot;natural&quot; solutions such as tea tree oil might help some people (and are readily marketed as such), the &quot;scary&quot; pharmaceuticals work for some people who really need them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, i think about this every year when Ramadan rolls around. I&#39;m in England so fasting lasts about 19 hours, which is a bit more than the ideal 16 hours for intermittent fasting but i still always see a noticeable difference in my body by the end of it. Been at it for 16 days this year and I&#39;ve already lost a couple kilos, despite all the snacking i get up to during the five hour window.</p>

<p>I’m 35 and was almost put on blood pressure meds for the rest of my life. On a whim I tried vitamin D due to the lack of sun I’ve been getting for the past ten years after my melanoma diagnosis. It worked like a charm! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I changed Absolutely nothing else, and it helped over a matter of only a few days! That’s pretty much what my doctor asks, he doesn’t believe that it can be the only thing that changed. And I guess that’s just how they think, that no natural supplement can make as drastic of a difference as pharmaceuticals. </p>

<p>I react poorly to many medications, and frighteningly sometimes (collapsed lung from a flu inhaler, caffeine makes me react so terribly that I had to go to the hospital, Novocain does nothing for me, etc) because of a genetic mutation that effects how I break down 10% of the most commonly prescribed medications, so anything less harsh and more natural is always my first option. </p>

<p>I’ve always suffered from anxiety and a racing heart, especially at night. I’m forced to wear earplugs because my husband snores, which made the pounding heart sound so loud I couldn’t sleep! The racing heart gave me more anxiety, they really go hand in hand, and that all ties to sleep. </p>

<p>If I don’t take the 5000 IUs every day, I notice it almost immediately. I feel so much more at peace and it really makes me sad that it was such an easy fix. </p>

<p>My best friend had very similar results, she’s the one who actually suggested that I try it....she lives in Minnesota so she also doesn’t get nearly enough sun for most of the year. It helps her crippling period cramps so much. And by crippling I mean that she would end up in urgent care and throw up from the pain almost every month. Vitamin D has made it so much more tolerable for her. </p>

<p>It seems to have strengthened my immune system as well, I used to get so many colds and they’d last forever, and now I haven’t had one in a few years. I feel one coming on for about half a day, and by the evening, I’m feeling better. It’s really been a miracle for me. </p>

<p>It, of course, is not going to do anything that drastic for people that are not extremely deficient, my mom started taking it and didn’t notice anything, but she spends so much time outside that it makes sense. But for people who fear the sun, or people who can’t be in the sun for reasons like mine, it is a true blessing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for responding! Teens are cursed with a horrifically high sex drive plus very few outlets to express that energy in a healthy way. It can be tough, but 24/7 masturbation just creates unhealthy psychic energy cords linking that person to pint stars and the poem industry ( which creates the acne) and then one day if that person does fall truly in love with sonebody, their wiring is all screwed up. Can no longer get it up in normal sexual encounters; they have to try to relive their early pint memories which programmed them,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plant based diet clears my skin up in a few days. Loaded green smoothie (kale, spinach, Swiss chard, cinnamon, fresh turmeric and black pepper, fresh ginger, a banana, fresh squeezed oj) once a day taste great after you get used to it and will at least in my opinion clear up any acne that isn’t severe. Can’t beat nature. But vitamins are a good next step. Congrats for finding what works for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely hate mainstream medicine. They definitely aren’t “hiding” the cure as much as we would all like to believe, but they just actively choose to stay with current treatments; if any doctor or medical establishment deviates away from those protocol, they are labeled as nut jobs and crazy. Just look at MJ. Despite how popular it has become, doctors would rather administer synthesized drugs rather than just give what nature created; we know it reduces inflammation with very little symptoms, but almost all institutions would continue to research for treatments that are able to be patented (not cures). My parents have really bad cold sores and they’ve been using a really expensive over the counter drug(abreva I think?) for years. I told them about BHT and after taking it ONCE, they literally never had an outbreak. Cool fact: Thanks to the FDA it’s illegal to conduct studies on BHT, wonder why</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please. Cystic acne which isotretinion is primarily prescribed to treat has no other treatment available. You can change your diet, skin care regime and so on - the fact is that shit is under your skin and cannot be controlled. </p>

<p>I took 100mg of isotretinoin for a year and it did wonders. Maybe if people learned how the drug actually works they&#39;d be more understanding. </p>

<p>But no people just hear the name accutane and poo their pants. Oh it causes depression! (No it doesn&#39;t) oh it causes liver failure! (Your dermatologist should be ordering LFT and cholesterol tests each month.)</p>

<p>So shut the fuck up if you&#39;ve never taken it and be thankful you&#39;ve never had to take it you cunts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry slow reply. My hair was fine but ive always had very thick hair. My only side effects were really dry cdusty lips so i would always be rubbing vaseline into them. Also the skin inside my nose got very dry abd i bad a few nose bleeds as a result. I ended up using cotton buds with vaseline on them to line the skin of my nostrils and use to do that a couple of times a day which sorted out that issue. But yeah apart from those 2 things mentioned no other side effects for me.</p>
