       I've noticed a dramatic increase in hive mind behavior amongst liberals and the media is completely taken over by them.  I can't pay attention to social media for more then 2 minutes without losing my mind. How has this happenes? What's happening to people? What is next to come? There is a war on our language it seems. What's next? It just seems like everyone is fucking crazy besides me. It's a very lonely feeling. Is it meant to make me feel lonely? Cuz it's working.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to know what is next. Is there a book that has predicted this or what? It just seems like the end of the american dream.

       To feel lonely and alto of other stuff. In my opinion social media is an attempt (very good one) to destroy tribalism (especially for those lighter in complexion.) It gives you this addicting empty feeling of belonging somehow but puts distance between real interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, there are people, or creatures, on this earth that know the future. They are literally a hive mind and can target people on a whim. I read somethinsoak few years ago where there was 1 billion people that all liked something on Facebook at the same time on the same day. Its that kind of networking, knowledge of time, telepathy (not kidding) and other means that causes this. Ill be disappointed if its just to bring communism to America.

       Dude. Idk what you've been gettin into but i wish we could hang out for a day just so i could feel normal. There's that lack of belonging i was referring too. I want so badly for someone to agree with me, TO BELONG, in everyday life. Too few and far in between these days imo.

       Quite possibly. My only reservation are religious cultures like Islam and Judaism who generally still treat/see women as second class citizens. The "antichrist" is prophesied to seduce nearly everyone of all walks of life. I can still see quite a large portion of humanity rejecting this figure soley on gender alone.

       Well maybe you are just making assumptions. And forgive me, but if the guy hasn't been impressed with the women he has encountered in his 28 years, that does not make him a hater or someone who disrespects women. Maybe the women he has encountered have been unimpressive, I know I have met quite a few in my day. That doesn't mean I hate them, and it isn't disrespect to say someone who hasn't impressed you unimpressive...

       Just seems like alot of these proggressive idealogues' voices are more from women. I could b wrong on that.  Even from my own mom.. She started spewing this "white male" and "pay gap" reterict the other day at dinner.  My wife doesn't fall for that bs tho. It seems like mostly hollywood and teachers. And theres a lot more female teachers then males. Im just trying to figure out where it all started and who is controling the culture. And to me. The culture is almost a "mating ritual" for our species. And it is kind of dictated by what behavior people think would make them attractive mates to the other sex. That's why i think women do have more power right now. It seems like maybe what's happening. I mean im just spectulating here but that's where am at

       Hivemind amongst liberals? I can't even have a conversation with any of my Republican friends anymore without being torn apart on a personal level. I try to understand from their point of view but as soon as I challenge anything and stick to my guns, I am being cursed at or insulted. I mean the very word Liberal is an insult to anyone who sees themselves as Conservative and that in itself is scary to see how split we are.

       Oh man. U just reminded me of this. Conservatives are almost the same way. But maybe since i somewhat lean that way, that i don't nptice it as much... Idk. Conservatives woilf probably still be willing to budge on some topics though idk.

       I get bombarded by people twisting words to fit their ideals, and as soon as you challenge that the conversation is over. I can come in and listen and rebut politely but it is always the other side who attacks first, no matter how much I try to keep level-headed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is I am beginning to feel like being level headed isn't going to get anything solved. It is a slow boil, but the pot is heating up way to fast suddenly. Something is dreadfully wrong, and I fear the way it is fixed is not going to be pretty.

       Idk why but it seems to me like a stepping point in society/time to something much worse. Im not conservative and im not Democrat.  But it seems like we r on the way to a hitler regime or something. Like, they r attacking our language to the point where we can't even make jokes about funny looking people that look like planrt of the apes combined with muslim brotherhood . that shit was a fuckin quality joke! Thats what she looks like!

       But ape has a racial past as being an insult to African Americans in the past.  We have freedom of speech,  but I can't expect to go to work tomorrow and say "all black people are horrible " and expect to keep a job where I work with African American people as associates and clientele.  It makes productivity go down,  and if I am a good leader I will cut things that are a hindrance instead of being productive.

       Just in regards to your reference about the Roseanne tweet, I think that whole thing is less about attacking language and being politically-correct specifically, and more of a way for the media to use an opportunity to exaggerate the narrative, get everyone to hate Roseanne, and discredit her because of her tweets about Q and the deep state and stuff.

       Social media is just another example of technology having the capacity to be used for good or evil. I'm sure you feel the same as someone who witnessed the invention of the printing press or TV. The difference is the sheer speed and amount of information that can be produced and distributed these days, which was a natural progression of technology to accommodate the ever rising population and birth rates.

      <p>
       Don't let it stress you out friend. Instead of focusing on all the bullshit that is being slung via social media, be joyful in your ability to access truth and good ideas at the speeds in which you are able.

       (Unpopular opinion incoming)

       A recent example of crazy-level hive mind: The no-grilling lady, "BBQ Becky." I was late to the party by about two weeks, so had no idea what the deal was till the SNL cameo. Took a look at the source video, already knowing the narrative that a racist woman called the cops on some people just grilling in the park.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not at all what's in the video.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         For some reason, she's way into the rule that you can't use charcoal grills in that part of the park. (Background check: It's a real rule, was in the news in 2015, a toddler got burned, says no charcoal grills on maps, etc. Additional background: She's an pollution/climate specialist with a degree from Stanford, so she may have an additional rod up her ass about burning charcoal.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The woman never makes any reference to race. She only talks about no-charcoal-grills. She keeps her voice level for almost the entire video.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A psycho woman rails at her and shoves the camera/phone in her face, accusing her of racism for over 20 minutes straight. The behavior of this woman can only be described as aggressive.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No-charcoal-lady attempts to walk away from the psycho woman, but the psycho woman follows her
         <em>
          down the block, across the two streets and into a store.
         </em>
         Filming and bitching the entire time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The no-charcoal woman (
         <em>
          opinion here
         </em>
         ) may have Asperger's, since the police told her to wait there the first time she called and she did-- FOR TWO HOURS. Also, the rigid adherence to the charcoal rule and emotional immaturity at the end when the police finally show (she cries).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So what I saw was a person who tried to resolve a situation civilly before involving the police (she says in the video she spoke with the grillers first and they ignored her); a group of people who ignored her in a mocking, but mild way; a woman who pulled the race card and I'm-putting-this-on-YouTube card. A country that gleefully ran with the narrative and never paused to find out the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this lady ends up being mocked on SNL, turned into a meme, shunned, doxxed, you name it. I wouldn't be surprised if she has PTSD from it for
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       .

       Thanks for posting that. I read through it, but still think the situation played out closer to what I posted. One thing is that "BBQ Becky's" real name, where she worked, where she went to school,
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       come out. There was even one story gleefully reporting (with a photo) that she was at the airport leaving town.
      </p>
      <p>
       But your article reminded me of one thing I didn't originally point out. Any of the allegations made by the filmer of overt racism (racial epithets, threats of jail, etc.) "conveniently" don't appear in the video. And the video also has two edits-- both at points where the she said/she said stories don't line up. There's a real possibility that the filmer made up all kinds of stuff to fit the narrative and then people just ran with it.

       Wow that's really interesting. I haven't seen the video, just read some headlines here and there and figured 'just another crazy racist' (like everyone else just reading headlines...). Well done for finding out/explaining.

        Here's the full video.

       Very cringey. I wouldn't want to have a beer with any of these people, including the lady who's calling the police.

       A video of assholes being assholes is unremarkable. What's horrifying is how America responded-- including news outlets, comedy shows, morning talk shows, etc.-- to an inflammatory narrative that was
       <em>
        easily
       </em>
       verified as being false (or at the very least highly suspect).

       We had similar awful story in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       An 11 year old muslim girl went to school with her hijab shredded(could have happened because this little girl didn't like the hijab or was told to wear it and she lied to cover why it was cut up) School called her parents, she lied saying some Chinese guy attacked her on the way and cut up her hijab with scissors and just left)
      </p>
      <p>
       The School called the media, police and instantly proceeded to hold a quick press conference with thos 11 year about the hijab cutting, The Story went instantly in realtime viral that a muslim girl was attacked and her hijab cut up. The Prime Minister responded, and social media hive mind blew up the story
      </p>
      <p>
       In all this national frenzy, police had not yet interviewed the girl, the crime had not been investigated yet.
 No one bothered to protect identity of this minor (11 year old) as there was duty to protect rights of this little girl as a victim or suspect under Canadian law regarding crimes involving children, regardless of whether they are accused of the  crime or they are the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       They blasted this little girl's lie all over the World, put her face all over the tv, internet in the name of Social Justice virtue signaling and hive mind psychosis of nation rattling as a propaganda tool for opportunist media and government (Trudeau making statement before incident was verified by police.)
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/khawlah-noman-claim-hijab-cut-man-scissors-disputed-toronto-police">
        https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/khawlah-noman-claim-hijab-cut-man-scissors-disputed-toronto-police
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The girl lied to her parents and her school about her Hijab being cut. The Media, Prime Minister,Trudeau blew up her life and her right to be protected as a child. They used her as means to this propaganda, and in the process ruined her life.
      </p>
      <p>
       What child has not told a lie to their parents about something they did? This little girl was doxxed by her teachers, media all over, and the hivemind social disease carried to the ends of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       She will be forever ridiculed and her childhood innocence is ruined. It is hard enough being a kid but having to live with that kind of mistake at 11 years old. The internet does not forget.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was horrific thing they did to her. We have laws to protect minors for this reason but no one bothered to protect.

       Believers in the Mandela Effect ought to be a little sobered by this thread, because it illustrates exactly how easily utterly false ideas can be created and propagated to the extent that no-one stops to think about them or even check they are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am willing to bet that fairly soon, there will be people claiming to have witnessed racist behaviour in this innocuous video, and insisting that the original has been changed somehow to depict something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as evidence, they will cite the same news stories and comedy sketches that helped spread the misunderstanding in the first place.

       Me? I'm more "conservative" i guess. It's all bullshit man. The government doesnt work for us anymore. Politics are the entertainment devision of the military industrial complex. Its like wwe wrestling. I fell out of the belief around 9/11 and don't trust shit anymore. I was 13 when 9/11 happened. Shit has looked like the twilight zone ever since.
