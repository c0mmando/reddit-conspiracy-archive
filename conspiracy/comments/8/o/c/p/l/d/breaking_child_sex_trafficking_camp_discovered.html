       Bans thrown out to tons of people participating or questioning the mods.

      <p>
       I live 10 minutes from where they found it. Latest update from a woman that was just up there:
      </p>
      <p>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to write a post and outline a few things regarding the camp that was discovered earlier this week.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have further interest in what is going on, please like the page for VOP as they are updating often.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know many of you are concerned about the safety of going down there and I can only say that these are trained veterans that all made it back from deployments to “the sandbox” they protected our lives over there and now they are protecting us here.Never once was I scared. We are actually here now.
      </p>
      <p>
       VOP’s motto is “God’s got my six”
      </p>
      <p>
       They are straight down the middle Patriots that are not militia, not radical anything (not radical left, not radical right not radical religious).Many of them have only had a few hours sleep the past 6 days and they are still very passionate about protecting children.....all children.
      </p>
      <p>
       They happened upon this camp while out searching for homeless vets that may need some help or services.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were deeply concerned and called in others that have expertise in this area. Experts have confirmed that this is a child sex trafficking camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Craig Sawyer and his team areExperts at this and they have been down here and have confirmed that this is undeniably a child sex trafficking camp.Mark and I have been down here and I know nothing about sex trafficking camps and I don’t WANT to believe it, but yet it’s undeniable. I have seen quite a few homeless camps and this is altogether different.
      </p>
      <p>
       VOP happened on this camp and tried for 3 days to get officials down here to gather evidence.I asked what we could tell you and they said:They are not tampering with evidence.The most critical or damning evidence has been collected and taken out per protocol, by VOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       New evidence was just found and everyone is wearing gloves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the FBI and Homeland security wont come down and take all of this evidence then Thank the Lord these guys are. They are finding items that could lead to missing children.They have found log books, blueprints, drop books.Do you know that a child is worth $100k or more? And can be sold over and over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please pray for these guys.That’s all I can say.
      </p>

       The police have now blocked the gate access and arrested 2 volunteers who were at the gate but on public property."

       The admins have threatened very openly that T_D gets zero tolerance on linking outside the sub. If there's even the slightest inkling of info in those articles that could be interpreted as doxing or any reason the mods will 86 it and move on.

       Bullshit.  The_Donald is a gate-keeping community for the Trump admin.  They censor virtually any valid theory that questions the status quo and/or paints neoconservatives in a bad light.

       Pretend for a moment that that subreddit is an operative in the broader conspiracy of the story. They are removing it to make "the_donald is removing all mention of it" part of this story. Nobody really cares about this  supposed child trafficking site except the people talking about here in this post and on the chans, because none of this story can be believed yet, and it screams phoney baloney exaggeration.

       This type of created outrage is common now,  it is manufactured and quickly spread,  and just as quickly instantly forgotten even by those claiming to be outraged.

       I am about as far right as they come, and I will 100% agree with you. The_donald is exactly that, a gate keeping community for low IQ squeaky toys and Neo-cons that wanna play pretend that they are the edgy outsiders when in fact they are cut of the same cloth as every other "Conservative" leadership in the primaries, meaning they are just center leftists wearing a american flag lapel.

       Look at the posts here. There are people who are discounting the small entry hole (with an outside lock on it) that only a child could fit through, that leads to the small underground area with childrens toys. They are not replying regarding the small hand binders low on the tree. And their critical posts (skipping over important details) are being upvoted at a crazy rate.

       No they want this thread here on this sub. From here they can mass downvote all vital information whilst upvoting dismissive circular arguments. They can even attack any credible users and discredit them. They want threads here and on 4chan so when they do report it they can say "basement vigilantes with an obsession for child abuse throw yet more false pizzagate accusations". Just look at this thread and the dismissive comments fighting over tiny details that are insignificant to the actual point.

       8chan, like 4chan or Reddit, is a platform. It is not a source, but a place where sources can share information. The responsibility to filter legitimate information from made-up bullshit falls on you, and requires you to do your own research.

       How sad you’re able to see that there’s nothing communist about the intelligence community.  They are quite pro-capitalism, as it’s lining their pockets and hiding their crimes.

       Ever been in a homeless camp that has kids with parents? LOTS of those in Hawaii, looks just like this. Seriously? Straps on tries 😂 are for kids. Homeless do some crapy construction. Let see the kids and people they got to safety.  Ive seen the videos and looks like ANY OTHER homeless camp. Prob boarder jumpers rest stop.

       They have been threatened to leave twice by people coming from the local reservation that is heavily tied into cartels and drug trafficking. Any place there is that there is also human trafficking. Straps on trees are a real thing they use. They call them "rape trees".

       As I've said multiple times they've contacted the owners of the site and they don't appear to have anything to do with the guy who threatened them, at least one of which was a guy on horseback who came off of the nearby reservation. This looks exactly like many of the other camps they routinely find along the border that coyotes use to traffic people and drugs, and the women and kids who come across are routinely sexually abused. They are extremely commonplace. Don't act like this is some outlandish conspiracy that they stumbled across one of them. The suspicious part is how the local sheriff and police, who, living alongside this stuff should be familiar with it's frequency, is trying to write it off like it's nothing when these things are a notorious problem with coyotes, cartels and our southern border.

       They are a lot more fun and on the whole less vitriolic than the left has been for the past few years. There used to be great sources of information there that put me days ahead of the news cycle. It's changed a lot, but the majority of people there are good people, and not hateful. It's one thing to be a dick, it's another to be an asshole. TD has more dicks and less assholes.

       Worth pointing out. It’s crazy that Reddit isn’t required to put a disclaimer about that or something. I may not agree with everything they stand for over there, but I can recognize unfair treatment when I see it, and the way that community has been treated is just downright wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private companies can do whatever they want, sure. But they should be required to disclose practices like selective censorship.

       You just made my point. While I admit it's certainly possible, I don't see anything convincing in any of the articles about this. Straps on trees? That's it? A homeless camp is going to provide so many pieces of "evidence" that you could make it sound like anything happened there. Instead of jumping in, making a mess, seizing "evidence" and blabbing about it on the internet,, I would talk to authorities quietly to arrange an investigation. OR, if you didn't trust the authorities, hire a Private Investigator. Make some progress on finding stronger evidence. This reeks of loose cannon misdirection. The only mystery is whether or not it's intentional.

       He's not even Craig Sawyer, it's weird the person you replied to claimed it. All you have to do to see this is go to his Youtube-channel (just write Craig Sawyer on Youtube). Totally different guy. I don't know who the guy in that linked video is but he's younger, skinnier, has different facial hair and facial features (Sawyer has dark brown hair and is greying, this guy is ginger), higher voice, etc. Sawyer also seems to be a pretty calm guy and just uploaded a video update, and speaks in a very calm and concise manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't even one of those cases where it's ambigious and people just try to "defend" someone, this is legit not him and I doubt he's even supposed to be and the person just made a mistake in thinking it's him. I didn't see any indication the guy in that video was meant to be Sawyer.

       What I don't understand is why they didn't just have guys sit quietly and observe the site, wait for the people who use the camp to show up and confront them with your crew. Catch them in the act. They supposedly found this currently used site and just ran in and fucked up an opportunity to catch the perpetrators red handed?

       That's NOT him, lmao. He has a Youtube-channel where he uploaded all of the stuff they found and provides updates. He's a calm beefy guy with darker hair, this guy looks skinny in comparison, has a higher voice and different facial hair and color (gingerish).
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, he doesn't look even close to him and this is not some weird "defense", it's literally a different person. Like
       <em>
        actually

       actually. I don't know who that is but you can see he's not him if you go to his channel (write his name on Youtube search).

       My gut reaction was something similar, but I happened to watch the group's Youtube videos where they showed all the horrific stuff and were super calm, making me think the guy is either not the same person at all (facial hair and features seem a bit different) or he snapped from all the horrific shit he saw at night in those earlier Youtube videos with the child-sized jail beds next to BDSM gear and children's coloring books and toys.

      <p>
       Been following it all day after I saw The Sawman post about it, he's friends with men I served with and I would trust what he says is the truth, if nothing else the man is a Patriot, and A Navy SEAL.
      </p>

       There is something going on, there are way too many things connecting here than it being coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why is it that police can mobilise a SWAT team to shoot a pot dealer 30 times, but can't send a cadaver dog out there and a forensics team?

       Too many powerful ppl are implicated.

       I can't believe that the country got like this with the border. The crime and cartels are doing whatever they want down there, and paying off anyone they can.

       People may say it is just fear mongering, but it looks to me like crime is out of control near the border.

       yea, and ontop of the insane crime, the increased irregular weather patterns coming in from the gulf of mexico makes it an extremely unstable place to live and plan a future. It's sad really because there's a lot of beautiful places down south but it's just going to get worse and worse over the next decade.

       The cartels are contractors for evil players INSIDE the United States. The property where the children were being raped and tortured is owned by a company tied to the Clinton Global Initiative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all related to stuff like Dyncorp, which Representative Cynthia McKinney bravely called out for child trafficking in Congress (before they ran her out of office).
      </p>
      <p>
       These mega-corporations are involved in this stuff. Child trafficking generates more money than the narcotics industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the real economy implodes, we're seeing institutions fall back on drugs and human trafficking to make ends meet.

       Well, Trump is from a different faction.
      </p>
      <p>
       (It's why the CIA-controlled media is going batshit insane after he got into the Presidency.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't supposed to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Realize: There is a difference between The Shadow Government and the Deep State.
      </p>
      <p>
       People use them as synonyms, but they're not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two factions are currently at war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was most likely recruited by the generals, who are staging a counter-coup against the Shadow Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'll allow for a gross oversimplification, it's the CIA versus the Military Industrial-Complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary represented the CIA. (Her husband Bill got entangled with it during the days of Iran-Contra when George Bush, Sr. was running cocaine up from Central America using MS-13. One of the hubs for the operation was Mean, Arkansas, when Bill Clinton was then-governor. After he stumbled upon the covert op, he was enlisted to join up and promised the presidency if he played ball. Watch a reporter question Clinton about it back in the 1990s:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDMktUYvC7k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDMktUYvC7k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, the Clintons and Bushes are tied into the CIA drug-running operation . . . with the Bushes being in it almost as early as the Delanos and Forbes' (through Prescott Bush).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prescott Bush was one of the earliest architects of the CIA, and his son (George, Sr.) would later be made head of the CIA in the 1970s.
      </p>
      <p>
       But George had been running operations for them since the 1950s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, that's "The Shadow Government".
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        Deep State,
       </em>
       by contrast, was started by a man named Vannevar Bush in the 1930s. He was the head of MIT, and the first man to make the case that the U.S. should maintain a war-time footing even in times of peace, and that they should fund science to help the military. Vannevar Bush [no relation to George Bush, by the way] was the founder of military contractor Raytheon.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Nikola Tesla died, the government sent in Vannevar Bush's protege from MIT . . . a man by the name of John Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Trump is the uncle of Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Trump was there, at the ground floor, of the creation of what we today know as the "Military Industrial Complex".
      </p>
      <p>
       (To read more about Vannevar Bush and Trump, check out "Endless Frontier," by G. Pascal Zachary.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Journalist Daniel Liszt recently did a series of presentations on Trump and his connection to Vannevar Bush and the Deep State. See here:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpzmNSaF47Y&amp;amp;t=6258s">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpzmNSaF47Y&amp;amp;t=6258s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In summation, what we're watching now is a civil war between the CIA [which is losing power] and the Military Industrial Complex [which is engaging in a putsch to recover control of the U.S. government from the CIA].
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is NOT on the Clintons' and Bushes' side. Their mortal enemies. Which is why, in the last election, Bush, Sr. voted for Hillary. Barbara Bush, by the way, said that Bill was so close to the Bush family that she considered him one of her sons. These dynasties are tight.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump pissed them both off.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's playing a very dangerous game.

       Yeah, Obama is a weird case.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was allowed to cut in line of Hillary, and it was deeply upsetting to the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who knows what connections Obama had that outranked even a former President. We know that Obama was seen as the puppet of Trilateral Commission-creator Zbigniew Brzezinski. So maybe Brzezinski's connections were stronger than even Clinton's.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the mass of circumstantial evidence that Obama was groomed by the CIA from his infancy. His mom used to work for World Vision, which is a famous CIA front. (Interestingly, John Lennon's assassin also worked at World Vision. As well as Reagan's shooter, John Hinkley, Jr. George Bush, Sr., by the way, was friends with Hinkley, Sr., who ran World Vision. On the night Reagan was shot Neil Bush was having dinner with the Hinkley's:
       <a href="http://impiousdigest.com/the-bush-familys-greatest-hits-what-rockefeller-means-by-discretion/">
        http://impiousdigest.com/the-bush-familys-greatest-hits-what-rockefeller-means-by-discretion/
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, yes: A lot of weird stuff was being run out of World Vision. And Obama's mom was affiliated with them, jet setting around the world as an 18 year-old, with no job and no visible means of support. Yet she had all this money.
      </p>
      <p>
       She looks to all hell like a CIA asset. Even after she "died," her social security number failed to show up on the national death registry.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the woman's probably still alive somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's true that Obama's grandparents and mother were "in the club," then it might explain all the doors that were opened up to Obama on his ascendancy to the Presidency.

       It's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill was a Rhodes Scholar. That scholarship program was set up to groom people to be advocates for British tycoon Cecil Rhodes' plan to reconstitute the British Empire. Rhodes masked his plan by calling it "Globalism".
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, it was hegemony from the British Banking system over the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rhodes set up "round table groups" in all the Commonwealth countries to promote "globalism" and to erode national sovereignty. These groups were also designed to groom media figures, future politicians, academics, etc. These round table groups were set up in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, etc. In the United States, the round tassel group is called "The Council on Foreign Relations".
      </p>
      <p>
       You can read a brilliant book on this stuff by historian Carroll Quigley (in his book "The Tragedy and the Hope"). Quigley was Bill Clinton's professor at Georgetown, and Clinton cited him as his mentor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quigley was given unprecedented access to the minutes from the meetings of the Rockefeller Foundation. After plunging into the archives, he wrote a sort of "true history of the 20th Century".
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, everything that's unfolding now was started by Cecil Rhodes back in the 1880s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton (like all Rhodes scholars) was flown to Oxford to receive his brainwashing. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow is also a Rhodes scholar. As is Democratic Senator Corey Booker. Also the RNC's Bobby Jindal, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone made a video of how the Council on Foreign Relations hijacked our media. What we today call "The Mainstream Media" is nothing of the sort: It's Council on Foreign Relations media.

       That's not how Rhodes scholarships work. It's more of a philanthropic endeavor for Cecil to wash his hands. Rhodes Scholarships have no strings attached, the fund you for a year.

       Your quote seems to be talking more about an early think tank, rather than Rhodes Scholars which is a much more massive undertaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd compare Rhodes Scholars to Nobel Prize Winners. Sure, there's some potential political power to giving them out, but a lot of it is about bettering the name of the donor. Philanthropy always has an ulterior motive, but it's 90% washing the hands.

       Wait what? Why would all of this make you support Bernie?

       You realize he capitulated and supported Hillary Clinton, who received funds via CGI from this cement company that was just ousted as a trafficking site?

       You realize that trump is trying to close down the border, and literally everyone in the overarching power structure is virulently opposing him doing so, presumably because of trafficking routes?

       The Delano family goes all the way back to the Pilgrims. Philippe de Lannoy (anglicized to Delano) arrived on the Fortune ship (the second ship after the Mayflower in Plymouth). His uncle was Francis Cook, one of the singers of the Mayflower Compact. Delano was heavily involved with politics and land sales.

       I'm more worried about government checkpoints inside the US border than I am of the cartels. Crime isn't bad, at least in Texas. I just think it's BS that anything within 200 miles of a border is a constitutional-free zone. More of America should be up in arms over that.

       This situation has been engineered. I've been watching it brew for the last 18 years.

       The two preceding administrations intentionally weakened our border security.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bush administration regularly pulled some hokey shit in cooperation with the EPA,  leaving gaping holes for unseen border crosses to happen while using endangered species as the reason agents can't patrol certain areas.

       The Obama administration cut funding,  initiated "catch and release" (release... on our side of the border), and ordered agents not to patrol certain stretches of border as well.

       It's a good thing these (fucking awesome) dudes found them instead of someone like me. They're being all professional, whereas I'm pretty sure I would have just set up a little nest and just starting taking out anyone who showed up.

       Yeah, that part got me too. It’s hard to wrap my head around the fact this happens a hell of a lot more than we know. It’s heartbreaking to think of all of these children’s lives destroyed and taken because of these sick, twisted people.

       Hi, I was looking for this as well. Here's the best evidence I could find. It actually has some pictures of the camps. I'm not sure what I make of it all, but it's something at least:

       CEMEX, wow, that connects to everything.  And then there is the boylover symbol in more than a few local businesses.   Plus the clinton global iniative, the mexican president and the rothchilds, all tied to NVIXM also.
      </p>

       Wow, I never thought something like this would come out but it is the breakthrough I for one have been hoping for.

       It would mean that shutting down the border is itself a ruse that won’t actually stop trafficking, and I don’t see why there would be so much money being spent opposing it with media initiatives

       no, think of it like warring houses, the clinton global initiative and podesta group on one side, the trump's organization with ties to israel and russia were on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel played both sides but preferred trump.  Israel and Russia are both unified in the desire to see the US balkanized and removed from the UN sec council.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Trump and Bill Clinton have partied on epstein's lolita express, and Epstein is known to have recruited underage girls out of mar a lago:
      </p>
      <p>
       Roberts was working for $9 an hour as a changing room assistant at Trump’s Mar-A-Lago beach club, where her father was a maintenance manager, when she claims she was recruited to work as a masseuse for Epstein. She claims the invitation came courtesy of Maxwell. It was 1998, and Roberts was 15 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       NXIVM connects bronfman to alefantis and CEMEX is bronfman, so at a certain level they are all working together to make sure a steady supply of children disappears.

       Im specifically asking you for links that explain the last half, not “Known to have recruited.” Nothing is ever just “known to be.”

       Connecting trump to lolita express is easy because we straight up have flight logs.

       I wouldnt at all be surprised by Epstein recruiting Mar a Lago girls, but i want proof, not hearsay. Also, absolutely no reason to be making personal insults or claims of “Ignorance problems” unless you want me pointing out your superiority complex

       This reads like it was pasted from a news article, do you have it? Otherwise, use full names when youre referring to POI, not “Roberts” so i dont have to comb your previous replies

       after las vegas, trump immediately went to Arizona.
      </p>
      <p>
       trumps mara lago property is the location where Epstein was known to pick up 13 year old girls in the filed lawsuit, you should be able to find the article or you arre really out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump and epstein are friends, epstein and alefantis are friends, alefantis and bronfman and cafritz are friends, and they are all now tied to this rothchild mayor and cemex, which turns out to be an israeli subsidiary, to which trump is also tied by a dozen things.
      </p>
      <p>
       so if you are coming at this with the hope trump is going to lock up the pedos, you are so hopelessly naive i can't really help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump is a pedo, don't you get it?  (if he can still get it up, which I doubt he can even with a handful of viagra) (and putin and netanyahu are fucking him so hard, how would he even have time for his own pleasure?)

       Ya when he kicked him out...he was friends with someone for awhile who was friends with someone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so the dude actually helped start the Clinton foundation, who steals kids...Clinton went there like 13 times to his islands.

       It's right there...and your grasping and pulling on anything you can to ignore and try to connect something you can't.

      <p>
       It's slightly pathetic.

       You guys hate this man so much that it's starting to cause some of you mental problems. He's gone in a year, who gives a f**k...

       So you seem to be concerned about trafficking...how many posts did you make when Hillary cancelled the investigation on the state employees with CP on their computers? How about when they helped the silsbys who ACTUALLY got got kidnapping kids at a border and charged with it, how about bill actually flying to that island over 19 times, what about their pedo friends, Epstein helped start the Clinton foundation who steals kids from hati..
      </p>
      <p>
       So where are your posts on this if your actually concerned? Why would you reach to try to ccontect something not connected while ignoring something with so much of an actual connection.

       I'm not a big fan of saying "he's a Navy SEAL ergo he can never lie." He's human. He's part of the military-industrial complex, in the same unit that may have faked bin Laden's death. He has clear political motives in making up an elaborate child sex trafficking conspiracy (lol Clinton!).

       Sawer, the supposed "expertise" in child sex trafficking, and his entire organization, have in one year managed to extract ONE minor from sex work. But he's probably busy making that Netflix documentary about his efforts...
      </p>
      <p>
       He may be a good soldier, but this is not his area of expertise and his organization does not seem to be effective at much more than publicity and fundraising. Seriously, look at the website for V4CR.. it's all "buy our shirts" and "shop using our Amazon affiliate link" (seriously). The FAQ is all about donation or booking Craig to speak (for a fee). Even "volunteering" for them quickly turns into a money grab, requiring a $50 monthly donation in order to receive a certificate stating that you are a "Warrior For Child Rescue".

       Oh what a scumbag he only reached ONE child what a chump.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many kids have you rescued? It costs a lot of money to run an operation like that of course they need money, do you think veterans are just independently wealthy? If he is doing this as a job, hell even if it's a hobby, he is putting way more on the line than you are!
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you suggesting they're doing all of this to make money? If he wanted money he woild use his skills to go become a contractor and make 6+ figures a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some ppl cannot be pleased I guess. What would this man, or groups need to do for you to believe that they want to rescue kids? What people need to be doing it so they're skilled enough in your eyes to be doing this?

       Maybe because the police have better things to do than muck around an abandoned homeless camp? Also, these armed loonies have destroyed any chances of a proper investigation as they’ve made videos of themselves contaminating evidence by digging through the place while calling every thing they see an obvious sign of a child sex dungeon. This is typical Pizzagate hysteria and it doesn’t help that you have armed psychopaths on site thinking it’s all a government cover up despite the fact they’ve already had police sent there to investigate and the media has been covering it.

       The guy with the beard, the mouthpiece for VOP, no he isn't the SEAL, and I do not know his military background if any.

       C.Sawyer, callsign "Sawman" was a Marine Sniper I believe, then cross decked to the Navy to become a SEAL.

      <p>
       He is a pretty outspoken fellow at times, and certainly right wing, but from what I Know of him (again, men that I served with, are good buddies with Sawman, and I trust them, and their word/opinion on Sawman.

       Why wouldn’t they want this story covered? They’ve been pushing child trafficking conspiracies since p-gate. Plus this kind of thing happening in a city so close to the border would also be good for their narrative. It makes absolutely not sense that they’d be trying to cover this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that they are trying to avoid getting banned for doxxing like that one mod said.

       Just out of curiosity, what is your theory for why they would want to scrub this story from their sub?

       The sub has several special rules attached to it by Reddit admin. Linking non public people is doxxing, can't link other subs and can't name spez. Ever since Spez was caught editing people's posts and the popular female mod was banned for lifting the spez filter, the TD mods have changed it into a meme sub. Before you could go there and get news before anywhere else because other people weren't reporting on it. Now news never gets reported there unless it isn't controversial. Either the sub is comprovised (low chance) or more likely that there have been further threats by Reddit admin t

       Where is the evidence? Saying that something is child trafficking, without any proof, is propaganda. Especially when you see them spreading it and commenting on it like it proves something. They have even now taken to 4chan and 8chan to "investigate" so that they can hopefully find some "clues" since they haven't found any.

       You can't change reality to suit your beliefs. If this place is a child trafficking camp call the police and let them know your suspicions. Otherwise this is people making assertions and we all know people are 100% reliable and accurate in cases like this. If the VoP group has seen shady stuff I imagine the police would accept their calls.

       "They showed it to us"
What was shown? I've heard there were bodies and condoms and whatnot, but all anyone has seen pics of is homeless people trash...
If there's evidence of the claims that this is a child sex cult or whatever then make with the proof. If you can't because you don't have any then shut the fuck up already.

       no no....it would just be the people that helped fund the school, donated and helped build/name the school.  I wonder if, say, a Rothchild was major, whether or not they had anything to do with building the school?

       I see a couple threads where people have made these claims but it's not really linked to any evidence that shows what they're claiming. Maybe it's some where in the 8chan link a couple people have posted but that honestly looks like something a schizophrenic put together. It's just a ton of random points of information not tied together in any kind of way.

       Ermm, maybe it had been abandoned weeks or months or years ago? I'm not saying it's not a child trafficking site, but I'm honestly shocked by the low threshold of evidence people seem to require to arrive at that conclusion.

       I didn't "act like an expert". I gave my opinion that the body of evidence for it being a child trafficking camp wasn't substantial. And I was absolutely correct. And I never attacked anyone. And I never called anything bullshit. That's you creating a strawman to criticise.

       That's no proof of anything, homeless camps get abandoned all the time. They are, by definition, transient. From looking at the video it doesn't look lived in recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is upvoting these ridiculous claims? Even if yeah, they staked it out and no homeless people came back, it's just laughable to jump to "ergo it's a human trafficking camp for children connected to the Clinton campaign."

       At homeless camps? Pretty much everything they're not going to carry gets left behind. Do you really think they're going to load up whatever old dresser they found and carry it to the next place they're gonna live?

       Yea trash gets left at the location.  Homeless don't just move camps tho.  It's a lot of effort.  Unless forced to move by weather or police they're prone to stick around.  And if they dug out a shelter and put a water tank in there and covered it back up...

       That it's a place where people are living temporarily so most of those things are not out of place at all. A room with a dresser and chair, like you would have in a home? A knife, pretty essential. Bloody clothes, could be probably from anything. A plane ticket … for a person who is probably not missing, just the 4chan "investigators" don't know where the person is.

       How does being Navy SEALs and Marines make them experts in human trafficking? They're just pointing to totally normal stuff like straps and just deciding that it must be part of some child rape camp. Like they started at a conclusion that kids were raped there so they just went through trying to find things they could decide were evidence of it.

       Because the SEAL involved is literally an expert in recovering children that have been trafficked.

       And some of the other vets are EXPERTS as in it is there job, to help homeless ppl.

       They found a rape tree, used condoms, tons of kids toys, car seats, strollers, and old shoes, as well as an underground holding area covered by brushes with an entrance too small for most adults to fit into and just far enough down that a child couldn't get out on their own in an area where cartels operate heavily.

       No they do not "frequently make underground rooms". Have you ever met a homeless person? They don't exactly exert a great deal of effort. They aren't digging underground rooms, alright.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of manual labor it would require to dig out a livable underground shelter is not proportionate to the immediate hazards it proposes (flood, collapse, suffocation, etc). This is why homeless people use more practical things for their shelter, like tents, boxes, tarps, dense vegetation, and various combinations of these.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now it's your job to make me believe that you believe there are great numbers of homeless people out there shoveling by hand, underground rooms in compacted earth "for them to live in" and that this happens so commonly that it can be described as a frequent occurrence.

       This second video also disputes your claim that it can't be a homeless camp because of the immediate hazards. People DIE in Las Vegas storm drains every year. They are sustainable to sudden flash floods even when it's not raining, CO and methane gas buildup, etc, yet hundreds of people still live there.

       I think the issue -- and this is not uncommon among conspiracy theorists -- is you have no real understanding of the realities of the key issues here, and just make blind assumptions to support your narrative.

       Like "oh homeless people wouldn't live in dangerous places!" and "oh homeless people aren't going to put a lot of effort into making a place to live!" Both dead wrong if you ask anyone who's even spent a few minutes in an actual homeless encampment.

       NAXALT fallacy. You can't point to exceptional instances and pretend that they represent the mean. If this is a homeless shelter, it is exceptional and uncommon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it appears uncommon, it warrants investigation. If it turns out to be a homeless camp, then we know. But you're thinking up an less likely explanation and using it to justify ignoring certain evidence. There's a small chance some homeless people have buried a water storage tank for shelter, and a bigger chance that it may be utilized for nefarious purposes considering its location. There's no way to know without doing an investigation, which in and of itself may contain conspiracy, which is why we are both here anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just weird that anyone would go to such lengths to explain away peculiar circumstances that could be cleared of suspicion so easily and with such little effort and resources, when it could possibly lead to the downfall of the global human market.

       That's the thing though -- dangerous homeless encampments are the norm, not the exception. By their very definition most are crime and disease ridden to begin with, even the "normal" tent ones. Many are remote and outside of emergency services.

       There's literally

       Restraints, a pretty big red flag if true. However you can clearly see in the video what the authors call "restraints" for kids are actually straps being used to support the makeshift structure and hold it together.

       No, there is not. Take it from someone who has personally visited many of these sites -- homeless people are very ingenious with their structures. How many homeless encampments have you personally visited? Where are you getting your understanding of homeless encampment engineering from to claim that using such structures is unusual?

       Of course the camps are dangerous, why wouldn't they be mitigating the dangers? Didn't they find tons of dolls and toys? On property of a cement company which is a donor of the Clinton Foundation, near the Mexico border? I'm not saying it can't be a homeless camp, but you're saying it can't possibly be human trafficking?

       It's not uncommon for homeless encampments to set up on large properties like that. It's buried and on the outer fringe of the property lines, in an area with no equipment and no activity taking place. The property owner and employees have no usual reason to = go out that far and a small company like that probably doesn't have the finances ot hire a private security company to do patrols.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around here people set up tents in the woods behind many businesses. Yes they own the land, but how are they supposed to know they're there?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're seriously reaching trying to connect the cement company to the Clinton Foundation. How many people are Clinton Foundation donors? And what's the amount we're talking here? It must be pretty low if it was an individual donor -- there are like $2,500 caps on those donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could probably connect every single company in the country to the Clinton Foundation if you're only going by if someone connected to it donated to the foundation. Oh look the janitor made a $100 contribution! /s

       These types of homeless encampments are the norm, not the exception. I think the problem is you, having never been exposed to this world before, equate "homeless encampment" with tents in the wilderness, and thus anything more warrants extensive forensic investigation because some random guy said its a child sex trafficking ring. That's simply not true.

       I don’t think you understand how hard it is to dig into Arizona Clay. This is a JOB that required a lot of time and effort to put together. 
A couple of homeless people didn’t set it up. The best part though is that the guy who discovered all this spends all of his time LOOKING AT HOMELESS CAMPS! Don’t you think he might be a little better at identifying this stuff than you are??

       Youre familiar with Sheriff Joe Arpaio? The guy who made a pipe bomb, planted it under his cruiser, and then framed a schizophrenic man for it? That man was imprisoned for 9 years and Arpaio never even got arrested for it.
He’s the guy that used to be in charge of these very same police...
So no, I don’t trust these cops and their sketchy coverup(s).

       Interesting. Do you think maybe Donald Trump is ordering them to cover this up, and that's why he pardoned Arpaio, to have this leverage? Could this be where he's done with all those missing kids?

       They’ve found graves, childrens clothes/toys, boxes of condoms, restraints to hold children, bunkers/cells to hold children that are too big to hold adults, bloody child’s underwear, a bloody knife etc.

       Who cares if they're Navy SEALS. If they look at straps clearly tied to wooden planks holding together a shelter and decide that those are "rape ropes," then they're either idiots or trying to push some kind of agenda.

       They’re clearly restraints in trees, not tied to wooden planks and arent for holding anything together.

       They literally showed the bloody knife, child’s underwear, etc. on camera, and had to stop digging up graves because of the smell.

       You mean the “trained” officers and investigators that have done nothing but arrest two of their people standing on PUBLIC property? Trained officers who refused to test or secure any evidence? Trained officers who haven’t even scoured secured the area yet? Officers who haven’t even ran a proper investigation yet as this was discovered days ago? and still have the balls to say there is no evidence?

       What makes you think these folks are "trained to combat human trafficking"?? As someone who has extensive knowledge and background working with both people experiencing homelessness and victims of human trafficking..... I'm highly suspicious of this claim of yours. They seem to have "expertise" in multiple things.... none of which I've found any of them having expertise in.

       The fact is you have what clearly looks like a classic homeless encampment located on vacant land along a freeway in a big city. Without seeing any evidence of children actually being held, someone wwith a political agenda to push deemed it a "child sex trafficking camp" with ZERO EVIDENCE to support it. And r/conspiracy bought it hook line sinker.

       It doesn't look at all like a normal homeless camp. The location isn't where the homeless go. The main structure they reference, isn't adult size, adults cannot fit in it, and kids cannot even be comfortable in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I guess trees with a bunch of restraints attached to it at varying heights, surrounded by curtains, are standard for homeless ppl?
      </p>
      <p>
       How hard are you trying to just ignore this? Do you think homeless ppl would drag a septic tank out to the desert, dig into the hard clay to bury it, and then toss their kids into the hot, non ventilated, make shift room that Doesn't even have a flat floor?
      </p>
      <p>
       And that all makes more sense to you?

       I mean I’ve first hand witnessed certain cops look the other way at certain people pushing drugs. Not all cops are bad but a lot of the corruption starts at the top. So even if some good cop wants to investigate someone his higher up might tell him not to.

       I’ve first hand witnessed cops look the other way at certain people pushing drugs. A lot of the corruption starts at the top so even if that one cop wants to investigate that person he thinks is moving dope or trafficking kids his higher ups don’t give them the clearance
      </p>
      <p>
       In this certain situation the cops are discounting the evidence they are presenting and calling it a rundown homeless camp even all the evidence points to it being something worse. We got a bloody knife, stuff tied to a missing girl, trees with restraint on them, dungeons small enough only for a child to get in but out, scout trees, and the actual homeless camp right across from it said they don’t go over there because of the cartels.

       These aren't militia loonies.  Craig Sawyer is a former Navy Seal who investigates child trafficking for a living. He's involved. They're also unarmed and are repeatedly pointing that out despite a guy on a quad coming and firing rounds off in the air threatening them to leave.

       So then why the threats from probable cartel members over a homeless camp? We know human trafficking is a big problem everywhere but especially in the southern states where the cartels operate heavily. Police can be complicit in it just like any other human being. Look at the rape gangs in the UK. Police were found to be involved in the rapes and cover ups. The people on the ground have shown experts in human trafficking this place who agreed that's what it's used for and they're familiar with the area as well as it's homeless camps. Keep in mind this was stumbled upon by a group going out looking for homeless vets living in the desert because that's what they do. They would know what one looks like.

       As someone into urban exploration, I can tell you that's not uncommon when trespassing on private property in gun country. I live in New England but I have many friends who explore in places like Texas and get warning shots fired off at them a LOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also not watched the entire video but do we actually see the gun getting shot off? I'd be very suspicious of him pulling out "LOL I'm getting death threats I must be on to something!" out of thin air.

       The guy pulling the gun isn't the owner. They've tried contacting the owners who want nothing to do with it. These are reputable guys who I wouldn't assume were hoaxing something for attention. Much like every other person who writes off disconcerting things under the guise of skepticism, you're taking things that actually are weird and trying to turn them into common things.

       They probably do which is exactly the point everyone is making. But if there's drugs and cartels involved there's also human trafficking and subsequently child trafficking.

       You keep just linking this one bullshit news article that has been proven tine and time again to be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're trusting that single article more than video footage of what is currently going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're trusting a reporter who talked to a cop, and the cop said they think it's a normal homeless camp. That isn't damning evidence that this is all wrong, but you are desperate to believe it, and convince others.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least make some valid points beyond linking that one article.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess we just believe all news articles now, unquestioningly. And cops would never say anything to cover their own ass.

       I mean, VOP are experts in tracking and locating homeless camps, they would know what to look for, and what is out of place for a normal homeless camp site or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The former SEAL that was involved has spent at least the past year searching for human trafficking operations. Plus his military training and experience in combat, he is uniquely suited to be able to know what to look for, and what would be out of place at a standard homeless people camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the trees with a bunch of straps attached to them, hidden from view by makeshift curtains.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alleged blood covered knife, clothing, towels.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bag of dark hair dye (if it's just a stop off for coyotes as some suggest,  then why would they be needing black hair dye, when the Mexican people are often dark/black haired.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big ass, multiple hundred of gallons sized septic tank type container, in the ground... so a homeless guy found this, dragged it here, managed to dig it into the hard AZ clay, and just tossed his kid in there? Because it should be noted that an adult cannot fit in it, and for a child, there is no spot to get comfortable or even to play, it's a curved on the bottom...
      </p>
      <p>
       The local homeless saying that they don't go into that area. Then describe where and why the homeless set up camps, and that they would not set up camp there, and that it certainly doesn't look like a homeless camp to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, you have the one guy from early on in the story who was trying to scare VOP off, and he said that HE had built it, and it was so he could escape the heat.... right....
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there are tons of little details that point to this NOT being simply a homeless hideout.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess it's easier to accept that one news story that said it's for homeless ppl, disregard everything being said and found, etc... I mean the government and local police could NEVER do anything unscrupulous, that's basically what you guys are saying at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand not jumping head first into the wild conspiracy theories or anything. But just as bad to completely disregard what all these vets are saying, guys who have nothing to really gain from this being relayed to trafficking. They won't even accept cash donations, but of course they must be awful guys.

       I’m not here to argue because you have already made up your own mind but it’s the Wild West and it’s private property. Of course there is some dude firing a gun, especially because he has had homeless people building tents and shit around his area. He’s also close to the border so is probably on guard.

       That's not evidence of anything, it's just a bunch of guys in the dark, not showing any of the things they're talking about, and deciding that everything they see is part of some child rape organization. Calling a hole in the ground a "dungeon" doesn't make it true.

       Those aren't "restraints" they're straps. You can clearly see they're being used to hold that makeshift structure together.

       This would be like going into your house and making a video, finding twine in a drawer and calling it your "rape string" and seeing a lock on your kids' door and deciding that it's a rape dungeon.

       No it's a news story that features the man that discovered the camp. You were inactive until 2 days ago and all you've done is say how this information is false and that there is no evidence. I'm showing you the evidence. I am showing you a news reporter interviewing that man. So you can keep denying it all you want. Anyone with half a brain can see what you're doing.

       Yeah I just posted that. The police refusing to investigate is highly suspicious indeed because everyone that is not police says it's for child trafficking. More spots like this will be discovered and the American public will be made aware of the corruption in the government. Rest assure, this is only the beginning.

       The company that owns this land, that threatened these veterans, is a large donor to Clinton programs, and Soros own large amounts of stock in the company as well.

       With the knowledge that child protective services allowed the osteras/frodsham thing to happen without reform, that numerous whistleblowers say that the foster system is corrupt, and with the knowledge that arpaio didn't investigate child complaints for decades, and that he has only been rewarded, the new information fills in all the blanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arizona has been a major trafficking hub for the elite network that has legalized child abuse for their personal tastes, I have found smoking guns, the VOP found an actual gun.

       Let me ask the one question that no one seems to be asking. If this CEMEX company owns the grounds and are connected as you said, then why did they build this makeshift child trafficking  camp out in the open close to a freeway where it could easily be found? Why not put this operation into one of their buildings where it can't be stumbled upon so easily?

       companies who own tons of remote real estate are perfect for an operation like human trafficking
      </p>

       the higher ups in the company can make sure no complaints are heeded or forwarded from them, and if anyone else like VOP runs across what is going on, they can just say, 'we own so much land who could keep track of all this'

       Thank you.  I've seen plenty of more permanent residences that people have managed to scrabble together out of nothing, and this just looks like a poor illegal's family camp.  The man even came back and begged for his tools and they said no.  Those were probably the only livelihood he had.

       If there was evidence they're totally destroying and tampering with evidence and a crime scene with their good intentions. Anything that's found there in an official capacity will never hold up in court because they've trod all over it, and any defendant could claim it was planted, tainted or simply faked for attention.

       I don't know what to believe yet but they're going to totally fuck up that alleged crime scene

       Then you've clearly done no research.
      </p>

       They found evidence, they called the police. The police refused to go investigate. They took pictures and gathered evidence in a safe and correct manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no crime scene because the police will not investigate, why won't they investigate it? Well theories include them being paid off, or them knowing who is implicated in such crimes.

       Fuck T_D. I posted it again on there and the reaction was basically "yawn, no evidence". These are the same people who were obsessed with Pizzagate and here's something just as big and they don't seem to care at all. There's something off about that, it's like it's become a whole different sub. This whole thing isn't right.

       first the deniers say, 'there is no way something so big could happen without people finding out'
      </p>
      <p>
       then they say 'well this evidence is flimsy'
      </p>
      <p>
       then they say 'well of course we know the elites are up to no good, but what good does it do to think about what we can't change'
      </p>
      <p>
       people are allowed to think if they don't know how....

       Those squiggly triangles are observed all over Arizona because it’s borrowed from Native American petroglyphs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may mean something in other parts of the world but in this region it is very much a Native American symbol. This area has tons of reservations and tribes all over the place....  it’s not out of place and also not hiding in plain sight. The local gas station all the way up to shopping centres, jewellery (like tradition al necklaces made by elders) to logos on water bottles use this symbol and would be very confused if you started talking about sex trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was almost curious about the story but then these symbols were brought up as some sort of proof and the story loses all credibility to me.... like every time these symbols are used to prove a story is connected to pedo shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t want to argue that somewhere or someone has used this symbol but correlation is not causation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you can see a connection or a mutual relationship between two symbols, doesn't necessarily mean that they are related.

       I wonder if this is related to all the missing migrant children, hence the cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be real bad if the local police got caught having had something to with the trafficking, but the optics of kids you genuinely lost ending up with traffickers might be enough for the police to go overboard to prevent embarrassment.

       Doesn't make sense though. Trump has arrested more pedophiles/traffickers in 1 year that the Obama administration in 8 years. The Donald does not equal Donald Trump (administration). Something else is going on here, on good old censoring Reddit is most likely a part of it. My bet is that the Donald is a big sandbox, lots and lots of members. They don't mind positive Trump stories, but this, can get the word out to lots of people.

       Try posting this in r/farming. If they remove it, there is undoubtedly a cover up and all farmers are pedos. Such conspiracy.

       What's sad is that something this serious gets flipped to a partisan issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes satire helps show hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree. This is a very serious issue, but it has nothing to do with t_d and making it an anti-t_d post does the entire topic and injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is not that the T_D mods suck. Everyone knows that. The conspiracy is that there is a huge pedo-ring likely going back to the pizzagate days which was non-partisan and goes back farther than trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP is acting like T_D mods are smart enough to be aware of all of this, but are covering it up because they already know that it connects to trump..
      </p>
      <p>
       This goes beyond Reddit mods, republicans and democrats. This is a serious issue that's getting drowned out with disinformation and partisanship. My satire was an attempt to point that out. Trust me, I don't take this shit lightly and I apologize if it comes off like I do.

       Nice outsourced graphic. Probably based on magapill.com, which was double counting arrests and including arrests from every country on earth in its count.

      <p>
       Here are the real figures, with sources, from ICE.

       Human trafficking arrests
       <strong>
        peaked under Obama in 2016
       </strong>
       , and have dipped by 18% in 2017 under Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1,952 arrests with 631 convictions in 2016
       </strong>
       (highest figures ever),
       <strong>
        1,602 arrests and 578 convictions in 2017

       Why are you so excited about that?  What points to a Republican?  Everything I find points to Clinton, Soros and Rothchilds...complete with Pizzagate Pedo symbolism that points to Podesta.

       McCain, Military industrial complex, Blackmail, corruption, bribes. Those who are most conservative tend to be the worst offenders. See Religion Gone Bad by Mel White. See the Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much to Republicans claim they are holy warriors and exploit churches and cheap Bible verses for votes, yet they are all completely corrupted as evidenced by Open Secrets?
      </p>
      <p>
       This stuff hits both parties. Republicans are worse than Democrats when it comes to this Blackmail and corruption scheme. Yet just because Trump ran an "R", people and the cult of Trump think the Republicans are innocent of this long running game. They need to be red pilled and prepared that some of thier heros are guilty disgusting slime balls too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want both parties to be exposed and destroyed. They don't represent the people. They deserve to be fired. This country needs a reset. The Republicans  should not be shielded just because the heat is on the Clintons and Soros right now.

       This is a homeless encampment, nothing more. They visited, and invented out of thin air this narrative that it's a child sex trafficking thing for clear political reasons.

       The news is saying the police found no evidence of trafficking. And that it’s just an abandoned homeless camp. Are you FUCKING kidding me? They think we are that dumb? Of course it’s a traffic camp! Anyone involved in the camp and it’s cover up deserves to rot in prison till they die.

       Went through the entire thread.  There is literally nothing here besides videos of a few guys going through a homeless camp and assuming every single thing they find is linked to child sex trafficking.  No people at the camp, no children, nothing but conjecture based on some random items and some shit tied to a tree that was used to hold up a structure, which they're calling restraints.  I'm convinced these kinds of completely off-the-fucking-wall posts with insane claims and zero evidence are psyops to make you guys look crazy, which they do very, very well.

       My only regret with this is how they handled it (and I know they are doing their best and appreciate their efforts in drawing attention to this camp and the larger issue). It would have been better perhaps had they just kept quite and waited for the creators of the camp to return so they could be caught and evidence collected which could be used to truly stop these sacks of shit. Because these people can always create a new camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       But either way, I’m glad someone found this and stopped it.

       This hits home because I found similar worrying items when out exploring near some cemetaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't really say much without doxxing myself but I found some very strange similar items.. Stuff from the 90's, 2000's, and 2010's even up to today..
      </p>
      <p>
       Found loose dirt in a square hole with a massive sheet metal piece covering it and suspicious items/trash everywhere. I reported it to the police and FBI but I have not heard back and am tempted to treck up there again to see if anything new has appeared.

       Well, I was open to entertain the mods point. But I was literally muted for just asking a question. The Donald now is way different than it used to be. Just like this sub. This used to be the deepest thinking sub I frequented but some time around Trump winning, it just changed. The whole place changed. Now it is was to corporately influenced.

       I do hope the Shit hits the fan though soon. We really have to clean this place up.

       This is most likely something like "underground inc" (special on Netflix)... there are organizations of people who smuggle in people from Mexico, and in turn make them into sex slavesand promise them freedom and a new life in America...they hair dye, the barrels...they are probably smuggling people in and then trafficking them.

       The mods control the subreddit...of course not every user on the Donald is together in one massive conspiracy to cover this up.  I was relying on a tiny bit on common sense and critical thinking skills, which seemed to work out fine until....

       I found this video on YouTube from 8 years ago, talking about "rape trees" and human/drug trafficking at the AZ border, and they also mention how law enforcement doesn't seem to do much because of environmental regulations (a bullshit excuse).

       Where is the evidence? Saying that something is child trafficking, without any proof, is propaganda. Especially when you see them spreading it and commenting on it like it proves something. They have even now taken to 4chan and 8chan to "investigate" so that they can hopefully find some "clues" since they haven't found any.

       I can't believe that the country got like this with the border. The crime and cartels are doing whatever they want down there, and paying off anyone they can.

       People may say it is just fear mongering, but it looks to me like crime is out of control near the border.

       Nice outsourced graphic. Probably based on magapill.com, which was double counting arrests and including arrests from every country on earth in its count.

       Human trafficking arrests
       <strong>
        peaked under Obama in 2016

       , and have dipped by 18% in 2017 under Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1,952 arrests with 631 convictions in 2016

        1,602 arrests and 578 convictions in 2017

       "They showed it to us"
What was shown? I've heard there were bodies and condoms and whatnot, but all anyone has seen pics of is homeless people trash...
If there's evidence of the claims that this is a child sex cult or whatever then make with the proof. If you can't because you don't have any then shut the fuck up already.

       Since the person I responded to's post was removed for calling me a shill, I'll add my explanation here:
      </p>
      <p>
       Check these videos out if you doubt the effort people go through to find places to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this video homeless people were punching holes through concrete and steel highways and carving out spaces to live, then carrying heavy furniture through the holes to live in:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In this video homeless people were dragging furniture, water tanks, bedding, and other heavy to carry stuff
       <em>
        miles
       </em>
       into storm drains:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These types of homeless encampments are the norm, not the exception. I think the problem is you, having never been exposed to this world before, equate "homeless encampment" with tents in the wilderness, and thus anything more warrants extensive forensic investigation because some random guy said its a child sex trafficking ring. That's simply not true.

       Interesting. Do you think maybe Donald Trump is ordering them to cover this up, and that's why he pardoned Arpaio, to have this leverage? Could this be where he's done with all those missing kids?

       The way the votes are going here, this forum is done, infiltrated.
A small locked entry, that only children could fit through is discounted.
Small and low arm ties are skipped over.
These people are sick.

       Because it goes against their sub-reddit rules you goddamn retard. I'm sorry but the board for Donald Trump Support is not the board to report pedophiles. Perhaps you should look in
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       or
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       (lmfao)
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere idea that the_donald subreddit is blocking pedophile rape camp posts because they are in favor of it is the highest level of retardation one can think of.

       Fuck. Got as far as the rape trees, couldn't keep watching. I am numb with rage.

       It's a good thing these (fucking awesome) dudes found them instead of someone like me. They're being all professional, whereas I'm pretty sure I would have just set up a little nest and just starting taking out anyone who showed up.

       He's not even Craig Sawyer, it's weird the person you replied to claimed it. All you have to do to see this is go to his Youtube-channel (just write Craig Sawyer on Youtube). Totally different guy. I don't know who the guy in that linked video is but he's younger, skinnier, has different facial hair and facial features (Sawyer has dark brown hair and is greying, this guy is ginger), higher voice, etc. Sawyer also seems to be a pretty calm guy and just uploaded a video update, and speaks in a very calm and concise manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't even one of those cases where it's ambigious and people just try to "defend" someone, this is legit not him and I doubt he's even supposed to be and the person just made a mistake in thinking it's him. I didn't see any indication the guy in that video was meant to be Sawyer.

       Trump might be a douche, maybe even a perv....but your purposely trying to connect something that has nothing to do with him and making things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why he won the election...one group consistently accuses the other of something they are guilty of...if anything, this will lead back to the Clintons, per usual.

       What I don't understand is why they didn't just have guys sit quietly and observe the site, wait for the people who use the camp to show up and confront them with your crew. Catch them in the act. They supposedly found this currently used site and just ran in and fucked up an opportunity to catch the perpetrators red handed?
