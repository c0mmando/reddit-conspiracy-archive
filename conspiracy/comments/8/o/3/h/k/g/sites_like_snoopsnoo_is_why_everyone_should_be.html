<p>A guy owns an SEO/online PR firm. He is played by a business to do online PR. He creates many puppet accounts in order to make it appear that the narrative hes pushing is a common opinion being shared by many people.</p>

<p>Like, are you guys actually trying to deny that someone could create 8 accounts, make a post with one and then start having &quot;conversations&quot; with his puppet accounts?</p>

<p>Are you seriously denying that happens? You must not know anyone who does online marketing or PR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it really doesn&#39;t matter to them.</p>

<p>99%+ people who view the comments will neither check nor care about comment histories. </p>

<p>You know hundreds of people who have been influenced by advertising on twitter/FB etc, having viewed ads and conversations posted by accounts that are just names and no content. And none of those people looked at the &quot;history&quot; of the people taking part in the conversation... they simply absorbed what they read.</p>

<p>Even on this sub, people digging into user histories usually just get ignored or downvoted. In fact, most of the digging I see is from people looking at T_D&#39;s bot nets. You have an issue with exposing donald bots?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like what company? The data miners or buyers?</p>

<p>Some websites record what you type even though you have not sent it for example Facebook. Who then bull sells the data as a whole.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re using snoopsnoo to dox either 
1: you&#39;re putting waaaaaay to much info onto the internet through your Reddit account
Or
2:you don&#39;t know how to really dox.</p>

<p>Although it probably helps if the person youre searching up uses reddit like facebook there are better services than snoopsnoo to find actual info or dox info.</p>

<p>Also you&#39;re able to delete stuff off of snoopsnoo just letting you know. My profile on snoopsnoo is pretty much a lie. </p>

<p>I mean unless you&#39;re using a clean IP and MAC address along with ISP you&#39;ll still be traceable to most. Especially if clicking links or accidentally downloading .pdfs or anything really.</p>

<p>Shreddit is gear more towards programmers, since you have to run it in the terminal. One smart feature is it goes through all of your posts and edits them, replacing it with &quot;Lorem Ipsum&quot; gibberish, then it deletes it. We all know Reddit, FaceZerg etc never really delete your info, they just save it as &quot;deleted=1&quot; and then bundle all your data and sell it to some $HedgeFund for $.00001 who then re-re-re-sells it to every bank, credit card company, spammer, retailer, debt collector, private investigator, Federal Intelligence Agency, the ADL and SPLC, the JIDF, and the DNC, where somewhere down the line all yo shit gets hacked by China and they also have a full copy of the &quot;Patterns of Life&quot; of all 323 million Americans in real-time.</p>
