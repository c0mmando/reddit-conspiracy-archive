       Yeah, I tend to believe that a percentage of humans are psychopaths in that they lack any empathy, fake human emotions, and only care about their own rise to power. Also, that these ppl, due to their drive, tend to be among the elites. But I wouldn't doubt that they are actually, physically not human. Idk, something about it tends to make sense to me.

       Run? Not necessarily. Imo Reptilians have been making deals with certain factions of the elite. Those factions receive technology, but in return, work under the Draco empire.  Other species have also been making contact in this way, imo. The beings from the Law of One are not Reptilians, yet they state that they contacted Egyptians a few thousand years ago, and another similar group was contacting the Mayans.

       I actually followed all of that. :)  I just really want to know how long we've been here and if we've actually been genetically engineered via virus to evolve to suit the needs of various alien species.  Graham Hancock often says we're a species with amnesia.  I agree, and I want our collective history back.

       We are an experiment. Most intelligent civilizations in the universe operate on a kind of hive mind. It’s what allows the to coordinate to the degree necessary to become enlightened. Think ant colony on steroids.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are one of the few civilization where individual conscienceless has been attempted as a subset of a global conciseness, and in order to facilitate the individual we have blocked ourself from the global. When someone becomes enlightened it means they have learned to regain access to the global consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you could say we as individuals have been engineered by a higher dimensional being, that being our own global consciousness in its own attempt to itself become enlightened and join and even higher consciousness.  We all have our individual paths to enlightenment, and as a whole we moving the entire global consciousness along its journey (our journey really) as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are on the right path, but you have to approach from a more energetic perspective. We live in a world designed by ourselves perfectly to keep ourselves ignorant of the truth. We must look beyond the physical word we provided ourselves to find it.

       I don't know much about Icke but I do know he talks about Archons. I was watching a Gerald Clark video and he mentioned how Thoth spoke of them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoth said he knew a way to keep them away from the earth for a few thousand years by some magic or some shit but eventually whatever he did would stop working and they would return to earth and "attack" humans again.  Really crazy and interesting stuff (to me at least.) I wonder if they have returned?

       I like a lot of what Icke says.  I don't know that he or I are right in our beliefs, but I'd like to think so, because that makes more sense with the shit that goes on in the world.  To me At least, it does .

       He also claimed to be the messiah. Did that turn out to be true? I enjoy his ramblings and have entertained him through many a long video but you could hardly say he's been right about everything. Particularly without evidence.

       No. He actually claimed we are all "sons of god". He also exposed Ted Heath and Jimmy Savile as savage molesters and satanists. Which is now proven correct.

       No. He claimed he was the son of God on Wogan. He was right on Savile and Heath but people knew about Savile when he was alive. Louis Theroux asked him about it in his first Savile doc. I like Icke okay? I find him entertaining I just don't think he's right. He's been cobbling together conspiracies to try to make some unified conspiracy theory. I mean he didn't start going on about Archons until lately. He flip flops.

       I don't know who or what they are but there is definitely a world wide group of "people" who know what's going to happen ahead of time and they all work together.

       Watch A Beautiful Mind from the perspective that John Nash wasn't crazy (he wasnt by the way.) Its 100% real. That's why he said we need a miracle to save us.

       not a david ike fan but i do have something for you to think about..
      </p>
      <p>
       if we take dimensions and think of them the same way we think of a rainbow it is not to far a stretch to think about what we can not see .
      </p>
      <p>
       everything vibrates , it has a frequency . like a radio station  ..
      </p>
      <p>
       out reality is only one radio station . if we could tune to another we may have a totally different reality .
      </p>
      <p>
       there may be beings there who have mastered the ability to tune into other dimensions . but we think of them as ET .. or aliens ..or reptiles .. greys ..
