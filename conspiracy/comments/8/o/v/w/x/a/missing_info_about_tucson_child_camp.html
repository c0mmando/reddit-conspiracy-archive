       I have been getting caught up on what's happening in Tucson.  Dove into a lot of posts made over the last few days and came across some info that I really didn't see anyone discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am posting a compilation video I came across which includes a facebook live stream and reveals what all I am sharing.  In it he discusses that yes they are taking everything from the site and putting it on display at "bravo base camp" in Tucson. He invites everyone to come take videos and pictures and spread the info. Something I have not seen anyone else mention.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you live in the Tucson please go and help document and share what all was found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next he mentions several times blue prints that were found at the sites which he claims to be underground sex dungeons to hold children and plans for some sort of underground church to be built.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also indicated that they had found evidence that there are multiple sites that have not been investigated yet along the I-19 corridor. Obviously these people had money and were not homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also mentions that at the site they have found a couple of other underground bunkers near the original site. These had not been brought up previously and had not been shared with police because the police were not cooperating and they do not know who to trust.  So they kept that info private until the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting point he mentions is that over 80 pairs of different sized children's shoes were found. That is a lot of shoes people!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk just thought that this might be helpful since really all I came across on this sub was a lot of arguing about "rape trees" and arguing not really going anywhere. There is a lot more to this story that hasn't been revealed yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here come the downvotes...

       You mean the people on social welfare programs that Trump is stripping away from low-wage or unemployed parents? It's because they can't pay $1000 a month for child care and $1500 a month for housing.

       That’s a whole separate issue that needs addressed. But no human being should ever be raped or trafficked no matter their nationality.  These guys can’t fix everything the government broke but they can save people.

       ACTUALLY, what they have done is completely ruined every bit of “evidence” they collected. On the completely minuscule chance that something shady HAD happened, there is now no evidence. None. There is not a court of law in this country that would accept ANY of what this expert has collected. So grats to him for screwing that up completely.

       Literally only had to watch the first 1 minute. Once he said we collected key, good stuff, no point in me continuing. 
You see, here in this country, we have what the courts call chain of custody. If that is violated, the case can and will be thrown out. There are exceptions but those strictly apply to law enforcement agencies acting in good faith. They do not in ANY way apply to what these people have done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know in what country you live in but here, just being a “vet” doesn’t give you some magical right to do what you want and then try to justify it by saying I’m a vet. If they took ANYTHING from those camps, they screwed up and even broke the law. So good for them. All these pedos will run free now thanks to him and his people.

       He does have a point. What good is awareness when people could have actually been punished? Now a defense lawyer can just claim any evidence was planted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only upside is that it seemed no one was going to be punished anyway, so in this case awareness is the best we have. But if there was an ongoing investigation and this team fucked that up, then that should all be punished and imprisoned.

       If the police won’t take it seriously, giving them the evidence is equivalent to burning it. Better to try to see what they can learn from it in order to follow leads and track down people places &amp; things that will ultimately provide a larger, more undeniable body of evidence.

       The trouble is there are other sources to compete with your claim. I'm not saying you're wrong for holding your opinion, not at all. I respect your right to that. I'm just saying, we can't take everything from any established media at face value.

       Oh dear, it seems like you're not really interested in doing any of the looking on your own and would rather be spoon fed answers. That's how you run into people who are trying to sell you their story. Anywho, you can't really expect people to take time out of their day to try to persuade you to their side of the fence. Some people have provided links to videos, images, and things that they believe are connected to what's going on (i.e. Addresses). It's up to you how to interpret those bits of circumstantial evidence. If you don't believe in the trafficking theory, that's fine. Again, I stress that the conspiracy community should be vigilant and skeptical of mainstream media, regardless of the topic.

       It's not about persuasion, though(ironically) a FB live-feed, multiple posts on Reddit, etc... definitely qualify as attempts at persuasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tonight, we should ask ourselves, what is a thought. Is it an amalgam of unrelated things that could be interpreted in multiple ways and which seem like ideas? Or is a thought a cohesive, linear, fully formed idea that that is self supporting and unimpeachable?
      </p>

       So, the next time you would like to express a thought about any old thing, remember the above and don't expect your audience to accept any less.

       Well, all thinking people should be skeptical by their very nature. It is a defining trait of the homosapien.

       "It's not about persuasion," you say, and yet here you are making statements to persuade others to your line of thought 🤔 "And don't expect your audience to accept any less." By posting this, you now have an audience, and you've done a rather forgettable job of presenting your point. The next time you would like to hop on the bandwagon and attempt to sway us to your point of view, just have the sand to admit it instead of beating around the passive-aggressive bush, attempting to condescend with tangential, existentialist rhetoric like "what is a thought?" Remember the above and don't expect me, your audience, to accept any less.

       Agree. A good handful of us do ACTUALLY research shit then others who don’t believe us ask for evidence and sources...they still won’t believe if we provide something.
      </p>
      <p>
       THEY have to be interested enough to find the evidence themselves...if not they don’t actually care at all and are just being trolls...imo!

       Restraints generally aren’t used to hold up an underground shelter anyhow. Usually dirt (with various additions and modifications-like sewer tanks!) is used for underground shelters.

       Stand up people who project their delusional fantasies onto other people about child rape? That is some sick shit. I hope they get some type of involuntary psychiatric hold.

       How is it a delusional fantasy? There is evidence. Just cause the cops are in on it doesn’t mean they can make the rest of America believe them. The words out. Have you seriously watched the videos? Serious question?

       Yes, the ones that were initially posted didn't have any indication that they were used for trafficking. The restraints on the trees looked normal. The bunker didn't appear to be sealed off in a way that would be used for anything nefarious. Do you have time markers and screen shots of what you think proves their claims?

       In the amount of time you have spent arguing with people about your uninformed decision you could have watched the video twice.  You want evidence then please go to their base and take pictures and videos and post them so we can all see them. I sure someone will eventually it was kind of the point of me posting this was creating awareness and to get someone on here from Tucson to take care of this for people.

      <p>
       And solar panels. I’ve never seen a homeless camp with solar panels.

       No the ones that the victims who came out to help look for missing children said were rape trees. Because they’ve been tied to them before.
Give me three good reasons for very strange leather straps to be tied to trees in a camp filled with porn, lube, kids underwear, a bunker an adult wouldn’t fit in unless they were pretty fucking small, hair dye, a bloody knife, random people trying to get BACK into the camp to dig up stuff they’d left behind, weird straps on trees that make no sense for animal tying- with blood on them. What animals have two appendages that need tied up like that?  Unless there’s some kinda monkey smuggling operation going on....
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans. It’s humans. And the cartels and the government are treating them like nothing. Just more pawns in their sick twisted games.

       You’re not gonna convince people  with your shit. This is too big. And too many people are doing everything they can to help these guys.

       Just watched this update.. Fucking heart dropping. They found plans/blue prints for additional bunkers and they also found 2 other locations.
      </p>
      <p>
       He literally says in the video they do not know who to trust. The evidence is on display and anyone can take photos. Is anyone in the area? I am personally going to post on the local sub reddits and see if someone can go down and take photos of the blue prints for further sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell he really needs the publics help. And he does. They need us. Does ANYONE have or managed to take photos of the blue prints and other related items? This will be a huge contribution to awareness if we can get photos of the evidence they have on display

       So the police investigators said this is nothing. Judging by the videos, it's nothing. He's just inventing things that he thinks are part of some rape/torture ring when they're clearly not. Straps on the trees that he claims are rape ropes are clearly being used to hold their shelters together.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, good. Just looking at it logically, it seems like no one was raped there.

       So my question is, why do you so desperately
       <em>
        want

       this to be true. What is there to gain by trying to convince everyone this is true when all evidence says that it is not?

       Let’s not forget, EVERYONE with ANY power in Tucson is a part of this. The media is covering this up, all law enforcement are either a part of the cover up or are too afraid, the courts are a part of the cover up. The Mayor is definitely involved because of his last name. Let’s not forget that it also has to go higher. I mean, the sheriff dept and the state police also have to be involved since they are doing nothing as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, all that has to be true because the only other explanation is that this was a homeless camp. A regular old homeless camp with random shit thrown about. Nah, that’s just ridiculous. I’m going to go with the complete cover up by thousands of people.

      <p>
       I don't recall the last time I've seen such an obvious case of people wanting something to be true when Occam's razor is staring them in the face.  And if you try to counter anything with a simpler explanation of what it is, you MUST be a shill and in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, even if this IS some kind of sex trafficking thing , the chances of it being connected to who everyone is saying (HRC, Soros, Rothschild, et al) are beyond slim.  You might as well say every time someones creepy uncle touches them they're acting on orders from Bill Clinton himself.  It's ridiculous.

       I don't think some or most people realize how easy and common it is for local media and law enforcement to simply spin or ignore what could be a potential massive story.
I have seen it happen locally dozens of times. A student dies from hazing at a prominent local university. The frat members clearly responsible get 100% cleared because several of them have prominent fathers in office. County Police help with the initial cover up, all the local media plays along because it's a football school and their simply repeating whatever the law enforcement public relations office tells them to repeat. No one with local newspapers or television is doing any actual digging or investigating. They are parrots nothing more.
That's essentially a low level thing that's easily covered up. Something much more sinister would quickly be managed by the local PR much faster and efficiently.

       It literally took me under 1 minute to find that. Not figuratively. Literally. And I’m guessing if you actually provided any other details about any of these other “cover ups”, I could find the same in under a minute.

       So have I. I can't get enough of this shit. The shit you guys buy into is so fucking hilarious I can't help but just poke the obvious fucking holes in it.

       Am I a shill too? Some kind of paid conspirator here to make you ask questions like "Where are the kids?" and "What about that dude who showed up and admitted that he and his father built it for a homeless man a few weeks ago?" or "Why didn't they, if they believed it was a rape camp, sit back and observe and attempt to capture whoever was using it and save children instead of immediately going live with it for shares + likes?"

       People want to believe that positive things are happening and that scumbags are being brought down en masse. These sorts of mini-theories have hope at their core, which is why they are so alluring. Nobody
       <em>
        wants
       </em>
       to believe a child sex camp existed in Arizona, they want to believe such a thing was found out and stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this allows for opportunists to spread disinfo they know will hit home regardless of evidence, which is basically what Q is.

       So if this is true (which in my eyes it obviously is) why are we just finding these camps? I lived in Arizona all my life and I know some areas of the desert don't really get much traffic, but he had a video stating the homeless stay 300 yards or feet (can't recall which one) away because that's the "cartel" side. How is it just now making media? Is it because people rather listen to a patriot then some nobody and that's what it took to get headlines? I know the cops are paid off, but what about the citizens that came across these camps. That had to be hundreds if not thousands of people so how did they shut all of them up? They couldn't have killed all of them without raising red flags and if they paid them off then of course they know it's real sex camps and they wouldn't want normal citizens carrying that information. Which leads me to the question of why now?

       I think anyone with reading comprehension can take that as "boy I can't wait until all those skeptics are proven wrong," which, is kind of fucked up since you would think one would say "Boy I hope all the skeptics are right, I don't want to be right about this."

       I found it obvious that the OP already believes that it is a child rape camp.  There was nothing about hoping it was or wasn't...in their opinion, it already is and nothing will change that.  So, the hope was for the skeptics to get shit on when the truth is revealed.

       Making assumptions about what my beliefs are huh. Thanks for asking. I genuinely don't know what's going on as does no one. The point of the post was to start a discussion about things that weren't being discussed. Kinda the point of Reddit. Either way at the very least a child was living in a poorly ventilated septic tank in the desert and that child has been mistreated. No one should live that way and CPS should be involved.

       Do you personally have a good avenue of keeping p to date on this? Feel free to pm me. The hash tag was a good start but I imagine there is an easier way to get up to date info. Is he live streaming off his facebook? Feel free to pm. Thanks for the post!

       If there is one thing this sub needs, it is more threads about pedos.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more we talk about pedos, the more we let those ideas and thoughts into our minds, the more we focus our mental energies on pedos, the better, right?

       Sorry this is late but I myself am just getting caught up on all of this. This is literally what I dug up today. I believe that there is also a YouTube channel they are posting to although I have not had time to find it yet. Glad this has helped bring it some people's attention

       There facebook page I found has the most up to date information and videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find the FB by searching VOP alpha CO - team pulaski

       Pretty great videos and I've been going through catching up on the older ones. Seems the original site may have been bull dozed? Trying to verify this

       You can also spread awareness via social media, word-of-mouth etc. that's what I'm doing. You can also donate. Veterans on Patrol won't accept money nor do they want a go fund me, but they do need some stuff like fuel cards. Go to their facebook page and they have an address. I think even just posting here, talking about it, doing research we are helping. Never discount the small stuff that you can do.

       To those who understand the meaning of these words :
The WHOLE TREE IS BAD where I am at ( Bobby Kennedy called where I grew up “ the most corrupt county in America”)
There were underground tunnels in my church/school as a child / along with using evasive tech on us -
There were literally Dirt Holes that went nearly miles to houses in the surrounding areas as well as a church a block away -children would be in the school one minute and then seen walking from the woods or a house over blocks away -THIS IS OLD SCHOOL SLOP ! Where I endured stuff like this. the “killings” where usually homeless adults or debtors (drugs or whatever)to get us to behave - I CAN CARE LESS THAT THIS IS RED saturnalia &amp; I am sick of peoples telling me to post on the Chans !!!
It has become much more sufficiently sophisticated where I come  from - SADLY ; THAT MEANS that this crap is  NEARLY IN THE OPEN ! And now that they’ve taken nearly everything dear to me - I feel I must try to be as openly frank as possible. [Im new to the whole social-engineering-experiment-but the Cue cards sucked me in and I felt that this was finally my time / yet w/ my conditioning and life experience I have no idea anymore if EVERYTHING happening here ON THE “ Web “is “ to justify the means “in America we have been under Martial Rule !! I PRAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!!! That’s easily proven- this patriot crap hasn’t truly existed since before the last Civil War !!! / shoot the messenger all you want I’m used to it ! Just please THINK CRITICALLY ]
There are tons of public officials who’ve been charged &amp; are running churches or in government here .Who do you go to when you’ve already been black-listed for asked no questions -not that there aren’t good people in government! It’s just that here ; they just have been put in job positions that are best for them to make sure the money flows into bonds to build more court houses !!! I can elaborate on this...... regardless 
WILL YOU PEOPLE CHECK OUT YOUR LOCAL CEMEX PLANT ? 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT WAS CROSSED W/ THE USE OF THE STAVIA DATA TRACKER?
WILL YOU FIND WHAT I DID ?
Nevertheless I am high speculative of all of this ?
Sorry I was conditioned for a total societal collapse before 2020 w/ when the world discovers
 “ what we do “ . Which were some of the mottos I was hammered w/ daily  by nuns- yes it was being openly operated by several catholic organizations - it closed shop in the 80’s &amp; moved across the street -( the only thing close to the operation that I survived that’s been declassified was MKSEARCH ) my debriefing lasted years as far as I know it’s never stopped &amp; now the people who went through the entire process are running the show here . In my opinion- Sincerely Lost with no hope ,Dada

       Child sex camp with tunnels to the local casino with pedophile symbolism. The camp is located on property owned by CEMEX cement company. It is on the border of mexico. CEMEX is owned by Soros and the Rothschilds. CEMEX makes donations to the clinton foundation. CEMEX has had building contracts in Haiti, which is a known hot bed for child trafficking. This is going to be the biggest sex trafficking and pedophile exposure of the most powerful people the world has ever seen.

       Oh boy. Another "the billionaire will save us" delusional mouthpiece. Donald bragging about walking in on nude and semi-nude teenagers in Miss Teen and Miss USA pageants wasn't enough to make him suspicious? What about the photoshoot of him and an extremely young Ivanka? What about saying he'd like to date his daughter?
      </p>
      <p>
       The man is extremely suspicious. Condoning his behavior because you like good politics is disgusting.

       The Clintons are more suspicious than anyone. This thread is about child trafficking in AZ. You just want to derail the discussion. Another shill over here.

       Nice astroturfing. Clintons are part of the swamp. Trump is no saint, but he definitely isn't swamp. He is working with white hats and exposing deep state.

       I would love to know why you think Trump is the only elite, Hollywood, billionaire, socialite that loves common people and isn't a part of the elite, Hollywood, billionaire socialite pedophiles rings.

       His history with Miss Teen and Miss USA would suggest otherwise. His obsession with his young daughter would suggest otherwise. His circle of friends (the Clintons, gasp!) would suggest otherwise.

       yep. multiple presidential administrative ties, through decades. we literally fund the trafficking of children. and cps, the military, the police, and even the private sector is involved. bilderberg is addressing "post-truth world" at the years meeting. i wonder. golly gee.

       Almost all of this is made up. Where is the "tunnel?" Proof? I think what you were referring to is a wash, nothing underground and nothing sinister. They are drainage during our monsoons.

       Cemex is not "owned" by Soros and/or the Rothschilds. Lynne De Rothschild is on the board of directors, but it is a publically traded company. Do some research. This all publicly available info.

       The crazy thing is that there could be
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       kernels of truth to this story. I imagine this camp they found might have been used for moving illegal immigrants, which often happens in a weird space between voluntary/involuntary, often under terrible conditions. Perhaps some really bad stuff went down here, it is hard to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       To jump the immediate conclusion that this was a "CHILD RAPE CAMP RUN BY SOROS AND THE ROTHSCHILDS" is so so dumb. A bunch of misinformed internet sleuths connecting dots that aren't there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the VOP guys, they keep making a bunch of outlandish claims but literally back none of it up with video or photographic evidence. This dude has been live streaming for DAYS and we get no quality video of any of this? Just more really bold claims and zero evidence that should be easily demonstrable considering he is filming constantly. I remain skeptical until they show some evidence.

       Absolutely!  And sadly there is a chance it won't get the real investigation it deserves because of nuttyass claims.

       This reminds me SO MUCH of Pizzagate.  There were definitely some kernels of weirdness that warranted exploration, but the nuts quickly came in and muddied the water so much the entire thing quickly became a joke.

       Maybe it's to make it harder for the kids to run off in the desert with no shoes on. Lots of cacti, rocks and stuff that are hard on the feet. I would not want to be barefoot in the desert.

       Lmao this is the most stupid shit ever. Out of all the desert surrounding Tucson they pick I19 and fucking Valencia? Not exactly a super secret location. Just about every homeless camp in the city looks similar to this one. Campbell and 28th, Golf Links and Columbus, etc. Get over yourselves and find another hobby.

       Agreed. There are semi permanent homeless camps all over Tucson. Structures, tons of trash, etc. I grew up near the Pantano and Tanque Verde washes and we used to go scope on out when we were teenagers. Lots of similarities to this particular site.

       So they spent their life savings to buy a $10,000 or more septic tank delivered into the middle of nowhere desert all the while they could have just bought an rv and shit on a toilet?  I guess some people might be that dumb but they def don't have jobs

       Where is the proof that the septic cost 10k? If they had the money to pay for septic permits and have a $10k septic tank system installed then maybe they wouldn't be molesting children in the bushes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a septic tank installed in S.C. and it cost $2,900. In the desert it would be cheaper. But still unnecessary unless you have running water. Where is the pictures of said 10k septic system? I'm not seeing the proof.

       It was more an estimate. I just remembered from looking at some while I was working for a farm. From what I remembered and from seeing the size and shape from the video.  Seemed like I pretty reasonable guess. Could have been lower could have been higher. More of just wanted to point out they aren't cheap.

       Is the septic tank shown on the video? How do we know that the same people who built the camp had the tank installed? Seems more likely that it was already there and they happened to build the camp beside it.

       Another thing I wanted to point out that I really have not heard anyone else mention is the fact that this supposed homeless camp had a $10,000 septic tank that was buried in the ground in the middle of nowhere. These homeless people would have had to save up to years panhandling and then paid to have shipped in the middle of nowhere. No way they were homeless they def had money to spend on things.

       Dude, that is the "core" discovery they made. The bunker that started this whole thing.

       Not a $10,000.00 septic tank. Nobody is disputing there was an fairly unusual underground structure out there.

       I don't understand why there aren't any pictures or videos of what this group is claiming. If they have so much evidence and saw so much why not show it? The excuse that they are worried about the authorities doesn't really make sense as if they wait and what they claim is true, the authorities could just take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched several of the videos but it's just some guy talking and not actually showing what they claim. Is there something I'm missing about all of this or are people just taking this groups word for it?

       Exactly. There are some local news channels that show some good daylight footage of the site. It's pretty involved site and def a little creepy. I doubt a lot of good stuff happens there but these VOP from guys, from what I have seen, immediately just to "RAPE CAMP" without providing a whole lot of reasoning or proof.

       I have seen some crazy set ups for sure. No one living in a septic tank buried in the ground though. Probably not looking hard enough?  Why go through all that trouble when you could have a tent.   They def don't need 80 pairs of kids shoes.  I am sure you know that you can get an rv in the NW pretty cheap so why buy an expensive, hot ass septic tank to live in? People on site are claiming some of that stuff had have been there for years. No one in there right mind would live in a hot ass, unventilated septic tank in the desert for years.  That makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's say that you are right and it was a homeless camp. Some kid was still living in a septic tank in the desert and at the very least and that child was not being treated properly. CPS should be involved at minimum. No kid should be living that way ever.

       I agree that it is weird they aren't really sharing everything they are claiming.  The only thing I can come up with is that they are being cautious about things.  These guys were military and have a love for this country. It makes sense that they would initially keep things under wrap until the authorities came to investigate. I am sure some key things were given to police to help but now that they are not gaining traction and claims of no evidence all over the news they seem to have given up on them and handling things themselves.  Everything I am seeing these guys were genuinely freaked out by this place and still are and have shifted to finding these people and uncovering what all they stumbled upon. Hopefully once things start to settle down they can present some more facts.  I don't thing people would just be showing up to volunteer if this was all nothing.

       Just because they haven't been licensed to use the word veterans to collect donations doesn't mean they aren't veterans. Other veterans take stealing valor very seriously. I actually date a veteran and she takes it to heart. Any time a homeless person claims to be a vet to get money she quizzes the hell out of them s asks them what their MO was, Where they were stationed, etc...  If they try and bullshit her on that she will make the person very sorry. I have seen her pull this 3 Times each time it ended with the person apologizing profusely.  If these guys are faking being veterans they will be sorry for sure but I highly doubt it as his mannerrism and the way he talks is just like someone who has been in the military.

       The authorities can't investigate anything vigilantes find. That evidence is tainted. The absolute best these guys can do is put the evidence in their videos. It's extremely suspect that he only talks about evidence when the entire operation should be on video.

       I live here in Tucson born &amp; raised. I’ve been following this story ever since the camp was discovered. A group of vets go around town searching for vets and homeless camps to help get them off the streets. They stumbled upon this place and immediately knew something was different due to the pornography, kids shoes, ties on the trees, a bloody knife, and much more. And don’t worry everyone knows about the septic tank and are definitely focused on it. Investigators are saying it could’ve been used to hold children. It’s all so sick.

       So the group claims you can go by their bravo base camp and see all the things they have collected, take pics, and video and also asks for help to spread the word through social media. Anyway you would go by there and help us to see some of what they are talking about?  I know a lot of people are dying to see what all they are talking about.

       Yea I’m 25 min out from it. I’ll go out and check it out tomorrow. I was watching a live video like two days ago and the white guy that is screenshotted said TPD was going to go pick up the knife that had blood on it so I doubt that’s still there. Anything that is there I will get you guys more info and pics.

       It was more an estimate. I just remembered from looking at some while I was working for a farm. From what I remembered and from seeing the size and shape from the video.  Seemed like I pretty reasonable guess. Could have been lower could have been higher. More of just wanted to point out they aren't cheap.

       Are you kidding me? The restraints on the trees? Over EIGHTY children’s shoes, pornography, and the septic tank that looked like it was used to hold children. And please don’t tell me the restraints could’ve been something else. I’ve seen countless actual reports of rape trees and it’s terrible. You’re gonna tell me children were here just for fun and not for trafficking?

       I'm going to say there is no evidence as of yet that there is a connection to trafficking
       <br/>
       Everything you listed either has not been shown or can have other uses other than jumping straight to child sex trafficking
       <br/>
       Is it possible? Absolutely
       <br/>
       Have we seen solid evidence to show us any actual connection to trafficking?  No
      </p>
      <p>
       if the people pushing this so hard were not the ones who recently got exposed for trying to run another psyop, and this is basically trying to use the same psychology, I'm going to let the cops handle this and not people who I already do not trust
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the cops handle it and present evidence, not start another Bundy ranch

       What sort of evidence would satisfy you regarding a connection to trafficking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the items and contents of the camp, why do you feel it is such a stretch to assume something nefarious is going on down there?

       I'll trust those cops over people who have already tried to (and succeeded to a degree) decieve people.
       <br/>
       As of this point those specific cops have not to my knowledge attempted to deceive us, and until they do, I'll give them more trust than the others
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence would satisfy me?
       <br/>
       I hadn't thought about that honestly, umm, for the sex part, probably some sort of DNA which would need to be lab tested to see if there is a match at all, but if there was used condoms or something to that degree
       <br/>
       I wouldn't automatically jump to it being sex with minors even with that though honestly, if there was child pornography, that would definitely make me consider it a possibility
      </p>
      <p>
       For trafficking it would take a lot, most likely it would take video, audio or some sort of documentation evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's probably stuff I'm missing but I'm happy to look at all evidence (I've watched as many videos as I've been able to find) people have if they want to link it
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I don't think it's smart to assume anything, Espcially something to this degree
       <br/>
       Now, I never said nothing nefarious was going on there, please don't put words in my mouth
       <br/>
       I have said that as of yet, I have seen no evidence that shows child sex trafficking
      </p>
      <p>
       I have already said it is possible, I just think it's smart to rely on evidence rather than emotion and assumptions

       I'm definitely one of the open-minded people on this sub and I tried looking at some of this stuff yesterday, but it's all over the place. Not sure if the people trying to make everyone more aware are not aware themselves, but people on the internet hate videos. Especially if they video does not cut right to the chase. If they have to sit through more than half a second of anything interesting they're going to change the channel. So pictures please. (And please don't link from crazy.com, put it somewhere I wouldn't be afraid to put my click in.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any way we could get a concise, organized explanation of who/what/when/where here, perhaps in another post? And with clear pictures of the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is this group/person? I don't need a cop or a scientist at a podium, it can be a dude with a camera. But it can't be a dude with a camera who's lied to us before or stands to profit from BSing. Also, who owns it or who's been there recently? I have a feeling that if people with investigatory experience were involved from the get-go, they could have gone around and tried to collect as many hair samples as possible or something for identifying victims/traffickers/witnesses, but instead it sounds like lots of people have come in and more or less ruined that opportunity. But maybe not? Who owns it? What do they usually do there? Is it weird that they own it or do they own lots of other similar properties and has anyone poked around those for similar setups there before they can cover their tracks?
      </p>
      <p>
       What did they find? Pictures. Explanations. Please hold back from extrapolating basic things into outlandish ones, if there are a couple of solidly damning things, don't even mention the other eight sorta normal things that
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be something crazy. You just muddy the water and create doubt. You don't have a PR or a marketing team, you have to be your own PR/marketing team and recognize the strongest points and the weakest ones. In the same way that the media can downplay a story by only highlighting the trivial things, we can sow the seeds of our own destruction by emphasizing too much weak evidence too strongly. They just need a reason, any reason to doubt something they already don't want to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       When did the events occur? From the map it looked like there was a neighborhood across the freeway. Have any of those people been asked if there's been any activity on that other side in the last week/month/year? There have been mentions of the police being notified and stopping by already/others saying that ignored them - it would be interesting to see a timeline of these events with statements/articles/police reports showing a clear rundown so we're not having to just rely on a few people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where exactly is this? I guess I really mean, why was this place chosen? Where did the kids go? Where did the come from? (fuck off cotton eyed joe) Was there some sort of industrial operation nearby or trade show or event, short or long term, that happened at the time the children are suspected of being there that would explain them being there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't hookers flood to Super Bowls and World Cups? So wouldn't child sex traffickers flock to places where their services are needed, but on a smaller scale? So what if this was a stockyards of sorts, a temporary holding point for a Taken-like sex camp that moved along with some drilling crews or a Taken-like auction of kids to foreign princes?

       So the police investigators said this is nothing. Judging by the videos, it's nothing. He's just inventing things that he thinks are part of some rape/torture ring when they're clearly not. Straps on the trees that he claims are rape ropes are clearly being used to hold their shelters together.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, good. Just looking at it logically, it seems like no one was raped there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question is, why do you so desperately
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       this to be true. What is there to gain by trying to convince everyone this is true when all evidence says that it is not?

       You're getting caught up in semantics. They don't look like child handcuffs if that is what you are trying to imply. News stations reported that they had the same (or similar) straps on other trees to hold up the shelters.

       I think it's safe to say that everyone will feel pretty shitty if they find out there are children being raped, but he said
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I pray to god this blows up in everyone's face that is trying to say this is nothing
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think anyone with reading comprehension can take that as "boy I can't wait until all those skeptics are proven wrong," which, is kind of fucked up since you would think one would say "Boy I hope all the skeptics are right, I don't want to be right about this."
      </p>
      <p>
       The dude is hoping for raped children for the sake of triggered skeptics.

       Child sex camp with tunnels to the local casino with pedophile symbolism. The camp is located on property owned by CEMEX cement company. It is on the border of mexico. CEMEX is owned by Soros and the Rothschilds. CEMEX makes donations to the clinton foundation. CEMEX has had building contracts in Haiti, which is a known hot bed for child trafficking. This is going to be the biggest sex trafficking and pedophile exposure of the most powerful people the world has ever seen.

       He's wishing that the MSM doesn't win again and the comfortably ignorant American people wake the fuck up. This is only a sliver of the global trafficking ring.

       Oh boy. Another "the billionaire will save us" delusional mouthpiece. Donald bragging about walking in on nude and semi-nude teenagers in Miss Teen and Miss USA pageants wasn't enough to make him suspicious? What about the photoshoot of him and an extremely young Ivanka? What about saying he'd like to date his daughter?
      </p>
      <p>
       The man is extremely suspicious. Condoning his behavior because you like good politics is disgusting.

       What was sick?
       <br/>
       In the video I saw there was nothing that showed evidence of child trafficking
       <br/>
       It showed evidence children were most likely there but what evidence leads to trafficking?

       Nice astroturfing. Clintons are part of the swamp. Trump is no saint, but he definitely isn't swamp. He is working with white hats and exposing deep state.

       I would love to know why you think Trump is the only elite, Hollywood, billionaire, socialite that loves common people and isn't a part of the elite, Hollywood, billionaire socialite pedophiles rings.

       His history with Miss Teen and Miss USA would suggest otherwise. His obsession with his young daughter would suggest otherwise. His circle of friends (the Clintons, gasp!) would suggest otherwise.

       It literally took me under 1 minute to find that. Not figuratively. Literally. And I’m guessing if you actually provided any other details about any of these other “cover ups”, I could find the same in under a minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       So tell me again - the local media is in on it and covering it up by not reporting it all the while reporting it ? Got it.
