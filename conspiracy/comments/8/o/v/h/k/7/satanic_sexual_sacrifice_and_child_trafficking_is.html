       With the surfacing updates regarding Tucson Arizona potential trafficking camp, this brings to light the fundamental issue of Trafficking as a whole and where these people end up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is 2018 and we still deal with forced labor, forced slavery, and forced sexual contact. Meanwhile when these cases happen, the internet turns into a debating in-fighting machine hell bent on everyone trying to prove each other wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been a truth seeker for a long time and am so sick and tired of seeing people turn on each other and attack each other instead of offer actual due diligence and further research and cooperation. I am well aware of astro-turfing, however I see so many "noob" truth seekers who fall hook line and sinker for emotional reactionary implosions of complete BS comment strings based out of their own life experience and limited first hand knowledge of these subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point with this thread is bring awareness to you, the fact that this kind of shit has been happening for thousands of years. The "satanic panic" was not really a panic, but more an collective "oh shit, this might actually be happening" only it managed to get de-railed and lost it's steam.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we really want to have a prospective and clear shot for a better future for ourselves and our kids, we need to face the ugly facts and dark truths that we long have shoved under the carpets of our consciousness...
      </p>
      <p>
       SO many victims. There are so many victims of child sex trafficking that do not have the pleasure to post or share their experiences with us on Reddit. There are people RIGHT NOW as I type this, literally subdued and being transported, shipped, moved, raped, hurt, conditioned, controlled, you fucking name it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am tired of the division here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to share with you some actual survivors of Satanic Sexual Rituals. One of those brave souls is a sweet soul named Becki Percy. Here is a short biography.
      </p>
      <p>
       My name is Becki Percy. I am a citizen of the United Kingdom however moved to America in 2015 for fear of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       My bio parents are Satanists so, as a result, I was subject to child rape from the age of 4, trafficking from age 9, acting in child pornography, and being a witness to satanic rituals including child sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police and authorities in UK have full knowledge of this yet those who tortured me are free to roam the streets. I know if I went back to my country, I would be killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently my asylum case is pending in the Ninth Circuit. Since being in America I have done what was asked of me and I will soon be opening an online business April 1st.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am begging for refuge in America. I know I can bring much to this country. The country I love
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your time
      </p>

       Here are video testimony of what has happened to her:

        https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2WchHhGBXo7AF8z9lS5aA/videos
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS IS ONE VICTIM.
      </p>
      <p>
       ONE.
      </p>
      <p>
       VICTIM.
      </p>
      <p>
       That managed to break free and actually use her voice and bring awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine how many victims have not been able to do this! So many people have been killed and have never had the chance to speak about what has happened to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find channels like this on YouTube. I know she is not the only victim speaking up about her abuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are even videos like this you can come across:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/i4dcaaCwy6k">
        https://youtu.be/i4dcaaCwy6k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Couple this with knowledge brought forth by former agents and people such as Ted Gunderson and you have an ugly picture:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2c1siCGv78">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2c1siCGv78
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you go further and look into Cathy O' Brien and cases like the Finders and other mysterious conspiracies and you really paint some dark pictures of things that need to be brought to the light.

       We need to continue to raise awareness and bring this unfortunate reality to the light of truth and day. It is the only way this shit can get shut down. This is systematic and not strictly related to one country. This happens all over the world.

       It needs to hit public awareness. It needs to hit the 100th monkey.

       As soon as the mass consciousness wakes up to these truths it's fucking game over for the power structures of the world.

       That sounds like a very specific case and one I honestly am not fully aware of.

       Do you have any links of where I can get started?

       My question is to those that feel the need to down vote this post and posts like these.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it the emotional reaction? Is it the fear? The ignorance? or is it just paid astroturfing? Oh man I could use a genie in a bottle right now

       Yeah, TPTB can't afford enough shills to fully downvote a post on r/conspiracy

       What's more likely is 28% of r/conspiracy users disagreed with the post.

       I mean either way u wanna position it, it's still just speculation. So your guess is literally just as valid as mine (assuming you are not a shill attempting to discredit a non-shill). So with that in mind, I'm not saying u are wrong but I'm not saying I am either.

       TBH, I'm just not going to be prodded into an argument. arguing on these sites does nothing for anyone since people tend to just dig into their current belief system, even more, when challenged. When I see a profile that seems to exist purely to be antagonistic, It makes me extremely suspicious about the identity and intentions of the person managing that account for sure. Not saying anything about you specifically, but it is a trend i have noticed whilst lurking.

       Who did I try to discredit? Ironically assuming any disagreement is the result of shills
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       discrediting r/conspiracy user who share that opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess both possibilities do have the same amount of evidence, I just think TPTB being unable to downvote a r/conspiracy post below 50% is highly unlikely (realistically, if r/conspiracy was a threat it'd be gone). It's much more likely that the downvotes are from normal users, just like every other post on every other sub on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this is r/conspiracy where we accept the most obvious answer isn't always the correct one, but there seems to be this common opinion here that we're on the verge of exposing TPTB but all they're doing to combat the threat is ineffectually downvoting. That seems absurd to me.

       If you were trying to end the discussion you would have succeeded by now, because ending the discussion would require you to do literally nothing. You're actively putting effort into keeping the conversation going by replying.

       I'm still only half way through it, but it's very good.  Had to get the paperback since the ebook wasn't available then.

       Silly question and one I can probably google but might as well ask
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I need an actual kindle to view e books? Or can I get a desktop app or program to run/read the e book.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not I can just buy paper back but I am curious. Thanks again

       I may just buy paper back, always better to have books on paper than on a cloud in my opinion.

       Regardless I'm going to browse through it and get up to speed.

       Android tablets also have free kindle software, so you're not required to buy a kindle or an Amazon Fire tablet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of books are also available in ePub ebook format at the Google Playstore, not just in kindle ebook format, but
       <em>
        Programmed To Kill
       </em>
       doesn't appear to be in ePub format yet on the Playstore.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also check excellent free apps like Hoopla to see if they have a book, or free library apps like OverDrive (really good one too) to see if libraries you're affiliated with have the book available free for you in digital format.

       Here is a Wikipedia link at the bottom for Martin Allen's case.  There are some references at the bottom of the page.  Also in the page there is stuff that will you lead you to the a page on the Elm Guest House Scandal.  Since it is late where I am unfortunately I am going to have to till you to look up Vishal Mehrota on your own (not to be rude).

       It's because many departments and positions of power have been filled with psycopaths that will gladly cover up this sort of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which in turns make people feel they cant trust their own local police or even the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, it is so prevalent that I am suprised it has not "hit the fan" as it really should have back when there were many cases reaching public eye especially the Dutrox case and subseqent cover ups of other trials and cases coming forth

       Feigning outrage is a bullshit tactic. I'm not defending pedophiles, and I'm not attacking victims, but this seems more like a scam than a victim speaking out.

       Survivor or charlatan? you decide!
      </p>
      <p>
       There is literally no evidence to support either claim my man. One persons story is just that, one persons story. I'd love to hear something from either people who she claimed to be her parents and see what they have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's vacuous blabber that proves her right, maybe it's he-said-she-said, it wouldn't be the first time that the truth is somewhere in the middle.
      </p>

       I've met people in my personal life that "escaped" form their parents, they mostly had mental issues. That is not to diminish their worth as human beings, that's just what it was: mental issues and a broken home. It would be far from the first time someone made up a story like that. And seeing as how she "runs a business" selling hippy bullshit candles it's just such a cliché at this point.

       You frame this thing as a

       battle and then the vast majority of the time, the folks pushing this stuff also frame it as a
       <em>
        Trump will save the children
       </em>
       trope.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm old and cynical and the fact that we
       <em>
        know for a fact child molesters come from all races, political parties, and religions
       </em>
       means that when I see someone trying to use this shit to their advantage, it raises a red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Y'all say pedophiles are protected by the highest levels of government and let's be real, you try to link Hillary and/or Obama to it; why? I think it's because the majority of
       <em>
        fox news types
       </em>
       have become conditioned and their confirmation bias is on point so this type of shit can really rally the base.

      <p>
       Anyone who actually read Podesta's emails doesn't believe in pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say that Alefantis isn't a molester and it's not to say that Podesta doesn't join him, but the way
       <em>
        y'all will say, did you see the emails??
       </em>
       is akin to only reading the headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you'll say I'm a shill or ignorant so I'd like you to point out something in the Podesta emails
       <em>
        that provides any evidence for this shit
       </em>
       ....don't worry I'll wait.

       If we
       <strong>
        really want to get the pedos

       What opened my eyes to this, OP, is that there are SO MANY victims of SRA that are just out there, online, trying desperately to have their stories be told. They're all out there in the open. I think most people immediately dismiss as crazy, because they don't think this could be true...but why would so many people from so many different backgrounds lie about the same story? Also, there's really nothing to be gained by telling the world you were sexually abused or accusing so-and-so of being a pedophile. Also, those accused almost never attempt to sue the allegers, because that would open them up to discovery. It's the same pattern again and again and again. There's even 'accused advocate' firms where shady professionals help abusers squash victim's claims against them:

       Satanic Panic in the 80s was real and was just successfully covered up. Read Elder Pace's memo to the church about the SRA victims he met with:

      </p>
      <p>
       If you can accept, for one second, that these people are telling the truth about being ritually abused, there's literally a mountain of evidence against various named perpetrators that are still waltzing around out in the world, maybe just waiting for the opportunity to do the same to your children.

       Some cases and people recieve more attention than others, but I totally agree, there are so many people out there willing to say their stories and already have, but are often ignored or downplayed or even ridiculed.

       These pedophelic people are groups of Ashkenazi Jews who have been in and out of trouble for the same thing for literally 1000s of years. Their ritualistic child murders and blood letting is what led them to be forced to convert to Judaism in the first place, funny enough. After much research, I have come to the (original) theory that they do this because they have, by virtue of long periods of inbreeding and/or living in the outskirts of societies and thus having for choice of breeding partners the dregs of societies throughout history, accumulated a massive list of genetic and mental diseases, some of which have been treated with the imbibation of blood, like Porphyria for instance. Imagine what it would feel like to be a person with wholly evil inclinations who then finds that they feel better (assuage symptoms of various diseases) when drinking the blood of children, and how you might rationalize that in a religious sense. You would tell yourself that you are evil, because the evidence would be incontrovertible, but you would want to feel as though that were alright, and so you would say that you are the purest yang to the purest yin; a metric by which goodness might be measured through comparison to absolute evil, and thus are a good force in an overarching way. This same sentiment is echoed in the Hidden Hand dialogues, wherein he says that the hidden elites of which he is a part are actually good because they allow people to understand true evil and therefore choose to not become it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly believe that this is the final conclusion to the research into child ritual abuse and the self-same bloodletting/drinking that occurs in most all cases. A group of people who are massively genetically afflicted with a whole range of diseases both mental and physical, some of which can be treated by drinking blood, tried to rationalize their wholly evil effect on society and so came to the quasi-religious conclusion that they are good because they give the clearest contrast to what is good.

       So, in my research, I've come across that theory as well. Also heard stuff about the Knights Templar, who were originally dissolved due to charges of blasphemy (worshipping Baphomet, and some weird mummified head that appeared as different things to different people), supposedly moved to Switzerland/Scotland...switzerland supposedly satanic (
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/06/world/48-in-sect-are-killed-in-grisly-ritual-in-switzerland.html">
        https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/06/world/48-in-sect-are-killed-in-grisly-ritual-in-switzerland.html
       </a>
       ), Scottish Rite freemasonry also rumors of being satanic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, we've also got Jay Parker (
       <a href="https://www.thehighersidechats.com/jay-parker-satanic-ritual-abuse/">
        https://www.thehighersidechats.com/jay-parker-satanic-ritual-abuse/
       </a>
       ) who claims to have grown up in a multi-generational Satanic family, that claims they're illuminati bloodline  from the 3000 year old Amalekite's
       <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Amalekites">
        https://www.britannica.com/topic/Amalekites
       </a>
       ....(also interesting about Jay's story; he claims Arden, Delaware is a satanic town. I'd love to poke around there one day)
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, when we reach that far back in history, I can't be sure. I don't think anyone can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       My interest in Satanism only occurred because I started studying pedophilia. If you go down the pedophilia rabbit hole, you ultimately bump into Satanic Ritual Abuse (and if you follow that you also come across MK Ultra, but that's another story). I've come to believe a lot of 'pedophiles' are actually 'pedo-sadists' that get off on the destruction of something innocent. Who would want to do something like that? Psychopaths, turns out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the 'tenets' of Satanism would uniquely appeal to psychopaths. 'Do what thou will shall be the whole of the law'. It's the ONLY 'religion' that says, 'fuck traditional morality, do what you want, be your own star, be your own God'. Serial killers have talked about the 'God feeling' they get from killing someone. Psychopaths. Surgeons have that feeling too ---&gt; that field skews toward psychopathy. I think people need deeper justifications for their actions, even psychopaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if they don't, here's a sect of people who are a-okay with horrific shit. I think the doors are open for any psychopath that wants to fuck shit up...consider Henry Lee Lucas:
       <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=299036">
        http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=299036
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you were going to abuse kids and want to get away with it, it would behoove you to make the situation in which abuse occurs SO BIZARRE that no one will believe the kids if they try to tell. There's the Hampstead kids:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/su5Gt57Hhgw?t=50s">
        https://youtu.be/su5Gt57Hhgw?t=50s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Bonacci's testimony of abuse (kids being killed, horrific shit) sounds like it was all done for 'kicks'.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, whether there is some older faction that participates in rituals for some deeper reason, I think the Satanic Abuse door is wide open to any psychopath with pedophilic/homocidal tendencies. There also seem to be many different reasons for it: mind control (breaking people to create 'alters' you can program), basic sick sexual release, and perhaps something else...Maybe some demonic entity really does appear when you fuck and kill kids/people. I don't know, I'll never find out via first-hand experience. If there WAS some supranatural thing that happens when you commit evil acts, then I can't imagine any one specific group of people would have a monopoly on it...anyone that did evil things would figure that out. I can't imagine 'the devil' discriminates between his followers. Maybe the Caananites were the progenitors of this....like I said, too far back, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the essay, but like I said in my other comment....this shit goes DEEP!

       For sure. I've gone through it; just commenting that there are rabbinical scholars that propose that it's not such a strange story when you take into account how common child sacrifice was back in those days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you seem to know a bit about it, what I always thought was weird was that there was just a Ram/Goat (forget) just kinda hanging out by the temple, and then Abraham killed it instead. Any possible significance with a Satan metaphor there? I haven't read the bible and I'm not well versed in the Abrahamic religious texts at all.

       Genesis 22:
      </p>
      <p>
       7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
      </p>
      <p>
       8 And Abraham said, My son,
       <strong>
        God will provide himself a lamb
       </strong>
       for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
      </p>
      <p>
       9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
      </p>
      <p>
       11 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
      </p>
      <p>
       12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing
       <strong>
        thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son
       </strong>
       from me.
      </p>
      <p>
       13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him
       <strong>
        a ram caught in a thicket by his horns
       </strong>
       : and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering
       <strong>
        in the stead of his son
       </strong>

       Okay, so God says, 'sacrifice a lamb up on the temple' and Abraham is like, okay, we'll find a lamb on our way up there. But then there's no lamb, so Isaac says 'well, I guess I'll just sacrifice my son' (or is he like, 'God wants me to sacrifice something, and I don't have a lamb, so I guess it's Isaac's time to go'?), and he's about to do it, and then the Angel's like, 'okay bro, you're with the shit, we get it. Peep: there's a ram over there', so he sacrifices the Ram, instead of Isaac yah?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I get that Jesus is the sacrificial lamb.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's up with God being so high-maintenance and needy? Why does he want anyone to sacrifice anything?

       God made a specific promise to Abraham through Isaac in Genesis 17:
      </p>
      <p>
       19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a miracle child due to Sarah’s age, by divine intervention (Genesis 21):
      </p>
      <p>
       1 And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       God then tests whether Abraham believes His promise or not in Genesis 22:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Abraham obviously believed God would intervene in some form, and in doing so in action we have a figure of Christ as well as a demonstration of his true faith (Genesis 15):
      </p>
      <p>
       4 And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       James 2:
      </p>
      <p>
       20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
      </p>
      <p>
       21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
      </p>
      <p>
       22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
      </p>
      <p>
       23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

       Okay, okay. Makes more sense. God hooks people up and then tests them to establish the importance and strength of having faith; establishing he's not gonna let them down if they're with the shit.
But you can't just have faith and not do anything; that's not how it works. You gotta willfully act upon the world, and be proactive, but then if you also have faith while you're doing it, God has your back heavy. Something along those lines, yah?

       Well, in the times of the Gentiles God hooks us up with the Holy Spirit when we repent and believe.  The question then is what difference does it make if you claim to believe in Christ and don’t do what he says?  Luke 6:
      </p>
      <p>
       44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
      </p>
      <p>
       46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
      </p>
      <p>
       The good fruit is a result of true faith in Christ.  John 15:
      </p>
      <p>
       4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That faith will be tested this side of eternity though.  Romans 8:
      </p>
      <p>
       24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
      </p>
      <p>
       25 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
      </p>
      <p>
       27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

       I made a similar comment about how this is the benchmark for evil and morality in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Catholicism there is transubstantiation.  Maybe it was meant to be a ritualistic way to ween people off evil inclinations...and faith alone may have a placebo effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe it's Jesus' way of saying "Eat me" as a epithet.  LOL
      </p>
      <p>
       It actually gives me an idea though...ever read
       <a href="https://lifeofjesus.wordpress.com/">
        this
       </a>
       ?  I take most things with a grain of salt, but I kinda have wondered why people believe in works from channeled entities like Thoth or Ra but not someone like Jesus, especially if this is mainly more personal.  I mean, aren't the books of the Bible the Word of God as "channeled" through humans?
      </p>
      <p>
       I generally read way too fast, but it would be interesting to skim back through it and see if there are any references to the things you talk about.  But considering the subreddit we are on, the first couple of chapters are pretty interesting (hint: Jesus was a conspiracy theorist).
      </p>
      <p>
       Has a good quote towards the end, "Courage, then, brothers of mine, now mainly in the apprehensions, vices, lies and evils of the majority, that depart you from yourselves, isolate yourselves from the darkness that they are surrounded by, and among that which they shall fall encircled in, to fill the plane due to them for their backwardness; whilst the environment is purified with their departure, you shall find yourselves in the midst of that which provides the same purity of the atmosphere that you occupy and the kindness and intelligence of those who are with you elected as the chosen of the Lord."

       <em>
        anyone guilty of these things should be hanged

       but the reality is a lot of this shit is pushed with such an obvious, and often inaccurate, partisan slant that it’s hard for many to take seriously.

       Hastert was third in line to run this country and he’s in jail so this gives me hope that these cases are outliers, but I don’t know.

       See and thats why I don't even really like using the satanic label anyway. I really should have just did the cover all term: ritualistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's such a common problem and in all honesty, the catholic church issue is a whole new thread in itself and own right. The amount of mass graves that are popping up is insane.

       From the Merrimack Webster definition of Satanism,
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        : innate wickedness
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       2 : obsession with or affinity for evil; specifically : worship of Satan marked by the travesty of Christian rites
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I’m aware of the church of satan and LaVey beliefs of satan as an archetype and not an actual entity. Quite literally, the word satanism means the belief in satan. We can debate semantics like this all day long but that is completely besides the point. Wouldn’t it be reasonable to instead assume the girl in question here does know about the church of satan beliefs but also attributes her parents’ beliefs to a literal belief in satan? Regardless if you want to call them satanists, abusers, or whatever, the priority should be on shedding light on ritual abuse and torture, with this thread specifically focusing on a pattern of abuse that has characteristics of a literal belief in satan instead of getting up in arms over petty semantics.

      <p>
       Really don’t think dismissing child rape and abuse over a perceived misuse of a word is a reasonable response here. This isn’t stereotyping, it’s saying there are a group of people that abuse children while using devil worshiping beliefs and rituals, and it shouldn’t be a shock that satanism sums that belief system up. Words can have different meanings based on context.

       If you look at the wiki entrance for Satanic Ritual Abuse, there's not a single mention of LaVey's Church of Satan, which you mention but quickly dismiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have to downplay or commiserate with OP's experience as it doesn't affect me in any way, but statements like yours and the OP's is what I take issue with.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still lack information despite your quick google search. You mention LaVey but completely ignore the eleven rules of his Church, instead going for the old "obsession with evil" stereotype.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're mistaking sub-humans with mental issues commiting atrocities in the name of some deity with a group of people trying to lead their lives according to very wholesome and personally liberating values, exactly as an uniformed racist will mistake every Muslim for a terrorist or every black person for a criminal.

       That’s actually the opposite of what I am contending. I acknowledge the church of satan and do not associate anything abuse related to followers of that belief system. I have no problem with them. I agree that the disgusting people behind this abuse and those that follow LaVey are in no way related asides from the word satan. Satanism, in the context of OP’s post, refers to sick people who believe in a devil like entity and “obsess with evil,” not the Church of Satan and its followers who, again, I have absolutely no issue with. I dismiss the Church of Satan so quickly because I don’t think it’s relevant to this at all asides from the word satan being in it. I’m not trying to associate the two in any way. Please at least allow me and others to clarify before resorting to the personal attacks.

       After delving into the history of Jewish Blood Ritual ala Blood Passover by Arial Toaff, to name but a single source, I see now that the same thing still occurs today but goes by the name of pedogate, or the satanic panic before that. The methodology and ritualism present in all of these cases, from Hampstead to the Franklin affair to pedogate, all echo exactly what is described in the minutes of court cases involving Jews who engaged in this terrible and most heinous of evils. There are over a dozen canonized child saints who are such only because of the torturous end they met at the hands of these same blood ritualists, and there are dozens of court cases throughout the past few hundred years wherein Jews were convicted for these crimes, so don't call me an anti-semite, and muster an actual argument in lieu of emotional shame-based epithets, please.

       Ancient people did it for a long time. Child blood was supposed to bring youth and now science is proving it. It even happens in the open when the rabbi circumcised the baby and drinks the dick blood. The penis being the most potent source

       it’s an account of a huge pedophile ring in Belgium. It just mirrors how every other country is handling it. It seems to be deeply rooted in our conscience and it seems to be going on in virtually every single country. I honestly think there is no way for it to be stopped it’s to big. The only thing we can hope to do is comfort the victims

       Well I was saying that as a generality which is why I separated it from the other comment. Didn’t want u to think it was a shot directly aimed at you. Let’s say hypothetically I did mean to say that but in some passive aggressive bullshit way (which is exactly what that would be if I were). Let’s say hypothetically I think you are a shill and no amount of arguing with me will change my mind, who cares? Personally I wouldn’t care cuz I know what’s on my side of this screen right now.
I told u ur opinions are as just as valid as mine so if that isn’t enough to put you at ease then I’m not sure what will and I’m not willing to put out the effort to find out.
 I do totally agree however about the latter portion of what u said about /conspiracy not being a threat. If it were I think it would be much more tightly controlled and censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the general tactic that tptb employs is just massive disinformation. Just get people arguing in all directions till they don’t know what is up or down, and THAT is why I am weary of any account that shows a disproportionate amount of antagonism. The real people in here just don’t go into subs they don’t like just to argue, they stay in their own lane unless they are on the clock and getting paid (I’m guessing and assuming here) to just lurk around in something unentertaining to them. If they want to argue for entertainment, they are still a shill. Just a different kinda weird negative emotion-feeding shill instead of a state sponsored shill I guess. Hope that makes more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to answer ur question, no. It wasn’t some passive aggressive backhanded comment.

       Android tablets also have free kindle software, so you're not required to buy a kindle or an Amazon Fire tablet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of books are also available in ePub ebook format at the Google Playstore, not just in kindle ebook format, but
       <em>
        Programmed To Kill
       </em>
       doesn't appear to be in ePub format yet on the Playstore.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also check excellent free apps like Hoopla to see if they have a book, or free library apps like OverDrive (really good one too) to see if libraries you're affiliated with have the book available free for you in digital format.

       God made a specific promise to Abraham through Isaac in Genesis 17:
      </p>
      <p>
       19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a miracle child due to Sarah’s age, by divine intervention (Genesis 21):
      </p>
      <p>
       1 And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       God then tests whether Abraham believes His promise or not in Genesis 22:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Abraham obviously believed God would intervene in some form, and in doing so in action we have a figure of Christ as well as a demonstration of his true faith (Genesis 15):
      </p>
      <p>
       4 And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       James 2:
      </p>
      <p>
       20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
      </p>
      <p>
       21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
      </p>
      <p>
       22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
      </p>
      <p>
       23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

       TBH, I'm just not going to be prodded into an argument. arguing on these sites does nothing for anyone since people tend to just dig into their current belief system, even more, when challenged. When I see a profile that seems to exist purely to be antagonistic, It makes me extremely suspicious about the identity and intentions of the person managing that account for sure. Not saying anything about you specifically, but it is a trend i have noticed whilst lurking.

      <p>
       Who did I try to discredit? Ironically assuming any disagreement is the result of shills
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       discrediting r/conspiracy user who share that opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess both possibilities do have the same amount of evidence, I just think TPTB being unable to downvote a r/conspiracy post below 50% is highly unlikely (realistically, if r/conspiracy was a threat it'd be gone). It's much more likely that the downvotes are from normal users, just like every other post on every other sub on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this is r/conspiracy where we accept the most obvious answer isn't always the correct one, but there seems to be this common opinion here that we're on the verge of exposing TPTB but all they're doing to combat the threat is ineffectually downvoting. That seems absurd to me.
