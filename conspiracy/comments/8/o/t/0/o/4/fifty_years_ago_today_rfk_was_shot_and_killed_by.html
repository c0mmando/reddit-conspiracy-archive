       Let us remember the mind that we lost June 5, 1968.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Even if we act to erase material poverty, there is another greater task, it is to confront the poverty of satisfaction - purpose and dignity - that afflicts us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product - if we judge the United States of America by that - that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl.
      </p>
      <p>
       It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is true here at home, so it is true elsewhere in world."
      </p>
      <p>

       Good link. 'Operation Mind Control' is a very good book if you can get your hands on it. There used to be pdf's online somewhere. He tried to release a second edition with added info about microwave technology but it pretty much dissapeared (supposedly CIA bought every copy).

       RFK Must Die by Robert Blair Kaiser is a great read, covering the hypnosis Sirhan underwent after the assassination to retrieve blocked memories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who Killed Bobby by Shane O'Sullivan is also a good resource, covering all aspects of the assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a great video which came out last month, which explores the mind control aspect of the assassination.

       I'm not as familiar with Monarch Programming as I should be, but I have heard before that he could have possibly been Delta Monarch programming (which I guess has something to do with amnesiac assassins?).

       But the evidence, which supports that he had been hypnotized into pulling the trigger, is staggering.

       Well, they kinda go hand in hand if I'm not mistaken.  Their minds are fractured in the same way as schitzos, but I think the monarch programming can be triggered. Similar to that movie Zoolander.

       What is with you trying to tell me that schizophrenic people are easier to mind control? That's what I was diagnosed with when I was 18, and I'm most definitely not capable of killing anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even kill insects.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not making progress with your outdated conspiracy theory about how schizophrenic people are easy to mind control so why do you post vitriol?
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in 2018 and all of this shit is completely irrelevant now. There's never going to be another assassination that you can blame on schizophrenia so why are you celebrating this beyond fucked up holiday to fuck with everyone's minds?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard voices in my head nearly 24/7 since I was 18 and I fully believe they are independent people contacting me through telepathic means. And I never once came even close to murdering somebody. In fact, I think they tried to use MK Ultra drugs on me after I was made vulnerable by my diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND I STILL THINK YOUR THEORY IS BULLSHIT.

       Basically a contact of mine attacked me in 2012 by giving me something close to mescaline or similar powerful hallucinogen without my knowledge. First, I felt like I had ascended to some lightbeam dimension where I could project my mind into other places and see them, but then it turned hellish eventually resulting in me walking to a gay bar and having an ambulance called for me. I was in the mental hospital 30 days afterwards.

       By the way I wasn't trying to say you were high, it's just that I think I know what you're on about when you say mk ultra but I think many drugs and pharmaceuticals could be considered MK ultra, or at least drugs that help indoctrinate into our narrow minded society.

       Sirhan Sirhan didn't even pull the trigger. He was mind controlled by handlers and just sent to the hotel. There were at least two shooters. I always found it funny that they found a "Palestinian" to blame it on. I wonder what group of people really dislike Palestinians.

       It wasnt Sirhan Sirhan it was actually Duran Duran. But seriously there are so many logical holes in the shooting it is like swiss cheese. So Sirhan somehow knew RFK would be directed through the kitchen even though the original plan was to go through the ballroom.
