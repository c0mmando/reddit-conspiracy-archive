        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let us remember the mind that we lost June 5, 1968.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if we act to erase material poverty, there is another greater task, it is to confront the poverty of satisfaction - purpose and dignity - that afflicts us all.</p>

<p>Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product - if we judge the United States of America by that - that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.</p>

<p>It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl.</p>

<p>It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman&#39;s rifle and Speck&#39;s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.</p>

<p>Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.</p>

<p>It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.</p>

<p>And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.</p>

<p>If this is true here at home, so it is true elsewhere in world.&quot;</p>

<p>- RFK</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy to help. </p>

<p>RFK Must Die by Robert Blair Kaiser is a great read, covering the hypnosis Sirhan underwent after the assassination to retrieve blocked memories. </p>

<p>Who Killed Bobby by Shane O&#39;Sullivan is also a good resource, covering all aspects of the assassination.</p>

<p>This is a great video which came out last month, which explores the mind control aspect of the assassination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is with you trying to tell me that schizophrenic people are easier to mind control? That&#39;s what I was diagnosed with when I was 18, and I&#39;m most definitely not capable of killing anything.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even kill insects.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not making progress with your outdated conspiracy theory about how schizophrenic people are easy to mind control so why do you post vitriol?</p>

<p>We live in 2018 and all of this shit is completely irrelevant now. There&#39;s never going to be another assassination that you can blame on schizophrenia so why are you celebrating this beyond fucked up holiday to fuck with everyone&#39;s minds?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard voices in my head nearly 24/7 since I was 18 and I fully believe they are independent people contacting me through telepathic means. And I never once came even close to murdering somebody. In fact, I think they tried to use MK Ultra drugs on me after I was made vulnerable by my diagnosis.</p>

<p>AND I STILL THINK YOUR THEORY IS BULLSHIT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, with your snarky ass comment about how I&#39;m high or something I&#39;m not inclined to tell you. But I will because you apparently gave me a genuine apology.</p>

<p>Basically a contact of mine attacked me in 2012 by giving me something close to mescaline or similar powerful hallucinogen without my knowledge. First, I felt like I had ascended to some lightbeam dimension where I could project my mind into other places and see them, but then it turned hellish eventually resulting in me walking to a gay bar and having an ambulance called for me. I was in the mental hospital 30 days afterwards.</p>

<p>Why wasn&#39;t LAPD stationed at the Ambassador Hotel, only private security guards?</p>

<p>How many bullets were actually fired? </p>

<p>Why did LAPD destroy the physical evidence (wall panels, etc.) that were removed from the hallway where RFK was shot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, with your snarky ass comment about how I&#39;m high or something I&#39;m not inclined to tell you. But I will because you apparently gave me a genuine apology.</p>

<p>Basically a contact of mine attacked me in 2012 by giving me something close to mescaline or similar powerful hallucinogen without my knowledge. First, I felt like I had ascended to some lightbeam dimension where I could project my mind into other places and see them, but then it turned hellish eventually resulting in me walking to a gay bar and having an ambulance called for me. I was in the mental hospital 30 days afterwards.</p>

<p>They were planning to dose me with this drug for a long time.</p>
