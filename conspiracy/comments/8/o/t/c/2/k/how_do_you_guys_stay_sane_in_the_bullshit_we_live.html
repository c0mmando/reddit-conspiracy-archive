<p>But how do you deal with the bullshit rat race, getting raped by taxes, the fucking food is all glyphosate laced, everywhere I go now I see trannies and they have no ideas its the glyphosate/atrazine/fluoride/chemtrails, like I legit feel bad for them having to go through that because its all chemical influence</p>

<p>You work and have zero free time for anything else. Everything is taxed, the loans are all interest money making scams, college is a scam, women lie and are untrustworthy (I&#39;m like on my 50th GF for fucks sake, I&#39;m about to start dating Christian girls who maybe have some fucking morals and values)</p>

<p>Its all bullshit to be honest. I tried living in Commune (won&#39;t mention the name here because I dont want to dox myself) and that shit sucked. We all had to work 40 hours a week to keep the community running, but didnt get paid shit because food and housing is freely provided there. (let&#39;s just say I will never be for communism or socialism after that experience)</p>

<p>But I know we can set up some sort of community, living, city, or some shit that is better than the bullshit we have now.</p>

<p>Anyway, how do you cope with money, work, lifestyle, free time, etc? Existice itself in Western society is a big fucking scam and its all set up to milk you, make you a cog in its machine</p>

<p>Not really. If it burned down, it would be utter chaos for a long ass time before anything of semblance reformed. In that aspect, it wouldn&#39;t be worth it. I think its more like a Thanos/Balance thing. Or maybe its something like when you were a kid and threw something in the bonfire to watch it burn, mesmerized by its destruction. In a sense, creation is slow and boring, destruction is quick and chaotically entertaining</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Its a fucking scam. Taxes, college, loans/interest, wage slavery, the 40 hour work week, pay is shit, fatherless homes, society is broken, escapeism, psychological brokenness in most people, lots of zombies walking around, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually cool with myself, and in a sense at peace and content with the fact of my own existence, but you very well know that the current system can be something better</p>

<p>imbalance, inequality, suffering, manipulation, scams, bribes, pollution, everything is fucking poisoned with industrial or big ag run off, most people aren&#39;t genuine or even conscious, etc</p>

<p>No its not just based on me. I can very easily reach a contentment and peace with everything and go off to a monastery or off the grid, but then I&#39;m being selfish and not helping fellow man. Its the Bodhisattva who, even though he has reached enlightenment, refuses to live in the Pure Lands and sacrifices Valhalla in order to keep returning here to wake everybody else up until everyone is enlightened. </p>

<p>People are already suffering, psychologically, physically, spiritually, financially, emotionally. As someone who has worked with the dying, I&#39;ve seen people waiting to be released from this realm.</p>

<p>That makes about five or six of us on this sub.</p>

<p>hopefully, though, we can encourage more people on this sub to </p>

<p>1) Learn what appeals to authority and appeals to consensus are</p>

<p>2) Understand why such logical fallacies work against the pursuit of truth</p>

<p>3) Reconsider the nonsense stories they were taught in school and by TV.</p>

<p>its called conscience. I regret sleeping around and whoring around when I was younger and in retrospect find that my best sex and experiences where with women I loved and was honest and dedicated to. Also, its gross to be with someone who has slept with 100 dudes, no thanks. You can be a slut, but go do that else where, I&#39;m good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to find like-minded people! (I couldn&#39;t believe it but I put myself out there on Tinder a year ago and met some really wonderful people...I simply wrote in my profile what I was into and that I was looking for like-minded humans and found some). Maybe find a pet companion... or plants if you&#39;re allergic I guess haha, they are very comforting. Try to balance out the negative with the good, watch an uplifting movie or some funny youtube videos. I&#39;ve been reading The Law of One series and knowing that I can be a positive force in the world balances me out a bit, although... knowing the truth is always going to keep you sad to some extent. Just gotta roll with it and try your best to take care of yourself!</p>

<p>Western culture, media, etc programs women into free for all sex, tinder creates a certain psychological profile, shit my ex was legit 9 out of 10 said when she was on tinder, she got 1000 messages the first 2 days with offers to buy her stuff and send her money for pic/panties, etc. So that tinder effect will create certain privileged bullshit attitudes and the media/mags tell them they have to look a certain way and that their boyfriends should look a certain way and so on. Its all a massive brainwashing scam</p>

<p>The feed from secondary reality, which has much more information in it then pre-internet did can be overwhelming. My brain is meant to deal with primary reality, and to handle a few stories, not all that can be gleaned in a day online. </p>

<p>Living simply (which includes not getting into debt) and keeping focused in primary reality has brought great peace of mind. I enjoy conspiracies, but I don&#39;t give them weight in my life. It&#39;s a fun study and that is all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen Chaps, ill post my unvarnished opinion here because i think it is important (lol)</p>

<ol>
<li>Loved ones, family, good friends (who you meet with IRL)</li>
<li>some nice foods to occasionally enjoy (like a good BBQ and a Beer)</li>
<li>Nature, Nature, Nature!!</li>
</ol>

<p>This is my recipe for an sane life, get off reddit sometimes and be with the ones you truly have affection for. I am not truly a poor guy, but when my parents were going through tough times, the best memories come from that period. The joy i felt if we were having a BBQ, family around, friends who drop by.</p>

<p>These are the little things that make life, life. That truly gives a moment of joy without the worries of WWG1WG or other things like #me2 and  Bush did 9/11. And ofc NATURE!! nature is the best place to learn new stuf, lots of our tech stem from the processes of nature, and the ones who are the most in haromny come from that to. And it gives you the moment to contemplate about your own life as well.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents Chaps, enjoy the good foods with your loved ones to come. :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the old adage remains true, by that: if it&#39;s everyone (or everything) else&#39;s fault, it&#39;s probably you. It can be hard to view the world favorably for someone who finds interest in conspiracies and the like. My advice? Try and find pockets of ignorance in your brain via immersing yourself into a few hobbies that give you legitimate joy. Find a group of friends you truly connect with and can get positive effects from being around them. I can&#39;t really say you&#39;re wrong about everything you brought up. It&#39;s a matter of perspective, and I&#39;m sure you have all the reasoning to why you believe you&#39;re right. And hell, you might even be. But the world has a lot of optimism and good things out there if you look for them, just as much as there are bad things.</p>

<p>wtf? Actually I accept people having different views and sexuality, but 100% know that the trans epidemic is from the chems in our food/water/plastics, etc. If you go to any country that does not have the same chems in their food/water supply, you simply will not find the same amount of trans as in the U.S.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stay &quot;sane&quot;?</p>

<p>hahahaha.</p>

<p>&quot;we&#39;re all mad here&quot; like in Alice in Wonderland.</p>

<p>Embrace the insanity is the first step to cope with the black pilled Abyss.</p>

<p>Here is my one thing that keeps me going through the daily onslaught of bullshit and lies and poverty and slavery. It is the first thing on my mind when i wake up and it&#39;s the last thing in my mind before my consciousness blinks out to sleep.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my only healthy obsession.</p>

<p>Think of it like the scene from Batman Begins: &quot;if you devote yourself to an Ideal and if they can&#39;t stop you then you become sonething else entirely..&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UTq93_VQGuw">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UTq93_VQGuw</a></p>

<p>What &quot;ideal&quot; am i referring to?</p>

<p>The Crash is coming.</p>

<p>And everything in Modernity, all of the fake economy, fake jobs, fake people, fake cities, fake media, fake institutions, fake billionaires, fake leaders--the corruption and wickedness and worship of Mammon--all of it will be rolled back several centuries in a giant civillizational reset.</p>

<p>Ted Kaczynski was right about everything except for the foolish and doomed and futile way he retaliated.</p>

<p>But Ted was a Harbinger and a Prophet of the Coming Crash.</p>

<p>So how is the Crash going to happen and flick over all of the World&#39;s dominoes simultaneously?</p>

<p>If i told you, i&#39;d have to kill you.</p>

<p>just kidding, the whole blueprint is laid out here in the most visionary essay ever written by Julian Assange way back in 2006.</p>

<p>Conspiracy as Governance:</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf">https://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf</a></p>

<p>What does it mean?</p>

<p>We have to destroy cryptography.</p>

<p>All of it.</p>

<p>By cracking it.</p>

<p>Forever.</p>

<p>That event will trigger the crash. No more Internet. No more Globalist networks where Illuminati, Bilderbergs, Zionist ex-IDF spies, Deep State servitors, Narco-Terror Cartel Bosses, Billionaire Oligarchs--can change a number in a spreadsheet and zap it to London to Malta to Dubai to Hong Kong and plunder trillions from entire nations and start wars on false evidence and keep it all secret using crypto.</p>

<p>These vast and thinly stretched Intl networks of Conspiracies ringing the world like a Hyrda&#39;s tendrills will all snap back when The Book of Secrets opens.</p>

<p>Glen Simpson and his network of Conspirators at FusionGPS and Orbis used custom crypto Apps to conceal their plotting. And that&#39;s just one example, a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>After crypto is cracked, none of that will be possible any more.</p>

<p>Crypto made Conspiracy <em>TOO EFFICIENT</em></p>

<p>100 years ago you&#39;d need a cast of 1,000 insiders to pull off what FusionGPS and Orbis did. Today it took less than a dozen with a need to know.</p>

<p>But the Crash won&#39;t exactly resemble Mad Max. Think of it as more like the 50 years after Newton revealed his invention of the Calculus, which sparked a fury of inventions and discoveries and triggered the start of the Industrial Revolution.</p>

<p>It&#39;s The Singularity, and it&#39;s not going to resemble what anyone has written in speculation about what it will be like.</p>

<p>And you get to be alive to witness it.</p>

<p>That makes tolerating any amount of infinite bullshit the easiest thing in the world.</p>

maybe start at a business you are interested in emulating and learn as much as you can.<br/>

<p>IDGAF what triggers you to be honest. If you are triggered by &quot;trannie&quot; then that&#39;s your issue not mine.</p>

<p>If you are a trannie, so what? Yes I still see you as human, yes I can still give you respect, yes I can still have a civil discourse with you if you allow that, and yes if you were my style physically (not fat and other attributes) then I would be open to dating/etc.</p>

<p>However, I still think 100% 1 of 2 things: Either you got tricked by the chems in the food/water/air or pre-natal influence in the womb by these chems to be Trans.</p>

<p>Or, you were female in past life and ended up in a body that you needed to change because of that. But I am more of the school of thought its the chems that got you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just rated us based on whether we are hot to you. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have the upper hand in this conversation.</p>

<p>This is a very low consciousness, duality/division, SJW thing to say. I am not looking at our debate as me having the upper hand. I am looking at this more as a friendly tennis match.</p>

<p>However soon as you revert to wanting to report and censor me because you are triggered and &quot;feelings&quot; its clear that I am winning</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re just a huge tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why, because your feeling are hurt and you can&#39;t use civil discourse to discuss things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you should look at yourself for the problem. Not everyone is a tranny, not every girl is a scumbag, not every job saps the life from you. If you live in sma major city, try getting out to rural areas more often. City people are very different from rural people. There are less crazy liberals, trannies, and LGBT people who want to force their beliefs onto you. You&#39;re more likely to find a girl who wants more than just hooking up in a relationship.</p>

<p>As for college being useless, I found it to be the best thing to happen to me. I was often depressed and felt like there was no meaning to life before I went to college. Then I went and started interacting with other people in ways I never had before. I pursued a degree that interested me, had the potential for big money, and taught me skills that are applicable in every field. I met one of my closest friends, who I ended up dating and am now planning to marry. All of this took a lot of work, and wasn&#39;t easy. You need to work hard if you want to get ahead in this world. </p>
