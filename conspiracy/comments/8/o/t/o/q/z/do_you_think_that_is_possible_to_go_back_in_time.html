<p>Is it possible that we are each as individuals meant to find and pursue our own meaning?</p>

<p>If so, what kind of a life, is a life spent feeling victimised and helpless?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but them divergence timelines, they are a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>maybe it&#39;s easy, using gravity to bend the space itself to travel,(gravity hill / gravity well *see electrogravitics for more info. but quantum divergence is a thing. I don&#39;t know how far the timeline will change, but only to you it will have changed. Because you have recollection of that other timeline, until it solidifies and then its the new normal for you.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think i would do it though, have thought a lot about this. Maybe if i had no family and such then i would.</p>

<p>But... if there is NO divergence, then i would go immediately and talk to nikola tesla, and viktor schauberger, those 2 are the worlds best scientists and inventors the world has ever seen (imo)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres the classic time travel from linked black holes and one being accelerated close to the speed of light. It&#39;s like tearing a piece of paper, sending one piece on a high speed roundtrip, and taping it together. When you cross you end up traveling through time. However it is limited to the point of linkage minus the slowdown from accerelation.</p>

<p>There is a good chance this isn&#39;t a natural occurance. However, if possible to recreate this might allow limited time travel in the future and explain why they didn&#39;t visit us.</p>

<p>A second method might lie in controlling quatum fluxtuations. If a machine is able to quell the fluxtuations and have enough energy to trigger a tachyon field you could harness tachyons. The latter part is already possible in particle colliders. There at sufficent energy levels quatum fluxtuations cause the Higgs tachyonic field to condense prior to reaching negativevmass.</p>

<p>If the fluxtuations can be quelled there is nothing we know of in physics preventing tachyons from forming. While Tachyons would not send you through time, they might be able to send information through time.</p>

<p>This has other dependants. We do not know much about possible tachyons. In order to interact we might require them to be charged. This causes a loss of energy because of Cherenkov radiation which will cause the Tachyon to reach near infinite speeds(It&#39;s lowest speed is just above light speed).</p>

<p>There is a further complication in relativity with Tachyons and local field interactions which might or might not prevent information transfer that breaks the fourth wall.</p>

<p>Hope this sufficiently answers your question. For further reading I suggest hawkkng radiation where one of the pair has to be tachyonic but is also destined to unite with the black hole and subtract it&#39;s mass, technically going back in time to do this. Cheers.</p>
