        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, r/conspiracy. I&#39;m a long-time lurker and I wanted to make a post regarding something I&#39;ve been wondering about. </p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in looking into conspiracy theories because I find that many are plausible, but only to a certain extent. For some examples: </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the Stoneman Douglas shooting was a false flag, but I do believe that the media exploited the event to push an agenda (both liberal and republican). </p>

<p>I believe that organizations such as the Freemasons should be held accountable since they have a large amount of power (anyone who would like to contest this need only to consider that they have a building and chapter in almost every town in America, not to mention a temple located near the nation&#39;s capitol), but I am not convinced that their intentions are one-hundred percent malicious as I simply do not know enough about them. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked enough into Jimmy Comet&#39;s instagram and Podesta&#39;s emails/art collections to believe an investigation into those individuals is warranted, but I do not believe that absolutely anyone who has ever eaten at the restaurant is in on some child sex ring. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned enough about Walt Disney and his company to find some of the content they produce questionable, but I don&#39;t think that every single movie that has been enjoyed by generations of fans is intrinsically evil, Satanic, or meant to poison the minds of young children. </p>

<p>In other words, I&#39;ve seen enough that I cannot ignore. I am and probably always have been convinced that there is more going on than meets the eye - but a lot of conspiracy theorists I&#39;ve seen (channels like A Call For An Uprising, Splintered X, etc.) make a lot of bold statements about the fate of the world and the nature of many governments and corporations. I can&#39;t get on board with that. So, I was wondering - to what extent do you, as an individual, believe the theories you have heard? When you speak about &quot;the great conspiracy&quot;, do you mean a worldwide, imminent globalist purge of biblical proportions or do you mean the small everyday things that go unnoticed but can have big repercussions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think of the philosophy of &quot;Global Government&quot;, and all of the naive people who have been indoctrinated into believing it as a necessity or an inevitability. </p>

<p>I think of the men who control the banking and issue the currencies of the world, and I&#39;m led to believe they wholeheartedly believe in the need to establish a one world government of which they are in control.  </p>

<p>I also think of how good hearted, yet easily manipulated the masses can be, and how people with sociopathic tendencies are the ones who usually pursue and seek positions of power.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a conspiracy of ideas. Men who wish to rule, vs men who want peace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty much how I think of things; the people with the most power in the world are a minority of sociopathic and narcissistic individuals who care only for themselves; this is how they reached power in the first place. But, most people have a degree of empathy and know what&#39;s really important in life. I think leaders can also manipulate people with these things too, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal observation and observation of what is going on in the world. To get into power you typically have to be willing to step on a lot of people and to make some difficult choices. I also study psychology and there have been many studies showing that the further up you get in the ranks of almost any establishment, the incident of sociopathic tendencies and personalities grows. This connection has been explored many times by many different people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. We all make choices. Those of us who have remained out of power have likely made choices that, on a moral basis, are drastically different from the choices made by those who end up in power. Think about all the decisions you have made in which you&#39;ve compromised your own well-being or advantage for the sake of morality. Think about where you would be if you had taken advantage of every single opportunity in your life, whether it was the right thing to do or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest conspiracies of all time (IMO):</p>

<ol>
<li>The very concept of money itself (as an idea and as a system). It&#39;s retarded. We&#39;ve just been doing it for so long we accept it as a natural thing without ever questioning it. No other animals in nature use money. It&#39;s a dumb system.</li>
<li>Language itself. Where did it come from? No one knows. There&#39;s a linguistic idea that language is an infection. It completely structures our perception of reality; so much so that we can&#39;t even conceive of what it would be like to experience life without language. We can theorize about how/why language came to be, but ultimately we have no idea about it&#39;s origin.</li>
<li>Death itself. We&#39;ve existed as a species for hundreds of thousands of years and still no one knows what happens when you die? There seems to be a distinct effort to stop people from killing themselves, but why? Everything dies. Death is as much a part of life as fucking or being born. Why the persisting fear of it?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you think any of those are stupid, take more psychedelics.</p>

<li><p>Agreed, but, we are creatures of economy.  We develop economies regardless of the tender, be it currency, coin, food, force of arms, sex, slavery etc ...</p></li>
<li><p>Language is actually easily explained from an evolutionary perspective (there are so many non-human parallels for it to be that much of a mystery) .  How are brains are so molded to it is another issue.</p></li>

<li>Doesn&#39;t change the fact it&#39;s retarded. It&#39;s no secret that retarded systems persist, but the fact that no one even thinks about this, to me, brings it to conspiracy levels.</li>
<li>&#39;Language is actually easily explained from an evolutionary perspective&#39; - like I said, we can theorize and hypothesize how it came to be, but ultimately no records at all from when that happened (don&#39;t even know for sure WHEN it happened), so we don&#39;t KNOW anything about it. It&#39;s only best guesses with best available information, aka we don&#39;t know shit.</li>

<li><p>Of course.  We need a better system, but the onces in control now will fight to the death to keep it how it is.</p></li>
<li><p>That only means it predates our ability to have recorded the fact, which, of course, only makes sense.  You sound like there&#39;s some grand secret to it, and won&#39;t be satisfied until we have some sort of time machine that shows it to us directly.  I&#39;m not saying there wasn&#39;t some sort of alien contact or panspermia event (I&#39;m actually a proponent of those sorts of things) but logically it can be explained.</p></li>
<li><p>We rot ... sorry.  The only other thing I can throw at ya is that the Gaia theories and other dimensions aren&#39;t yet proven impossible in my mind, but there isn&#39;t much evidence showing they exist.</p></li>

<li>Have you ever heard of Forgotten Languages? </li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://forgottenlanguages-full.forgottenlanguages.org/">https://forgottenlanguages-full.forgottenlanguages.org/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a group of academics that use machine learning software to translate ancient texts. They also use the software to create their own languages that are only decodable through use of the software. They&#39;re fascinated with &#39;cryptolects&#39;, or a secret language encoded within another language. They claim to have deciphered the Voynich Manuscript. They&#39;ve been keeping this blog for 10 years, the majority of it unintelligible, as it&#39;s published in their own languages.</p>

<p>At various points, people have discovered the site and reached out to them, and they&#39;ve responded. From reading their correspondences, it&#39;s apparent to me their group has SERIOUS intellectual weight behind it. Reading the writings of &#39;Ayndyl&#39; exposed me to some insane linguistic ideas and concepts I had never come across prior. hey appear to have DoD funding/access. They also seem to be working on deciphering alien artifacts. They seem to believe we were seeded here on earth by Aliens. This is a VERY deep rabbithole, so maybe not something to casually dive into.</p>

<p>I&#39;d already been aware of the absolutely crucial role of language in our structuring our reality and ourselves through the work of Jacques Lacan and Ferdinand de Saussure, so I recognized these people know what they&#39;re talking about. No one still really gets what the website actually IS, but through the ideas they present about language, I&#39;ve come to 1) learn a shit ton of interesting thing about linguistics and language and 2) believe there&#39;s something much more profound about the noises that come from our throats than anyone is aware.</p>

I came here expecting a lot more specific answers, but the answers I have received have been about large philosophical concepts, and that is far more intriguing.

<p>Language itself. Where did it come from? No one knows. There&#39;s a linguistic idea that language is an infection. It completely structures our perception of reality; so much so that we can&#39;t even conceive of what it would be like to experience life without language. We can theorize about how/why language came to be, but ultimately we have no idea about it&#39;s origin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s why meditation is such a powerful tool, you will eventually realize that &quot;knowing&quot; does not come from thoughts.</p>

<p>Like when you pay attention to your breath, you know &quot;I am breathing in/out&quot; without having to verbally think this, you just know what is happening by paying attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ultimate conspiracy is that the universe resides in all of us individually. It&#39;s all there before us to be happy. </p>

<p>I used to think that the only thing in the world you can control is how you react to your surroundings. To do this though you need to take a deep dive into yourself which can be intimidating and unpleasant at times. You need to truly challenge yourself, your conceptions of reality and your belief systems. It is a stacked deck, this whole world is designed to not let you realize this. </p>

<p>At the end of the day all of the conspiracies going on in the world, good and bad, doesn&#39;t really matter. I agree, it&#39;s fun to delve into them...
If some are proven true then what?</p>

<p>To turn inward...conqueror, harness and master your emotions is key. </p>
