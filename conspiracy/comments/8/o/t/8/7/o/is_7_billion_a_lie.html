What if...
This is a lie?
I mean, what if the whole &quot;world population clock&quot; is a lie. What if there are really 20 billion people. Or just 500 millon people. This sub has shown that there are serious, historical &amp; current things that are manipulated by bigger companies, people, etc. . Media lies and our lives are just fed for us: Eat this, read this, do this and dont believe that.  For example, didn&#39;t someone a while ago say that the year really isn&#39;t 2018, but we are really living decades back or something like that? Anyway, what if world population is a lie. Yes I know it kinda sounds stupid because there is proof everywhere but.. it is possible? And yes I know there are people born and not on data.. But what if there really is dramatically more or less people than they say? Have any of you heard anything like this or do you have some theories? Would be really interesting to know !</p>

<p>Yeah the phantom time thingy is bollocks. The time shift we should be focusing on is 0. Why make the year 0, why do this 400 years after 0 and not make 0 then or Cesar birthday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you mean Caesar (The famous Roman politician, general, and author), he died before Jesus existed. Almost certainly, he probably implemented the Julian calendar with the &quot;ab urbe condita&quot; convention (years since the founding of the city of Rome). However, this also may be untrue (for the most part, as ab urbe condita was really only used for historical purposes (It was also unreliable to an extent, as the Romans were not certain of the year of the founding of Rome), as the Romans during the time of Julius Caesar mostly named their years after the consuls of Rome for the year (Think like if America had two presidents, and they had a term of office of only a year. This is a decent, but not entirely accurate, idea of how to think of the consuls) So, if we are talking about the year we know as 63 BCE, to the Romans it was the Year of the Consulship of Cicero and Hybrida. Romans had a very different convention for the names/numbering of years.</p>

<p>Due to the fact many people are born and die every minute I believe the number is only a rough estimate. The number being an estimate doesn&#39;t make me think there is a conspiracy to change that number  </p>

<p>Dude they couldn&#39;t even completely cover up the gulf of tonkin, jfk or 9/11 and you think the are making China and India misreport their census data for no fucking reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just laid out my evidence - that starting with the census takers themselves the numbers have to trickle up the pipeline on a city, county, state, federal, and global level.  Every step of the way at least one person is looking at the numbers.  Once they&#39;re released, you&#39;ll have economists, sociologists, policy makers, etc all basing their work on those numbers.  Quite a few people would be a position to notice that the numbers aren&#39;t right  - ie &quot;Gee wiz, that county has a lot of extra people but doesn&#39;t seem to have the infrastructure to support it.&quot;</p>

<p>Not to mention that unless they manipulated long term and kept a uniform distribution of fake persons, anomalies like unusual population growth/shrinkage would start to show up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phantom time says something like 300 years are unaccounted for.  There may be more.  There is a lot of fuckery with the dating of old things.  dates could be off up to 1,000 years.  Dates used to be written with an i or j in front (for Jesus or Iesus).  This was more or less the same as AD, a way of denoting the calendar was counting years since jesus was born.  You can find many examples of things, for example, that might say i.384, and the historians say this is 1384.  Many times there isn&#39;t a period, but sometimes there is a period after the i, CLEARLY denoting the i is an abreviation of something, not a 1, but they pretend the i or j are just a weird old way of writing a 1.  Remember the old typewriters that didn&#39;t have a 1, and you had to type a lower-case i?  I think that&#39;s part of the conspiracy....  </p>
