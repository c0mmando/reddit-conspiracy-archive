<p>Just get someone like Donald Trump into the White House, show outrage outrage outrage from both Donald Trump and from the media, to force people to take a side.</p>

<p>You are either with Donald Trump and against the media, or against Donald Trump and for the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that really woke me up was watching a documentary on North Korea.  It followed a more well to do family living in an apartment in downtown Pyongyang.</p>

<p>In North Korea, televisions must remain on all of the time.  The volume control allows you to turn the volume down, but not completely off, during prayers before meals only.  North Korea has two channels that run sate news programs as well as movies for adults and children that constantly remind viewers of the outside threat from the United States.</p>

<p>Wow, I thought.  North Koreans must watch a lot of television.</p>

<p>But then I thought, there&#39;s no way North Koreans watch more television than Americans.</p>

<p>And then I thought, if the North Koreans are being controlled by the propaganda from their televisions, what effect is it having on Americans?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol and how many movies have no black people in them at all? Black people get one big movie and some people just can&#39;t fuckin handle it lmao. The movie is called Black Panther ffs, it&#39;s about a fictional place in <em>Africa</em>. It makes complete sense that the cast is mostly black. </p>

<p>Not denying American media is almost entirely propaganda, but stupid shit like &quot;omg they made a movie with mostly black people!&quot; just makes me laugh. </p>

<p>So you’re basing this on your feelings and not fact? You do realize Black Panther was introduced in 1966, right? Before the “SJW crowd” was even remotely mainstream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Black Panther character was created to sell a civil rights based political character to white youth. If you don&#39;t believe me, go look up the statements by the character creators.</p>

<p>SJWs in the 60s were hippies.</p>

<p>Every generation tends to have it&#39;s new form of anti-racist, pro gay, pro feminist activists. SJWs are just the current iteration.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a clip from Fritz the Cat circa 1972.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XKFuBOuxUgk">https://youtu.be/XKFuBOuxUgk</a></p>

<p>The college kids sound exactly the same as current day SJWs because they&#39;re manipulated by media and academia who keep using these issues for their own gain.</p>

<p>The Black Panther character was designed before blaxploitation became a trend in Hollywood. It technically does fit into that genre though because it was designed to exploit black people by selling the image to white consumers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok then.</p>

<p>Disney owns Marvel, who made the Black Panther movie.</p>

<p>That movie is racist as fuck and actually sets the idea of &#39;equality&#39; back by like 40 years.</p>

<p>Black Americans are just Americans. Like 99% of them haven&#39;t ever been to Africa and the term &#39;African American&#39; didn&#39;t even get used in mainstream culture until 1989. Yet, Hollywood tries to shoehorn black people into adopting this Diaspora mentality because they like the visibility of black people having a sub-culture that can be endlessly exploited.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a bunch of bullshit.</p>
