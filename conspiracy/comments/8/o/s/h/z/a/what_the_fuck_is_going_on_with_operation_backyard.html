    <div class="md"><p>the long and bitter:</p>

<p>I live here in the area and have been aware of vop and other groups like them since I can remember.  there is a bad homeless problem here in metro az (as with many big cities) and these groups do great things.  I worked with a rehabbed vet and would have NEVER known the guy spent close to a decade on the streets.  sorry, sidetracked.  Point is, these guys are not virgins when it comes to homeless people and their problems, habits, and importantly in this case encampments.<br/>
They were out doing their thing looking for people to help since the heat is getting bad quick, when the found a camp.  They went to see if they could offer help and found it abandoned.  What they found didn&#39;t fit the mold for your average hobo camp.  They found straps tied to trees (which could be lashing for structures....sure), newish childrens items (toys, clothes, stroller, crib, etc), food rations, a fairly newly buried bloody knife and panties, and a make shift &quot;bunker&quot; (for lack of a better word) that contained more food stuff.  What the didn&#39;t find were cardboard boxes, makeshift bedding, trash (like almost none), or other makeshift items that are almost ALWAYS found where the homeless have set up.  </p>

<p>These guys didn&#39;t jump to social media and blow their own agenda up either.  They found something that didn&#39;t look right and reported it....to be ignored for days without ANY response.  The vets didn&#39;t say anything about cemex ties or anything themselves, that&#39;s important to know.  They found something disturbing and did what we are all told to do....report it.  When it got swept under the rug is when people started getting pissed and throwing up the red flags.  </p>

<p>hope that helps</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh a few more things to add.  after 4 days they finally sent in an investigation team.  they found &quot;nothing&quot;.  vet dude insisted they bring a cadaver dog, they wouldn&#39;t until they cleared the area of everyone but law enforcement, then said that the &quot;dog&quot; found nothing.  I call BS on that part personally, just throwing a bone to shut everyone up.  The dust cleared and the VOP group moved to another location to investigate, while that was going on the ENTIRE camp was bulldozed.....nothing to see here tho</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didnt they talk to homeless in that area and asked if it was a camp and were told no way that that was a cartel area that no one would make a camp there? Not trying to stir the pot just something that I had read in my researching this. The other thing I found kind of hinky was there was a pretty good number of play yards and car seats of many sizes...I just thought that was very random for a camp that &quot;wasnt there&quot; supposedly. Well I guess it actually ISNT THERE NOW THANKS TO THE BULLDOZERS CRAFTMANSHIP. Nothing to see here...moving right along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly.  even residents around the area said they didn&#39;t have a vagrant problem around there.  residents in a housing community would see this stuff without a doubt.  I can&#39;t speak for EVERYONE, but when I lived just off the freeway in Tucson there as a literal TOWN of homeless.  we&#39;d hear them nightly pushing their carts down the blacktop then into the desert to their &quot;house&quot;.  the police knew about it and didn&#39;t shut them down....EVER.  we were there for almost 8 years, the bums were literally our neighbors in that neighbourhood lol.  again, didn&#39;t get shut down or anything by police....let alone BULLDOZED</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re very correct, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here with the rest of us.  I honestly want to know what relevance that reply had though, aside from labelling a moment in the video with a timestamp description (which is indeed helpful, but you&#39;ve provided it enough imo).  what relevance does that have right now?  what are you trying to say or point out?  the son was shook and worried (maybe because of said threats or fear of safety), and the father was combatitive IMMEDIATELY.  both of those seem like they&#39;re at least trying to cover their own asses or are worried about something being discovered.  maybe they&#39;re just worried about being in trouble for harbouring a known illegal immigrant?  but those two providing an explanation as to why the bunker was the way it was is not proof that this is not worth looking at further.  their testimony, in my opinion, just makes it look even shadier and increases the worth of further investigation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people can watch the whole video and draw their own conclusions, people can watch just the part I point out and decide the patriot is wrong about the rape camp or decide the father and son are covering something sinister up.  I&#39;m not hiding anything. but the biggest what the fuck about this story when it blew up was this mysterious cell that only a child could fit into.  People will continue to want to know how it got there and who built it.  The timestamp of the video I link to gives people more information on the who and a little on the why then they had before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>at 17 minutes the son says the white thing was there already.  I have no idea what the white thing is or why it got there but it is a large open top container of some sort.  I would love to know what company fabricated it and whats it&#39;s commercial purpose is. IMO it&#39;s something manufactured, possibly purchased by Cemtex but since I&#39;ve only seen the hole that leads into it (maybe there is supposed to be a pipe outtake) I don&#39;t know what the white thing is.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t look like a septic tank or water storage container.  It looks so large an excavator was needed to dig the whole for it and a truck was needed to transport it to that location.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am more than a little concerned that this is a psy-op/LARP.  Look up Craig Sawyer&#39;s wiki page.  Scroll down to the people he has worked with and his current profession.  Throw in the fact that sthe way they have gone about everything on this &quot;mission&quot; runs the risk of destroying the evidence andhas likely made the evidence in-admissable in court.  I worry that if this goes viral and is then later found to be a hoax, it will greatly damage the movement.</p>

<p>Again, I am only skeptical about this, not rulling it out.  But there is more than enough reason to be skeptical about this.</p>

<p>We need professionals and someone official down there to verify all of this.  ASAP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is no evidence, there is no &quot;rape tree&quot; as seen in their own original videos, and this guy is taking donations under the name veteran, while legally not filing and proving his status to do so...</p>

<p>reference here -&gt; <a href="http://www.kvoa.com/story/31338954/veterans-group-does-not-file-legally-required-papers">http://www.kvoa.com/story/31338954/veterans-group-does-not-file-legally-required-papers</a></p>

<p>if you dont believe me, see the original video where sawyer and VOP find the &quot;camp&quot; and they look at a homeless camp with absolutely ZERO evidence that there was trafficking there, and call it a sex slave prison rape tree (not exaggerating at all)</p>

<p>also, the involved people just happen to have gone on infowars a few days ago telling everyone that</p>

<p>&quot;there is 3000 pedo arrests that the gov isnt telling you about&quot;</p>

<p>reference infowars and alex jones channel on youtube</p>

<p>everyone has to hold people to a standard of backing up what they say, because people WILL use things that sit close to our hearts, like child trafficking to take donations (which he said he would not take, but research shows they are taking money, money cards, and more)</p>

<p>this is a SCAM</p>

<p>the guy is a PROVEN CRIMINAL<br/>
and everyone is falling for it again hook line and LARP</p>
