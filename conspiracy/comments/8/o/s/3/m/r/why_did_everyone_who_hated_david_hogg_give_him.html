I understand people analyzing his opinions and engaging in discourse over it,  but I don&#39;t think he nessisarily earned the unbelievable level of srutiny he received and definitely didn&#39;t earn the amount of right-wing attention he had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that the MSM rocketed him to &quot;stardom&quot; by  collectively focusing attention on him, making him the Poster Boy and virtual Spokesman for the &quot;Movement&quot; seems to have been contrived and deliberate.</p>

<p>I suspect that much of the &quot;Hate&quot; was ALSO contrived by agent provocateurs who sought to create the perception of Hogg Hatred in the hopes of making him - and the &quot;Movement&quot; seem more relevant.</p>

<p>IOW, anti-gun trolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, anyone that seeks out the limelight is fugazi, imo. I grew up in a bad neighborhood and people got shot all the time (not &#39;random&#39; like Parkland...people got shot over beefs, or drugs, or money....it was still kids killing kids, though. It was still senseless)...when your friend gets shot, man I can&#39;t tell you how bad it feels, and your first reaction is DEFINITELY not, &#39;hey let me go talk to a reporter to call attention to this!&#39;. Where&#39;s the David Hogg of South Side Chicago? Something doesn&#39;t sit right about the fact that this kid didn&#39;t even have any close friends that got killed, and he&#39;s using his this event that he was sort of peripherally there for to launch a political cause and &#39;activist career&#39; of sorts. You want to talk about politicizing a tragedy? The media always ends up doing that anyway, weird to see the people effected doing it themselves from the get.</p>

<p>I guess coupled with that, I&#39;ve been following the cesspit that is Broward County since it was ground zero for the oxycontin epidemic. Human trafficking, pedophilia, corrupt sheriffs and politicians....it all goes down over there. Part of the reason FL has fucked up gun laws (&#39;stand your ground&#39; among others) is because of the columbian cartel violence in the 80s. It feels like Florida is leaking when some kid from there is trying to apply what happens in his fucked up state to the rest of the country. There doesn&#39;t need to be a federal law about best practice for getting your golf ball when it lands next to an alligator, because that&#39;s only an issue in florida. Keep that florida shit in florida.</p>

<p>And lastly, he&#39;s got just about the most punchable face I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s weird when a dude has &#39;resting bitch face&#39;, and it makes me judge the content of his character. Ain&#39;t shit funny to me, but I still smile.</p>

Dude, go to therapy and try to understand how the narcissistic element of your personality (or the &#39;need to be seen&#39;) is effecting your actions. Do some work to find yourself before you try to exert your will on the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, you caught me! *Activate throwaway #155. 
I do agree he should be focusing on his coming of age. When I said he should do what he wants, I just meant anyone should be free do as they please (within the limits of legality) whether or not it&#39;s in their best interest, but going full speed ahead on the path of activism doesn&#39;t seem to be in anybodies best interest. A YouTube career would be a good way to see how much he really matters to everyone, rather than be given platforms to artificially inflate significance of his ideas, being a good middle ground between doing nothing and doing everything he&#39;s given the chance to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, like...you can&#39;t see that making a post about yourself in 3d person to try and figure out how to make people like you is the height of narcissism? The fact that the only thing you seemed to be interested in of my initial comment was that you should smile more? Pathological Narcissism my friend. It&#39;s okay though, narcissism is the defining trait of our modern age.</p>

<p>Look man, when I was your age, I thought I knew everything and no one could tell me shit. I was quite a bit more precocious than you as well. Looking back, I didn&#39;t know a goddamned thing. The world is complex, man. RIDICULOUSLY complex. Anything that seems simple to the naive teenage mind is actually SUPER complicated. It takes living in the world, experiencing the world, years of active learning and interacting with the world before you&#39;ll even possess the tools to make heads or tails of anything, let alone effect change. </p>

<p>If you want to do activism, great. Do it quietly and continue on with your life, reading books and educating yourself and leveling up your knowledge and thus, your ability to effect the world. I think it&#39;s very apparent (just from our brief little interaction here), that this is more about YOU and your need to be seen than it is &#39;making a difference&#39;. If you could &#39;make a difference&#39;, but no one would see or acknowledge your role in it, would it be worth it? Really ask yourself that question, man. The hubris of youth is limitless, but if you keep trying to inject yourself into national conversations when you haven&#39;t even developed the ability to hide your narcissism, you&#39;re gonna shoot yourself in the foot before you even start the race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna give you some real advice brother:</p>

<p>The reason you&#39;ll never be able to just start on your own is that you have no qualifications. All those news anchors you admire on CNN? They have college degrees in journalism or broadcasting. The only thing that you really have &#39;qualifying&#39; you as someone to be listened to is that you&#39;re an eye witness to an event. Know who else was an eye-witness? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt3z9XdOOrU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt3z9XdOOrU</a></p>

<p>Does that qualify her to speak on political things? No. If you want &#39;clout&#39;, then you have to &#39;build&#39; clout. You could try to do that through twitter like a jabroni, or you could do it the legit way and go volunteer with an activist group that&#39;s actually out there doing something...that&#39;s actually your best bet. Find an &#39;activist&#39; that&#39;s already tied in with the political machine and go &#39;intern&#39; under them. Soak up what they know, learn the ropes from them. DeeRay McKesson seems like someone that&#39;s on the path you wish to be on. Black leaders have understood effective activism for a long time. The marijuana legalization movement is a sterling example of top-rate activism...maybe reach out to them?</p>

<p>You basically need to beef up your CV before you can hope anyone will listen to what you have to say without deriding you as a ignorant narcissistic child (which is what you currently are, for all practical purposes).</p>

<p>hogg is just another mass media attempt at making a celebrity mouthpiece to con people into living in fear to give up control to whomever.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that worried me is that I recognized him from some video I had previously seen where he was busting some cops balls in California.  It seemed implausible and improbable that the kid would be in a viral video one month and a national tragedy the next.  Now - I never put much credibility in the idea of “false flag crisis actors” but this coincidence struck me as unlikely. Then I couldn’t help but view all of his appearance through the lens of “what if this kid is some kind of phony.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha!</p>

<p>This asshole was willing to climb on the bodies of his dead classmates for attention and now is resorting to Reddit shitposts on /conspiracy... well I hope that the low makes up for the high. For a narcissist this must be like the nastiest hangover possible. Also, did the shrooms take away your sense of humor?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I was sarcastically contributing to the idea that Psilocybe  is capable of destroying a person&#39;s sense of humour, I do tend to feel free of humanities influence and social constructs when tripping. Do you feel more in touch with humanity while tripping? The concept of identity and human nature seem to be kept at bay while having such an experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a 50+ foreigner, the amount of hate shown Hogg was reflective of a) America&#39;s insane love affair with guns and b) some well developed tropes (or memes) given huge publicity by pro-gun lobbyists and their well-paid fellow travellers.</p>

<p>Almost as if foreign powers were funding US &#39;patriot&#39; astroturf orgs to help keep US divided and weak. But that&#39;s just me. </p>
