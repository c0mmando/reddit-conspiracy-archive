        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Rap music today has become nothing but an homage to selling drugs and using drugs. Rappers glorify heavy drug use and the act of selling them. Youth from lower class upbringings, many without any good role models, are being tricked into thinking that the use and selling of drugs is not only good, but cool. YouTube any popular rap video and you will see nothing but expensive designer clothes, that become the ultimate goal and bait for youth, and drug use/sale lyrics. We aren&#39;t just talking weed anymore, they focus heavily on opiate and benxo abuse(xans, lean, Percocet), the type of shit that will make you a straight up baser. Does anyone else feel that rap is purposefully used to keep young African Americans, or just anyone poor really, down by making them focus on the wrong things, such as drugs and designer clothes, while the rich get richer and the poor become worse off?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with this, however, I would add... that it&#39;s more Socioeconomic, imo. The more &quot;affluent&quot; or &quot;well-to-do&quot; Blacks and Whites, generally grow out of it, while their counterparts carry it on, as a culture. Basically, it keeps the poor sedated, ignorant, poor, and wishful hopefuls/consumers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also believe it leads to police shortage thanks to &quot;Fuck the police&quot; and everything else dealing with negativity of police there for making people not want to be a part of the police force.</p>

<p>This shortage leads to calls being unanswered or taking longer to be answered, neighborhoods going out with some kind of patrol, a tired over worked police force and The police force having to reduce restrictions and having to get the bottom of the barrel instead of the cream of the crop which gives us the cops that are more trigger happy and quick reacting than quick thinking.</p>

<p>Idk a thought I&#39;ve been contemplating and have been waiting on a topic like this to share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean to claim they were the first and only. I just wanted to show how mainstream rap these days, which is the most popular with youth, seems to promote heavy drug use at an alarming rate. Like we aren&#39;t talking about a couple songs, literally EVERY song that is popular now has lyrics either about being lame if you don&#39;t sell drugs or how doing drugs is awesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually do listen to a lot of rap/hip hop (not the kind that I am talking about). I know that rap in general talks a lot about drugs, but I just feel like it&#39;s been taken to the next level in the last 5-10 years. I also listen to a little rock, country and jazz. And before you say it, I know they all promote some type of drug use to an extent but not to the point I feel like rap today is taking it to. Rap almost takes it to an irresponsible level knowing that they are what the majority of the youth listen to and that youth is at an all time high for being impressionable with social media and what not IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is absolutely true in my opinion. i listen to rap music frequently and i bet you’ve all heard this phrase. “yo jerome is an oreo. black on the outside white on the inside”. this is so prvalant except being black is associated with rap culture which perpetuates hood mentality and guns and drugs and murder. etc. so if you’re not a “real nigga” you’re considered a coon or shilling for white people. these rappers are rapping “what they know” but what they know is used perfectly to keep black people down in a perpetual cycle. the music is catchy as fuck. rap is pop now, but it’s dangerous. just my 2 cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean might be a bit off topic, but its jsut somethign ive noticed and want to just throw out there.</p>

<p>a big problem is see with black kids these days is this tendancy to self segregate themselves. i work on a university campus and its really odd, i see every other group tends to mingle and mix with everyone except the black kids, and even with them the guys and girls seem to avoid hanging around with each other unless they are partying.</p>

<p>its been driving me nuts since i noticed it, and from outside observation as a white dude quite a bit older it seems like its self imposed (this is in canada at a pretty multicultural school too)</p>

<p>its seems so odd because everyone wants to hang out with them as they seem to be the &quot;cool&quot; ones and yet they stay in their small black only cliques. is this normal? id love to hear some one from the black communities take on this.</p>

i mean it might make sense if it was just white kids they wouldnt hang out with, but its not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s not a lot of active victimization going on in America either, especially not of college kids, but it&#39;s the popular narrative. Black people do a good job of perpetuating that narrative and self policing it so it doesn&#39;t just fall apart when people come to realize there isn&#39;t some uncontrollable outside force dictating their lives, it boils down to making good choices and taking responsibility for the outcomes of those choices.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying blacks aren&#39;t disadvantaged in some ways, they may be, but there isn&#39;t a conspiracy against them, it&#39;s more about socioeconomic factors and poverty being a self perpetuating cycle; if you grow up in poverty and raise your kids in poverty, it&#39;s likely your grandkids will be poor too; you can break the cycle with good choices and personal responsibility and some luck; some black people will claim they&#39;re held back with systemic racism but that doesn&#39;t add up: a larger percentage of the black population is in poverty, but <em>much more</em> white people live in poverty; meanwhile there are alot more programs aimed at blacks than poor people in general, so they actually receive more opportunities than most. There is and has been for decades a concerted effort to help raise up the black community, but nobody can do it for them, and if they continue to deflect responsibility for their failures onto racism or whatever they won&#39;t be able to learn from them; why learn from something you have no control over and isn&#39;t your fault?</p>

<p>Now, I suspect there&#39;s some outside force that benefits from this divisive status quo and does whatever possible to continue it, probably at a social engineering level; for example: if you&#39;ve read this far you probably think I&#39;m racist, but if you go back and look I didn&#39;t <em>really</em> say anything racist, it&#39;s just that people these days are conditioned to automatically consider any criticism of a black person or people as racism, which is ridiculous. There isn&#39;t any honest discourse between blacks and others and that among other things causes them to feel like outsiders and fall back on the basic instinct of tribalism, causing the self segregation you&#39;re seeing.</p>

<p>Just my guess/opinion.</p>

i actually totally agree with your thoughts on things, i just can&#39;t understand why there are people in the black community trying so hard to keep this victim mentality going. </p>

<p>i want to understand that perspective, but when i ask it just devolves in to being lectured on my privilege (of growing poor, with an abusive step father, and having nothing and no one to rely on but myself)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely disagree. Have you been to a rap concert recently? For most of the big mainstream even up-and-coming guys right now, its mostly white, younger (15-22), mostly female concertgoers that yell out every word during a performance.</p>

<p>A second thing to consider is that these rappers are HEADLINING major music festivals (Coachella, lollapalooza, tickets are $300+) and are known to have the biggest stage crowds. Who do you think the demographic that can afford these tickets?</p>

<p>Also look at most instagram captions for this same demographic. 6/10 times its a rap lyric.</p>

<p>Another thing to look at is international streaming numbers. Hip-hop artists are right there at the top worldwide over any other genre. I think its a youth thing, def NOT an african american thing anymore</p>

I grew up in a suburban upper-middle class neighborhood in Oklahoma and had gun pulled on me in 8th grade by a kid who thought he was a Blood.

    <div class="md"><p>Does everything you just said make it worse?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say a majority of black people detest popular Gansta Rappers and don&#39;t want to support the pop culture glamorizing of selling and using drugs, the endorsement of violence to solve problems, the dehumanization of bitches and ho&#39;s who&#39;s only value is their fuckhole and who are to be passed around to the homies like property and beaten into submission and it&#39;s all one big joke, the material lust for bling and empty luxury brand goods which appear like totems of success but are actually emblems of Globalist exploitation and slavery (just who do you think sews that Gucci suit?), and poisoning the youths minds with all of this to entrap them into the School-Prison pipeline as young as possible to kill off any hope for future generations to break the cycle.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying an overwhelming mass of tens of millions of afluent white suburban kids are the predominant consumers of Rap, and it&#39;s their dollars that are bankrolling the entire industry of Blaxploitation.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that the most White Privilege thing ever? To re-enslave a whole class of people by forcing a degenerate and self-destructive pop culture to be dominent over the very class of people who are victimized by it, and then to scoff &quot;well I didn&#39;t do that, my little Becky only bought tickets to a Lil Wayne concert, that&#39;s just how the Free Market works. Besides, I donate to several Liberal charities, so it&#39;s like buying carbon offsets, where my one  bad consumer choice is redeemed by my other good purchases.&quot;</p>

<p>What you have described is pretty horrifying. Yet another reason to hate smug Liberals. They have created a system that is worse than slavery for black people and they not only don&#39;t realize it but they bless it under the guise of macroeconomics and consumer choice.</p>

<p>On principle, I would buy an African slave today in Libya for $180 before I ever gave $1 to buy anything from a Rapper.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m AltRight!</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that make you Liberals feel just terrible about yourselves, your hypocrasy and your destruction when what you have done to re-enslave black people is worse than the &quot;race realism&quot; I and others on the AltRight believe?</p>

<p>What does it even mean for the future of the &quot;Neoliberal&quot; world order when a bunch of so-called &quot;racists&quot; care more about protecting the black community than you do?</p>

<p>It means Cats and Dogs my man. Total Protonic Reversal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with you, although i don&#39;t think its just African Americans it keeps down, but all that buy into it, but yes they are a primary target.
I love hip hop, that&#39;s why i listen to good independent artists like Immortal technique, Cunninlynguists, Diabolic, Poison Pen, Old WuTang, Hieroglyphics, Lowkey, Sweatshop Union, etc.. 
That commercial shit is a disgrace to many of the pioneers of hip hop, the system saw what was happening and commercialized it.
If you haven&#39;t checked out any of the above music i highly suggest you check out Immortal Techniques work, especially his newest album The Martyr.
Its free if you want, and the beginning of the album even says &quot;if you&#39;re listening to this, its your responsibility to burn this for every motherfucker you know&quot;
He covers many topics that are popular and dear to us conspiracy theorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most common presented black role model presented to young black males: Black Athletes making millions who are probably a make up of .01% of the black population, Rappers who get a lucrative deal and another .01%, and their local drug dealer gang banger who make up 30% of black neighborhoods, and thugs in jail who glorify gang culture and blame the man for being in jail who are another 30%.</p>

<p>Black kids are not presented with real world options, and it&#39;s not entirely the rap music, but I can agree to it being an influence. Most people will argue that music does not influence people, fine, but let me ask you this; A snickers commercials is supposed to influence you to buy a candy bar in a 30 second jingle, but you insist a rap video glorifying the money they made from rap, and encompassing a gangster and drug filled life style is not? </p>

<p>When young black males are presented these few options as the only way to make money in the world, they go for it. All the see is big money, and as self admitted, not enough fathers in house holds coming home from the daily grind tell their child it&#39;s okay to be a plumber, mechanic, teacher, brick layer, yard service, or whatever daily grind profession. It&#39;s self admitted, it a plague currently that well over 30% of black house holds are ran by the women, the fathers aren&#39;t there because they are either estranged, out being gang members, or in jail due to failed drug war. </p>

<p>No one can fix the problem that is Black America until black America recognizes it&#39;s own problems, rap won&#39;t help it, that&#39;s for sure. Once black people stop blaming the government, and white priveledge, and see that welfare and family disparity is the core root of their problem, you will continue to see daily news articles of black on black violence, and the majority of perpetrators of crime in cities being 40% black making up 13% of the national population, which is a serious problem. It&#39;s not a poverty problem, it&#39;s a morality problem, and it&#39;s derived from false hope that a gangster life style is a cool thing because that&#39;s what gangsters do if they can&#39;t become a rapper or professional athlete, cause as many rap song teach, working that daily grind is to be a SLAVE to THE MAN. It is a racist connotation towards white people, and telling young black males that if they work for white people they are being treated like a slave.</p>

<p>To be facetious, welcome to America, where no one struggles but the blacks, cause everyone else has it figured out and never has to work that daily grind, and no one is racist towards them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CONspiratard next level achieved. Power up. </p>

<p>Nancy Reagon
1985 Oakland “War on Drugs” is born
Iran Contra Cocaine
FBI SSA LEO vs NWA
Rap ban on public radio libraries and retail
Country Music wa$ king 80s
Prisons becoming privatized 
Ebonics pushed as a language via schools
Gang Drug culture glorified
Tennessee privatization of prisons lobby
Clintons prison lobbyists </p>

<p>In a matter of years these events unfold. We go from outright ban into full blown $upport of the genre. </p>

<p>Connect the dots and you will find many more interesting connections to these ideas. Hit the history books and get an understanding of assimilation tactics, the US used to break the Native American culture up, by design via loss of language. </p>

<p>I’m fully certain this will come to light in the future. Country music suddenly, after being behind the bans, got behind gangster rap, right after the privatization of prisons. All most all major rap artist of the times were funded recorded etc via these groups out of Nashville Memphis unknowingly afaik. Even up to 50ct via clearchannel. </p>

<p>Shaping society via cultural ideas? Or weaponized cultural killer in the guise of reality? When a people’s loses its language, they are extinct as a culture. The definition of language in this instance is weaponized. In order to keep a people’s from progression. The church is all they have left to split culturally imo, after assassinating the language ala MLK equal rights mvmnt. Is this why Jayne is pulling his stunts? Does he realize these ideas may not be his own if it’s a pushed marketing ploy? Could he split the black vote and churches if he pushes on with this act? </p>

<p>Once the language barrier is broken, ideas culture, and history can no longer be passed down or communicated from generation to generation. I don’t get kids these days you will hear. Grandparents don’t understand grandkids etc.</p>

<p>Gangster rap Ebonics and gang culture are killing the last generations of native speakers as well, as the genre is popular in native Americans communities music etc. Its effectively co opted the tribes languages, which are at extinction level as is, and the older generations largely can not understand the younger generations. </p>

<p>Is gangster rap into mumble rap a progression? Was gangster rap co opted to kill the positive messages in early hiphop? </p>

<p>POOPITY SCOOP
POOPDY POOP
SCOOPITY POOPTY POOP </p>

<p>Big money in cultural genocide. Esp when you can back the ideas you need to implement via a medium people believe is a free choice largely. The emotions via music are a key tool in shaping minds.   </p>
