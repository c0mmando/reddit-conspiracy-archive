       We are over a year into this "Russian Collusion" investigation and what have we found? Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Israel are getting everything they want from the US government and no one seems to care. Isn't that the real collusion? This link points that out and highlights the specific facts of the matter.

       Gazprom sold a huge portion of their company to unknown buyers in Qatar, Kushner has financial ties in Qatar. My guess is a Qatari is holding Gazprom shares in escrow for Trump until he can fufill his purpose and lift sanctions off Russia. He's already eased sanctions off them by not enforcing the Magnitsky Act. So we'll hopefully find out the truth.

      <p>
       More like indictments of various campaign officials, the NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR and one of Trump's most trusted advisors, the president's former campaign chair, his lawyer's office got raided, his own SON's email show collusion with Wikileaks and his own SON admitted to meeting Russian's for "dirt on hillary Clinton"... You know, that same shit the whole organization is being criminally investigated for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inability of some users here to piece together this toddler-level puzzle of criminal activity and collusion.... While somehow touting their ability to solve a 4D puzzle made of out-of-this-world satanic, pedophile cult connections is astounding.... Or it just shows the underpinnings of a massive pro-trump shill campaign being leveled against the users of this sub and the greater internet.

       alright I've been not looking too closely at the Russia collusion stuff since the days that all anyone was peddling was the Twitter bot indictments. I'll take any links to get up to speed on where things are now at if you got em.  the Twitter bots hysteria was just really funny when there's been another foreign lobby essentially dictating American foreign policy for decades that none of the Russia alarmists cared to mention.

       alright I've been not looking too closely at the Russia collusion stuff since the days that all anyone was peddling was the Twitter bot indictments. I'll take any links to get up to speed on where things are now at if you got em.  the Twitter bots hysteria was just really funny when there's been another foreign lobby essentially dictating American foreign policy for decades that none of the Russia alarmists cared to mention.

       Ok... And that doesn't negate anything from what this case is about.

       yeah well, when you've got America engaged militarily around the world on behalf of the Ziomob for eons while their presstitutes beat you over the head daily about the republic being brought to its knees by Twitter bots sharing Western news stories and having zero sway on the outcome of the election, ya gotta have a chuckle at the hilarious diversion attempt.  like if we're gonna have an outcry over foreign interference without the foreign Rothschild syndicate which fully owns Trump not even being brought in to the conversation, i'll just be over here pissing myself with laughter while you all carry on, thanks.

       that said if there's a lot more to the story now i'll read up on it if you can send a few sources my way.

       Trump was bought by the Zionist cabal long ago when Rothschild inc. bailed him out in the late 80s.  he's even brought their operative, Wilbur Ross in to run the U.S. economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's not even about the highest bidder, the Zionist infiltration of U.S. politics is absolute and to the core and anyone who sits in the president's chair is gonna end up doing their bidding.  that is a fact we've seen play out consistently since the days that JFK tried to force their lobbies to register as foreign entities and to compare the strangle hold these Zionists have over America to anything the Russians would ever be capable of is hilarious.

       I hope that Democratic supporters who emerge from the gaslight hold their corporate leadership to account not only for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in a spectacular arrogant failure of a political campaign but for gaslighting their faithful with a bullshit story rather than face their own mendacity and corruption like real leaders.

       Well there have been guilty pleas and people serving jailtime already from the Russia Probe, so that's "what we have gotten" so far.

       But some of us believe that Trump could easily be paid for and influenced by more than one country. Israel and SA have plenty of reasons to get out their checkbooks, but that doesn't preclude Russia desiring a backdoor to US influence either.

       Israel gave data to Saudi and russia though. They all wanted trump. Russia was just a hired hand for Israel. In curious the deal Netanyahu made Putin for them to ditch Iran Syria.

       13 of those are twitter bots.  their crime? sharing western news stories and having no influence on election results.  i'll admit i'm a little out of the loop on this because the Twitter bots thing made it clear that what we were watching was a psyop and diversion from the much bigger more important foreign subversion elephant in the room, but i'd like to have a look at any sources for the rest of the pleas and indicments if ya can help out with that heh.

       oh because they're foreign operatives, i get why it's supposed to be important.  except it had zero influence on the election outcome and their ties to the Kremlin are not substantiated.  even if they were proven ties between them and the Kremlin, then what? i'm supposed to believe the best they can do is a Twitter farm that accomplished nothing? lol, k.  meanwhile Israel has us fighting its wars for decades on end, but RUSSIAN COLLUSION!!
      </p>
      <p>
       indictments of a few candy assed Twitter bots aren't proof of anything here other than a state agenda to blame everything on Russia meanwhile the real foreign subversion from the Ziogang is waaaayy off the average person's radar.  it's a blatant psyop.  would you like to source up with anything that shows otherwise? i asked because i'm interested, but the the usual thing is no one ever actually does that and when they do it's some lame sensationalist spin from a mainstream news outlet that doesn't confirm much of anything.
