    <div class="md"><p>Lol 31% would still be an insane figure.  I think the black death only killed about 20% of the global population,  and we have quarantine measures now, that even if something biological happened with no cure for several years..it would be basically impossible to wipe out 31% of people in the country </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol theres absolutely no explanation as to how they&#39;ve developed these figures other than a brief thing about  economic crisis and population concentration causing loss of life. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be real...the only things that could cause 80% reduction in population in the next 7 years would be some sort of biological crisis that dwarfs smallpox, or an all-out nuclear assault on most major US cities.  </p>

<p>Even if the dollar were to crash and the yuan were to become the dominant global trade currency by 2020 (which would be a ridiculously fast transition)...the US would have very adequate default measures to countries like Russia/China. We would have widespread austerity in this country and be forced to sell off our utilities and resources like America has done to so many third world countries...but that would not come close to causing such a significant reduction in population.  </p>

<p>I agree that we have a serious potential for impending financial collapse like we&#39;ve never seen before in this country...but 80% depopulation is just silly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, It definitely sounds silly. But u/kingcubfan pointed out who is in cahoots with this website/data mine or whatever it is. UN, NATO, NSA, The world bank are all partners or clients. That is just to name a few. So yeah, it definitely sounds silly but would it be backed by such government entities if there was SOME validity to it? If I&#39;m being honest I don&#39;t think the numbers are based off of an economic collapse. Probably something much worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol this is nonsense. Most people would easily survive in this sort of situation.  Humans can go long times without food...and water wouldn&#39;t be an issue for very long...most people would still have access to means to boil water,  or create vapor traps to get fresh water. Having been through several events where people lose access to water, power, etc...its amazing how quickly people band together to help others in those situations. &quot;Survival skills&quot; are not really necessary with the technology we would still have access to. It would not be all-out chaos or anything close to what you see in movies...and certainly not close to killing off 100 million Americans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude imagine Manhattan with no food, water, power or rescue. The entire east coast is fucked. Any big city is entirely and completely fucked too. Anyone who needs their medication is fucked. Survivors of the first few days will try to kill you for anything they can take. The biggest difference between a grid down type scenario and what happened with the hurricanes? No one is going to come help you. Even if other countries could and would, the logistics alone make that impossible to be effective without at least half the population perishing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I love how you imply that the entire east COAST would be without food or water in a total shutdown. Even water from the nasty east river can be boiled and perfectly drinkable. </p>

<p>You just naturally assume that people would start harming each other instead of banding together to survive...multiple experiences I&#39;ve had tell me the exact opposite, and I&#39;m usually the cynical one. </p>

<p>As for no other countries coming to our aid....what century do you think we live in? Literally a dozen or more countries in the western hemisphere alone have the capacity to come to our aid within hours to days. (Its this funny thing where other western militaries also prepare for humanitarian rescue in addition to war...unlike us). Unless you&#39;re implying that they&#39;re shut down too. </p>

<p>Even with zero outside food or medicine,  do you understand how long it would take for HALF of a major city to die? </p>

<p>Lol yall watch too many endtimes movies. In reality,  aid from Canada and western Europe (not to mention our own navy with countless nuclear powered entities) would come way before any significant loss of life. </p>

<p>Also you haven&#39;t even proposed a mechanism that would actually cause loss of the grid and transportation so rapidly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope you are right, but I&#39;m damn confident you are not.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not arguing that something is going to happen that will be isolated to the United States. Not very likely. I&#39;m arguing that a huge percentage of the population would not be able to survive a SHTF scenario.</p>

<p>Everything depends on what the cause is, but I&#39;ll just give you a CME for the mechanism because that&#39;s the big one for me (aside from NWO finalization) Honorable mentions for pandemic, supervolcanos, pole shift, asteroid impact, alien invasion, etc.</p>

<p>Do you really think enough of the population would band together and help each other now a days in a complete SHTF scenario for any kind of lasting cohesion? Maybe at first, a big maybe, but once the hunger really sets in it&#39;s not going to be pretty. Seven billion people aren&#39;t just going to suddenly become self sufficient and learn how to share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m with you on this one space stuff. This guy is just not willing to accept how codependent we are on everything running PERFECTLY in this country. Grocery stores stock at most 1.5 days of product, that’s it. Once word goes out that something big is happening that will be gone within an hour or two. Gas will run out within the first couple hours. Hospitals, Banks and all public servants will shut down shop. The first few hours while everyone is scrambling to stores/banks/gas stations is gonna be our only shot of getting off the East or West coast. After that it will be gridlock on all major highways inland (and there aren’t many) That’s when the chaos will really set in and start to amplify. Looting/Robbery will start within the first 24 hours. Humans will do sick things in times of extreme desperation, people tend to forget we are still animals and it is still a dog eat dog world out there.</p>

Seeing as we are having an uptick of that, we could have an interesting situation real quick.</p>

The Biggest losers are UK, Israel, US and all the next biggest losers are either NATO members or close allies with the US. Seems all the countries that aren’t NATO members or close allies with the US remain pretty much unchanged or increase. I guess only time will tell at this point....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I should’ve edited that my bad. The numbers are updated regularly but in 2013 the estimates were 30 million people down from 313 million in 2025. Clearly their agenda wasn’t working as well as they hoped so they had to up their numbers. Thanks</p>

<p>What if THIS, this post right here, that thread, is the only hint they/the elites, have given to us, that pretty much says how far they are willing to go to maintain their control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I agree 100%. Whatever they decide to show the people through Mass media/News/TV is merely a distraction and only the tip of the iceberg. The ties run so deep in the 1% they literally use earth as one big game of “Risk.” What’s even worse is how few people realize this or are willing to realize this. They are getting sloppier with their agenda and pretty much just rubbing it in our faces at this point. Only time will tell at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always has, always will be. That’s why people like Bill Gates are allowed to go to 3rd world countries and do live testing of “vaccines” on tens of thousands of children without any prior testing. Weird how Supposedly dead diseases (Polio, amongst others) are actually contracted by a lot of the kids in these 3rd world countries. We, The 99%, are the guinea pigs for the 1%. It’s absolutely disgusting. Even worse is no one seems to know...or care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just goes to show the extent of the misinformation/brainwashing they have been doing. It starts when you get into Kindergarten now and never stops. They’ve definitely achieved their goal of dividing the nation and creating the perfect amount of discontent people (on both sides) I think they are just pitting us all against each other so we (the 99%) end up doing the dirty work ourselves. Oh and your username.....It’s a big fuckin pool party over at NASA! They don’t even try to seem legit anymore...How could we possibly penetrate the van allen radiation belt in the 60’s and get to the moon, but now we can’t even get through the radiation belt and supposedly “destroyed the technology” that got us to the moon in the first place. 100% sham. Keep up the free thinking!</p>

<p>I live in Texas where we just had Harvey and before that ike....both situations left many of us without water or power for extended periods of time, and basically everyone is alive. Humans are robust and resourceful, those things wouldn&#39;t impact overall population </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m with you on this one space stuff. This guy is just not willing to accept how codependent we are on everything running PERFECTLY in this country. Grocery stores stock at most 1.5 days of product, that’s it. Once word goes out that something big is happening that will be gone within an hour or two. Gas will run out within the first couple hours. Hospitals, Banks and all public servants will shut down shop. The first few hours while everyone is scrambling to stores/banks/gas stations is gonna be our only shot of getting off the East or West coast. After that it will be gridlock on all major highways inland (and there aren’t many) That’s when the chaos will really set in and start to amplify. Looting/Robbery will start within the first 24 hours. Humans will do sick things in times of extreme desperation, people tend to forget we are still animals and it is still a dog eat dog world out there.</p>
