       Hey conspirators. Can we share our experiences with alternative forms of medicine that worked for us? I’ll get right to some of mine:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         BHT to treat herpes/cold sores: don’t take that super expensive over the counter abreva shit. My parents literally never had an outbreak after taking some BHT
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Intermittent/normal fasting to “cure” diabetes: diabetes isn’t a disease, it’s a symptom caused by constantly raising insulin levels. As much as we hear we need to be eating 24/7 or else we’ll go into starvation mode or ruin our metabolism (wonder who’s promoting ideas like these) take a break from eating and rid ur bodies addiction to eating constantly. Without insulin spiking up every second, insulin resistance will decrease.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Improper swallowing, breathing, and forward head posture causes teeth misalignment and face breakdown: I’ve been practicing proper swallowing and definitely see changes in my face. This one is a handful and requires a lot of explaining. And I’m too lazy to do that so just google mewing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glasses promote elongation of the eye: ur eyes weren’t meant to look at stuff upfront and close for hours. When doing something that doesn’t require u to have glasses like reading a book or on the computer, take them off. Ur just making ur eyes worse by making close things even closer. Hence why ur vision gets worse
      </p>
      <p>
       THEORY: antibiotics that pass the blood brain barrier to treat neurological diseases. Seeing how almost all patients with MS had the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. Some people are saying that diseases like MS and Alzheimer’s are caused by that bacteria and that they can be cured with heavy doses of antibiotics. I don’t know about this one but does anyone have experience with this?
      </p>
      <p>
       remember there are going to be retards that try to discredit us by writing shit like tiger penis cures cancer. Plz just remember to do ur own research. curezone.org has a lot of cool/legit topics (but also some scammers be careful) I suggest u go there I’d medicine interests u

       I’ll ask again, can u plz elaborate? 
1. BHT is used as a preservative, is safe for consumption, and is an antioxidant. It’s found in cereals and most processed foods. 
2. Fasting is not dangerous. If ur a diabetic, u take drugs like metformin to control ur insulin levels when u EAT. By fasting ur not even raising ur insulin levels in first place and giving ur body the time to lower it
3. Proper posture, swallowing and breathing is dangerous?
4. Reading books and using the computer without glasses is dangerous?

       It doesn't matter which type you're talking about, it remains dangerous. I was just also pointing out that you appear to not even understand there is a difference in types of diabetes.

       A theory is a coherent group of propositions formulated to explain a group of facts or phenomena in the natural world and repeatedly confirmed through experiment or observation. So no, it's not "just a theory"

       It breaks my heart to find people who think type ii diabetes is just too much insulin and it needs to somehow be lowered for everything to magically be ok. Here are some crash courses on diabetes by type for you all.

       Of course there is going to be a period in fasting where BSL drops, but if not regulated BSL will shoot up as the body breaks down ketones. Unmanaged BSL in diabetics is dangerous to the point is can cause coma &amp;/or death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there have been some studies in mice, and a couple of
       <strong>
        short term
       </strong>
       studies in humans. These studies have not in any way established safety of intermittent fasting in diabetics, even for the popular 5:2 diet. Moreover, while there have been some short term successes with intermittent fasting during the aforementioned studies, there have also been situations in at least one study where intermittent fasting had the opposite effect. In all of the successes the subjects were heavily managed by health professionals and medication.

       It is scary to think that not only does OP think it's ok to play doctor with his made up treatments, but that the mods of this sub are allowing it to happen. This is a very real problem.

       I guess that's why doctor's don't know how to deal with biofilms. Seriously go look at official treatment recommendations for chronic infections, they are stuck in the 1940s.

         You can fix burned tongue within an hour by slurpee or snowcone. if the burn is from peppers put a small amount of white bread in the affected area. It will make the pain disappear.

       -Drinking coconut water dramatically reduces fatigue, prevents blackout and keeps the body's temperature stable even in summer. It is kind of like a miracle. You won't feel the heat like others. But you have to make sure that you are drinking 100% coconut water just in time. Non GMO is best.

         You can cure razor bumps by applying turmeric paste to them. The problem should go away within a day.

       I had a staph/MRSA issue about 10 years ago, antibiotics only made it spread and I was flat broke. Did some googling and found a thread that talked about garlic of all things. I had spent over $1200 already, so a $1 garlic clove was a feasible option to me. Crushed some up and packed it into the affected area and immediately showed signs of improvement. It burned like hell but cleared up within a week.

       One thing I definitely noticed is how my sinus problems are completely non existent now. I used to have really bad sinus problems and always breathe through my mouth
      </p>
      <p>
       Appearance wise it’s a lot more subtle but I can definitely see a difference after 1 year: my cheeks look a lot more angular and the lower part of my cheeks also seem a little more hallowed in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I did this when I was in my teens though, supposdley that’s when all this stuff has the most  impact, but i can still definitely see the slight changes

       Buteyko breathing. I've been doing it for over a year now. I never have a runny nose anymore nor haven't had a single illness since I've started despite the rest of my family catching colds and the flu this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of bullshit claims surrounding the method but at it's core it seems to work wonders for allergies and immune system boosting. I can't vouch for asthma relief since I don't have it.

         Doing a heavy metal detox can do the same, but with different ailments (though there is some crossover). Detoxing mercury specifically will enable the successful treatment of candida overgrowth and Lyme. Mercury and Lyme appear to be partners in crime in connection to a large family of debilitating autoimmune conditions. Detoxing aluminum can help with motor function and autism, which appear to be linked in some manner. Really, heavy metals in general are just bad news.

        Reducing fiber cures constipation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The study used patients who had clinically diagnosed constipation and asked them to reduce dietary fiber intake, which helped them have regular bowel movements and less abdomen pain. It makes sense that fiber will cause bulkier stools, though the study doesn't say how much dietary fiber the patients were taking except "high". On a personal note, I remember eating about a dozen of those cup-and-spoon ice creams in a day a few years back and getting abhorrent constipation late at night (it felt like trying to pass an iceberg). Since then I don't let go of my precious fruity dietary fibers and I haven't had anything similar happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone should try different things and observe how their body reacts, reducing what causes them pain or discomfort but I'd say my presumption that people generally don't have enough fiber and should take extra is correct more often than the reverse. Meat is necessary for the body, we need so much protein but plants are the other side of the coin and it's fair to say we need a balance of things on the platter.

       It’s actually only recommended to drink if you have metal poisoning such as that from mercury or lead because it draws it out. You can’t drink pure deionized water for detoxing because it will kill you. What you’re referring to is water that has went through the reverse osmosis process which, albeit contains very little minerals, is not 100% deionized. If you drink pure deionized water, such as that used in steam boilers, you will certainly die.

       Given that in order to achieve 99.999% efficiency (because 100% is never possible in the real world) you need to do a phosphate or a chelate treatment, combined with zeolite beds, you would die, yes. It’s not poison but it would suck every bit of water and electrolytes out of your organs causing a major shutdown of your kidneys and liver, most likely resulting in death. No, you are not guaranteed to die from drinking a sip of deionized water, but what were taught is that a glassful can kill you

       As a healthcare professional I understand there are sometimes better treatment options than those presented to patient by doctors and other clinicians. However, much of this thread is blatantly completely anecdotal, dangerous, and highly susceptible to placebo effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh shit I have x ailment and take y item now I feel better" Is not good evidence based medicine. Also just because someone on YouTube said some crap doesn't make it true. I've seen countlees people die from these home remedies for conditions that we could have reversed. I'm not against home remedies, I'm against spewing bullshit and not using evidence.  Most of you likely aren't around the sick and dying all day and don't know how frustrating it is to have a patient die from not heeding medical advice. So much of this is preventative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently had a patient with kidney failure, decided to do some bullshit natural remedies instead of hemodialysis and other medications and died very quickly. Eating stupid blends of plants won't regenerate your kidney no matter what that guy on YouTube said and will not magically let your kidneys do their very important functions.
      </p>

       Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

       I'd strongly recommend everyone to wear glasses if able, it resolved my headaches and facial strain. I got -5 on both eyes due to not wearing glasses for 10 years, my doctor was amazed I was able to function. Bad vision is just genetic, can be solved with surgery.

       After many years of believing in mainstream medicine, despite solid evidence from personal experience that it was not effective at both diagnosing many health issues as well as treating many health issues (and that they don’t create medicines that fix the health issues, just usually mask the symptoms), I switched to naturopathic medicine. I went from “incurable” to completely healed in 3 months. My naturopathic doc explained how each thing works and how it heals so the natural medicine did not need to be taken indefinitely. It was an amazing experience to finally get my life back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, over 30 of my friends and family have seen the same doc and were healed of their health issues (like gout, diverticulitis, IBS, chemical depression, food sensitivities, Lyme Disease and other infections, MS, eczema, psoriasis, etc.). It’s amazing what can be done when the focus is on healing the body as opposed to masking symptoms.

        THEORY: antibiotics that pass the blood brain barrier to treat neurological diseases. Seeing how almost all patients with MS had the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. Some people are saying that diseases like MS and Alzheimer’s are caused by that bacteria and that they can be cured with heavy doses of antibiotics. I don’t know about this one but does anyone have experience with this?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       None of this is true. MS, like many autoimmune diseases, is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and possibly a viral trigger. It has nothing to do with
       <em>
        Borrelia burgdorferi
       </em>
       or any other bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alzheimer dementia also has nothing to do with bacteria. It is caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain. The main one, beta-amyloid, is a misfolded form of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) on chromosome 21. This is why virtually every person with Down syndrome (ie. those who have an extra chromosome 21) develops Alzheimer dementia by the time they are 40-50: the extra copy of the chromosome means they produce more beta-amyloid at earlier ages.
