       From the Daily Mail no less. The videos of the AZ suspected sex trafficking camp have finally got some attention. But, it is a reasonable way down the page!

       So that makes it straight false then? This sub has been brigaded lately with negativity on any subject.... can we not just have a conversation about it? Assume it’s both lies and the truth until concrete evidence shows us what is really happening

       You can probably have an intelligent, thoughtful conversation about it.

       No, but being on the Daily Mail says nothing. It doesn't add to the credit ility of the story, cause the Daily Mail doesn't care about it being true to print something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we can discuss everything, but the normal way of discussing is thinking that something is not true until there are supporting facts. And the facts till today don't really add to anything.

       I’m sorry but I’m not sure why you are even on the sub then if that’s your outlook, it’s all about being open minded to things that surface. There is a lot of money involved to bury stuff, things don’t just come out naturally they are suppressed. Take any major event that happened recently say the Cosby stuff people heard stuff all the time about what he was up to but no hard evidence... no facts but look at it now, if your so quick to just close this case right now then why bother even being here tbh, you haven’t added anything to the conversation other than tell people there is no facts and the DM is a load of bolox like .... shit takes time to come out and the more people on board on the story the faster the truth comes out what ever it may be but to come in here looking for some insight or even the gist of what’s going on only to be greeted with negativity isn’t helping anyone, if you think it’s a load of shite then just stay away from it no need to be posting, I’m just following along here, I’ve nothing important to add so I don’t

       An odd attitude. The Mail is opinionated and those opinions may not be yours but the Guardian has opinions for that matter. Also the Mail sometimes perhaps by luck is on the right side. It was on GM foods for example

       At least it's nice that they went through and pulled screenshots.  I haven't followed this very closely, but in every thread I've checked out when people asked for pictures no one was posting any and instead directing everyone to videos which are mostly face shots of the guy walking around describing things.

       It has a veneer of credibility, backed by years of good to decent journalism. Of course, they can be wrong, but they normally correct untrue stories and their objective is to print the truth. The DM's aim is to swindle rubes into being shocked by the headline so they buy the paper.

       No, it lost that veneer when they lied the nation into war in Iraq.  It further lost any traces of that veneer hen Obama legalized domestic propaganda via the modernization of the Smith Mundt Act.

       You are completely devoid of any kind of cultural knowledge about the UK, i suppose. Cause The Sun is the poster child of yellow journalism, a filthy rag devoid of any ethics or objectivity, made to cater to the lowest of the low peddling lies and shock stories.

       But there's no proof of anything. It looks more like freaky hobo sex games. If they were smart investigators they would have scoped the place out over a few days, set up hidden cameras, spoken to the land owner but since nothing along these lines seems to have been done this looks like a bullshit group spinning a story out of some junk they found to get some headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the daily mail and the sun are the only outlets in the UK reporting on this speaks volumes in itself. Those 2 papers are gutter trash pushing headlines for clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it objectively and this, albeit weird, doesn't contain proof of anything like these 'investigators' claim apart from some weird shit in the woods.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they've blown any chance of a serious investigation by running to the media and alerting any perpetrators now that their cover is shot.

       The hair dye was kind of weird. And asthma inhaler.

       You think homeless people are dyeing their hair out in the woods regularly, or have asthma inhalers?  I mean it’s certainly possible, but it’s one of those things where everything added together seems a little weird.

       Well hell, they might be. More evidence for that than suggesting it's some human trafficking camp where kids are imprisoned at this point. Or, maybe it's just garbage? Trash collected by a crazy person who lives in a hole in the woods. That's a theory equally as viable as any other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it could be what these veterans on patrol are claiming but it's going to take more than some random objects and circunstancial hearsay to convince. I feel like these dudes are grabbing an easy headline for 5 minutes of fame rather than trying to conduct a serious operation which would have involved accumulating actual evidence over a period of time to draw a real conclusion about whatever is happening here, be it child trafficking, hobo sex, hair dye parties, Bigfoot worships whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       But whatever it was, these dudes have practically eliminated any chance of anyone competent finding out.

       I found some additional evidence of Rothschild involvement in CEMEX. They supposedly own 4.160 shares through EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD HOLDING S.A. and 9,124 shares through BRONFMAN E.L. ROTHSCHILD, L.P. that were then sold I'm guessing, because the current shares are at 52.
