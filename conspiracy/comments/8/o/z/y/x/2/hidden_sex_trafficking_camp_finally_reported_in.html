    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry but I’m not sure why you are even on the sub then if that’s your outlook, it’s all about being open minded to things that surface. There is a lot of money involved to bury stuff, things don’t just come out naturally they are suppressed. Take any major event that happened recently say the Cosby stuff people heard stuff all the time about what he was up to but no hard evidence... no facts but look at it now, if your so quick to just close this case right now then why bother even being here tbh, you haven’t added anything to the conversation other than tell people there is no facts and the DM is a load of bolox like .... shit takes time to come out and the more people on board on the story the faster the truth comes out what ever it may be but to come in here looking for some insight or even the gist of what’s going on only to be greeted with negativity isn’t helping anyone, if you think it’s a load of shite then just stay away from it no need to be posting, I’m just following along here, I’ve nothing important to add so I don’t </p>

<p>No, it lost that veneer when they lied the nation into war in Iraq.  It further lost any traces of that veneer hen Obama legalized domestic propaganda via the modernization of the Smith Mundt Act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there&#39;s no proof of anything. It looks more like freaky hobo sex games. If they were smart investigators they would have scoped the place out over a few days, set up hidden cameras, spoken to the land owner but since nothing along these lines seems to have been done this looks like a bullshit group spinning a story out of some junk they found to get some headlines.</p>

<p>The fact that the daily mail and the sun are the only outlets in the UK reporting on this speaks volumes in itself. Those 2 papers are gutter trash pushing headlines for clicks. </p>

<p>Think about it objectively and this, albeit weird, doesn&#39;t contain proof of anything like these &#39;investigators&#39; claim apart from some weird shit in the woods.</p>

<p>And they&#39;ve blown any chance of a serious investigation by running to the media and alerting any perpetrators now that their cover is shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well hell, they might be. More evidence for that than suggesting it&#39;s some human trafficking camp where kids are imprisoned at this point. Or, maybe it&#39;s just garbage? Trash collected by a crazy person who lives in a hole in the woods. That&#39;s a theory equally as viable as any other. </p>

<p>I mean, it could be what these veterans on patrol are claiming but it&#39;s going to take more than some random objects and circunstancial hearsay to convince. I feel like these dudes are grabbing an easy headline for 5 minutes of fame rather than trying to conduct a serious operation which would have involved accumulating actual evidence over a period of time to draw a real conclusion about whatever is happening here, be it child trafficking, hobo sex, hair dye parties, Bigfoot worships whatever. </p>

<p>But whatever it was, these dudes have practically eliminated any chance of anyone competent finding out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found some additional evidence of Rothschild involvement in CEMEX. They supposedly own 4.160 shares through EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD HOLDING S.A. and 9,124 shares through BRONFMAN E.L. ROTHSCHILD, L.P. that were then sold I&#39;m guessing, because the current shares are at 52.</p>

<p>Use search function and input &quot;Rothschild&quot;.</p>

<p>I also have another Rothschild adviser firm that seems like invested 100k to CEMEX and they were found in 2013.</p>
