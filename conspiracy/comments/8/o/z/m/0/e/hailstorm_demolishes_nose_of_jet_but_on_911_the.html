       The radome is not aluminium.

       I don't think anyone thinks a lightweight aerodynamic fairing would destroy a steel beam.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a 6000 pound engine made of titanium, stainless steel and nickle super-alloys all travelling at 350 knots  is a very different proposition to something made from fiberglass honey comb.

       Oh come on. Now I'm not even making an argument about what did happen that day, but a bunker buster makes absolutely no sense and for that exact reason - it would go right through a skyscraper and detonate on the opposite side. "Bunker buster" is a generic term and not a specific missile, but even our smallest ones can go through something like six feet of reinforced concrete. The more powerful and ones are 20+ feet. They are also much, much smaller than a jet aircraft, so it's not like people couldn't tell the difference when they saw it.

       again and again it shows that small bunkers are penetrated exploded shortly after impact.  e.g. 38s

       That's not a bunker buster, that's an AGM-158 cruise missile.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHKkzuU2qtE">
        Here's a video
       </a>
       of the BLU-109 bunker buster. Notice how the entire missile passes through about 6 feet of concrete and is still completely intact before detonating on the other side. Someone who knows more can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the thin outer layer of a skyscraper would be enough to even detonate that thing. If it was, a simple steel roof over important bunkers would be enough to protect from bunker busters, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, that cruise missile you linked is only 14 feet long. Just because it looks similar to a plane doesn't mean anyone is going to confuse the two at close range.

       Really? It should be pretty easy to find literally thousands of witnesses to back that up then. NYC has a population of about 8 million people, and even if they didn't all see the first plane hit, there must be thousands and thousands of people who were watching when the second one did. Plus the second impact aired live on TV. If that footage was somehow edited in real time, surely these thousands and thousands of witnesses who saw something else would be rioting in the streets.

       Birds too. And yet we are to believe that the aluminum fuselage not only penetrated the massive steel beams and steel trusses laid with concrete on every floor, not only that they did so without slowing down, but in one instance the nose of the plane is shown to be emerging intact from the other side of the building —before that feed immediately fades to black upon the error being realized.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don’t you see, you Johnny-come-lately’s, it doesn’t matter how many people you incorrectly assert saw a plane. It doesn’t matter that it happened on television. It could not have happened, therefore it did not happen. No planes hit any buildings on 9/11 and no plane crashed in Shanksville.

       It appears to be a jet of black smoke that you can see In
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz2iGEAuDBk">
        every other video
       </a>
       of that impact (and in higher quality versions of your clip, included in the link).
      </p>
      <p>
       If they prepared CGI footage before the attack, wouldn't the "error" have been noticed at that time?  The video doesn't fade to black as you say, it cuts out for a fraction of a second after the supposed nose appeared, completely failing to obscure the purported deception.

       No, it's clearly a plane nose. September Clues overlays the two images and they're the same, clearly identical plane nose, before and after impact. Only it's not a plane nose, obviously, because planes cannot physically go into or especially through steel and concrete skyscrapers. It's a shitty CGI sprite, because there were
       <strong>
        no planes.

       Mechanical engineer here.  Mass x velocity=momentum.  The rate of change of momentum with time, or (assuming mass is constant) mass x acceleration=force.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, kinetic energy= (1/2 x mass) x (velocity)
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       and upon impact with the building, the kinetic energy will be transferred in the form of force x distance since there will then be acceleration.  Or acceleration x mass x distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       A boeing 767 has a mass m of approx. 157 tons
      </p>
      <p>
       The velocity of the plane at impact was reported as 590 miles per hour (which is at least 30mph greater than the maximum velocity this plane can achieve)
      </p>
      <p>
       The length of the tower's cross section is 208 feet or x
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane stops by the time it has reached the end of the tower, so average velocity throughout the crash is 590/2 or 295mph or v
      </p>
      <p>
       The approx. time for the plane to travel through the building t is t=x/v=0.5seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average acceleration of the plane from impact to when it reaches the end of the tower is v/t=901 ft/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the average force during the crash is F=m*a=4.4 kilo tons
      </p>
      <p>
       The steel used in the WTC was A36 structural steel, having a yield strength of 36000 psi
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the middle of the tower was mainly elevator shafts and whatnot, I assumed there to be no strength added in that section.  The area of the middle of the tower's cross section is 49% of the total cross sectional area of the tower, so I applied a factor of .49 to the A36 strength.  Following this, to account for the tower not being solid steel I applied another factor of .5 to the A36 strength, resulting in a final estimated strength of 8640 psi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the cross sectional area A of the 767 cabin, which is roughly 35630 in
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       now the average force needed to break the tower can be determined.  Strength=F/A, and F=Strength*A=158 kilo tons
      </p>
      <p>
       Fplane=4.4 kilo tons
      </p>
      <p>
       F to penetrate tower=158 kilo tons
      </p>
      <p>
       So, with a 767 flying faster than reportedly being capable of at an altitude that is far below the reported minimum operational altitude, only 3% of the required  force to penetrate the WTC is produced.

       according to you the entire plane should have flown right out the other side... but much of the energy of collision must have disintegrated the plane
      </p>
      <p>
       we never saw any big wing, tail sections, rows of seats or even luggage.. only pieces as small as intact passports could survive this dissipation of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, the wings and tail made cartoon cutouts in the buildings, but at the pentagon, the wings disintegrate?  can you rationalize that one for me?

       I based that analysis on how it looks on the footage which shows the nose of the plane exit on the other side.  What I did was try to determine the average force required to stop the plane in the time that it appears to stop in the footage starting at the speed that was reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       The force that was determined to be needed to stop the plane as it is seen in the video was nowhere near what should have been capable of breaking the structure like it did.  That force applied over the cross section area of the cabin  creates a stress of 1.7 MPa.  The stress required to penetrate the structure is 61.2MPa.  Since the plane as seen in the footage would be the result of the average stress being 1.7MPa being applied to it, there is no way this was a plane because the structure wouldn't even be penetrated unless a stress that was greater than its strength was applied.  So I'm saying the plane should have smashed as it hit the tower, maybe done some damage to the outer parts of the tower a bit, but that'd be it, according to my very basic analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah it's so ridiculous that they expect us to believe a plane hit the towers where there's no evidence of any plane parts in the rubble.  Not even the engines, haha but yet they can find the passport of one of the supposed hijackers.  I honestly can't believe that's the story that's being sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       That part is hilarious also, the plane that hit the pentagon didn't even go completely though the building but there's nothing even resembling something from an airplane in the rubble.  It's funny how the plane at WTC just cut through the tower as your saying, like a cartoon cutout, and the same results weren't replicated at the pentagon, which seemingly would be a weaker structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the pentagon was either a missile or an explosive inside the building.  And at the WTC I think there were explosives in place to cause the desired damage and also ( at the location of the supposed plane entry) placed to create holes to fit the shape of the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I almost think the WTC plane was just edited into the films.  There's lots of people saying they saw no plane in person at the time.

       I know that, but I was trying to be as conservative as possible in this analysis.  I knew the middle would still have a lot of steel columns and such, but not as much as the outside and I didn't know how much a difference there would be since I'm not sure exactly what all of the middle was composed of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the middle adds significant strength to the tower only makes even the result from the analysis even more conclusive, as in reality there would be much greater stress required to replicate what is seen in the film than the strength determined.

       are you saying that a piece of straw is equivalent to a complex machine made of aluminum vs. steel beams?

       that's a false equivalence.   the density and strength of materials are certainly factors in the expected collision results.

       This is a pretty crazy comparison. So you're saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       Object 1 damages nose cone
      </p>
      <p>
       Object 1 does not damage building
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, nose cone cannot damage building.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be able to begin to argue that, you'd need to fire hail at a building at 600 mph.

       Hail destroyed the nose cone... as would the steel beams... but you can be sure the impact also destroyed the hail stones... as would the impact destroy the steel beams.

       That's not how it works. It's about speed, not mass. KE = (1/2)M*V^2. A high speed piece of foam punched holes into the wings of the space shuttle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass of 767 = 320,000 lbs = 145,150 kg
      </p>
      <p>
       Speed of 767 = 500 mph = 224 m/s
      </p>
      <p>
       0.5 * 145150 * 224^2 = 3,641,523,200 = 3.6 gigajoules

       Vne is around 350 knots on the 767. That's around 403 mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       As always in aviation there is significant safety margin inherent, let's say around 10 per cent, which would equate to Max speed of somewhere around 390 knots or 450 mph. And that's just before you start doing structural damage to the airframe...which I don't think was a concern at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, the aircraft was definitely oversped, and probably bent, much like the Taiwanese 747 that almost went supersonic after a loss of control 20 or so years ago.....but the 767 is a very strong airframe.

       I posted sources, and my line of logic is impeccable. My point isn't to push the official bullshit narrative, it's to show that nose strength and nose material is irrelevant because there is still 2+ gigajoules of energy behind a plane hitting a building.

       Mechanical engineer here.  Mass x velocity=momentum.  The rate of change of momentum with time, or (assuming mass is constant) mass x acceleration=force.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, kinetic energy= (1/2 x mass) x (velocity)
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       and upon impact with the building, the kinetic energy will be transferred in the form of force x distance since there will then be acceleration.  Or acceleration x mass x distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       A boeing 767 has a mass m of approx. 157 tons
      </p>
      <p>
       The velocity of the plane at impact was reported as 590 miles per hour (which is at least 30mph greater than the maximum velocity this plane can achieve)
      </p>
      <p>
       The length of the tower's cross section is 208 feet or x
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane stops by the time it has reached the end of the tower, so average velocity throughout the crash is 590/2 or 295mph or v
      </p>
      <p>
       The approx. time for the plane to travel through the building t is t=x/v=0.5seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average acceleration of the plane from impact to when it reaches the end of the tower is v/t=901 ft/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the average force during the crash is F=m*a=4.4 kilo tons
      </p>
      <p>
       The steel used in the WTC was A36 structural steel, having a yield strength of 36000 psi
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the middle of the tower was mainly elevator shafts and whatnot, I assumed there to be no strength added in that section.  The area of the middle of the tower's cross section is 49% of the total cross sectional area of the tower, so I applied a factor of .49 to the A36 strength.  Following this, to account for the tower not being solid steel I applied another factor of .5 to the A36 strength, resulting in a final estimated strength of 8640 psi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the cross sectional area A of the 767 cabin, which is roughly 35630 in
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       now the average force needed to break the tower can be determined.  Strength=F/A, and F=Strength*A=158 kilo tons
      </p>
      <p>
       Fplane=4.4 kilo tons
      </p>
      <p>
       F to penetrate tower=158 kilo tons
      </p>
      <p>
       So, with a 767 flying faster than reportedly being capable of at an altitude that is far below the reported minimum operational altitude, only 3% of the required  force to penetrate the WTC is produced.

       are you saying that a piece of straw is equivalent to a complex machine made of aluminum vs. steel beams?

       that's a false equivalence.   the density and strength of materials are certainly factors in the expected collision results.
