       If you've done your research then you'll understand that what's happening in Tuscon is VERY real. What's sad is that we have to watch this become another hoax/conspiracy. Don't believe me? Cough.. Cough.. "Boys Town" 
Boys Town has had too many cases and allegations thrown their way in the past, yet nothing has been done about it. There's still cases that pop up but just get tossed aside.I'll never understand how a place like boys Town has survived this long, but I might have a good Theory. We are getting to watch in my opinion one of the greatest discoveries in human history, but sadly as a whole we're still too asleep and are not ready to take on such an evil. You would think something like this would be alot easier to believe then UFO's or the world being some type of simulation right? Unfortunately no, it has to make headlines on mass media like CNN and Fox before the ones asleep would even jump on board with the idea. We all know the high ups control these types of networks so they would never report on it. The authorities are showing us they want nothing to do with the situation so who are we to ask for help? If we try awakening the ones asleep, then we just become crazy in their eyes. This is history showing us that we will never become strong enough to destroy this evil. Until we find a way to wake everyone up, then this is the world we will forever live in...

       Literally ran into this just yesterday. Guy called out my sources instead of thinking for himself and actually reading and evaluating information on his own. Instead just told me to come back when it’s in the AP.

       TLDR; in society, there are sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs.  The sheep are the vulnerable, the wolves are criminals, and sheepdogs are police or those sworn to protect the vulnerable.  I learned about it in a concealed carry class.

       No problem.  That little essay is one of the reasons I don't carry.  I can't commit to being a sheepdog, so I will remain a sheep, at least as far as firearms are concerned.

       I don't care what people think about me.  I care about getting people to understand what is going on in the world.  Ranting about invisible elites controlling everything does little to help.  But if you've had success with that method feel free to share.

       if you find what you think is a grave and stop digging because of the smell   you fucking failed.  Dig up the body and all the support in the world would follow.    get that shit on video in the proper perspective and ill call it evidence.  until then  they dont have shit.

       That's literally the only thing any of you doubters can say. Why not debunk how there's actual footage of the tunnels with toys? There's too much evidence pointing towards these camps showing there were children there. The one and only REALISTIC theory (other then child trafficking camps) is that this is to draw our attention away from something bigger in the making.

       I have to agree with this. Once they got the smell, they should've gotten the cameras on that and DEFINITELY kept digging, giving warnings about what might be seen.

       This is the most suspicious thing about the entire event.

       I don’t understand how video evidence doesn’t exist of some of the things being claimed. Like there’s snippets of scenery in like 2 walkthroughs, but there have been claims of bloody knives, a bulldozer and black suv’s, encounters with police, first 6, then 60, then 80, then 90 pairs of children’s shoes, blueprints of tunnel systems, all of which supposedly found at and then removed from the site (wtf why the fuck would you not meticulously document everything where you found it) yet the only thing we’ve seen is that dude recording himself making vlog entries about battling unseen forces

       He even states he doesn't know who to trust anymore so why would he deliberately show us evidence such as the knife? If he did then this would be blown open... or people would still find a way to doubt on this because some of us just can't believe the unimaginable

       these guys are either idiots or purposely bad actors because that is the dumbest excuse ive ever heard. documents himself talking about all the evidence he has, doesn’t document the evidence while it’s at the site, then removes the evidence from the site, then doesn’t document it while it’s in their possession, because he doesn’t know who to trust? but he’s fine showing his face and talking about it?? not to mention the claims of bulldozing and black suvs, pull out your fuckin phone right? its like they are trying to make it as unbelievable as they can! 99 times out of 100, if someone says they have proof of something but can’t show you or can’t go public with it, especially because “i dont know who to trust”, it’s bs. because a reddit comment from someone who saw a reddit post based on an earlier thread made by someone who heard a rumor on 8chan about some whispers on voat surrounding a facebook vlog of a guy recording himself talking about loads of damning evidence is not sufficient to earn credibility.

       This shows my theory is correct. It's not about  these types of scenarios being real, it's the fact of as a whole we continue to shut people down and force them to not be open minded. People like you keep the world the way it is. When something like this happens I want it to be debunked with reasoning backing it up. Do you have evidence to back up this is a lie? No because you aren't their witnessing this "lie"

       There is a difference between being open minded and accepting what somebody says with no evidence. He says they have evidence, but they won’t show it. If the evidence is right there, why should I even entertain the idea if they won’t show it?

       They have had a reporter come and investigate  the camps. That's all we need to know until further information is brought to our attention. Instead of saying its fake, show me evidence stating it's fake. You have nothing to show but your word.

       It's at 80 not 90 so stop putting fake facts out. Where's your video evidence showing the camps are fake? There's evidence of them existing so until you show me they're fake I will continue to hope and believe this is real.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that there were 90 now. I don’t have video evidence proving the camp isn’t a child sex trafficking/dungeon hot spot. I don’t need to have one. There is a video proving that a camp exists, but no proof that it was for child sex. He can prove there is a location that was used as a camp and that is it. Him saying that it was used to hold children hostage is just him projecting his ideas on it, just like if someone said that it was a homeless camp. He found the camp, he claimed it was to hold children hostage/rape them, now he needs to show us the proof that he says he has so we don’t just have to take his word for it. When he does that, then we can decide if the evidence holds up.

       Yeah, I agree. Sucks, because I was rooting for this Craig Sawyer guy to be the real deal.

       It's even worse, though, because we all KNOW they're running kids over the boarders of Arizona and it's a total Mexican cartel shit show. Maddening.

       Bunch of fucking people with nothing better to do. Seriously that camp was nothing more than a homeless camp. God damn. I’m all for believing that children are being trafficked around the world but that camp in Arizona is like grasping for straws lol.

       Nothing better to do? While you probably work some desk jockey 9to5 job, people are trying to stop child trafficking and you're saying there's nothing better to do then that? I have no hope for people like you. Even if this turned out fake, I would hope that trying to stop a child trafficking ring would be a pretty good use of your time. Js

       Oh I’m all for supporting people ending trafficking in general, but sitting at a keyboard talking about this particular situation will net you nothing. If it turns out fake? It is fake. There is literally zero evidence backing up all these claims other than a few people here and there on this board making random statements. It’s like the game telephone. Someone says something and it gets changed over and over until it’s something completely different. The comet pizza had more credibility to it than this homeless camp. That I could see as being possible. This? Nah.

       You're up for child trafficking to stop, but when a story comes up with tons of video evidence you immediately say it's fake? I don't know if it's because I have a child myself, that I'm open minded, or that I know the world we live in is built on evil, but this is one of those story's that I feel you can't help but believe. If you think it's fake then show me instead of talking. They are out there doing something, you're not.

       I always see these post about "when will beat the elite, are we ready, etc."

       People like that seem to optimistic and not realistic. No major change has come without bloodshed and fighting. Change through peaceful protests? Yeah right.

       I will also say that when you're freedom, life, and rights are at stake, you must also fight for what you want and believe in.

       I think things will repeat...just like the cival war. There were be strong opinions, so strong that the country is literally divided.

       I really don't know how positive change will come. The military can easily just lock you up in a camp and throw out the key

       the US has a status to uphold. If the world saw us quarrel from within like that it'd be terrible. The government would probably back factions and militia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it'd be militia vs militia with the overall military providing weapons and Intel to whichever aligns with what they want

       I think this is happening in like two thirds of the world at the moment. I have a personal experience but basically it’s the Youth. The youth are the ones crying for change. In Nicaragua right now the students are the ones leading the national

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The government there is using paramilitary factions under the guise as police (a normal tactic). The military has not really chosen a side despite kind of supporting the protesters. Either way, this is not localized.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rohingya in Myanmar, Syrians all over Europe, IDPs in the Middle East, Venezuela’s internally displaced people and their plight, Africa’s continuous public health and refugee crises... the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       This crisis that the US is going through is one of... identity. It is not truly life or death yet. But it may involve the life or death of the spirit of the US. It’s already bordered an oligarchy since the turn of the century. It is too soon to tell the outcome, but anyone who’s willing to do a little research can see the major players.

       The Youth will be the ones that save this world from fascism this time, methinks.

       resist the attitude that it is 'the best of all possible worlds' and 'everybody knows this stuff goes on anyway, not much to do about it, none of my business' or worse, that statutory laws are quaint things of the past, like the bill of rights or geneva conventions.

       That’s a lie taught in the ancient Luciferian mystery schools that lives on today in many forms including the New Age movement.  Man cannot become God.

       There exists two ancient belief systems: Gnosticism and Hermeticism.  Each of them teach that we are a part of “god” and so then we are “god”.  I used to believe in these beliefs before I learned about the Luciferian mystery schools which is where Gnosticism and Hermeticism were taught more than 1000 years ago.  Today, it is taught in the secret societies.  These teachings are also veiled in the New Age movement, which originates from people like Alice Bailey who founded the Lucifer Trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Hermetic work, the Kybalion, was published by a publisher using a Masonic temple as its address.  Aleister Crowley, member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in his religion, Thelema, taught, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.”  That is what the philosophy you speak of leads to: lawlessness.  Quite the contrary to YHWH wouldn’t you say?  Crowley was also a Satanist.
      </p>
      <p>
       To learn about Gnosticism, I recommend the following hour of Bill Cooper’s Mystery Babylon series:
