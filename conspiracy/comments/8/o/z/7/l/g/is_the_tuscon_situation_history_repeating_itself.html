        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you&#39;ve done your research then you&#39;ll understand that what&#39;s happening in Tuscon is VERY real. What&#39;s sad is that we have to watch this become another hoax/conspiracy. Don&#39;t believe me? Cough.. Cough.. &quot;Boys Town&quot; 
Boys Town has had too many cases and allegations thrown their way in the past, yet nothing has been done about it. There&#39;s still cases that pop up but just get tossed aside.I&#39;ll never understand how a place like boys Town has survived this long, but I might have a good Theory. We are getting to watch in my opinion one of the greatest discoveries in human history, but sadly as a whole we&#39;re still too asleep and are not ready to take on such an evil. You would think something like this would be alot easier to believe then UFO&#39;s or the world being some type of simulation right? Unfortunately no, it has to make headlines on mass media like CNN and Fox before the ones asleep would even jump on board with the idea. We all know the high ups control these types of networks so they would never report on it. The authorities are showing us they want nothing to do with the situation so who are we to ask for help? If we try awakening the ones asleep, then we just become crazy in their eyes. This is history showing us that we will never become strong enough to destroy this evil. Until we find a way to wake everyone up, then this is the world we will forever live in... </p>

<p>these guys are either idiots or purposely bad actors because that is the dumbest excuse ive ever heard. documents himself talking about all the evidence he has, doesn’t document the evidence while it’s at the site, then removes the evidence from the site, then doesn’t document it while it’s in their possession, because he doesn’t know who to trust? but he’s fine showing his face and talking about it?? not to mention the claims of bulldozing and black suvs, pull out your fuckin phone right? its like they are trying to make it as unbelievable as they can! 99 times out of 100, if someone says they have proof of something but can’t show you or can’t go public with it, especially because “i dont know who to trust”, it’s bs. because a reddit comment from someone who saw a reddit post based on an earlier thread made by someone who heard a rumor on 8chan about some whispers on voat surrounding a facebook vlog of a guy recording himself talking about loads of damning evidence is not sufficient to earn credibility. </p>

It&#39;s not about  these types of scenarios being real, it&#39;s the fact of as a whole we continue to shut people down and force them to not be open minded.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I read a comment on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that there were 90 now. I don’t have video evidence proving the camp isn’t a child sex trafficking/dungeon hot spot. I don’t need to have one. There is a video proving that a camp exists, but no proof that it was for child sex. He can prove there is a location that was used as a camp and that is it. Him saying that it was used to hold children hostage is just him projecting his ideas on it, just like if someone said that it was a homeless camp. He found the camp, he claimed it was to hold children hostage/rape them, now he needs to show us the proof that he says he has so we don’t just have to take his word for it. When he does that, then we can decide if the evidence holds up. </p>

<p>I always see these post about &quot;when will beat the elite, are we ready, etc.&quot;</p>

<p>People like that seem to optimistic and not realistic. No major change has come without bloodshed and fighting. Change through peaceful protests? Yeah right.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not advocating for violence, everybody should be able to live unharmed.</p>

<p>I will also say that when you&#39;re freedom, life, and rights are at stake, you must also fight for what you want and believe in.</p>

<p>I think things will repeat...just like the cival war. There were be strong opinions, so strong that the country is literally divided. </p>

<p>The Rohingya in Myanmar, Syrians all over Europe, IDPs in the Middle East, Venezuela’s internally displaced people and their plight, Africa’s continuous public health and refugee crises... the list goes on. </p>

<p>This crisis that the US is going through is one of... identity. It is not truly life or death yet. But it may involve the life or death of the spirit of the US. It’s already bordered an oligarchy since the turn of the century. It is too soon to tell the outcome, but anyone who’s willing to do a little research can see the major players.</p>

<p>The Youth will be the ones that save this world from fascism this time, methinks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a lie taught in the ancient Luciferian mystery schools that lives on today in many forms including the New Age movement.  Man cannot become God.</p>

<p>Perhaps if you can elaborate on what you meant I can go into more detail.</p>

<p>If you walk in Jesus’s footsteps, you will be fighting for the force of good against the forces of evil you speak of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There exists two ancient belief systems: Gnosticism and Hermeticism.  Each of them teach that we are a part of “god” and so then we are “god”.  I used to believe in these beliefs before I learned about the Luciferian mystery schools which is where Gnosticism and Hermeticism were taught more than 1000 years ago.  Today, it is taught in the secret societies.  These teachings are also veiled in the New Age movement, which originates from people like Alice Bailey who founded the Lucifer Trust.</p>

<p>The Hermetic work, the Kybalion, was published by a publisher using a Masonic temple as its address.  Aleister Crowley, member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in his religion, Thelema, taught, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.”  That is what the philosophy you speak of leads to: lawlessness.  Quite the contrary to YHWH wouldn’t you say?  Crowley was also a Satanist.</p>

<p>To learn about Gnosticism, I recommend the following hour of Bill Cooper’s Mystery Babylon series:</p>
