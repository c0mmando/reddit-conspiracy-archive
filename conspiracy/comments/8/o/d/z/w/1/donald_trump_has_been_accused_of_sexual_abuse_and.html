       A lawsuit was filed against the businessman accusing him of repeatedly raping the 13-year-old girl in 1994.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the suit, the assaults took place at parties hosted at the Upper East Side apartment of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, owner of the infamous 'Lolita Express' private plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The victim says she was lured to the parties with promises of a modeling career, where she was then assaulted in a “savage” manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump allegedly tied her to the bed and slapped her across the face as she begged him to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the details of Defendant Trump’s sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically harmed if not killed,” she stated in an affidavit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plaintiff previously filed a case against Trump in Los Angeles, which was dismissed.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was also accused of assaulting his ex-wife Ivana, who later backtracked on the statement she gave under oath, where she described the presidential hopeful violently attacking her, pulling out her hair, and raping her while they were married.
      </p>

      <p>
       In 1997, a woman accused Trump of touching her intimately and attempting to rape her on numerous occasions. She withdrew her case after he husband settled his own case against Trump,
       <strong>
        but stated she stands by the allegations in 2016.
       </strong>

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sounds like Trump's lawyers are extremely good at getting his victims to recant their statements and settling the cases with a payout. I'd imagine someone who was being considered by the global crime syndicate to be a future president, an incredible asset to them, is going to have a little extra help along the way as well.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump deliberately walked in on two young Miss USA 2001 contestants while they were naked and getting dressed for a rehearsal, one of the former beauty contestants has claimed in an interview with the Guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr Trump just barged right in, didn’t say anything, stood there and stared at us,” she recalled. Trump’s attitude, she said, seemed to be: “I can do this because I can.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “He didn’t walk in and say, ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I was looking for someone,’” she continued. “He walked in, he stood and he stared. He was doing it because he knew that he could.”
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find particularly disturbing is that half of these cases involve lewd sex acts against children. Hardcore Trump supporters will find creative ways to absolve him of any wrong doing,
       <strong>
        likely by attacking the accusers as money hungry women who cooked up a story.
       </strong>
       People who think Trump is still some sort of anti establishment good guy do not realize that he has been compromised, and is clearly as sadistic and power hungry as the rest of the elites.

       The "Pizzagate people" are well if Trumps relationship with Epstein and his various sexual abuse cases. He is a person of interest in our investigation.
      </p>

       I'm bringing this to attention for the new lurkers and readers who may still be under the assumption that POTUS is has their best interests at heart. He doesn't.
      </p>

       I'd be highly entertained though, to see you address these accusations and attempt to absolve POTUS of any wrongdoing.

       I'm simply shining a light on the sexual deviancy of our current president. We're all aware of the clintons and their crimes, I didn't feel as if I was obligated to address that in my post. Both parties and the people involved in politics suck, and bringing up Bill Clinton in a post about Trump could be considered "whataboutism" to deflect.

       The ruling class doesn't like seeing their puppet asset painted in a negative light. Especially after they've spent to much time portraying him as an "anti establishment good guy"..

       What proof or evidence do you have that Trump is a rapist?  It better be something new.  If all you have is past allegations, then you are wasting our time.  We have already looked into that.

       "That should be the first priority in any conspiracy related sexual abuse investigation."  You mean to tell me that you would rather look into that than the activities of the satanic pedo Cabal that rules the world?  I think your priorities are flipped.

       You are correct.  Nobody gets a free pass on any of this shit.  If we thought that Trump was a member of the Satanic pedo Cabal, then we would not support him.   This is not a political issue.  It is a fight between good and evil.  If someone has information that Trump chose evil over good, then we need to see the evidence.  The evidence I see is that Trump chose good over evil.

       "The "Pizzagate people" are well aware of Trumps relationship with Epstein and his various sexual abuse cases. He is a person of interest in our investigation."  Trump was a person of interest.  Nothing was found to link Trump to the Satanic pedo Cabal.  There is no doubt that they targeted Trump for recruitment, but they were unsuccessful.  Do you have anything new to add to this?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Downvote all you want. I'm just trying to bring this to the attention of the new lurkers and readers who may still be under the assumption that POTUS has their best interests at heart. He doesn't."  I did not downvote you.  I normally do not downvote people.  Whose interests is Trump concerned with?
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'd be highly entertained though, to see you address these accusations and attempt to absolve POTUS of any wrongdoing."  Easy!  Epstein was running a pedo honeypot for the CIA and Mossad.  If Epstein had gotten Trump to screw a kid, then it would be on video.  If Trump was on video screwing kids, then the CIA, Mossad, and FBI would have access to the video and Trump would be under their control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has been at war with the CIA and FBI since before the election.  This tells me that they were not able to get Trump on video screwing kids.  Also, Comey would have used that video to save his job.  Trump fired Comey without a concern in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump acts like he does not give a fuck about what the CIA, Mossad, FBI, etc. think.  There is no video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have anything new to add to the discussion?

       Just another soul caught up in the blackmail ring most likely. The only hope is that his ego somehow makes him live out a movie fantasy of U.S.A. saviourhood, and somehow a sexual deviant can not get us completely obliterated or financially ruined?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully we can take the time to indict both sides though. We can't fail to mention people like Bill Clinton here. Finding candidates with sexually deviant proclivities is a priority for any controller.

       Maybe this is why no one takes it seriously. From your own sources on the alleged rape of a 13 year old:
      </p>
      <p>
       "A Guardian investigation this summer found that the lawsuit appeared to have been coordinated by a former producer on the Jerry Springer TV show who has been associated in the past with a range of disputed claims involving celebrities including OJ Simpson and Kurt Cobain. A publicist acting for “Jane Doe” also attempted to sell a video in which the woman describes her allegations against Trump to media outlets at a $1m price tag."

       Your sources don't back up your claims and you are merely speculating that these women were paid off and Trump protected. Again, one of the "victims" claimed she would vote for Trump for President and his ex-wife claimed it wasn't criminal rape, whatever that is. In other words, the victims don't even back the claims that they are associated with.

       Attempting to say an investigation by The Guardian is a reputable investigation is pretty audacious after the onslaught of untrue things to come from them and outlandish claims, not just about DJT but many topics.

       I misunderstood your comment. I figured you were stating their investigation being a shame meant the claims made by the victims were true. While The Guardians investigations may not be any good, the information they uncovered in this case may have been. I have no way of knowing as I cannot confirm or deny what they wrote. However, as a source to back up rape charges, the article did exactly the opposite.

       You're expanding on something I addressed in my post. A man with this sort of wealth, power, and political influence would have the ability to convince or threaten these women to recant their original statements via his legal team. Perhaps large sums of money were promised in return? Death threats (which were mentioned by one of the victims)?
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm unsure as to why you're so quick to defend Trump, I understand your concern. That being said, you can't possibly be so naive as to think someone with his financial and political influence would be incapable of these things?

       Your own sources dismissed these claims and had very valid reasons for doing so. One woman even said she would vote for him if he weon the Republican nomination. Must have been one helluva payoff. You have no evidence and are only speculating. I'm in no way saying Trump is clean, but the only one with any potential validity is him walking in on the Miss USA contestants which isn't really a crime. It makes him more of an ass than anything. Find better sources which actually back your claims if you want people to take your post seriously.

       You're essentially looking for a reason to defend somebody that has been accused of molestation over a dozen times. There are several other instances I didn't even list.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling that your political favoritism is blinding you on this issue, because it's pretty rare to find somebody to defend a political from several documented sexual abuse claims, let alone the sitting president, in the conspiracy forum of all places.

       First off, I'm an independent and I didn't vote for Trump. Second, your own sources refuted your claims. I didn't do anything other than read what you provided. While Trump may have done these things and may be protected as your theory suggests, you provided zero evidence backing it up. You presented articles that did exactly the opposite and you misrepresented what they said. If anyone comes across as having an agenda, it is you bud. Why so keen on getting everyone to believe Trump is a pedophile and a rapist?

       The person behind the 13 year old Jane Doe story also sold stories to the media that he sold OJ drugs they day of the murders, hired the hitman who killed Kurt Cobain, was a close friend of Casey Anthony who confessed murdering her child to him etc
He takes hot media stories and tries cashes in on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       He outright refused any off the record confirmation of her identity to any journalist. No one was ever deposed, nothing was ever officially filed. He presented a personal letter and a personal videotape as being official legal documents and a taped deposition.

       the reason i dont have any faith in these lawsuits, is if they had any real merit the media would be all fucking over it. i mean they are grasping at straws for ANYTHING remotely negative about him. the fact they arent beating us over the head with them is a pretty good indicator they looked in to it and couldn't find anything worth a damn in them.

       I don't play this guy here but I will. Accused doesn't mean shit, was he convicted? no? then nothing to talk about. How would you like it if you were convicted of raping a kid and you had nothing to do with it, and all your family and friends think your a child rapist. Only you get off of it but you can't go anywhere do anything see anybody without being called a child rapist. Even though you only got accused... Just saying

       If there is/was compelling evidence of wrongdoing by Trump then the NYC Police Dept is culpable as he has not been charged. If Geoffrey Epstein is an FBI informant any activity would also have been known to the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       IN neither case of either department has an indictment been sought or obtained. On the basis of this I can see no evidence of anything other that butthurt the Trump is in the White House while Hillary is under investigation.

       As someone who has been raped, assaulted, harassed by multiple men, I feel like Trump is definitely the type to do all these things and more. Especially given all the creepy shit he's said. He has the power to make (some of) his victims fall silent, and if you've been violated by someone who's that wealthy and powerful it would be very hard to stand up for yourself. It's not a far fetched "conspiracy" at all. Imo when people defend him it looks naive or suspicious.

       I'm entertained that people will defend Trump from anything and everything while claiming that Trump is not friends with either Jeffery Epstein or the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's own words about Epstein, “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
      </p>
      <p>
       And...
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, a 2003 Vanity Fair profile of Epstein named Trump as one of the “businessmen who dine with him at his home,” and several other articles have pegged Trump and Epstein as friends.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The lawsuit by the young lady that accused Trump of raping her and another gal when they were 12/13 years old went all the way until December.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is jumping on the everyone's a pedo in Hollywood with Pizzagate but point to Dear Leader, the God-King Trump who is as much apart of Hollywood with his TV shows and involvements in movies, he's the most innocent man in the world.

       I'm bringing this to attention for the new lurkers and readers who may still be under the assumption that POTUS is has their best interests at heart. He doesn't.

       What proof or evidence do you have that Trump is a rapist?  It better be something new.  If all you have is past allegations, then you are wasting our time.  We have already looked into that.

      <p>
       "That should be the first priority in any conspiracy related sexual abuse investigation."  You mean to tell me that you would rather look into that than the activities of the satanic pedo Cabal that rules the world?  I think your priorities are flipped.
