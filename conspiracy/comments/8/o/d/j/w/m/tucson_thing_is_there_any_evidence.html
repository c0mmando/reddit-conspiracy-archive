       I've been reading about this story and there appears to be quite a bit of evidence, but I haven't seen any actual photographs in any of the posts. Am I looking in the wrong place? Has anyone posted some evidence for any of this stuff? I would have assumed this veteran's group would take a bunch of pictures and document the scene and stuff, and I would have expected these pictures to be prominently featured here and elsewhere, but I'm not finding anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe someone can help me out?

       These are data points, but not evidence of what they're claiming. A press release about a mayor? A bunch of maps? How does that prove that children are being abused?
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems like they're trying to overwhelm with unrelated data so it looks like they've done a lot of research and uncovered things, but none of it is related to the claims that are being made.

       I agree, none of it is actual evidence of any of these claims. They say they had experts come to look at it, and those experts concluded it is what they are saying it is, but there is little in the way of actual empirical evidence of any of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s something though right? Lemme know if you find anything more, as with most of these “conspiracies”, it does seem that they are deliberately making the evidence difficult to examine.

       If an actual expert corroborated any of these claims, they would easily have the contacts needed to
       <em>
        investigate
       </em>
       and if they were credible experts, it would be done already.

       He's looking right at nylon straps holding up planks of wood in what is clearly a shelter structure, and he claims they're "rape restraints" … so no, I don't really trust this guy's ability to properly identify anything.

       That's why they're getting cadaver dogs though. For proof. In the video he says they will arrive tomorrow morning and that they're keeping watch until then. The Police will be the ones controlling the dogs with permission from the DOJ if you believe the video anyway.

       That honestly shows me nothing to back up their claim. He can call it a "child sex camp" all he wants, that doesn't automatically make it true. This video is just 8 minutes of the guy walking around pointing to normal things and imagining ways it is used to rape kids.

       Do you have a reasonable explanation for the restraints on the trees that one could understand it to be a "normal thing"?  I ask because that seems to be the opposite of normal to me.  I've never seen restraints on trees in my life.

       It's all conjecture and eye-test for both of us though in one of the videos, one of the people on-site mentioned blood on them.

       Neither one of can know without being there and seeing it ourselves.  But right now, I'm more prone to believe the accounts of people actually there than someone on the internet trying to explain it away as something that's just "normal things".

       There's plenty of suspicious things at that site to feel something nefarious is going on.  As far as I am concerned, enough to warrant a further look by investigators.  I appreciate you trying to explain it all away.  Heck, it might even be your job for all I know.  But being this is now days old, multiple government agencies have been apparently contacted, and zero action has been taken by any of them... Well...  Something is fishy about that to me.

       Maybe they should tell them an African-American male is on-site selling drugs to kids whilst weilding a firearm.  I imagine that would get some sort of response from law enforcement.  Because as far as I've seen and can tell, one officer went on site when a local news station was reporting and said they would turn it over to detectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the claims of the man in the video, DHS, ICE, and the FBI have all been contacted.  It may just be too soon at this point but there's been zero response from any of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, we shall sit around and see what happens.

       States such at 1:29.

      <p>
       So I guess it’s a grey area right now. are detectives looking into it further or are they the ones that determined there isn’t evidence of such? Or was that just TPD patrol officers that were preliminarily on the scene?

       I don’t see anything out there that states either definitively.

       That’s why an investigation would be reasonable considering it’s a camp with children’s belongings and blood on site. Human trafficking is real. This potentially could be a location associated with said crime, but we don’t know if we don’t look at suspect locations.

        Do you have a reasonable explanation for the restraints on the trees that one could understand it to be a "normal thing"?

       In the video, right where he points to the "restraints" (at about 2:15), you can clearly see a horizontal piece of wood that is being held by the
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       same types of straps that he's claiming are restraints. The evidence that those are straps for some kind of structure rather than restraints is
       <em>
        right there
       </em>
       in front of him. The rest of the junk he finds might not be "normal" in a broad sense, but nothing was really out of the ordinary for a homeless encampment.

       Real-life, professional investigators went in and said they found no evidence of human trafficking, but since these people have decided they won't accept any reasonable explanation (like the one for the "rape tree"), they're claiming the investigators are in on it, too. The only problem here is that they are
       <em>
        refusing
       </em>
       to accept any kind of logical explanation that doesn't support their conclusions.

       just a regular illegal alien camp folks, nothing out of the ordinary here. catch and release and let them go build houses for D R Horton and every other builder in the entire country, roads and bridges, then do landscaping for you after you buy the house they built

       Mistake #1...they should have staked it out and caught shit in action...instead they brought massive attention to it....if it was used for pedo crap etc....it won’t be again and they’re aware and are in ass covering mode with evidence/ trails leading to them.
