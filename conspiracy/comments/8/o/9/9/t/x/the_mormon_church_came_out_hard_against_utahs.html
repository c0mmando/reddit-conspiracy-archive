       The Mormon Church came out hard against the proposed initiative in Utah that would legalize medical marijuana. A few weeks later, financial docs are leaked which show that the Mormon Church has over a billion dollars invested in big pharma stocks. Interesting how they failed to mention that when they came out in opposition to the medical marijuana law. Looks like the church is protecting it's financial interests over what is best for sick people.

       The Bible is actually fairly critical of large hierarchical churches. But Mormons and Catholics generally care more about their institutions than anything God has to say.

       And they wonder why the younger generation isn't falling in line like the thousand years worth of patrons before them. Like its a fucking mystery. They have enough capital to float themselves for another hundred years or so before they fade into oblivion. It doesn't have to be this way, but they ever so insist.

       Because the plant is incredibly easy grow and if you used said plant correctly it can eliminate tons of different symptoms with no after affects. One of the biggest tactics of pharma is they cure one thing and create 10 others (which they happen to have pills for go figure right?) each doing the same so you’re stuck on this endless cycle, that plant is a one stop shop for most conditions and you wouldn’t necessarily need a middle man to have access to said medicine. In the states it’s legal they have had HUGE drop off in opiates and other pharmaceutical bullshit, plus  marijuana is completely affordable on our end when most “ medications” cost an arm and a leg and then actually cost you an arm or a leg.

       You said it's incredibly easy to grow. Not true unless you like garbage.. Probably true with what you're used to. What I work with in the Nor Cali hills is not easy by any means. It's exhausting. And we are true to it being perfect. Sun up till sundown solid hard work.

       Idk man. You never grew small scale? 1-2 1000 watts is perfect for a 10 plant grow for self use. There is plenty of videos on YouTube and weed forums that tell you everything you need to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I've done this and have done hydro and aero. You must be gorilla growin. I simply work from my garage that I basically cut in half for a makeshift grow room.
      </p>

       Ever watched the grow bible DVD? Gives great examples and the book itself is an AWESOME and very informative read.

       Also this is becoming an issue. I rather just grow my own knowing what I nutrients and other natural ways to kill pests affecting my crop(If it ever became a problem)

       Also I get paid to help people start and teach. Don't be the gatekeeper like the elite. Help people learn.

       Calaveras county area here, with our hot dry weather, its really not that hard to grow quality flower, obviously depending on how large a grow. A personal outdoor garden with 10 plants is a hobby, not a full time job.

       We have our own "conspiracy" theories. It's a land grab. These fees he paid the county was near extortion to grow that much, then they banned it immediately. It goes deeper. There are some folks with big money in power picking up properties as we speak. I'm moving to a different part of the industry now. Much better and safer

       Marijuana isn't a weed that anyone can grow. It's a plant that grows in many places whether you want to or not. Marijuana is a plant, that's all it is, from that perspective it's no different from a daisy or a dandelion. There's parts of the U.S. where it grows naturally because that's all it is, it's just a plant.

       Dude do you know what weeds are? They're plants that grow anywhere whether you want them to or not. They're the pests of plants. All you did was agree with the guy you replied to and confirm his point. If not for the law literally anyone would be able to grow it

       Medical marijuana isn't "prescribed" it's "recommended".  Marijuana is still a schedule 1 drug and as such can't be prescribed as medicine. It can't be patented as a drug, and it drug companies generally don't grow medicine as much as they synthesize it.  The chemical interactions in weed are too complicated to make a single chemical synthetic drug that does the job, if you look at the history of Sativex and Marinol you'll see why drug companies don't touch it.

       Well isn't most it not all of the medical benefits from marijuana the THC inside? If it became legal I don't see why pharma companies don't create edibles or at least pills with the dosage you need that's prescribed. It'd be weird to see Bayer branded weed but they could definitely make pills or something concentrated.

       Oh, no. CBD is just as if not more important than thc for pain relieving and epilepsy etc. Thc is the psychoactive part. There's other alkaloids that are of benefit too. Most dispensaries afaik have their weed tested so you can see the levels of certain alkaloids and make your choice accordingly.
      </p>

       I soo hope that the UK (where I'm from) gets its act together. I'm currently on a lot of meds including very strong opiates and using weed would cut my use of these meds drastically. Only issue is a regular supply of the suitable strains.

       Good weed is available, the problem is most dealers don't even know if they've got an Indica or a Sativa, let alone what strain it is. I have a few medical issues and so only buy weed when I can get a strain that would be beneficial.

       It really comes down to knowing what percentage THC vs CBD you have/need for your particular treatment, and without proper dispensaries, it's not likely anyone you're buying from will know offhand what exactly they have.

       That's because you don't get addicted to marijuana the same way you get addicted to other drugs. Most drugs, like oxy, nicotine, alcohol, make a person develop physical dependencies which is where a lot of withdrawal symptoms come from. With marijuana you can still get addicted but it's far more mental and is more like a bad habit than an addiction. You might feel heightened anxiety or slight depression if you cut out weed but you're far less likely to develop shakes, have your body shut down, or any of the other symptoms.

       Also a threat because its relatively easy to grow a large supply for oneself.  Once I started growing my own I never took another pill again.  That was 8 years ago.  They know everybody would do that rather than run to the pharmacy for their garbage.

       Dont talk to ANYONE about it and you will be safe forever.  Ive done jail time because of one error, telling the ex wife.  Grew for 3 years without a single hiccup in a nice suburb in UT til she gave the tip.  Get a good setup and dont use more than about 8kw of lights.

       I would really recommend you buy a piece of property for cheap that you can grow on legally and just do outdoor there.  Your ladies will thank you for the sunlight.

       agree, but they are really expensive and frankly I don't think they have the penetrating power they need.  Best indoor I have ever produced was in grown under hps and led mixed lighting.  Thats the way to go in my book.

       I don't want to piss on anyone's parade, but it sounds like you're implying that you've replaced all your medicine with kush. I don't think that's quite how that works. Marijuana helps with
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       conditions, but it's by no means a cure-all. Don't go into snake oil and magical crystals territory.

       I didn't imply that cannabis was an immediate cure all for all medical problems.  It was what taught me nature can handle anything we take pills for.  Cannabis replaced most of my meds, but that doesnt mean I didnt still have to find other plants to do what the ganja couldnt do.  Marijuana helps with
       <em>
        MOST
       </em>
       conditions, and gave me the confidence to look to nature for healing instead of pharmaceuticals.  Once I had that confidence I invested the time and research into learning herbology and filled the gap between most and all with other plants.  Pills suck, and we dont need pharmaceutical medicine at all, snake oils and crystals aside.

       No offense, but I honestly don't buy this alternative medicine stuff with natural remedies only. There's a very good reason why we have pharmaceutical meds, and it's not just about money. There are things you can't cure with herbs, and the things you
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       cure can usually be cured much more efficiently with synthetic medicine. Like it or not, but the moment where mankind started isolating, concentrating and even synthesizing the medicinal substances commonly found in nature was a huge step forward in medicine. It's partially thanks to synthetic medicine (especially antibiotics) that the average life expectancy soared in the last few hundred years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, I believe your hatred towards "pills" is misguided. Don't hate the medicine. Hate the companies that charge an arm and a leg for it. Or the shitty healthcare system that won't provide you with the medicine you need for an acceptable price. Without modern medicine, we'd be back in the Medieval times in terms of healthcare, like it or not.

       Not really, these days most of the money is in biologics (based in recombinant DNA technology) and synthetic drugs. Many early ones certainly came from plants and may still be in common use today but they are long since out of patent and therefore open to easy competition. This is why you can buy an insane number of different brands aspirin or ibuprofen for example. If marijuana had just been discovered they would be eager to patent it (or at least medication made from isolated compounds) and take advantage of their newfound bounty but since its been obviously in common use for years they can't do that (at least not to the raw, non GMO plant or simple AND common ways of using such as smoking or eating it though they could possibly patent a cannabidiol drug mix of some sort).

       Medical marijuana is considered not profitable to one corporation because one corporation can’t sell all the marijuana. You have to have the growers, the testers, the dispensary which all falls short of the corporate system for profit.

       This is a good answer and shouldn't have been downvoted.  I think you can make a corporate model on cannabis that is hugely profitable, but that is only because of the inflated prohibition price.  Without that there is too much labor involved in the process of seed to smoke.

       Does say that they are only denied if a substantial part of their activities are for attempting to influence legislation. Does most of the Mormon churches activities attempt to influence legislation? I'm not sure on that since I don't really care one way or the other. Seems like it would be an easy case if it were.

       This is false. It is ADVISED to not drink caffeine but is not a "commandment" of theirs. I live amongst the mormon community and this is one thing that always gets misconstrued.

       I don't see this at all, while i can't think of a single LDS member that drinks coffee, 90% of the membera i know in my family and at work drink soda/pop with caffeine in it, generally diet coke/dr. pepper/mountain dew.  Not that perhaps some one is disappointed, but shunned, seriously frowned on... never seen it with 2 decades of lds church under my belt.  Has it happened somewhere, yeah probably, but as a common response, nah, not in my experience in Utah, maybe further away from the base people are harder on each other? i would figure closer to the source/homebase people would be more explicit, not less, but that's my opinion.  My mother how traveled around the world as a LDS woman loved the people further away from Utah as they seemed more genuine compares to members in Utah. Always found that interesting.

       No you are just choosing to interrupt the word however you like, that is what every brainwahsed religious member is doing. You need to get out brother or sister. If you enjoy coffee, try out marijuana or LSD! Both are less addictive and less harmful to your body then caffeine since you are already doing drugs. Stay away from alcohol, and all those other schedule 1-2 drugs though they ruin lives.

       LMFAO.... oh god, my sides. I'm not an advocate against EITHER, but "if you like coffee" "try LSD" is a FUCKING hoot. Holy hell, how can you even suggest that. LSD is not comparable in function and should not be taken with such lightheartedness, regardless of its physical harm being nil. Just stop giving advice, please.

       Then maybe research the substance. I get more high from weed then 50ug of LSD or a half tab. And the 50ug of lsd keeps me level stable and pleasant to others for about a week. Weed keeps me pleasant and stable for like 6 hours :/. Caffine keeps me pleasant and stable for maybe 45mins.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me besides the obvious over consumption of a substance leading to drastically different effects;
      </p>
      <p>
       Caffeine; When I was abusing was 1300mg+ a day. My high would last for 5 mins tops after say a full monster, usually the big pop top cans about 3 a day. Was also taking caffeine pills, and drinking pre workout mix. I did not work out I played video games. This would lead to massively unstable moods, rage fits, constant headaches and chest pains, digestive issues not limited too trouble passing, bloody stool, and abdominal pains. You can tell me caffeine does not belong in the drug category and I will continue to disagree. There are OVERDOSES from caffeine consumption recorded yearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed; At my peek I smoke an 1/8th of flower and half a gram of wax daily averaged over the span of a month. Yes that is about an ounce a week of weed and an oz a month of wax. My budget for weed a month scrapes 700$ in a rec state with medical discounts. This too leads to side effects as some in here are honest enough to recognize. Paranoia in different forms is constant, and the mood stabilization is a double edge sword sometimes. I have literally no appetite sober and only sometimes get munchies when high, again a double edge sword. Also no recorded deaths of overdose by intoxication.
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD; Now here is the weird one. I have never felt the urge to take more then a single “dose” 100ug. And usually take less 50, or 10. I first starting using it because of micro dose research. But have never been able to actually accurately dose what is really considered “micro” and my “trips” have been less intense then mushrooms ever were or “dangerous”. And the after effects or side effects are non existent. But hey just like marijuana, there are no recorded deaths from intoxication from LSD.  Though plenty of psychosis cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey man they are not even in the same LEAGUE right ?

       I'm not sure you understood my point. It wasn't about any of the factors you brought up, I was making a comparison between the conscious altering effects. Any reasonable amount of Caffeine or Weed will not full blown tilt you and keep you up 12 hours like LSD can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now of course that's all dependent on dosing, sure...
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know I sure as fuck wouldn't be taking advice from someone who was dumb enough to abuse "1300+mg a day" of caffeine. I'm sorry to hear about your addiction issues.

       It comes from the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_Wisdom">
        "Word of Wisdom"
       </a>
       in the Doctrine and Covenants.  It is not written to explicitly say caffeine as when it was written such knowledge wasn't commonly available if at all, early 1800's i think caffeine was discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is anything that could be/is a vice is either extremely tought against use or explicitly forbidden.  During younger years in the LDS faith i have never ever ever seen someone lose a temple recommend or be shunned(this is not a common word used by LDS folk) by the leaders a ward, stake or top leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is and is pretty simple, if you are addicted or have vices you may not be prepared for might come whatever that is and having vices can ensure some degree of failure, be that smoking or whatever.  It is good to be in the most control over your mind and body, i was taught people make mistakes and that's the point of being here, the difference is what you do when and if you recognize the issues.

       I was brought up in utah, only 25 miles away from Salt Lake City and generally what I hear about peoples experiences I have never witnessed or heard of unless i was on the internet other then people doing bad things to kids/young adults, but that seems to be a people problem, not the religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       source: brought up in utah, live in utah, work with 80% of staff being active members of the lds chruch, haven't observed religion for 20+ years. Weird stories are weird.

       I would suggest you read the wikipedia link above, but as a sample, beer!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The revelation suggests that barley-based mild drinks (such as beer) may be permissible.  As recently as 1901, apostles Brigham Young, Jr. and John Henry Smith argued that the revelation did not prohibit beer.  However, LDS Church leaders now teach that consumption of any form of alcohol, including beer, violates the Word of Wisdom.

       Even that isn't
       <em>
        quite
       </em>
       true.  The word of wisdom never mentions caffeine.  The specific wording is "
       <em>
        hot drinks
       </em>
       are not for the body or the belly" and over the years the definition of "hot drinks" has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, hot cocoa and hot herbal tea are fine, iced coffee and tea are not.  These days even diet coke or full sugar sodas with caffeine aren't considered off limits for most practicing mormons.

         Churches can currently push for social issues, but cannot campaign directly for candidates and they like it this way. Around 10&amp;#37; of the mormon tithe alone could have funded a mormon backed candidate dollar for dollar against Hillary Clinton before any other conservative interest or church pitched in.

       That really is an interesting point. The church could finance its own candidate up to a billion dollars very very easily. Just 10% of their

       As far as I know, the staff and clergy pay income tax. However, the church itself doesn’t pay tax on offerings like other businesses pay sales tax on their revenue. Given the amount of community service local churches provide such as food and clothing donations, I don’t agree with taxing the churches. Plus I feel the government taking religious donations is a violation of the first amendment.

       All valid points. I come from shit hole Arkansas with a church on every corner. I even attend occasionally to make my mom happy. I have personally witnessed the work and effort small churches provide to the town. Many volunteers give their time and money to help better their communities. I am not an expert on tax law but I realize the people on payroll are paid solely on offerings and those people do actually pay taxes. “Sales tax” and property tax would negatively impact their efforts. I am agnostic atheist and do not believe the fairy tales but I am not so pessimistic as to not see what good things otherwise great people provide to struggling communities.

       Most the the mormon church's wealth is not actually in the church itself. They also have a corporation by their same name, and it is taxed as a corporation. This is why they can remain both a church/non-profit and be ridiculously wealthy. The sections of their organization that make the most money are taxed... though they use every legal loophole they can to avoid as much tax burden as they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also have a considerable amount of real-estate, which is privately traded between about a dozen top level members, but isn't actually owned by the church itself, so despite basically being "for the church" it isn't legally responsible for that real estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making the actual religious organization pay taxes would actually be a minisculely small pittance compared to the overall group's total wealth. It would do almost nothing.

       Separation of church and state was meant for the examples of state run or church run of the state like in the Anglican Church in the U.K. It was not meant to say no church could be invested in politics.

       I agree, religion should not be constrained from political speech or involvement but they should also not be supported through tax breaks. We should not have laws that enforce specific religious morality or that bans religious practice. I don’t give a fuck if your religious beliefs include sobriety or dietary restriction, keep it to yourself and stay the fuck off my lawn with that shit. If I want to smoke some pork or take a few marijuanas it is my own damn business, as long as I maintain productivity as a member of society no one is harmed.

       It's that way for a reason. History has shown that it works out poorly as taxes are used to opress unpopular religions. That's why we have the scheme we have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       But clearly we are seeing the other side of the coin here; the system is clearly being abused for profit. We need to come up with guidlines to differentiate between the religion itself and the massive endowments/PACs/etc. That they control that clearly should not be tax exempt.

       I have heard they also maintain controlling stock in a major rail road, and to a lesser extent Wells Fargo.  If I had sources I would sight them, however the information comes from both company men, as well as union railroad employees. Perhaps they can’t compete with the Catholic Church, but Mormons have always maintained highly sound business strategy to ensure deep pockets.

       It doesn’t have to be a conspiracy. They are invested in pharma because it’s a good investment. Marijuana is against their religion so even if they weren’t invested in pharma they would still campaign against it.

       They do not forbid caffeine. You can drink a Coke or a Pepsi just fine as a Mormon. IIRC, a bishop got in trouble for telling members that they were not allowed to drink caffeine in sodas. It is just coffee disallowed due to it's daily addictive nature.

       While spreading incorrect information.  Here's an explanation about the situation from u/grim_washington:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So here's the logic:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <ol>
         <li>
          The LDS Church owns the domains of several finance companies
         </li>
         <li>
          Therefore the LDS Church owns the finance companies
         </li>
         <li>
          Therefore the LDS Church owns ALL THE MONEY MANAGED BY THE FINANCE COMPANIES.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        While I suppose this is possible, it's making a few leaps.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <ol>
         <li>
          The LDS Church owns the domains of several finance companies.
          <strong>
           proven true
          </strong>
          -
         </li>
         <li>
          Therefore the LDS Church owns the finance companies.
          <strong>
           likely, but not proven. It may own a part, or all
          </strong>
         </li>
         <li>
          Therefore the LDS Church owns all the money managed by these companies.
          <strong>
           Almost certainly false. The requirement is that the company file form 13f if they're managing over 100 million dollars. That does not mean these companies OWN that money. They are literally financial managers - trying to help investors make more money.
          </strong>
         </li>
        </ol>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        These are businesses owned by the church like any other business, and they make profit like any other business. Their assets under management are NOT owned by the LDS church.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The big pharma claim of 1b is coming from this leak of 32b in assets which 17 financial management companies control.  You'll note the assumption is that the 32b in funds controlled by these financial companies for their customers is being assumed to be solely the LDS Church.  So OP is taking a leap of logic to conclude the LDS Church has 1b invested in big pharma, when the only info we know is that these financial management companies are controlling 2b worth of assets of various customers which may or may not be the LDS Church's money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, the LDS Church was fine with a medical marijuana bill in 2016 - bill SB 89.  So the LDS Church isn't even against medical marijuana, they are specifically against the current medical marijuana initiative as they feel it doesn't sufficiently regulate medical marijuana use.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a bunch of misinformation.

       Yes, the reason they were so against the proposed bill is they felt it was simply a legalization bill in disguise - very easy to abuse.

       Even if it is against their religion and there is no profit incentivr, they are clearly spending money for political purposes, and money spent in that way should not be shielded from taxes because of their religious status.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they wany to venture outside of religion and into politics to lobby for their beliefs that is totally fine, but they should have to pay taxes on that money just like everyone else.

       Utah represents a very tiny portion of the pharmaceutical market. Protecting that one state would do very little to preserve the profits of Big Pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, if they saw medical marijuana as a big threat to part of their investment portfolio they could, you know, just start divesting themselves of that portion of their portfolio.

       It’s brainwashing. If you grow up being told that something is true, and you’re only exposed to an approved narrative, it’s very easy to believe. Your mom, dad, Grandma, grandpa, friends, and everyone you know and respect constantly tells you that they
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       it’s true. The church strongly encourages members to “bear testimony” to each other often.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the strongest weapon they have IMO, is that they teach you from childhood that there is only one way to know truth, and that is through the “spirit” or “Holy Ghost”. Which basically means good feelings. So logic&lt;good feelings. So to true believing members, no amount of logic can overcome the good feelings they had at church one time.

       I mean I can understand why some aren’t. I no longer attend church but when I did the only money we had saved in the church fund was 10k. We had a policy to never keep more then that. All of our money went to pay the preacher and to help the needy. Did he file taxes? I don’t know. That’s completely on him.

       Please note:  I am not defending the church or their practices, at all.  But to clarify, they are a couple of different entities, they are the church, and then they are the corporation.  They don't pay taxes as a church, they do pay taxes as a corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       All money made off of these investments is taxed.  No tithing money was
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       used to make the investments (of course all of the money the church has
       <strong>
        <em>
         at one point was seeded by tithing
        </em>
       </strong>
       but they do now keep the two at arms length).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think all churches should be taxed, flat out, but until they are, I'm sure the church will legally keep the two entities separate, at least on paper and in the finance books.

       Isn't the Mormon people supposed to not use pharms? Maybe I am wrong but for some reason I have a memory if hearing about no pharms, caffeine, alcohol.

       No, Mormons are allowed to use drugs prescribed by their doctor. But caffeine, alcohol, tobacco are all against their creed. However, because they don't drink, smoke, or use caffeine, they also need another way to destress, so many Mormons are also on Zoloft, Xanax, and opiates. Salt Lake City has a huge opiate problem, and one of the highest psych drug prescription rates as well if memory serves.

       They also recruit the impoverished to their church hard. They want to be your savior, but are really the devil himself. Live near one of the largest Mormon populations in the world and they disgust me. Without a doubt, the most functionally 2-faced groups of people I have ever met.

       Ive been in the Mormon church subject to my Mormon parents for years and know the nicest most loving people that participate in the church. They dont “recruit” those in need, they do service for those in need. Maybe you could learn a bit from that?

       Here’s the problem with this theory - even if every Utah patient who could benefit from medical marijuana took it and completely stopped taking a pharmaceutical alternative made by one of these companies, there would be ZERO impact on these share prices.  Utah just isn’t big enough (less than 1% of the US population, and healthier than average), AND these companies all make lots and lots of products used for things medical marijuana wouldn’t affect (like shampoo and sunscreen and band aids), AND most of their medicines treat conditions marijuana doesn’t treat, AND a lot of their revenue comes from sales outside the US.  I’m sympathetic to the idea that religious organizations get away with things they shouldn’t, but there’s no logic to support this connection.

       I'm exmormon and cannot stand the vibe around r/exmormon, for example.
A lot of these people get more into anti-mormon advocacy than they ever were into Mormonism. I feel like the best way to be ex-anything is to stop focusing so much time &amp; attention on that thing.

       That’s a nice sounding phrase but utterly meaningless.

       Tesla has negative cash flow of a billion a quarter? And is not profitable. Who cares about Volvo.  As far as I’m aware there isn’t a single electric car that is profitable, chevy loses 8k on every volt it sells.

       Ford killed the electric car, even after Edison invented a brand new battery that was much better than old batteries.  Why? Cause it still sucked.  It still sucks today in comparison to the ICE. it isn’t a conspiracy it’s engineering.

       Don't entirely agree with OP. Mormon Church is extremely conservative. They have their own rules and ways of life. Money isn't the end all be all here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at Utah's bizarre liquor laws. You can't pour alcohol in front of the customer, it has to be done behind a screen or whatever. You've got polygamy going on in some parts. They don't even drink coffee for crying out loud. They don't behave like this for money, this has nothing to do with money. It's just their way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to this their little secret societies where they have these nicknames and meet to talk about the latest social issues they need to tackle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact they own stock in big pharma just means they are smart business people. Mitt Romney didn't get rich for no reason. That doesn't change the fact that they have 10 million rules for living because that's how they roll, and medical marijuana doesn't fit into their commandments.

       It has everything to do with religion, in the sense  that religion itself is a mode of social control and a means to profit for those within the clergy. Attention theists: fuck your rules, fuck your lies, and most of all, fuck your god. Swine, the lot of you.

       To be honest, I don't see anything wrong with that as far as I know, it's fine to oppose marijuana and support traditional medicine. Now I haven't followed the debate and
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       hard they opposed medical marijuana, so the issue might lie there. I don't know.

       Bro what you don’t know. Is they actually have medical grows.  A good friend of mine is a major player in the cannabis industry that lives up in Seattle. Well he’s been an advisor from them on there large scale grows.  The ownership doesn’t directly say Church of Latter Day Saints, but they’re theirs for sure.  There all about the money

       Not really defending the Mormon church....BUT....I’ve seen this narrative bouncing around several subs.  This has nothing to do with the money.  The Mormon church uses puts its money in the stock market, real estate, bonds, etc.   Their funds are heavily diversified.  I’m sure the plan is so they can keep building churches and temples etc until the end of the world...any day now lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the head line read “Mormon church has 3% of their stock market assets invested in American house hold goods companies, including some pharmaceutical companies” that would be a lot more accurate.  I totally agree that non profit (ie religious organizations) should not be allowed to use money to lobby or push a political agenda.  But in reality that is going to be a tough but to crack.  First step is to over turn citizens united.   Until then money is free speech, and we are stuck following the golden rule.  Those with the gold makes the rules.

       So I feel like this is my field of expertise as I am a mormon/smoker/conspiracy lover and while I do agree that this does like pretty shady you have to keep in mind a few things. 
1. The leaders of the Mormon church are experts in their fields, some doctors, some lawyers and they put aside their career to work with the church, those who do it full time get paid a wage that would be a fraction of what they were earning in their careers so they are not personally benefiting from these stocks.
2. As having a number who are experts in the field of medicine it makes sense for them to want to invest in pharma’s researching cures and medicines.
3. The stance against smoking weed is labeled out in the “word of wisdom” where you do not partake in addictive/habit forming substances (in b4 “weed isn’t addictive”). I can say easily that I’m addicted to smoking weed, not from any addictive substances but more addicted to the feeling, it is a demotivator and therefore the church continues to hold its stance against it just as it does with same sex marriage/alcohol etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR 
Although it looks shady I think their heart is in the right place.

       The “living allowance” church leaders are paid was $120,000 in 2014 according to leaked documents. You claim many of them are “leaders in their field” which seems arbitrary but even so $120,000 (which has probably gone up in 4 years) is more than a fraction and it all comes from financial investments according to the church

       These guys are basically working 24/7 travelling the world away from their families.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the example of Dallin H Oaks he was a justice in the Supreme Court, and then moved over to working full time with the church spending twice as much time away from his family to earn a lot less.

      <p>
       It isn’t a step up so if you are out for personal gain it would be a ridiculous decision. Not saying there’s nothing to see, you can decide for yourself. 
But (can’t find the source sorry) there’s already been investigations by journalists into the lds churches leaders to see if there was any evidence of money fraud and they take one look at these leaders homes and it says enough.

       Yeah. Umm. This isn't really new or anything. Long time ago, the church of matter day saints was firmly against drinking soda. Then, this magical thing happened, the church bought heavily into Coca-Cola stock. After that, soda wasn't bad anymore. And can you guess that any church owned or affiliated restaurants carried coke products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, the church wouldn't allow black people until they were sued, in the 1980s. Fuck, you couldn't even go into the temple unless you were white enough, ie brown was a no go.

       I live in Utah and the Mormon Church has investments to sustain all the properties they own and build worldwide. Church Buildings, Temples, welfare farms and facilities, charities, a handful of colleges besides BYU, Mission Homes, Seminary Buildings, Travel for the General Authorities world wide and the list goes on. Along with the building, upkeep and maintenance of all their properties they also provide a living for all of those in their employ, benefits and retirement. They manage the Church funds frugally and smart with investments like many other churches and organizations. The General Authorities make their own living and were mostly successful before their callings but live modestly. No one is living high on the hog using church funds. The current Prophet has a home in Midway, we lived not far from it. It is a normal modest home for a brain surgeon where they raised their large family. Please stop trying to create conspiracy theories about the Mormon Church. If you would like to look on their website it has all the charities, welfare missions, etc, listed. The Church teaches patriotism, the rule of law, and love of the constitution. Like all parts of society the Church also has it share of shady people who are members. And the break off Mormon groups have their own teachings that don't jive with the Mormon Church or the law. Please don't smear the Church with innuendo. Many of you who have retirement in 401 accounts are also invested in mass group accounts are in the same investments as the ones listed above. It's not wrong. Many of the patriots here and other places are good Mormons and are on the same side as everyone here.

       Every for profit church business ultimately only donates to the church for tax purposes and doesn't pay taxes because of the offset.

      <p>
       Of course thechurch non profit doesnt pay either.

       "Today MormonLeaks™ releases a compilation of information connecting the Mormon Church to 13 companies who collectively owned over $32 billion of shares in the United States stock market at the end of 2017."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is only 32 billion that has been found.
      </p>
      <p>
       These companies also donate their profits as contributions to the church.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect the church has 300 to 400 billion parked away in assests like land, buildings, companies, holdings and investments.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the late 1800s the goal was the for the church to do well and then not ask for tithing. Yet the members continue to pay because they THINK they are BLESSED FOR IT. LOL!

       Members do first of all because God commanded the paying of a tithe. The blessings come from obeying any and all commands of God. Some call it Karma, others, you sow what you reap, we call it the law of the harvest. All the same natural laws.

       Tithing is a false idea. Its from the old testament. Jesus never cared about tithing but the LDS Corporation church lobrs the tax free donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about all the bad financial woes and failure that happen even though a member does pays tithing. Oh, they call those trials. Financial disasters while following God's rulebook is somehow supposed to help someone spirutuallym.
 Nobody highlights the failures in Sacrament meeting testiminials shared. Only the good things that a member connects in their own mind that was coincidental but the member self programs to make the rxperience a tithing blessing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tithing is just a foolish person bondage parting with their money.
      </p>
      <p>
       If tithing was a real principle and gave blessings then church going tithe givers should be some of the most happy and successful folks on Earth bathing on blessings and good luck. Yet they are not.  Oh that's right ..only the meek shall inherit the Earth...so the bible says Bwahaha..such rubbish!

       Which I've always suspected might be connected to the church's stances against homosexuality, caffeine, alcohol, therapy, sex before marriage and logical thinking. So they keep the membership depressed, then invest in Big Pharma. Nice business model.

       I remember this being a thing when I used to hear about the Morman church, it was seen as a sin to have anything with caffeine for a long time. I had Morman friends that would have to comment about how they are not allowed to have soda. I accepted as if they were closer to Quakers or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then one day out of the blue it was okay for them to have Coca-Cola products. A bit specific. I heard later on that the church had established financial ties to Coca-Cola that year.

       Traditionally, I'd expect the Christian community to be more for medical marijuana than for big pharma. Greed for profit may be popular in mainstream Christianity, but certainly not traditional. Satan wins a large majority of the battles, but he won't win the war!

       Regardless of the true intentions and motives of the Mormon community the facts are still the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smoking Marijuana is a toXin to Your lungs, cardiovascular system and a toXin to Your nervous system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smoking Marijuana is a danger to the child that a man or a woman produces, causing health problems for the child in its mental and physical development.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in children and young adolescent adults, Smoking Marijuana is very dangerous. If You smoke enough Marijuana You cannot operate anything technical and it is dangerous to drive or do anything such as driving or mechanical operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You wait for some time to pass while You " Come Down " from Your high. Alcohol is the same, same health risks if You drink large and frequent amounts of alcohol You will risk Your organs health and also is dangerous to the health of a baby in the womb.
      </p>
      <p>
       However with alcohol - it is totally legal, people do not go to prison or get into any trouble for having an unopened case of beer or an unopened bottle of whiskey in the trunk or back seat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore people tend to abuse and overdrink and even drink and drive because it is completely legal to possess alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Colorado, The 2013-16 period saw a 40 percent increase in the number of all drivers involved in fatal crashes in Colorado, from 627 to 880, according to the NHTSA data. Those who tested positive for alcohol in fatal crashes from 2013 to 2015 — figures for 2016 were not available — grew 17 percent, from 129 to 151.
      </p>
      <p>
       By contrast, the number of drivers who tested positive for marijuana use jumped 145 percent — from 47 in 2013 to 115 in 2016. During that time, the prevalence of testing drivers for marijuana use did not change appreciably, federal fatal-crash data show.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the numbers probably are even higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       State law does not require coroners to test deceased drivers specifically for marijuana use in fatal wrecks — some do and some don’t — and many police agencies say they don’t pursue cannabinoid tests of a surviving driver whose blood alcohol level is already high enough to charge them with a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I never understood how we’d pass a law without first understanding the impact better,” said Barbara Deckert, whose fiancée, Ron Edwards, was killed in 2015 in a collision with a driver who tested positive for marijuana use below the legal limit and charged only with careless driving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana should be more regulated IF the government wants to make it legal, the government should crack down on DUIs just like they do with Alcohol.

       Sounds like standard reddit-fare actually. Just have to know the right buttons to push, even if the information is misleading.

       Dont talk to ANYONE about it and you will be safe forever.  Ive done jail time because of one error, telling the ex wife.  Grew for 3 years without a single hiccup in a nice suburb in UT til she gave the tip.  Get a good setup and dont use more than about 8kw of lights.

       I would really recommend you buy a piece of property for cheap that you can grow on legally and just do outdoor there.  Your ladies will thank you for the sunlight.

       I find the best place to get seeds is from Britain, there's a few good sites listed in their sidebar. Get a small growlight off amazon and start off with autoflower plants. After that, work up to bigger things.
