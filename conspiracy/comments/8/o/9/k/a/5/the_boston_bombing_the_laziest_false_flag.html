        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On Monday, April 15, 2013, a pressure cooker went off towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring hundreds. The FBI quickly identified the Tsarneav brothers as suspects through video footage. According to official reports, the Tsarneav brothers were radicalized online by their extreme Muslim beliefs. They personally designed a sophisticated pressure cooker bomb, planted the bomb, and set it off. </p>

<p><strong>The Real Story:</strong></p>

<p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a Confidential Informant (CI) for the FBI who was coerced into operating a false flag operation. Ok, buckle up because we need to wade through Tamerlan&#39;s prior extensive history with the FBI and other attempted cover ups.</p>

<p><strong>March 2011- Tamerlan&#39;s first encounters with the FBI</strong></p>

<p>Tamerlan met with FBI officials as early as March 2011. The FBI opened a file on Tamerlan in March because Russian officials warned the FBI that Tamerlan may be connected to Islamic extremism. In June 2011, The FBI abruptly closes its file on Tamerlan. However, it&#39;s likely that the FBI cut a deal with Tamerlan and coerced him into being an FBI patsy</p>

<p><strong>September 11, 2011- Waltham triple homicide</strong></p>

<p>On this date, the police found three men with their throats cut in an apartment in Waltham. One of the men, Brandon Mess, was Tamerlan&#39;s best friend and sparring partner at his boxing gym. The three bodies were covered in marijuana that had been sprinkled over them. Further, the alleged perpetrators left behind nearly $5,000 in cash. No one has ever been convicted of these crimes. After the Boston Bombing, the FBI attempted to tie these murders to Tsarneav, but later admitted it had no actual evidence to do so. Instead, the FBI committed this egregious act to send a message to Tamerlan: don&#39;t act out of line or there will be consequences. I don&#39;t think the FBI specifically knew it would use Tamerlan in a false flag operation at the time, but the Bureau certainly sent a message to the young man. </p>

<p><strong>October 2011- July 2012</strong></p>

<p>Russian officials again warn the US that Tamerlan is a radicalized Jihadist. In response, the government ceremoniously adds him to two different terror watch lists, including the no-fly list. Despite these additions, Tamerlan is able to fly back to Russia in January 2012 and return six months later without problems from customs. The United States chalks this mistake up to a spelling error on their terrorist watch list. However, their behavior is suspiciously similar to how agencies treat their Confidential Informants. They pay their dues by placing them on the appropriate list but give them special privileges. It&#39;s also uncertain how a 25-year-old living on welfare was able to pay for his flights to Russia.</p>

<p><strong>April 15, 2013- The Watertown Lockdown</strong></p>

<p>After the bombing, the Tsarneav&#39;s allegedly robbed a 7-ll, shot MIT officer Sean Collier, hijacked a vehicle, and made a dramatic escape. During their escape, Tamerlan was killed in a shoot out with the police. Dzhokhar made it to Watertown, Mass, and an unprecedented manhunt ensued. FBI agents ignored constitutional rights and ordered citizens to stay inside. They entered homes without warrants hunting for the man. Eventually, Dzhokhar was found in a boat and arrested. However, the residents of Watertown had to endure the complete loss of constitutional rights while the rest of America cheered on the police. </p>

<p><strong>April 18, 2013- Daniel Morely&#39;s Arrest</strong></p>

<p>The Bomb was a complex device so its hard to believe the Tsarneav brothers acted as lone wolf terrorists. Further, as Dzhokhar&#39;s lawyer pointed out in trial, the bomb-making location was never identified. On the morning of April 15, Daniel Morely, a disgruntled ex-MIT employee, left his mother&#39;s house for a few days without explanation. After a domestic abuse confrontation on April 18, the FBI arrived at his mother&#39;s house and made an astonishing discovery in Morely&#39;s room: several bags of fertilizer, a pressure cooker, Thermite, and instructions on designing a bomb detonator. Despite the 9-11 call being a domestic abuse charge, the FBI appeared at Morely&#39;s house, not local police. Morely also bears a striking resemblance to CCTV footage of the man who robbed the 7-11 and shot Officer Collier. On June 9, 2013, Morely was arrested and charged but his charges were dropped without him seeing a courtroom. Morely spent the next two years in various mental health facilities before being released in June 2015, the same month Dzhokhar was sentenced to death. In my opinion, Morely designed the bomb for the government as a false flag in exchange for leniency on previous charges and cut a deal with the FBI to sell out Tamerlan.</p>

<p><strong>May 2013- The Murder of Ibragim Todashev</strong></p>

<p>Ibragim Todashev was murdered in May 2013 during an interrogation by FBI officer Aaron McFarlane. Ibragim was Tamerlan&#39;s good friend and sparring partner for MMA. Ibragim was shot seven times, including a fatal shot to the head. McFarlane claims that, during routine questions, Ibragim became enraged and lunged at him with a metal pole. In a lawsuit, Ibragim&#39;s estate showed that Ibragim was recovering from a knee surgery at the time and could not have lunged at the officer. McFarlane also had multiple open lawsuits for negligence surrounding him at the time of the murder. In my opinion, Ibragim was coldly gunned down because he knew something the FBI didn&#39;t want out.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The FBI perpetrated the Boston bombing as a false flag operation and murdered at least five ppl to keep it under wraps. The story that the Tsarneav&#39;s were lone wolf extremists falls apart quickly once examined. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off i wasnt trying to answer anything? I was asking questions? And secondly, you mean o tell me that you wouldnt let FBI agents break into your house if it means helping them find a terrorist? Trust me im very into conspiracys, but this belief of literally everyone being against you is one that i do not agree with. The FBI and other officials were doing their job to find the terrorist, so i would gladly open my door and allow thme to come in if it meant speedingup the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, are you being serious? Not only would I not be ok with them being able to say &quot;terrorist&quot; and trespass on my private property, invade my privacy, and violate my Constitutional Rights. If they tried, I would react exactly the same as I would to a home invasion; if I was killed in the process then that&#39;s that, but if anything happened to them I wouldn&#39;t be charged, or if I was I&#39;d have it thrown out.</p>

<p>You must be British... If not, if you&#39;re American, please find out what the Constitution is and why it&#39;s important; also why it&#39;s a slippery slope to create conditions where rights can be violated. What if the police suspect you of something but can&#39;t provide sufficient evidence for a warrant? Could they just say they&#39;re looking for a terrorist and go in? Do they have to prove they weren&#39;t lying? When and to whom? Right then before they enter, later after they&#39;ve already gone in? Do they have to prove it to you, or their boss who would protect them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I’m a little late to the party, but hate this dude and anyone like him, who read the same name of a girl he went to school with in a paper, and believes he can debunk conspiracy theories.  However, I really DO or did know or know of quite a few victims.  So all I know for a fact, is that injuries were not faked.  (We jokingly refer to one friend’s F150 he ‘inherited&#39; from his step mother after she had her leg blown off as the the F1Fund).  Further another example actually being one of the deceased, she worked with my best friend, and hung around with her older brother growing up.  (A quick google search can actually verify and lead you to the obvious conclusion of which victim).  And so there were certainly real people not only effected but killed by the bombs that day.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s one of those things you have to just take my word for, which I don’t expect you to easily do.  However, those things are unfortunately  facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The murder of Tamerlan&#39;s friend by fbi officer Mcfarlane is one of the most obvious signs of a cover up. </p>

<p>Some info on officer Mcfarlane: he came from the corrupt Oakland PD. he had a history of falsifying police reports, issuing false arrests, and refusals to cooperate in court trials. Also, he was receiving paid disablity benefits from Oakland PD during his &quot;employment&quot; with the fbi.</p>

<p>Not the kind of guy you would want to invite into your home to in order to be interrogated for five hours. After five hours of &quot;interrogation&quot;, the fbi says Todashev lunged at them with a knife. Later the story changed to &quot;he lunged with a metal pole&quot;.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and after the fbi gets sued, once again, for their &quot;negligence&quot; in this case, guess what? you the taxpayer get to front the bill in the amount of millions of dollars.</p>

People will believe any incident where &quot;Muslims&quot; are the supposed perpretators even if the evidence doesn&#39;t hold up. They can literally just blame any attack on &quot;those scary Muslims&quot; and thanks to the media everyone will believe it hook line and sinker, even if no evidence is presented at all. Cue more and more of our rights being eroded away for &quot;national security&quot; reasons. The Western world is going to turn into a police state, and the people will cheer it on.
