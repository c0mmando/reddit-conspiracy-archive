       I highly doubt it's a conspiracy. In fact it's been pushed so hard on this sub lately that it's starting to just seem like some dead end discussion they want us to have.

       I am not talking of some bizarre conspiracy. I was thinking more on the lines of a political conspiracy. What would the administration, Trump and republicans achieve politically by this situation.

       A distraction from what, could you explain? Yeah, she doesn't like being the first lady that's for sure. Isn't it true that initially even Trump himself hadn't anticipated that he'll win? Must have shell shocked Melania that she'd be the first lady.

       It has happened four times.  Once getting off AF1 the day before his inauguration, twice on the south lawn heading to the marine one helicopter, and once at an airport in Tel Aviv.  At which of those is it inappropriate to hold hands?

       Its odd she hasn't made a public appearance but I think the truth is that she simply wants a break from the spotlight. Even though a divorce would be hilarious, I would suspect if they were in serious talks of one it would have been leaked by now.

       Personally I find it incredibly strange that in the times of social media, she wouldn't as much as post a picture of herself to shut everyone up, or to placate the people. I am not sure that there is an extraordinary conspiracy going on, but something is definitely off seriously.

       Yeah, I doubt we'll see a picture. I think proving she's still alive to a handful of leftist conspiracy theories is pretty low on the priorities list. Also, given the general disorder of the Trump White House, anything serious would certainly have been leaked by now.

       I think there are more than a handful of people concerned about this. I am from Europe and I saw it on the news online here. And what about her general activity, that's been nil as well. The question is, would USA have reacted the same to any other first ladies doing the same?

       Seriously. There's something massively wrong here. The Trump brigade will obviously fight you tooth and nail, but, again, look into Martha Mitchel. This seems very much like what happened to her.

       That's great. You're welcome to pray for their well being. At the same time, you're welcome to give your input on this situation. It doesn't matter whether you're a republican or a democrat, certainly you must find it odd the Melania hasn't being seen or heard from for almost a month?

       Are you joking?  If someone tried something on Trump he'd never be able to keep it a secret.  He's Already the single most persecuted man j. American history and makes no qualms about reminding us that everyone is out to get him.  If someone legit tried to hurt him?  He'd be tweeting while the doctors were checking him out.

       POTUS has his own security. NSA warned security detail and driver was removed. Yes I carry concealed  because I have a license. Anyone can carry openly in the US but every business will tell you to leave or conceal it. As long as you don't have a Felony &amp; you are a citizen you can pass the test to get a license for conceal and carry for $100.

       That would so strange if it were true. What if she died during surgery. In retrospect, Trump's and White House's current reactions would seem so surreal. A bit like when Princess Diana died and the Queen was acting so fishy.

       gad zooks some of the comments, i guess i don't find it odd. she has never been much in the limelight since the beg, i think she is a pvt person, and protects her son like a mama bear. ithink all this gossip/truth whatever has been very hard on her, she is probly biding her time i suspect .

       Even though she has a very reserved nature (partly because no one ever anticipated Trump to actually win and this first lady role got thrusted upon her suddenly), I think she has enough smarts to know that her absence is causing a lot of negative speculation. For her to not react in a forthcoming manner is what makes this very interesting for me.

       Also that tweet was fishy. But I love conspiracies so what do I know :)

       I doubt if this was it. Her character is that she knows she is in a sugar baby/daddy relationship with Trump. She is selfish as well (in a normal way) and don't think is the type to kill herself for something like getting too much attention. If she did try to commit suicide, Trump would have played his sympathy card long ago. He is not the one to wait. What is fishy is that something IS happening and miraculously Trump is keeping his large mouth shut about it, that's the real brow raiser here.

       Huckabee amazes me every time, the way she deflects and denies is an art in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Melania goes, she was enjoying her ideal life - being married to a provider who gives her expensive bags, dresses and shoes. In return she just needed to be a trophy. Now suddenly being thrust into this extremely prominent and hard working role of the first lady, she probably hates this. As with most sugarbabies, hard work is not exactly what they are in love with.

       She didn't travel to camp David with Trump this weekend, she isn't travelling to Quebec next week for the G7 and she isn't travelling to Singapore for the first summit between Now Korea and the USA.

      <p>
       It doesn't mean anything nefarious but  I have to wonder if the release of Trump's financial records showing he gave Cohen the money to pay off Stormy Daniels and get her to sign a NDA to not go on TV and day she was sleeping with Trump shortly after Melania gave birth to Trump's son might have made her super mad at him.

       Absolutely could be true. But given that she is a smart and selfish (in a normal way)woman, and that she always knew her and Trump had a sugar daddy/ baby relationship - I doubt she ever expected loyalty from Trump. In her own way, Melania is smart enough to know the real character of Trump. She always supports him in public because that's part of the sugar arrangement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a few women in such relationships with high profile people, they all know what they are in for and what they will get in return.

       She knew he was a cheater but she had no clue she would become first lady and have that become a world wide story.  Don't just consider  her feelings about the cheating and the scandal think about how she feels her son learned about all this on the the evening news.  Did Trump tell Baron none of this was true, did she tell Baron none of this was true?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking for a juicy conspiracy go Google Nixon beats wife during Watergate and how Nixon's attorney general John Newton Mitchell kidnapped his own wife during Watergate because Nixon's inner circle believed she had plans to leak information to the press. And then ask yourself if the past is repeating itself.

       Oh damn, didn't know anything about the whole Watergate beating up fiasco. Gotta read up on it tonight.

      <p>
       As far as Baron goes, how he takes this news depends on what type of a kid he is or if he even receives negative news at all. Is he old enough to realize the type of marriage his parents have? Would it really matter to him if his father was sleeping around or is he taught that this is normal behaviour for rich people. Look at Eric and Don Jr., they certainly don't seem like down to earth, normal individuals (nothing wrong in being privileged). But imagine if it were young Eric or young Don Jr. finding out Trump was sleeping around, I think we can estimate their reactions. And from that we can infer that Baron probably doesn't care, in my humble opinion.

       Although I distrust room on some level.  He seems to be the guy who started the rumour of the Trump elevator tape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump Jr didn’t speak to his father for a year after the highly publicized divorce of his parents, New York magazine reported in a 2004 article about the Trump children.  He was 12 years old at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some facts here and a lot more gossip but I don't think this family is like any other family and now that they are under a media spotlight and under legal scrutiny things that wouldn't have bother them 5 years ago might cause someone like Melania to snap.

       Nixon later said that Watergate never would have happened without her.

       Your thread is great.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why the absence of Melania doesn't get more notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's beyond creepy. Even when she shows up, it will never explain why we weren't told what happened. The First Lady can't just vanish without a word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome to the Martha rabbit hole. She was a hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole Trump thing seems like they're going out of their way to be far worse than Nixon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, his numbers are actually up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you view the current situation as is, the republicans are just complicit, across the board. They need to go. Their efforts are, always, to reduce voter turnout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women alone could completely change everything in the next election. They've just got to show up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's Martha Mitchell, as I'm sure you found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thom Hartmann is the smartest person in media. Give him a listen. He was making the connection from Melania to Martha the other day.

       That's not what a sugar daddy / baby relationship is.  That's just two adults getting married for pretty normal reasons.  Almost all women over 30 consider money when choosing a mate, and almost all men at any age consider beauty when choosing theirs.

Id be REALLY surprised if she expects Trump not to cheat on her... TBH, I'd be surprised if she was never in a threesome with him and another model.

       she threatened to leave and this is simply unallowable. i said this in another post here, but maybe she reached some kind of alimony/payoff deal in which she will stay away/stay quiet until some time in the future (maybe even after his term?) to prevent political ramifications

       This is what first came to my mind as well. That the most common reasons why celebs go MIA. However, she could have done what other celebs do in such cases - take many pics doing random stuff in advance, even of a fake recovery from the kidney operation .. and slowly release the pics during this MIA time. No one doubts a thing and everyone is none the wiser. Like a lot of Youtubers going through surgeries they don't wanna talk about make Youtube videos in advance and release them periodically- so the fans never know they are actually gone. But Trump's administration is so daft, I doubt they thought it through.

       She told the John that she was going to divorce him and take the kid with her. She's currently in a straightjacket at a CIA blacksite being reprogrammed. She'll be good as new in a few days and no one the wiser.

       I was thinking about this and it occurs to me that if my wife was president it would take about two weeks for me to come to the conclusion this isnt my fault, fuck this. Security, press coverage, photo sessions, meet and greets with repulsive donors. I am disgusted by the actions of this administration, and every administration in my lifetime, but in no way would I speculate as to the behavior of someone who appears to be above board and may be sick of this shit. People should cut her some slack.  She deserves her privacy.

       Ok, the fact is that she is MIA for almost a month now. No one has seen or heard from her. The tweet 'she' sent out had Trump undertones to it. What is your opinion on these things?

       The latest I've heard is that Melania has not joined her family at Camp David this weekend, and does not plan on joining her husband in Singapore on the 12th, which is more than a month after her operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Melania hasn't posted any photos of herself on Twitter when previously she did so frequently, I wonder if something has changed about her appearance. That leads me to speculate three possibilities, but I have to stress that these are pure speculation with no evidence. The first guess is plastic surgery. An operation might come with complications like infection.  Second guess, she got beat up real bad by Donald in a fit of rage and needed reconstructive surgery. This would explain the hospital stay and not joining her husband when he travels. Third, an assassination attempt. Remember the change in Viktor Yushchenko, he developed chloracne after he was poisoned with TCDD in 2004. This would be something the White House may want to keep under wraps for now but I'm not sure if Donald Trump could keep quiet about it.

       I think it could definitely be some surgery complications. In that case The White House should ideally just say there were some problems with the surgery (of course pretending that it was the kidney surgery).
      </p>
      <p>
       The second scenario, does Trump have a history of domestic abuse? If not, then this theory is a weaker one. If yes, then wow! What a terrible thing for her to go through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh hell yeah, I remember the Viktor fiasco, the guy turned purple and riddled with acne and much worse in a few weeks. However, politically speaking - would it favor Trump to hide or to reveal Melania's poisoning?

       Older plastic surgery sometimes need touch ups/updates. Typically someone who had has stuff done goes back for more later. I've been saying plastic surgery for a while. No proof but I think it's the most logical guess.

       Late last night there were reports Melania would attend an event for gold star families today, but press wasn't invited. So maybe someone will provide evidence that she is still alive.

       Well, I just checked my post history and 43 days ago I noticed an uptick in Melania stories. Just weird things that seemed to be out there to discredit and demean her, but out of nowhere. Back then I said I wouldn’t be surprised if a big Melania story is coming up, and here we are. Whatever happened, it started a couple weeks before her ‘surgery’.

       That's interesting. I find it so bizarre that the first lady is 'missing' and so many people are so cool about it. Imagine if Michelle Obama went MIA like this, would have been a whole other story.

       Yeah, you know what else I think is weird is that this all happened right around the time the story broke of the raid on Trumps medical files. Apparently, Bornstein also treated Melania. I wonder if her files were part of the raid. And it’s weird that that story would break out of nowhere right before the First Lady is treated for a medical condition that keeps her out of view for three weeks now.

       This is actually the first post about it in this sub that hasn't been massively downvoted. I've been kind of interested in this story but didn't want to comment because everyone who said anything was being attacked for it.

       Did you see the latest announcement that she won't be attending the G7 summit in Quebec or the North Korean summit in Singapore either? G7 starts on the 8th and the North Korea one isn't until the 15th I think so that's potentially two more weeks without making a public appearance.

       tbh, as a health care worker, it doesnt surprise me if a kidney procedure took her out of the lime light for this long. because you arent just recovering from a little slicin' and dicin', kidney disease a long term, permanent thing in most cases... we dont know what sort of complications she may be recovering from, or if shes in kidney dialysis... dialysis is typically 3-5 days a week, for 4-6 hours a day... sometimes more. it doesnt sound fishy to me that its taken her multiple months to recover.
      </p>
      <p>
       however, ive always had empathy for her and i agree that she must be in some distress over the political drama that has suddenly become her life.

       Actually if you look through my post history, I am a kidney disease patient undergoing dialysis :) If she is on dialysis, there would be a tube sticking out of her neck for the first 6 weeks and then a very visible scar on her hand plus needle marks (typical dialysis needles are 15G in thickness - thicker than a naked pencil lead) on her arm. I wont wish kidney disease on anyone ;(
      </p>
      <p>
       It was in the news that she had an embolism in/near the kidney. She could be suffering from complications resulting from this surgery. But why won't the White House and everyone just come clear with what's happened to her, you know. Everyone knows kidney disease is vicious, John Oliver even did a segment on dialysis so people know more about it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it hard to have empathy for her. She did choose a sugardaddy and not the hard worker's route of life. She is a smart woman and certainly knows what a sugar daddy/ baby relationship entails. Also, I always give spouses of politicians a big margin to make errors as they are all being dragged in the ugly politics unwillingly. But I was disheartened to see Melania defend Trump over the pussy video tape. Had she stood up for women that time, everyone would have understood and respected her. But I disagree when people call her abusive names or call her dumb.

       a lot of my patients have dialysis ports that are easily hidden... not always obvious. it seems like i see her in a lot of long sleeves too.

       What do you mean by dialysis ports? Do you mean the tube? That would be rather noticeable in her fitting dresses. Her fistula might not be ready yet(takes minimum 6 weeks to mature), so if she is on dialysis - she has a catheter.

       That's nonsense. As someone who is on a transplant list and with kidney issues, one kidney is enough for keeping a person alive. Please don't spread misinformation like this. Or give proof with linking studies to make your point.

       okay, but nothing i said was about dying, or implying it waant possible to live. i said the lack of a kidney was detrimental to a persons health in a way that affects other organs... you have one kidney and are on dualysis. you proved my point.

       Umm what? I have no kidneys.

      <p>
       And no, lack of just one kidney doesn't effect the good health of a person. If you think it does, link the research paper in your next comment or shut up.

       Yeah, insults, and no actual insight into why you think she is going through hemodialysis. Now, it may hurt your feelings, but you really do have no clue whatever Melania is having done. I as a doctor, just think the odds of her getting HD after a surgical procedure related to her kidney is something rare. The largest reasons by quite some distance people need HD are due to non surgical disorders, DM and HTN being the leading causes. So that would lead me to infer that you are a fat slob with DM and HTN who doesn't take care of yourself. Yes, I voted for Trump, and take a look in the mirror you're the chump.

       Hmm, the 'gift' from the American prisoners idea seems interesting, far fetched, but interesting. Imagine if NK would go Walter White poisoning the mexican kid on Melania. Oof, tragic.

       As far as the kidnapping goes, I don't buy this one. Simply because I would presume that the American special security is not nearly as incompetent as the White House. They won't let anything happen to the first family.

       At this point I wouldn't be surprised if Trump is actually asking Melania to keep this up. It's an easy distraction for him to keep up. The more people dedicate to Melania-gate, the less time they spend on actual stories. Y'all distract yourselves.

       She had some work done and is recovering. She just doesnt want to be scene because it is still noticeable. A nose job would explain it. That way if something went wrong they can say "see we said it was surgery" .

       Yes. They talk about pizza, note there is not a single use of the phrase Cheese Pizza once, several times over years worth of emails. So spooky and weird. Why would old non internet savvy people use a term made up on 4chan? It makes no logical sense. I think all pizzagators are idiots. Belief in pizzagate requires astonishing levels of willful ignorance and idiocy.

       Na. The toxic thinking is the kind that enables people to believe literally anything as long as it feels good to you. Ther was never a single piece of evidence for pizzagate but it felt real to you. So you beliebed it. Only an idiot does that.

       I fully agree with you on that one.  PG is a real conspiracy of people trying to create a directed political attack on their political enemies through the use of lies and manipulated truths, all under the common virtue signaling(if I’m using the correct term) of “but think about the children!!!”.

       I think this is a place to discuss conspiracies, not just accept everything everyone says as fact without question.  If a theory has holes, people should be free to discuss them in a polite way without having their character attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of new visitors here due to current news talking about major political conspiracies and coverups and I think those people should be welcomed just as much as t_d members were welcomed here by the mods a while back.  Maybe they don’t subscribe to every theory proposed and post questions while at the same time walking away with a little more exposure to things they might otherwise miss from their normal sources of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, assholes should be treated in kind and discouraged from participating should they attack other posters and/or engage people in an impolite manner.  This sub shouldn’t have a hive mind mentality where posters have to think the same way about every conspiracy theory and should be a place where people feel comfortable speaking freely.  Things should be questioned and holes pointed out because it can lead to great discussions, but that questioning shouldn’t be conflated with attacks or dissing conspiracies.

       No idea why anybody actually thinks they are even married, or Baron is even hers.

       For all you know she is just there, just to be in front of cameras.

       The theory is, she is in a relationship with someone else.

       Even though she has a very reserved nature (partly because no one ever anticipated Trump to actually win and this first lady role got thrusted upon her suddenly), I think she has enough smarts to know that her absence is causing a lot of negative speculation. For her to not react in a forthcoming manner is what makes this very interesting for me.

       She knew he was a cheater but she had no clue she would become first lady and have that become a world wide story.  Don't just consider  her feelings about the cheating and the scandal think about how she feels her son learned about all this on the the evening news.  Did Trump tell Baron none of this was true, did she tell Baron none of this was true?

       If you're looking for a juicy conspiracy go Google Nixon beats wife during Watergate and how Nixon's attorney general John Newton Mitchell kidnapped his own wife during Watergate because Nixon's inner circle believed she had plans to leak information to the press. And then ask yourself if the past is repeating itself.
