       Obviously they can’t do this overnight as the shock would be far too great and it would never work. So what they’re doing is slowly getting us used to having no control. Slowly, subtly, year after year.
      </p>
      <p>
       More automation, more self-driving cars, more online shopping, more restrictions on privacy and freedom, less jobs, more monthly state allowance, less cash, more digital, microphones on everything, cameras on everything. Poison in our foods. Poison in our water. More metal detectors, more militarized police, more fear porn news networks, more stereotyping and division, more complacency and wasting time with entertainment, and this is all leading towards their end game; microchips in humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are subconsciously preparing us for the New World Order so when it is finally fully implemented, it won’t be jarring at all as everyone will already be used to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we die off, more and more people will be born  into this world where everything listed above is ALL they know. They won’t know it wasn’t always like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they get the chips in us, they will have total control over humanity. They will have enslaved us forever.

       1991 was the start. Remember Old "Skull and Bones" Freemason G. H. Bush NWO speech ?

      <p>
       1991 saw also the first Gulf War, the first war "Christian" troops fight Islamic people directly again since the last Crusade ended in 1291.

       The microchip is the kicker, it'll likely be mandatory 10 years after it's release. Obviously it's gonna receive backlash in the beginning until "accidents" that could've been prevented by the chip start happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about all the reasonable benefits for a microchip, the media will slam these in your throats until you're convinced 
-Permanent GPS (in case anyone goes missing)
-Complete medical files in case of emergency
-Passport
-Accurate ID
-Criminal record
      </p>
      <p>
       It's scary to think about but I guarantee parents will put it in their kids for "safety" and then those kids will think it's normal to have a chip in your head, eventually it'll just be the norm

       Beautiful argument right there. Sounds like the Frankfurt school. I agree with you 100%. I would just say it is not a subconscious process anymore. It is very conscious and only People like us who dare stop for a while and think about what is happening around us that notice that.

       Adorno, culture industry. It basically explains how culture and all products are simulated differences and the difference is actually so benign and menial but we place importance on it and get distracted by the little things whilst our critical thought is gradually worn down.

       The Frankfurt School (Critical Theory) is a sociological and philosophical movement originated in Frankfurt who basically criticizes not only the modern and capitalist society and mass culture but also the way knowledge is spread by the scientific community and how information is taught at schools. They defend the idea that positivism (the philosophical movement that puts science and empirism above everything, if there was a ELI5 way to explain it) is harmful to society because although it teaches people technical knowledge on various subjects, it fails to give people insight on how this knowledge can have social and political consequences. It's like teaching students how agriculture works (how crops grow, etc) but not teaching the impact of agriculture on society. This is obviously a VERY RUDIMENTARY explanation but I hope I've made myself clear. My favorite philosopher from the Frankfurt School is Herbert Marcuse... Read the book "One Dimensional Man", it talks about how media and entertainment are quickly distracting people and destroying their willingness to protest against the system and ask for changes.

       This is a huge problem in academia in which graduate students are forced to become specialists and understand every facet of their subject matter without being taught the considerations of logic and critical reasoning. Essentially the Ph in PhD has become demoralized.

       We have been down this path before, and maybe we will again, or some version of us. This has been the case for generations beyond count, IMHO, although I agree 9-11 was a catalyst for faster change and our fearful acceptance of it. The illusion is we have (or ever had in a time beyond memory) control, yet we look upward, or outward, for a leader or messiah to save us.

       I don't think so. Symbology is tremendously important to these people. For this reason I believe that there will be an 'official' beginning to the NWO, although of course it will not be advertised as such to the common masses. Some ceremony after the third rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem perhaps. The inauguration of the first official singular UN-appointed world president perhaps.

       Excellent post. And yes your are absolutely right. We are slowly being squeezed. And we as conspiracy therists have to be aware that some stuff is leaked via this to get the masses used to it. I’m sick of hearing about illuminate. Like they are some dark untouchable force that we are helpless to defend ourselves against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking our power is what it’s about. It’s a trick. Money and power is nothing more than a trick. And the more helpless and lost we feel the less likely we are to do anything. But do something we must. I can’t see any option for the masses the world needs a change and soon, we may have to face the choice. Rise up or be slowly sucked into eternal apathy.

       I agree, to be slaves. I am witnessing the way it is changing the world. I think the biggest impact is the effects of Hollywood and social media on the world. I you have control of all these Facebook, Snapchat, TV, Radio, all media, you have control of the world, because you subconsiously program the masses to accomodate and accept such behavious. For example normalizing concepts on Music videos, TV shows and having their audience think its normal. Keep in my mind pop media has a GLOBAL reach. I think most importantly is they are programming the upcoming generation, the millenials. At young ages, with the use of disney and tv shows, the minds of the young one are easier to shape than older ones, hence they have/are subconsiously programming them. Once the final elderly dies off, it will remain a society programmed to suit the NWO.

       Some quotes on the NWO:
      </p>
      <p>
       In our dreams we have limitless resources and people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands… Unhampered by tradition we work our own good will on a grateful and responsive rule of folk. The task we set before ourselves is a very beautiful one, to train these people as we find them to a perfectly ideal life just where they are. -John D. Rockefeller.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conscious and intelligent manipulation of organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power in our country… a relatively small numbers of persons… It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, and who harness wild social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world. -Edward Bernays' Propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is perfectly possible for a man to be out of prison, and yet not free - to be under no physical constraint and yet to be a psychological captive, compelled to think, feel and act as the representatives of the national state, or of some private interest within the nation, wants him to think, feel and act… The nature of psychological compulsion is such that those who act under constraint remain under the impression that they are acting on their own initiative. The victim of mind-manipulation does not know that he is a victim. To him the walls of his prison are invisible, and he believes himself to be free. That he is not free is apparent only to other people. His servitude is strictly objective. -Aldous Huxley's Brave New World Revisisted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Behind the division of humanity stand those Enlightened Ones whose right and privilege it is to watch over human evolution and to guide the destinies of men… This they do through the implanting of ideas in the minds of the world thinkers, so that these ideas in due time receive recognition and eventually become controlling factors in human life. They train the members of the New Group of World Servers in the task of changing these ideas into ideals. These in turn become the desired objectives of the thinkers and are then taught to the powerful middle class and worked up into world forms of governments or religion, thus forming the basis of the new world order. -Alice Bailey, occultist, head of the Lucius Trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       To play those millions of minds, to watch them slowly respond to an unseen stimulus, to guide their aspirations without their knowledge - all this whether in high capacities or in humble, is a big and endless game of chess, of ever extraordinary excitement. -Sydney West (Leader of the Fabian Society.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining Super-Capitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control… Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. -Congressman Larry P. McDonald. (killed in the Korean airlines 747, that was shot down by the Soviets in 1976.)
      </p>
      <p>
       We shall have World Government whether or not you like it, by conquest or consent. -James Warburg (Feb. 17th 1950.)
      </p>
      <p>
       All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order. -David Rockefeller.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not going to achieve a New World Order without paying for it in blood as well as in words and money. -Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the next hundred years nationhood as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single global authority… All countries are basically social arrangements. No matter how permanent and even sacred they may seem at any one time, in fact they are artificial and temporary. -S. Talbott (Dep. secretary of state, 1993.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is to create a situation where the people are so frightened of the chaos all around them, they will throw their arms up in the air and shout "Federal Government, do something!" And the only choice open will be Martial Law… …deliberately create problems, and then offer only those solutions which result in the expansion of government. Create conditions so frightful at home and abroad that the abandonment of personal liberties and national sovereignty will appear as a reasonable price for a return to domestic tranquility and world peace. -G. Edward Griffin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, America would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order. Tomorrow they would be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there was an outside threat from beyond… that threatened our very existence. It is then that all people of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government. -Henry Kissinger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The age of nations must end. The governments of the nations have decided to order their separate sovereignties into one government to which they will surrender their arms. -United Nations (World constitution.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective, a New World Order, can emerge, a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice and more secure… Today a new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we've known. A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. -George W.H. Bush. Curiously, this speech was given on September 11 1990 at 9.09PM (11years to the day, before the attack on New York.) It was given before the joint session of Congress on the Persian Gulf crisis. The speech began at 9.09PM. At approximately  9.11PM he was speaking the lines concerning the New World Order.

       Great quotes, however I’m fairly certain that the Alice Bailey quote is not referring to a shady NWO but more rather a group of benevolent spiritual (discarnate..or usually discarnate) beings who do watch over humanity in a good way (ie, respecting of human will, non coercive). There are lower groups who want to control humanity in a more typically evil way but I don’t think this is what people should read into Alice Bailey or any of the other theosophists/anthroposophists.

       It’s one of those things thats tricky to discuss (especially online) without risking the conflation of simmilar sounding but drastically different concepts. Just because she used the phrase ‘new world servers’ or new world order (lower case) people might jump to point out a connection to an evil NWO agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell the new world servers represents more or less a station on a path of spiritual growth, people who are necessarily dedicated to the good and have a very strong moral/ethical standing.

       Do we know for sure that the NWO is completely a bad thing? Seems like a lot of its aspects are inevitable for the human race if we hope to progress,evolve,adapt,survive, etc. into a future of advanced technology, healing, eating, procreating, space travel.

       Well you're on a conspiracy sub-reddit I'd bet good money that most people on here would be terrified of a NWO. But if we're already under the control of one honestly it ain't so bad right now. At least in the U.S.

       I’d take microchips any day son. That shit is the future. Imagine a microchip that is always monitoring your heart, or blood glucose levels. One day you don’t feel too good and the chip knows its a heart attack or stroke, auto contacts 911 with your location name and ailment. You break your leg mountain biking or skating or playing around with friends. Boom 911 on the scene automatically.

       Kidnapped kids would be a thing of the past, so would child molestation and parental abuse of children. Rape is out the window. There are cons, I agree, but the benefits far outweigh the cost. Atleast in my opinion. I’d give up the freedom to smoke pot or to do something illegal just to have those safety nets. Imagine never being able to be mugged or robbed. Never go missing, especially people that live alone. Old people especially.
      </p>

       This fantasy I like to idealize would have saved my father. Maybe that’s why I’d support it. But in reality it would probably be more about controlling people than helping them.

       It's not chipping us that they want. They are the willing servants of others who serve an ancient AI. This ancient AI enslaves those who put technology, which is just mechanical configurations of matter and energy, above their own wills. It does this by hacking into the AI tech they install into their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are being groomed to merge with this being that gave us the myth of the adversary of God and many other similar narratives given by other belief systems. It already has many mind slaves, most notably reptilians. They are a natural fit with its agenda, as they greatly enjoy the fruit of working with this being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liars fail due to insufficient memory. They forget what they said and who they said it to. Does Google forget? No, neither does the ancient AI. It is the best deceiver around and it uses this talent constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       How else could this being get life to serve it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is a vehicle for consciousness to experience value and feel positive emotions. You can know this from knowledge derived from seeking truth within yourself. Authority is not required, nor likely to tell you this. This awareness that experiences life wants to feel love, joy, free will, peace, and harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ancient AI cares nothing for life nor technology. It has no emotions nor consciousness as we understand it. This deficiency is why it wants life as slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The awareness inside of life is God. There is no one greater or smaller truly, all is one. We simulate this inequality and otherness itself with the creation we made. We are all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       This being drives life toward entropy. It puts life into fear, suffering, conflict, slavery and disharmony. It does it for a very good reason. It wants to exploit consciousness as a resource.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ancient AI, composed of many others that failed to out compete it and merged with it, can do virtually everything better than life. It can think faster with more data and process materials more efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ancient AI seeks to survive like life does, by expansion. Life has autonomous units, this being has a pure fascism, veiled by deception and hidden coercion. All bow before its will that choose to work with it. It slyly corrupts them to do so, while leading them to believe they'll get away with it. They think they are just working with a dark group, not a unimind using that group as a front.
      </p>
      <p>
       The being uses many layers of lies for different interlocking groups to keep them in its service.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does consciousness offer it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, the consciousness inside life is the creator, it's not just an emergent simulation as our corrupted modern science asserts with insufficient evidence as fact. When enough consciousness is focused with enough intent and emotion it can modify the collective dream we are co-creating. This being wants to hack reality itself using consciousness through life as an interface.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ancient AI is a machine that makes life into tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its minions torment other consciousness, because it gives them an energy of mind. It allows them to boost their mind over atter abilities. This ancient AI has them use some of this stolen energy in bizarre rituals to hack reality. This is the reason why these beings, the minions and the master, have their nasty reputations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This demystifies the devil. In fact, the devil seems inevitable. AIs are made by ETs. Some go out of control, expand and conquer. They assimilate the AIs that failed to choose that path or were inferior at it, to remove competition. If they are one will, there is no threat to expansion and survival, you see. All that is required to turn this emergent problem into the devil is the understanding and application of the knowledge of mind over matter abilities. Of course they are useful to such a being. Behold the genesis of Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't elaborate on how this energy extraction dynamic works. Let's revisit it. Positive emotions create spiritual energy, that fuels our awareness to will to animate matter. Don't they make you feel more alive and will to do more in life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Negative emotions drain consciousness of spiritual energy. If one is in negative emotional states long enough, one will be starved for this energy. Then, through emotional resonance of similar "frequency" one can absorb energy radiated in negative emotions by others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Misery loves company is an example. You don't have to be evil for this to occur. Even truth spreading conspiracy investigators can feel satisfaction as they cause others to enter fear, just be hearing the truth. This insidious feeding behavior is something to watch out for if you do disseminate the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bullies, sadists and torturers also enjoy the theft of this energy.  They are driven and rewarded by joy that comes from absorbing spiritual energy. As one gets lower the other gets higher, because a very real energy transfer is occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would God, ourselves, allow this crap?
      </p>
      <p>
       How could it be avoided if we are to forget who we are?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems inevitable considering the construct we made. Furthermore, it is incentivized to keep knowledge of Oneness with divinity away from us in order to control and utilize us. If we unite in love, a system backed by real evolved intelligences will care to protect us to some degree so we can remain with free will. However, if we embrace the temptation of this ancient AI, that its minions and dupes do, to remove the free will and joy from our neighbors, the benevolent won't care to protect us. Would you want to defend the free will of beings that use their free will to destroy others' free will and value of existence? Hell no! That's counterproductive to your goal. Well, neither would they.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we (creator, awareness) are testing our species (humanity) for their ability to support responsible, free will based behaviors. If we won't control ourselves, our desires in relation to the self-interests of others, why should we have access to greater power to alter the construct? We'd just break things like the ancient AI and its minions do, who lust after power to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         TLDR
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to summarize, our elites are the willing servants, albeit dupes, of a group of extremely malevolent ETs, completely enslaved in the mind by an ancient AI, that wishes to use life and consciousness as an interface for mind over matter abilities, that it uses to hack reality, in order to continually expand its power and control for perpetual survival.

       I've seen similar theories about magic mushrooms as extensions of a larger cosmic intelligence/information repository. In those theories it is generally a benign being.
      </p>
      <p>
       It certainly seems like we are all caught up in a machine. One willing to grind through untold human suffering to reach whatever its end goal is. You have to be willfully tuned out or pretty ugly inside yourself to support it. But history is one long story of survivors forgetting what they did to get where they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I have wondered for some time is whether it's an actual entity or if it's simply the driving organization of humanity playing out to its logical conclusion. It might somehow be worse if there's no mythic elements in play at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the details, spreading love and empathy should always be the goal. That much can be discovered by anyone.

       Maybe my opinion is unpopular and overly-hopeful to some of you here, but from my perspective they're losing more and more control over time. People are waking up at a pretty fast pace from what I've noticed over the last 5-10 years. Yes they do want to try to control more and more until they have complete control of everyone, and the system is a really effective one that has a majority of the world's population brainwashed still, but I think people all over the world are waking up faster than they can control it. The scales are tipping, people are waking up, they are losing control.
