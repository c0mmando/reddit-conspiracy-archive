<p>I believe our leaders use porn to kill a bunch of birds with one stone, and this is why it’s the only form of media that is completely free and millions of hours of it are released daily.</p>

<p>I believe they use it to pacify the masses. It’s kind of hard to start a revolution when you’re constantly draining your seed and pounding off alone in a dark room.</p>

<p>I believe they use it to push moral boundaries. This makes a more degenerate society with less empathy that’s easier to lead into depravity.</p>

<p>I believe it’s also a way to groom children. With the explosion of technology, the old “it’s up to the parents” doesn’t fucking cut it anymore. These people know kids are finding hardcore internet pornography at younger and younger ages, and they love it. They get off on taking a child’s innocence.</p>

<p>Imagine your 12 year old son is at school and one of his friends tells him about these sites, and now you’re child is alone in his room watching “ANAL GAPE SLUT GETTING POUNDED BY DADDY”.</p>

<p>Are you seriously okay with that?</p>

<p>&quot;If you invite in enough of the world, you dilute the poison.&quot;j</p>

<p>Also jews are not allies of the West. Israel has torpedoed the USS Liberty, stolen the US&#39;s nuclear secrets, and takes billions of dollars in aid a year. The West gets nothing out of it, except hatred from others in the world for our association.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. That&#39;s a bit unsettling. I don&#39;t see how people watch something they&#39;re not into at least somewhat. That&#39;s kind of the point of choosing that particular option when you have a slew of other choices. </p>

<p>To be fair I do enjoy like ffm with mom&#39;s and teens, which I think are sometimes portrayed to be mom/daughter. I watch for the young/old dynamic though, not family lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s mostly that it&#39;s taboo, this makes it exiting. 99% of people who watch it are probably grossed out by the idea of being intimate with family, but still enjoy the porn because they like the idea of breaking taboos. Same with the &quot;public&quot; porn where they&#39;re secretly fucking around a corner or behind the kitchen counter. The fear of being caught makes it more exiting thus better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it might relate to just how fucked up boundaries are in families these days/throughout time as well. In a lot of families, the only thing really different from the mom fucking the son is the physical aspect. So many children are victims of emotional incest, and I’d bet a lot of ppl use incest fantasies/porn to make sense of these types of traumas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the explanation for that.</p>

<p>Basically it was a very highly <em>searched</em> term because it was hard to find. It&#39;s hard to get a sense of true numbers from searches so some producers took that as &quot;wow a lot of people really want this&quot; when it reality it was a smaller minority that simply couldn&#39;t every accidentally bump into what they were looking for.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a bit of a prisoners dilemma so the studios making the movies got noticed by others, and all the sudden you have an explosive of this crazy genre just because the few people who liked it searched for it so ravenously.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like the gluten free phenomenon</p>

<p>certainly! prior to reading the book, my philosophical viewpoint was weak atheism coupled with interest in and practice of vajrayana buddhism, ritual magick, and afro-caribbean traditions such as vodoun.</p>

<p>yes. Catholicism, specifically.</p>

<p>the book is written from a proudly Catholic perspective, and the material contained therein -- particularly the discussion of the harlem renaissance poet and writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay">claude mckay&#39;s</a> conversion to Catholicism -- inspired me to look more deeply into the Church. i spent three years reflecting on the matter before i decided to convert.</p>

<p>as to the other denominations, only Orthodoxy has anywhere near as respectable a claim to be the Church Christ founded, and a close examination of the writings of the early Church Fathers conclusively demonstrates that Orthodoxy, for all its charms, is not <em>that</em> Church.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong at all, and I&#39;m not trying to condensed you. I am a follower of Christ myself and am very interested in your perception.</p>

<p>Early writing give the pope a super human status?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>early writings, beginning with Matthew 16:18-19, most certainly accord ecclesiastical primacy to Saint Peter, and writings from the second century onward accord primacy in decisions made regarding the Faith to the Bishop of Rome (i.e., his successor). i&#39;m not sure exactly what is meant by &quot;superhuman status,&quot; but i suspect it has to do with the doctrine of papal infallibility. papal infallibility only operates in certain tightly defined and extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>and porn is free to make and distribute and has a nearly unlimited market.  it has the lowest barrier to entry and the highest demand of any possible product.  even marijuana, which is a literal weed takes time and space to produce- you can create porn and turn 100% profit on it almost immediately.  it&#39;s not a conspiracy.</p>

<p>How is what I&#39;m saying Bullshit? Are you trying to claim that no paid porn sites exist? Because if they do, then what I&#39;m saying isn&#39;t bullshit. And they do exist, in the thousands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it’s being projected into every device, everywhere, no filter, for FREE, by design.</p>

<p>Yes it is by design. Its a design by criminals to make money from copyrighted content, just like watchseries or any other media streaming site that streams the copyright of others and profits from the advertising associated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s 100% a tool of the jew, and that’s just a fact.</p>

<p>No thats not a fact. A fact is that Jews are over highly represented (just like in most areas of media) but they dont 100% control the porn industry. Please don&#39;t tell me that something is fact, when it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>But like with meat, over-consumption and hyper-production are not  good in the grander scheme. </p>

<p>For instance I have 1 Jewish friend (which is high for where I am as there are few Jews) who is as anti-zionism as I am.</p>

<p>If you focus on the expansionist political ideology, alongside the crazy religious zionism, you have a much more deserved target than &#39;The Jew&#39;. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Israeli Zionists have already displayed their willingness to sacrifice their own people, when needed.</p>

<p>Thats what Brazzers is, a pay site under the same corporate umbrella as pornhub and a couple of others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand, porn isn&#39;t really free.</p>

<p>The reason theres so much of it is because its easy and fast to manufacture and brings in a comparitavely large income.</p>

<p>Sites like Pornhub function like Youtube and other social media, you pay with your information, subscriptions and the ads you consume. The money made from all this is then mostly taken by the site with some going back to the creators.</p>

<p>If you want specific videos you&#39;ll have to pay an individual or company a premium, often the videos put up for free are there to try and get you to buy more from them directly.</p>

<p>Many sites like Youtube, Facebook and Reddit have a similar quantity of content for &quot;free&quot; too, I get where you&#39;re coming from but I think it&#39;s more a case of the free market speaking than a government conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A documentary on amateur porn actresses being lured into the industry that follows their mostly short lived and pretty brutal careers called &#39;Hot Girls Wanted&#39;(on Netflix guys) really shows you a lot and your comments on how easy it is to produce versus profit I believe is the real answer, or at least most of it. </p>

<p>Most porn on porn hub is either old, a cut down version of the full with the &#39;best bits&#39; cut out or a full length un-cut film trying to lure you to a whole site of the same kind of content - the content you can only see three or four scenes of for free without involving piracy ie a specific actress or genre or production niche.</p>

<p>These girls cost almost nothing. Porn is so saturated, they are getting a grand or so per shoot. Maybe up to five grand if it&#39;s ruthless as and they are super smoking hot etc. Most porn is&#39; amateur&#39; in that regard and pay isn&#39;t that much better than being a high class prostitute or sugar baby. Pretty sad really. </p>

<p>Porn industry understands the Internet better than other media companies because it really thrived from the Internet. Unlike cable or cinemas competing with the Internet, porn had a rebirth and could suddenly be accessed privately and instantly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My list of blocked subreddits on r/all only fits 100. It&#39;s full and I had to start removing political subs to fit the porn ones. Still have a few pop up starting in the top 300s. It&#39;s the problem with browsing on mobile without RES. I guess I could just subscribe to everything, but I kind of enjoy seeing most everything that&#39;s at the top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I recall reading, there was one person who went and bought up a bunch of porn sites and made them free.  Their goal wasn&#39;t to provide free porn to the masses, it was to use free porn as a lure to attract a ton of advertisement money.  It worked and some pay sites will use free sites as a source for more viewers by releasing shortened clips of their videos and aggressively pursuing having full videos removed, meaning if you liked the clip and want to see a better/longer version you should pay for their site.</p>

<p>Rather smart from a business standpoint, or at least I thought it was when I first heard about it.</p>

<p>You should pay a little closer attention.  Many of those clips are actually published by the studios that produce the content.  Seriously.  <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/channels/tushy">Here&#39;s Tushy&#39;s <strong>NSFW</strong> channel on Pornhub</a>.  Or if you like, <a href="https://www.youporn.com/channel/882545149/tushy/">their channel on YouPorn</a>.  I think you get the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean my comment is just saying he’s wrong. im not allowed to disagree? </p>

<p>i did provide valid logic. he thinks porn is free so people jack off all day. porn is free bc ANYONE can make it. a porn shot on an iphone in some good lighting is going to be pretty much as good as something youd pay for. the difference between a movie shot on an iphone vs a produced film is a big enough of a difference most people will pay for it. </p>

<p>but porn makes a ton of money. theres ads and its not full vids etc. i cant believe this post has more than 10 upvotes. op is prob a 14 year old that thinks he yanks it a lil too much which may be true idk the guy n he’s a little insecure, and instead of being like yanno maybe ill yank it less, he thinks up a conspiracy that the jews are controlling his mind through his penis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>porn goes both ways.  it&#39;s been used, correctly, as a lever against traditional binary models.  the same models that force mindless conformity, that don&#39;t work for everyone, that provide abusive legal policy, that needlessly imprison, that are used as a control mechanism by the powerful.  and porn has been used as a distraction, and as a way to pattern social behaviour.  it has a spectrum of effects and it itself is spectrum-y.  so i don&#39;t think it fits in any particular &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; box.  </p>

<p>the issue of &quot;consent&quot;, on the other hand, if clearly codified, would resolve much of what manifests as bad behaviour in real life.  way easier fruit to pick.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the naked ladeez picturz market does not track with other markets, it is atypical, asymetric, etc</p>

<p>women get paid way less than what it&#39;s worth because they can support themselves other ways, and people pay more for what its worth because either they are going to copy it or because they are affected by hormones</p>

<p>and the ad-reselling market is huuuuge, and the secondary &#39;who likes what porn&#39; market is also huuuuuge</p>

<p>so there are all kinds of externalities affecting this market, and the human form seems to just love this on-demand nudy pics and i am not going to pretend to be above this</p>

<p>i do think there is a crisis approaching where some elites may want to find a way to legalize adult-child sex, something i will always oppose and want to be clear that i will always oppose. </p>

<p>i am radical about a hundred or a thousand things, but i am not radical about statutory limitations on sexual relations between adults and minors. </p>

<p>a child who is allowed the entire internet is going to be damaged by it, so i do believe in parental responsibility to monitor and restrict internet usage until adulthood.   </p>

The truly scary part is, that new Porn has a way of making you forget about all the Porn Stars of old. Look how hard they pushed back at &quot;tube&quot; sites that allowed their content to be given away for free (let alone torrenting).

    <div class="md"><p>This, plus porn is something that can be made my literally anyone so long as you have some nasty bits. Of course there aren’t loads of free movies and games out there. It’s because it takes a skill set to produce it and you better believe it’s worth more money than the BJ that someone recorded on their iPhone. The masses produce the porn and the sites host it and reap the ad profits. There’s probably more to it than that but this conspiracy is whack </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When they first started making it, why do you think they used the designation xxx? Who adds an x to their pet projects?</p>

<p>Miles Mathis has an interesting theory. He says that in typical Hollywood movies, interaction between members of the opposite sex is deliberately toned down, and most often, horror and distrust are unneccesarily introduced into the equation (why do you think Girl on a train and Gone Girl got pushed up the charts).</p>

<p>But those seeing commercially made porn as an antidote end up seeing extreme and unrealistic things (establishing unrealistic expectations) which only makes them worse off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the &quot;Free&quot; porn is pretty much amateur couples who put up their vids online to make some cash or to fuel some fetish. Most of the companies that make it just let out parts of the videos not the entire videos in order to make you pay for their websites. Even a &quot;free&quot; site like pornhub has its restrictions and charges you for other stuff. Porn is a business just like everything else. 
Also tons of stuff are not charging you anything. Youtube is much larger than pornhub for example and hundreds of hours are uploaded on it daily and people have made it a job posting there. Sites like twitch are also free. And don&#39;t forget you are on reddit which is also free and you can find pretty much anything here. 
The gaming industry is also like this. There are thousands of games that you can play for free and are not obligated to pay anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully agree and I&#39;ve been saying this for years. Pornhub destroys regular and healthy sexualities. Anything can become a perversion and right now the family as a unit is under heavy fire. Go to pornhub and see how many videos are of siblings or parents supposedly getting screwed. Also they&#39;re not just sex videos, there will be long videos that cut through (imagined) days where a brother will groom a sister and if he fails he will blackmail her for sex. Sometimes a looong video will only result in a small sexual act. This is 100% grooming and <em>showing</em> the process of grooming. You can turn anything into a perversion and these sites like pornhub is the front line of a war that no one talks about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there could be something to your theory that they allow porn because &quot;they&quot; will encounter less resistance if they lower testosterone levels.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been told for a couple of decades now that masturbation is normal and healthy. That may be the case, but compulsive or daily masturbation not only lowers testosterone, it changes your brain.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just a tiny piece of the puzzle, there is a war on masculinity and it&#39;s not just coming from the far left drones who are outraged about &quot;toxic masculinity&quot;.</p>

<p>Pesticides and other chemicals in our food, junk food containing trans fats, MSG, and artificial sweeteners, fluoride, BPA&#39;s and other chemicals in plastics (which virtually all of our food and beverage are packaged and served in), hormones and antibiotics in agriculture, artificial sweeteners, processed sugar, soy, alcohol, and a big one - stress (which goes will with alcohol).</p>

<p>It definitely feels society is conspiring to make men less masculine. Whether that&#39;s a coordinated effort to suppress an inevitable uprising long enough for the oligarchs can liquidate the planet, or that it&#39;s the result of corporations maximizing profit in this capitalist utopia is up for debate, but that nobody is doing anything about it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I would suggest people take steps to protect your own testosterone levels. Stop pulling your pud three times a day. Stop eating Doritos and McDonalds and, if you only do one thing to make your body and mind better, stop drinking soda completely. Try to figure out how to relieve some stress and cut back on the booze. Just generally treat your body like it&#39;s the only one you&#39;ll get.</p>

<p>Testosterone is what makes a man. It makes men productive and driven to succeed. It&#39;s what makes us competitive, it is what gets us off our asses to do something and to do it well. On the other hand, low testosterone is a nightmare of depression and uncertainness and stress and low self esteem. I&#39;ve personally lived it, and I think there are a lot of national and even global evidence that it&#39;s not just me, this is a widespread problem.</p>

<p>Look, I know it&#39;s tough, but if I can do it anybody can. I cut sugar, junk food, and booze out entirely a couple of years ago and there absolutely is a significant difference in my mind and my body. I started losing weight for the first time in my adult life, and without even trying. I&#39;m just not hangry all the time anymore and I don&#39;t drink liquid sugar all day long anymore. I have much more energy and motivation, and my mind is more focused. Once you&#39;ve broken the addiction crappy food starts to look repulsive. It&#39;s exactly like smoking, cigarettes are gross until you get addicted, and then they&#39;re delicious. When you quit they go back to being gross again. It&#39;s the same with all of this crap we put into our bodies.</p>

<p>Anyways, I didn&#39;t mean to get preachy but your comment about lowering testosterone struck a chord. I really think this is a long term problem that very few talk about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, give your kid freedom first of all.  I think I felt so confined within the strictness and rigidity within my family.  A lot was expected of me in school, expectations were high and I resented a lot about the way my parents treated me.  So I explored and tried to find an escape.  I had so many rules I could never even do bad things to get in trouble for.  The internet was an infinite expanse of all the things I could never have or be.  </p>

<p>Finding a community like 4chan&#39;s /b/ board was like finding the cool kids on the internet.  They talked shit about everything including each other.  All the aggression and anger I had caged inside I saw chaotically bouncing around in this orgiastic clusterfuck of... Something. </p>

<p>I had no idea what but it was something I wanted because it was something I couldn&#39;t have.  In an attempt to get me to stop using technology, my parents installed a program on our shared computer allowing me 30 minutes per day. I obviously hacked a way around that.  Then they&#39;d take my phone at night, so I used my iPod, which then became my psp, etc etc. </p>

<p>My point is, every time they tried to stop me, they never attempted to understand me, which only pushed me further away from them and deeper into my need for that counter community.  </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m at the point where I can&#39;t blame my parents but I can understand that I chose everything I did as a means of escape.  By 14 I was addicted to watching videos of people dying, watching hardcore rape porn, and even going as far as diving into the deep web to get the real dark Chan boards.  And I wanted all this because I didn&#39;t want to be like my parents, my classmates, people in society.  What originally sparked that, I&#39;m not sure, but the way it was handled by myself and by those around me only ever pushed me deeper into darkness.  </p>

<p>Talk to your kid, please. Don&#39;t ask them how their day went and when they respond &quot;bad, you know I hate school why do you ask?&quot; give up and let their angst win.  Ask them how they feel not how they did on their exam.  Find out why they started dating that girl instead of just telling them to DEFINITELY not have sex.  Trust your child, why would they have any bad intentions as a kid? Maybe feeling that they&#39;re expected to have bad intentions inclines them to look for bad intentions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your honest reply.  I really do appreciate it.  Although I&#39;m older than you, I can relate to growing up in a strict home, with a lot of expectations, but no real support.  I didn&#39;t have the internet, but if I had, I can see how it can be a place to turn for refuge.<br/>
I try hard to be a better parent than mine were, but without that modeling from my own parents, it sometimes feels foreign.  I always tell my kids they can tell me anything and I pray they feel they can.  The older I get, the scarier the world seems. I just want to shelter them from that without being to restrictive.  It&#39;s a challenging balance.  Again, thanks for your response.  You seem to have an execellent ability to be introspective, which is an admirable trait.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents are both &quot;good people&quot; in that they&#39;ve devoted their lives to helping others.  My dad&#39;s the head of an ER, the chief of our local fire department, as well as the editor for a large emergency medicine journal. My mom would go to Africa and help charities and things.  That being said, it felt like my whole life they were trying to help other people but could never help me.  </p>

<p>They &quot;gave me everything and I&#39;m throwing it all away.&quot; But it was nothing I ever wanted. I never cared about money or materialism. I just wanted love.  </p>

<p>You applaud my introspection but I almost see it as a blessing and a curse. A curse given to me by my own loneliness, but a blessing in that maybe I can find a way out of this.</p>

<p>The reality distortion, the lack of empathy perpetuated (some love being the thing most often needed in this situation)... the list goes on </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That literally makes no sense.</p>

<p>First of all, majority of the internet is &quot;free&quot;. Free in the way that you don&#39;t directly pay anything, but the services themeselves generate income from ads. How do you think Reddit is run? Sure, there is the gold but that hardly is their main income. Same goes for Youtube, pretty much any social network, flash game sites, meme sharing sites...</p>

<p>Secondly, there IS paid porn. There are cable channels you have to pay for, there used to be magazines you had to buy, there is premium membership on most of pornsites...</p>

<p>Porn is a bussiness, just one that generates money &quot;indirectly.&quot;</p>

<p>So if you ask if I would be ok with a 12 year old watching, then yes I would because he/she has obviously hit puberty and from then on it&#39;s a natural process. A 12 year old that has not yet hit puberty and then stumbles on a porn site will simply be disgusted and close it.</p>

<p>When you put it that way, it really makes me wonder how many of those women in porn are victims of sex trafficking.  If we dig deep enough, how long will it take to tie the porn industry in general to outfits like NXIVM or to high rank politicians and military.  How many of those women are from countries that the US fucked by &quot;bringing democracy&quot; in the form of a coup?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the documentary on Netflix, &quot;Hot Girls Wanted&quot;
It&#39;s excellent and accounts for at least a percentage/large group of women in porn. There are many more documentaries from there, but I immediately thought of this when I saw your post. (The teens in this documentary are not trafficked, but would I say they are being treated ethically and fairly? No.) </p>

<p>With that said, I&#39;m a women who used to watch porn semi-regularly, but stopped after I began digging around and investigating conditions and (lack) of content control--especially on free steaming sites. At any given moment, you could absolutely be watching a victim of Revenge Porn, a sex trafficking victim, a women abused on set, and so on, and on. There is of course also well-made and regulated pornography produced and made by women who have agency and love what they do, but for me, the risk outweighs the potential reward. I stick to Literotica! Ha!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was 12 and surfing the web (using altavista and later google) I was finding a lot of pedophile snuff movies sometimes with some zoophilia in them because the internet wasn&#39;t regulated in any way, basically what the dark web is right now but accessible to everyone. The effects of this kind of content (which is way worse than modern porn because seeing babies raped to death or killed for fun isn&#39;t comforting for a 12 year old) definitely rewires your brain but no one can actually predict in what way this will affect the person and control the end result of a person&#39;s actions or behaviour. In the end the effects of being exposed to such content are relative to a person&#39;s attitude towards life in general, attitude which stems from the principles inherited from their family. If you come from a liberal family, with no principles, content of this sort will probably desensitise, on the other hand, if your family has strong principles and a solid moral foundation, you will become proactive in fighting against destructive behaviour of that sort and knowing it exists allows you to become more mentally flexible so you can deal with it. 
So the only true conspiracy that I can see here is saying people can be programmed, manipulated or controlled over a longer period of time, based on the false assumption that people are deterministic in nature, which is false and only creates FUD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not that taken by the notion that the cost is a conspiracy. lots of things on the internet are &quot;free&quot; but have several ways into your pocket. Porn is no different.</p>

<p>What really kinda surpises me is that even the most hardcore porn is accessable to anyone. You don&#39;t even have to lie about your age. When I open a fresh browser in incognito pornhub doesn&#39;t even ask me to say I&#39;m at least 18.</p>

<p>I think porn sites should be required to do at least minimal age verification where they at least ask the age of the person. Also, maybe it would not be great for me personally but I also think the harder porn should require a more concrete age verification like a credit card.</p>

<p>I rarely say &quot;think of the children&quot; but...we really do need to think of the children here. This firehose of hardcore porn is really much too easy to access. A 7 year old could easily be watching the hardest porn in like 30 seconds if you leave them for that long alone on a phone or PC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>totally disagree... there is a war on porn and its industry. Your entire theory precludes that.  I suggest among many other things you look into Proposition 60 in California... not a casual glane, but wha twas ACTUALLY going on.. it was nothing to do with &#39;heath&#39; and everythingto do with toppling the industry groups...</p>

<p>It is also clear that pushing oral boundaries is exactly what is NOT going on right now.... indeed it is the opposite</p>

<p>and yeah...I would have a huge problem with my 12 year old watching that alone.  but lets not throw out the baby with the bathwater.</p>

<p>you had access to playboys at 12? you lucky lucky bastard</p>

<p>and it IS up to the parents... but I think the government has failed totally to provide help and give them the tools.  Anyone with a a basic set of instructions can configure their router... create log files and block domains.. even setting times for webs access and scheduling..... they just need the information and the will. Ideally I would like to see information packs sent to every household from their ISP or government if they have kids</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your take and Porn is certainly something that should be discussed as a topic of concern. In a sense that access to porn should not be as easy as it is right now to even youngest children with a phone.</p>

<p>However you are on the wrong path with approach you are taking.</p>

<p>Porn is cheapest form of media to produce, requires no particular talent, and it takes only few hours to produce professional porn video. Not even to talk about amateur porn that anyone with a decent phone can produce.</p>

<p>This is the main reason that there is so much porn produced and spread on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In comparison to TV shows Movies Music and other forms of media.</p>

<p>All these need to have at least some form of talent and expertise, from everyone involved.</p>

<p>Also porn is not free, porn studios are taking down their pirated videos all the time but with amount of porn being produced, you barely notice it - and only big studios can afford to hunt down their content, small studios and amateur(ish) producers do not even bother with that too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you&#39;re older than me. Regrettably, I have literally watched <em>gaping anal slut pounded</em> by multiple men when I was 12.  I grew up with no &quot;sex-ed&quot; in school.  Porn was all word of mouth in school.</p>

<p>Nowadays not only is it easier to watch porn, but also sex-ed in schools gives children some nice clues on what to search for and where to find them, and &quot;everything is ok&quot;. Don&#39;t be surprised if 8-year olds are watching those shit now.</p>

All of YouTube, a bunch of free video games (currently like fortnite) and basically half of all entertainment is entirely free, but it&#39;s just an avenue for advertising products. You maybe don&#39;t notice with porn, but so much more shit than porn is free, it&#39;s just used to advertise </p>

<li>It&#39;s supply and demand that sets prices. It&#39;s very easy to produce porn, so there&#39;s a lot of supply. So the price is low.</li>
<li>A lot of people still pay for porn. Considering that porn doesn&#39;t really have a language barrier it&#39;s a global product. As long as you can make a decent profit off of a $4,000 shoot, you do it. You only need a couple of thousand people globally to pay a couple of dollars monthly to make your business model profitable.</li>
<li>Porn sites get paid by 3rd parties to upload malware on your phone and laptop which is a business model to extract money from less tech-savy users.</li>
