       Bit of a different thread. Recently I have read about the "martyr" Tommy Robinson, whilesuch full of irony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of believing that Islam is notoriously anti western or anti women I want people to research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I consider myself as nothing, i am not atheist nor religious because I'm not sure, I just simply don't know. I am not Islamic in any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's look at the propaganda. Every god damn single person i see points to muhammed fucking a child. I too was under this spell until I researched it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aisha had a sister, her sister was 10 years older, written in Islamic text. Her sister died in 73 a.h.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know she died at 100, in 73 a.h. So she was... 28 in 1 a.h. So if she's 28, Aisha is 18 in 1 a.h.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 a.h = April 622. So if muhammed married Aisha in 619, how was she 6?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not arguing for this nor arguing against it, I just want to know how it came to be that monothetic religions, with the same angels and beliefs can be so vile to each other?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the propaganda of Islam even at its worst is akin to Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my question  is, where does this hate come from? And for all those who want to "quote" the Islamic text, please do so and not a random hadith by a "scholar" 700 years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, mawar (?) Pearls to those on the side of the kaaba is interesting, especially since the meteorite has such a resemblance to the stones.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hadith, Arabic Ḥadīth (“News” or “Story”), also spelled Hadīt, record of the traditions or sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, revered and received as a major source of religious law and moral guidance, second only to the authority of the Qurʾān, the holy book of Islam.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Your claim that hadith is not Islamic text is laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muhammad was a murderous warlord rapist, so for him to have a child bride is not inconceivable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Child marriage was quite common not only in the middle east but all over the world at this time.
      </p>

       Islamic preachers use the Islamic texts to justify pedophilia to this day

      <p>
       And in countries like Afghanistan and Yemen it is still happening today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony is you mention Tommy Robinson, and although I find him to be a moron and don't really pay attention to him, the fact is he was 'reporting'/protesting/shit stirring in regards to a Muslim child rape gang.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I personally don't find his arrest that objectionable if he committed contempt of court by compromising the integrity of a trial like they say he did.

       Even if she was an adult, mohammed the warlord still heard voices in his head and was not sure of their origins. So we have a schizophrenic creating a whole cult around his schizophrenic voices, borrowed the rest from the Jews and Christians, made sure there was lots of submission so no questions the cult, and then boom(pun intended) power and his cult solidified in history

        Muhammad's first revelation was an event described in Islam as taking place in 610 AD, during ... "when I was midway on the mountain, I heard a voice from heaven saying "O Muhammad! you are the apostle of Allah and I am Gabriel."

       The cave he meditated in, may have been giving off a variety of different gasses giving him hallucinations as well which is another theory to his schizophrenia
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The moral degeneration of his fellow people, and his own quest for a true religion further lent fuel to this, with the result that he now began to withdraw periodically to a cave named Mount Hira, three miles north of Mecca, for contemplation and reflection.[3] Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad during this period began to have dreams replete with spiritual significance which were fulfilled according to their true import; and this was the commencement of his divine revelation.[1][page needed][4][page needed] This created inclination in him to engage himself in solitary worshipping

       Please, let me know what I said that is bollocks?

       You ask about research...
      </p>
      <p>
       But you say that hadith are not Islamic texts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure I could find dozens of Islamic scholars and researchers who disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you say...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Instead of believing that Islam is notoriously anti western or anti women I want people to research
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And I'm sure I could find dozens of examples from Islamic texts, including the Qurʾān, that advocate for the killing and abuse of infidels and non believers, and that talk about the horrible treatment of women.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what's the point, you already know all this because of all the research you have done,right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps your position is more rooted in political correctness than logic or reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'd ask you not to be so dismissive of the plight of children, women, apostates, homosexuals and other victims of barbaric Islamic societies and sharia law.

       Both views consist of cherrypicking. Clearly the Hadith is full of contradictions. Its not like you can take one set of sources over the other based on nothing other than "scholars - who happen to be pedophiles - say so; coincidence amiright". Tell me, how long after Muhammad's death was the Aisha hadith written w.r.t her being 6? 100 years? 200 years?

       Take Islam and Tommy out of the equation. Why cant a trial be public record or reported on? Especially one that involves nearly 30 defendants. I believe thats what got people talking recently. A media blackout on a trial not supporting Tommy or hating on Islam. Why are some religion's protected and some are not. Christian pedophile case top billing. Islam equals  misunderstood. Jewish equals victim. People are getting tired of these protections being placed on certain groups. Everyone get protection or its just wrong.

       Okay, I understand your questions now and I'm from the UK, firstly this wasn't  first time he had done this, within our political and legal system what he done was illegal.

       Regardless of left, right or on the moon you should respect the legal code of the country you live.

       But we all should remember or research WHO he is. Do not make a martyr of him.

       I dont quite understand why you want to be proven wrong when you were asking for people's opinion on a topic. My belief is the majority of people in the Western Nations practice bastardized religion. Life is to good in the west to follow the holy books. Christians, Muslims, Jews. If we practiced the holy books to the letter the world would look much diffrent. So when you see people following their religion from other areas it seems crazy.
Also a bigger problem is free speech in people's mind and a trial that isnt allowed to be talked about. Question for you, why should the trial not be public? I dont care about Tommy or his political view or history. The reason why Im interested is because Im not a fan of keeping trials secret. Courts are public paid for with tax revenue there for the trials inside them should be public record. Does the public not have a right to know about what goes on in their city/town. Yes you should respect the law of the land you live in. Thats seems to be another problem all together though.

       Because if I am not proven wrong it means I have believed a fucking lie all my life and that sucks.

       Second, laws are different in different countries. Respect that. Politics are different too. Our right is not your right, it's just about research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts are publicly paid with tax yes. But too apply that to being a defence of Tommy is dumb. If a drug dealer gets caught once you let him off, twice? Nah. You cannot apply your own law to ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main problem is research. How many of you guys have looked it up? How many have even looked at my original post and tried to verify it?

       Your not answering why the case shouldn't be public info. The drug dealers would be, wouldnt it? If your a follower of religion then there is a pretty good chance you've been lied to. Thats why most religions do their form of confirmation early in life. If they did it later in life the numbers might drop off after people recieve 12 years of education. Im not a hater of religion as many on Reddit are. I think going to church, temple, mosques is more or less just a way to network. Thier are scientists and engineers who go to religious services and then work on ways to blow up the world, save lives, put a person on Mars. Maybe they think that their just working out the details of their chosen God's magic/power. Im interested in why you think the 3 part trial should have a media blackout. Your right I live in America I am not a British citizen so if I could get your opinion on the trial being silenced, without Tommy being in the reason.

       It's not a black out. It's just a law you are not used too. You are unable to film on the property of court.

       Tommy boi knows this as he done it  before. What did he get? A suspended sentence.

       It is a blackout. Why has nobody reported the verdicts. Have there not been any? I ask because it would make sense for his supporters to provide the details of the case and gather support for Tommy and if they were found innocent it would make it easier for the Muslim community to gather support against Tommy. Neither has happened.

       But what about the original trial. If Tommy never was born and nobody interrupted the trial. I dont believe reporting is interrupting. Should it be public and not silenced.

       Doesn't matter about previous. He was on a public street not court grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watch his recorded live stream he asks cops multiple times if he was ok there and where boundaries were. He interfered in no way and this was a verdict hearing so there wasnt a way for him to interfere with the trial at all.

       Maybe it is and maybe it isn't compatible with the West in a larger sense depending on YOUR interpretation. The actions of a large enough number of Muslims in Western countries and their own is enough to determine they're not using your interpretation, though. Sure, not all Muslims are bad people. There are enough that are that I want to stop bringing them in to other countries until they sort themselves out before they destroy those places too.

       Enough "bad apples" and those bad apples are extremely violent and authoritarian. The Muslims who would get along fine in a peaceful, western society are bullied and guilted by faith into going along with the demands of the bad apples. The problem is there are so many bad apples that it is a risk to any country that takes them in large numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The immigration "crisis" is largely manufactured to take advantage of this. Who are the most likely to be the extremists? Young males. Who makes up 42% of the "refugees" in Europe? Males 18 to 34. Overall 70% of them are males.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is basically that there is a large enough presence in the Islamic faith of those who use the faith to do bad things. By taking in large numbers of them we are not solving the problem, only importing it, and it is a problem that fundamentally sees any attempt by us to de-radicalize them through assimilation as a betrayal of their faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're just as violent in their own countries. They are largely ruled by authoritarians and they interpret the West's way of dealing with legal matters and justice as a weakness.

       While those are great questions I would hesitate to say they're entirely relevant if we're discussing the pros and cons of mass importation. If I were a grocer and I got a shipment of bad apples I wouldn't put them on the shelves of my store and postulate how they got to be bad. I'd send them back to the distributor and tell him to figure it out. Sure, I might be able to sell some of the good apples but stocking the shelves with rotten apples will only harm my business. Then as the worms infect the other produce my store would go out of business until I can't afford to stay open.

       Well I kind of started talking about that in my post in regards to the fake immigration crisis but I guess I'm in too many places at once because that wasn't really the overall topic. I mean more to point out that if there are such large portions of an institution that are using it for nefarious purposes and that portion is violent enough to steer the course of the population as a whole then the whole thing is dangerous until the bad portions are rooted out. The thing about institutional change is it must come from within. The violent followers of Islam are never going to become peaceful from a bunch of kaffirs telling them about their own faith. It's going to take the peaceful followers to  right the ship.

       Nobody is focusing on the Catholic church being infiltrated by pedophiles when there won't be any Vatican left to worry about saving so long as Europe keeps importing so many people who hate their way of life and European governments are complicit in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say for arguments sake that you're right that the Quran doesn't promote pedophilia. The people you need to convince of that aren't non-Muslims. Nobody is going to care so long as child brides are still rampant amongst it's followers. For instance, many people dislike Christianity because so many of it's followers in the past did things like beating up or murdering gay people or whatever you want to call it. Jesus never advocated those things, though.

So now be sodomites, you Arabs.
Turn not away from it--
therein is wondrous pleasure.
Take some coy lad with kiss-curls
twisting on his temple
and ride as he stands like some gazelle
standing to her mate.
A lad whom all can see girt with sword
and belt not like your whore who has
to go veiled.
Make for smooth-faced boys and do your
very best to mount them, for women are
the mounts of the devils

       I would say a combination of 9/11 (and global Islamist terror back to the 80's);  media sensationalism and fearmongering; and just straight up propaganda.

      <p>
       Islam has plenty of problems (like Islamists and a variety of extremist sects), but white Christians have committed far more acts of terror on American soil than Muslims. But then white Christians are not the great "Other" we have been conditioned to fear and hate, so no one thinks twice or examines it much further.

       That said, it's pretty widely accepted that Aisha was a kid when she married Muhammad.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to Sunni scriptural Hadith sources, Aisha was six or seven years old when she was married to Muhammad with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached the age of nine or ten years old which is interpreted by many observers to indicate that she reached puberty at this age.

       The only person I can find that denies this a small female Muslim US author who tries to argue that various anti-feminist parts of the Quran and Hadiths are misinterpreted. Nobody that I can find takes her work seriously.

       You can't provide any sources, and so your point is invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just pluck random numbers out of thin air, cite them as your "research" without providing a link to your dates, come to a conclusion that differs wildly from general consensus (even in the Muslim world) and then not show anyone where you got your results from and how you got there. You absolute fucking moron.

       The fact that I'm even having to explain to this to you proves they you're a complete moron, or just a troll. Either way, please fuck off with your idiocy.

       Your not answering why the case shouldn't be public info. The drug dealers would be, wouldnt it? If your a follower of religion then there is a pretty good chance you've been lied to. Thats why most religions do their form of confirmation early in life. If they did it later in life the numbers might drop off after people recieve 12 years of education. Im not a hater of religion as many on Reddit are. I think going to church, temple, mosques is more or less just a way to network. Thier are scientists and engineers who go to religious services and then work on ways to blow up the world, save lives, put a person on Mars. Maybe they think that their just working out the details of their chosen God's magic/power. Im interested in why you think the 3 part trial should have a media blackout. Your right I live in America I am not a British citizen so if I could get your opinion on the trial being silenced, without Tommy being in the reason.
