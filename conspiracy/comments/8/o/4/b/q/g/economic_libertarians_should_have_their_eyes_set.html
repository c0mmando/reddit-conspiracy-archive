    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Economic libertarians&quot; aren&#39;t a fucking thing. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re American and you&#39;re thinking of libertarianism, I&#39;d bet you&#39;re thinking of anarcho-capitalism. &quot;Libertarian&quot; was only used in this context starting in like the 1950s. Before that, and presently in countries other than America, it referred to a much wider variety of political views. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism">Left-libertarianism</a> is a thing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">Libertarian Socialism</a> is a thing. Funny how that&#39;s all been <em>completely forgotten about</em> and people think we only have a choice between capitalist-dominated anarchy or the-state-owns-everything socialism. </p>

<p>P.s. any ignorant dipshits who go LOL MUH OXY MORON without reading the above links will be ignored. </p>

<p>P.p.s. an example of a libertarian socialist ideology would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>. </p>

American Liberals had adopted a term &quot;Libertarianism&quot; since then,  so now  (after a term started to be recognizable) you are beginning to  claim that Libertarianism is leftist as well.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey guys let&#39;s check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Etymology">babby&#39;s first source</a> over at Wikipedia I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll back you up</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The use of the word &quot;libertarian&quot; to describe a new set of political positions has been traced to the French cognate, libertaire, coined in a letter French libertarian communist Joseph Déjacque wrote to mutualist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1857.[16][17][18] Déjacque also used the term for his anarchist publication Le Libertaire: Journal du Mouvement Social, which was printed from 9 June 1858 to 4 February 1861 in New York City.[19][20] In the mid-1890s, Sébastien Faure began publishing a new Le Libertaire while France&#39;s Third Republic enacted the lois scélérates (&quot;villainous laws&quot;), which banned anarchist publications in France. Libertarianism has frequently been used as a synonym for anarchism since this time.[21][22][23]</p>

<p>The term &quot;libertarianism&quot; was first used in the United States as a synonym for classic liberalism in May 1955 by writer Dean Russell, a colleague of Leonard Read and a classic liberal himself. He justified the choice of the word as follows: &quot;Many of us call ourselves &#39;liberals.&#39; And it is true that the word &#39;liberal&#39; once described persons who respected the individual and feared the use of mass compulsions. But the leftists have now corrupted that once-proud term to identify themselves and their program of more government ownership of property and more controls over persons. As a result, those of us who believe in freedom must explain that when we call ourselves liberals, we mean liberals in the uncorrupted classical sense. At best, this is awkward and subject to misunderstanding. Here is a suggestion: Let those of us who love liberty trade-mark and reserve for our own use the good and honorable word &#39;libertarian&#39;&quot;.[24]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh lol would you look at that, a communist describing himself as libertarian over a hundred years prior to its modern American usage. Oh, and again, the &quot;libertarian = anarcho-capitalism&quot; usage is <strong><em>the American usage</em></strong>, and it&#39;s utilized quite often in a leftist context in countries that aren&#39;t politically illiterate. This was in a letter to Proudhon, who was himself a libertarian- though a market anarchist (<strong><em>which is NOT an anarcho-capitalist</em></strong>)- and a leftist...</p>

<p>Feel free to rant and rave about how this is just fake history for leftists to steal your identity with though, later dude.</p>

<p>Also about the &quot;90 genders&quot;, LGBT, etc. keep in mind that in a free society it would be impossible to use &quot;tax money&quot; to propagandize/vociferate around these issues; similarly unproductive/parasitical oligarch-billionaires wouldn&#39;t exist, and so couldn&#39;t promote this stuff either. So the issue would naturally disappear from view (save for the .001 of guys who <em>actually</em> think they&#39;re Napoleon, a velociraptor or a woman, but they pose no danger and you can easily ignore them).</p>

<p>I suspect many of the &quot;conservative&quot; values you hold dear would naturally and organically re-emerge in a free society. There is no need to force anyone. Psychological distress is not a crime.</p>

<p>Since you seem to be aware about contracting rights and possible clauses in property contracts I will only add that Libertarians would even allow common (OMG, it&#39;s like communism!) ownership as long as all co-owners join this scheme voluntarily. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s a road to your house then maybe - I don&#39;t know - it&#39;s you (and your neighbors) who should pay to build it, and thus be the owner. I can even imagine that some of your neighbors would even insist to let your guests use this road for free.   </p>

<p>I will only add that Libertarians would even allow common (OMG, it&#39;s like communism!) ownership as long as all co-owners join this scheme voluntarily. </p>

<p>Except the most commonly mentioned method to get assets out of government hands is via an auction.  In the real world what would be the results of that auction?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it&#39;s a road to your house then maybe - I don&#39;t know - it&#39;s you (and your neighbors) who should pay to build it, and thus be the owner. I can even imagine that some of your neighbors would even insist to let your guests use this road for free. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve solved the problem of a blank state already once with land reforms after the collapse of feudalism. It wasn&#39;t exactly a smooth procedure and sometimes it took decades to normalize this mess, but we are still in a better state now than before.  </p>
