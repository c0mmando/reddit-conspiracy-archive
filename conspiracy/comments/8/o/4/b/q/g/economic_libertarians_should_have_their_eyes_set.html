       "Economic libertarians" aren't a fucking thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're American and you're thinking of libertarianism, I'd bet you're thinking of anarcho-capitalism. "Libertarian" was only used in this context starting in like the 1950s. Before that, and presently in countries other than America, it referred to a much wider variety of political views.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism">

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">

       is a thing. Funny how that's all been
       <em>
        completely forgotten about
       </em>
       and people think we only have a choice between capitalist-dominated anarchy or the-state-owns-everything socialism.

       American leftists have stolen a term "Liberalism", which, as in "Classical Liberalism" had originally meant exactly economic freedom build around private property, low taxes and state non-interventionism. American Liberals had adopted a term "Libertarianism" since then,  so now  (after a term started to be recognizable) you are beginning to  claim that Libertarianism is leftist as well. I am sick of you thieves who cannot even live without stealing words an language - so stick your Wikipedia links into your ass.

       Hey guys let's check
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Etymology">
        babby's first source
       </a>
       over at Wikipedia I'm sure that'll back you up
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The use of the word "libertarian" to describe a new set of political positions has been traced to the French cognate, libertaire, coined in a letter French libertarian communist Joseph Déjacque wrote to mutualist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1857.[16][17][18] Déjacque also used the term for his anarchist publication Le Libertaire: Journal du Mouvement Social, which was printed from 9 June 1858 to 4 February 1861 in New York City.[19][20] In the mid-1890s, Sébastien Faure began publishing a new Le Libertaire while France's Third Republic enacted the lois scélérates ("villainous laws"), which banned anarchist publications in France. Libertarianism has frequently been used as a synonym for anarchism since this time.[21][22][23]
       </p>
       <p>
        The term "libertarianism" was first used in the United States as a synonym for classic liberalism in May 1955 by writer Dean Russell, a colleague of Leonard Read and a classic liberal himself. He justified the choice of the word as follows: "Many of us call ourselves 'liberals.' And it is true that the word 'liberal' once described persons who respected the individual and feared the use of mass compulsions. But the leftists have now corrupted that once-proud term to identify themselves and their program of more government ownership of property and more controls over persons. As a result, those of us who believe in freedom must explain that when we call ourselves liberals, we mean liberals in the uncorrupted classical sense. At best, this is awkward and subject to misunderstanding. Here is a suggestion: Let those of us who love liberty trade-mark and reserve for our own use the good and honorable word 'libertarian'".[24]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh lol would you look at that, a communist describing himself as libertarian over a hundred years prior to its modern American usage. Oh, and again, the "libertarian = anarcho-capitalism" usage is
       <strong>
        <em>
         the American usage
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and it's utilized quite often in a leftist context in countries that aren't politically illiterate. This was in a letter to Proudhon, who was himself a libertarian- though a market anarchist (
       <strong>
        <em>
         which is NOT an anarcho-capitalist
        </em>
       </strong>
       )- and a leftist...
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to rant and rave about how this is just fake history for leftists to steal your identity with though, later dude.

       The bottom line is whether you understand the individuals' natural right to life and liberty, and whether you reject the initiation of violence. The rest is minute detail; it pertains more to identity and caricature.

       If we lived in a free society, you'd be free to produce/exchange/save (à la John Galt), or to voluntarily join (or form) your preferred collectivist commune (à la Auroville). What you'd choose is secondary, as long as you recognize everyone's right to similarly choose.

       Libertarians are ideological and dangerous. They're just as rigid as the left. They get it more right when it comes to markets but are willing to allow us to go down a road of zero moral compass in the name of anarchist type freedoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarians can't see the forest through the trees. They don't understand long-term consequences much the same way as the left; especially in social policies. They have a keen sense of the debt problem and all, but that's about it.

       No, I'm upset that we have 90 genders with no limit to the sheer stupidity of post-modernism leading this country into a devolving state of non-existent culture. You know, basically what the entire "slippery slope" argument of gay marriage was about. No one really cared about gay marriage, it was what would come
       <strong>
        after
       </strong>
       that had everyone scared. These same people were made fun of for their concerns, called paranoid and every pejorative in the book for it.

       Am I not free to think I'm Napoleon? As long as I don't coerce anyone to agree with me, why is it a problem to you? So what if a man thinks he's a woman, or a velociraptor?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also about the "90 genders", LGBT, etc. keep in mind that in a free society it would be impossible to use "tax money" to propagandize/vociferate around these issues; similarly unproductive/parasitical oligarch-billionaires wouldn't exist, and so couldn't promote this stuff either. So the issue would naturally disappear from view (save for the .001 of guys who
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       think they're Napoleon, a velociraptor or a woman, but they pose no danger and you can easily ignore them).
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect many of the "conservative" values you hold dear would naturally and organically re-emerge in a free society. There is no need to force anyone. Psychological distress is not a crime.

       I'll bite - privatization of roads is indeed problematic and will have to be done carefully (without restricting current rights of users of existing roads) but it's because you already created this mess of collectively managed infrastructure which will have to be fixed. There is no problem with private roads whatsoever in a state where a developer builds a NEW road with his own money because he would only increase consumers choices by this no matter how much he would wish to charge for its use.

       Since you seem to be aware about contracting rights and possible clauses in property contracts I will only add that Libertarians would even allow common (OMG, it's like communism!) ownership as long as all co-owners join this scheme voluntarily.

       If it's a road to your house then maybe - I don't know - it's you (and your neighbors) who should pay to build it, and thus be the owner. I can even imagine that some of your neighbors would even insist to let your guests use this road for free.

       Except the most commonly mentioned method to get assets out of government hands is via an auction.  In the real world what would be the results of that auction?

       I already mentioned that practical privatization is tricky and governments notoriously do it wrong and they just arbitrarily pick winners (again) in an economic game - but I'd still choose to be the victim of their one last fraud over being robbed constantly day in day out till the end of my life.

       We've solved the problem of a blank state already once with land reforms after the collapse of feudalism. It wasn't exactly a smooth procedure and sometimes it took decades to normalize this mess, but we are still in a better state now than before.
