       This is a repost of someone else's post, it is still very relevant
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to make this post for a long time because I have realized the depth of media manipulation and propaganda, it goes farther beyond what most people even think they do, and in fact it is so deep that even the TPTB are affected by their own lies. It's like we live in a self-perpetuating lie machine. I have to get this off my chest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not watching TV frequently but every now and then I go and see what my wife is watching in the living room (I don't allow TV in the bedroom), and it is almost like a mesmerizing hypnotic brainwashing that is going on, it's so unreal from a outside observer, and I bet she doesn't even realize it, I have said it to her many times but she always shrugged it off, not like she thinks I am crazy, she agrees with me in many topics, but more like she knows it's true, but still doesn't care about it, she loves the hypnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I went to my friends house for a weekend chat and beer, he always had to had the freakin TV on. I am just so annoyed by it now. We were just drinking beer and talking about our week and stuff in general, but we can't do that nicely in quiet or perhaps in the garden, the fkin TV always has to be on, as he was just catching up with the latest soccer game.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of like feel from the guy from the "They Live (1988)" movie. I am not mentally ill or paranoid, many shills already called me that, but that is not true, I am just disillusioned with the web of deception and braiwashing that has encroached humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am really disgusted by it, you can call it "I woke up" now, it's like seeing "the matrix" around you. Yes it's the fucking Television. I have talked about this in the past but let's do it again because it is just so horrible that this can't be left without words.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Television is the greatest scienfically engineered mass-brainwashing aparatus that has been erected since the history of humanity in order to brainwash, propagandize, control and influence the minds of people. It's a mind-control mechanism, as a literal meaning as it gets.
      </p>
      <p>
       • There was a post here a while ago that was talking about some ex-spook that admitted that the TV is a mind-control apparatus
      </p>
      <p>
       • Also some ex-spooks in their books have wrote that none of them have TV in their homes
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically nobody intelligent enough and wise enough is watching TV. The TV is almost like an IQ test, anyone who has a TV in his or her house is already a person who is not the wisest around, and the more TV a person watches the dumber it is, sometimes a self-fulfilling prophecy as studies have confirmed that TV is lowering cognitive abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's review the characteristics of the TV:
      </p>
      <p>
       • It's full of "programs" organized by a specific and repetitive format subdivided by topics into 2: serious &amp; non serious
      </p>
      <p>
       • The serious programs (news reports / political analysis) is often mixed with non-serious programs (entertainment /pop stuff) in order to confuse the subject and to blur the line between facts and fiction, so that the subject will lose it's ability to tell apart real events from fake ones
      </p>
      <p>
       • The serious programs are always presented in a quiet background sound, with bright colors, casters in authoritative clothing and accesories, with strong articulated and confident voices so that the newscast or political commentary always looks like "experts" know things better thus you should believe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Serious programs always have a Pavlovian rally sound before , inside and after the program in order to call the "dogs" to attention. Yes you are like a conditioned dog in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Serious programs also use all tricks under their sleeves from verbal propaganda, dirty debating tactics, all logical fallacies, and all other verbal and visual tricks to deceive you. They throw basically the entire propaganda manual at you during a 90 minute political analysis talk for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Non serious programs rely more on emotional manipulation and subtle if not subconscious propaganda. Subliminal messages, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       • All characters in entertainment follow a specific patterns, well crafted to fit their agenda, and they all pander to basic psychological weaknesses of humans:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Kids: Ads telling and illustrating to you how much you love your kids, so make sure you vaccinate them..
      </p>
      <p>
       • Elderly: You love your grandma so much and she smiles at you and you don't want to lose her too early, so make sure she gets the flu shot...
      </p>
      <p>
       • Wife: Your love of your life just got breast cancer, but don't give up just take her to chemotherapy even though the survival rate of chemo is well below 10%..
      </p>
      <p>
       • Africans: They will show you a lot of pictures of starving kids, therefore you must support the GMO research initiatives
      </p>
      <p>
       • Pets: Kitties are dying, oh my God! And it's all due to Global Warming (which has predicted Netherlands under water by 1970), now let's accept a 5% carbon tax now, for the kitties!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is both in ads as in regular movies and TV shows, I have literally seen all examples written above. I am not joking they are now doubling down on the brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The TV is tuned into 50/60 HZ which is proven to create a very suggestive state where people can be more influenced as it interferes with people's brainwaves. In fact the entire electrical grid is purposely tuned into this frequency.
      </p>
      <p>
       • There are daily and weekly talking points, which is a horrible propaganda tool, and after the time of the news is over it's quickly pulled out, and never to be remembered again. It basically forces you to talk and think about something and then it quickly makes you forget it after it's over. I think this causes serious brain damage in many people. Thoughts would naturally arise and fade away slowly,but the TV literally swaps major topics so frequently, than even the biggest news lose importance after 1 week or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Memory Hole: Old news are forgotten and then rewritten in order to gaslight humanity in perpetuum. Most of history is fake due to this effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's literally Orwellian, everything that Orwell wrote is true now, it also became a Telescreen with the new Smart-TV's now, so perhaps in the future the propaganda could be even more individually tailored, instead of having 1 program for every citizen, it could be showing totally different things to different viewers as AI progresses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate brainwashing would be individually tailored propaganda, it's already tailored by subgroups (kids watch cartoons in the morning, elderly in the afternoons and normal adults at the evening) it would be even more efficient if they would create a massive AI that would create automatic CGI-based propaganda individually tailored to every viewer. I guess this will come in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for now everything that Orwell wrote is true:
      </p>
      <p>
       • The news is repetitive and repeats the lies in a very hypnotizing manner
      </p>
      <p>
       • Everything that is objectively important is totally ignored, total media blackout
      </p>
      <p>
       • Everything that is trivial (like entertainment and pop garbage) is mass saturating the screen, just totally mass produced without end, soap operas, music shows, just flooding it entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Completely fabricated news stories are presented as real and they can talk about it for months, introducing total hoaxes portrayed as real
      </p>
      <p>
       • Bald faced pathological liars, who can lie even in their sleep, as anchors
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I go over to a friend and they all have their TV's on all day. They don't even realize it, it's just on as a background noise, somehow they don't feel comfortable now in silence they must have the damn TV spewing noise out all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the TV literally uses rally sounds to call the sheeps to attention when something important is happening. You must watch the 1984 movie, it's exactly like that, when the voice in the TV said something like: "Attention Citizen, the Forces of Eurasia have been defeated, more news at 6 o'clock!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basically just rally points like that which are BS and they might not even be real, but the point is to call the sheep to rally to make sure it obeys you. So the TV is totally conditioning people like this, make sure you watch the "6 o'clock news citizen".
      </p>
      <p>
       Another disturbing element I found is when they list you the timetable of the programs. I was just at my friend when this happened, the TV guy started listing out the timetable of the programs for the entire week. Sure you can look that up on the internet, but I don't think this was for informing purposes it was again like a Pavlovian conditioning, to get the sheep know it's routine:
      </p>
      <p>
       • You must watch the 8 o'clock morning talk show!
      </p>
      <p>
       • You must watch the 6 o'clock news
      </p>
      <p>
       • You must watch the 8 o'clock political commentary
      </p>
      <p>
       • You must watch movie X at 10 o'clock
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it's basically shaping people's minds but it's also like a drill, it drills the programs into your head so that you will be like a dog that responds to certain stimulii. It will make you addicted to the shows and it will make you very focused when an update is coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was so bizarre for me to just see all of that going on at my friend with an open eye. After deprogramming it certainly shows you a different world and now I can see every single propaganda element in the TV, all of it. It was like an epiphany, the moment you realize how deep the brainwashing is, and how your reality is fabricated by a fucking box, and you are not even angry about that how silly that sounds, then you will realize the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a slave Neo, a prisoner in a mental prison created by a 100 cm black box.

       Me personally. I hate and i mean hate all t.v. I call it the MKUltra box and think it is dumbing down our population. I mean there is a reason it has been refered to as the idiot box. There are even studies that prove it reduces intelligence at only, i repeat only 4 hours a day. I know some people that watch that shit every waking hour of the day. They have it on just for background noise. If you asked me they are "addicted" to their programming, talk about mind kontrol.

       Hey Op, I had the same bullshit with my ex-gf. It was fucking scary. I'd be over on the recliner on my laptop, and I'd look over at her, and her face and posture was glowing and locked-in to that TV with fully acute facial expressions. If you interrupt them, they unlock from the vice grip, and look over at you with a deadened empty look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Invariable she'd be in a pissed off mood after watching these shows all night, staring bright eyed at the stream of propaganda on a 60" LED. I called her out on many times, and also called-out the bullshit Marxist propaganda. Then she was pissed off for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it was mentioned but another powerful method of programming. How the presenter frames each story. Judy Wo oodruf style. Insanely sad and worried eyes, with a syrupy, frightened tone asking the guest about the subject, etc. Talk about slanting shit.

        Hey Op, I had the same bullshit with my ex-gf. It was fucking scary. I'd be over on the recliner on my laptop, and I'd look over at her, and her face and posture was glowing and locked-in to that TV with fully acute facial expressions. If you interrupt them, they unlock from the vice grip, and look over at you with a deadened empty look. 
Yea they hit that alpha wave state in 30 seconds or less. Im surprized they dont start drooling
Invariably, she'd be in a pissed off mood after watching these shows all night, staring bright eyed at the stream of propaganda on a 60" LED. I called her out on it many times, and also called-out the bullshit Marxist propaganda. Then she was pissed off for sure.
It seems to me they use subtle fear projection to manipulate them into some sort of curiosity/fear feedback loop and that "locks em in. 
Maybe it was mentioned but another powerful method of programming. How the presenter frames each story. Judy Woodruf style. Insanely sad and worried eyes, with a syrupy, frightened tone asking the guest about the subject, etc. Talk about slanting shit. 
Yep Tavistock has studied this in detail. They know how to use NLP(neuro linguistic programming, mirror neurons etc) to get the xesired effect. Its like a science at this point.

       I think that he may have missed the fact that the screens are able to connect us as well. Not that I think he is wrong, but I think the idea that getting our information and entertainment will lead us to be pacified is not entirely correct.

       The revolution will take place in the mind. The change first starts with the mind. That's what "the revolution will not be televised" is all about. You gotta change your mind before you can change the world.

       Thank you for writing up this informative post. I agree with everything you've typed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have started to put loud, continuously playing, Televisions into the fucking GAS PUMPS where I live. IT. IS. INFURIATING. The last thing I fucking want when pumping gas is to hear ads droning on, see what the latest Lebron James highlight is, or hear whatever "newsy" shit they happen to be playing. It's insane I don't have a choice and have to hear this crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also feel the same about advertisements in general. Ads, especially television ads, cause me to react with extreme anger. I hate them with a burning passion. They are so damn manipulative and brainwashing it's insane.

       Yes it is so intrusive nowadays. Very irritating. I have to live with three tv junkies and man i just want some peace ans quiet. That old saying rings true. Silence is golden. We gotta try to change the direction we are heading in this worls or we are screwed. Mindless robots marching to their destruction and having a blast soong it... Ugh

       in my area the 2nd button down on the right-hand side will mute the ad if you press it. tv still plays but no sound. didn't believe it when someone told me but was so annoyed that i tried it one day - it worked. people have even started carving in "mute" under the button at my local station. glad to see this pisses other people off, shits getting wild yo!

       Thank you so much for this tip! Next time I get gas I will try pressing all the buttons. May even bring a sharpie so I can label the button as well. I love to help out anonymous humans that feel the same way in that arena.

       Now this is from 2001/2003, technology has been growing at an expotential rate since ever then. Makes me wonder what they found out and added until now?
      </p>
      <p>
       btw: I just read into my countries (Germany) "fundamental rights" and noticed they only state
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (2) Jeder hat das Recht auf Leben und körperliche Unversehrtheit. Die Freiheit der Person ist unverletzlich. In diese Rechte darf nur auf Grund eines Gesetzes eingegriffen werden.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It states that we have the right for physical integrity, it doesn't say anything about psychological integrity... I was assuming being manipulated via such methods would be unlawful, but it actually isn't... This is pretty fucked up.

       not only IQ, but even health and wealth would be drastically increased if I switched from watching TV to reading books. Yet, despite fully believing it, i still watch TV after coming home from work to relax, numb out the existential dread. I've definitely stopped watching news, the news channels in india are on a whole different level of cringe that would make your CNN and Fox News look like Discovery Channel. I've stopped watching cable TV programmes because an insane amount of ads are shown in india. Netflix is the dope i'm on right now, it's bad too but much less worse than cable TV.

       It's about the content, not about the medium. YouTube, Netfli and all that are just as much TPTB-tools as cable TV. You're still being programmed, just in a different way.

       entire family is addicted to television. I just get up and go to a different room when it comes on. I wonder if they actually notice my absence; do they wonder why I’ve left? or is it absurd to assume that television addicts are this observant in the first place?

       it doesn’t matter. 5 minutes later the trance is complete, and all else is forgotten.

       No thats exactly it man, the are oblivious to what is going on because they are entrance "hypnotized" they dont even realize they are being programmed. Once the shows over they are left in a state of confusion from going back to a extremely weak beta state of thinking. See they wanna keep is in alpha "fantasy land" and mever in beta unless we are working. Beta is for being aware and critically thinking. Never a good thing for TPTB unless you are slaving away at your job.

       There's a very specific face people make when they're absorbed by TV and their phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's this relaxed, melted look. Their eyes go dead, their face goes blank and unnaturally relaxed. They physically lock into one position. They feel nothing, think nothing. The only movement is either across the screen or from the food to their grease outlined piehole.

       Depends on what you do on them but actually yes. I have read about how when you open your phone by swiping its like pulling the lever at a casino and the samw thing applies to "likes" on fb etc. Even upvotes on reddit manipulate your dopamime system. We are being programmed in so many waya it is unbelievable. I shohld find that video where the makers of facebook admited to "hacking our brains on purpose"

       I cannot sleep at night unless my set is on....It's a habit acquired from living in a loud university neighborhood and being a late shift worker. 
Aside from commercials, it really doesn't bother me. It's background noise to me, nothing more. If I want to watch something in particular, I just DVR it.

       Or you could just not take it so seriously. I dunno what to tell someone who is shook from watching some violence and sex. It's just a show. I'd argue that TV in moderation (a few hours a week) mixed with other outlets of entertainment (reading, spending time with the kiddos outside, etc) isn't nearly as damaging as OP may think.

       Don't go hard on your wife (I know you aren't), assuming she's already been manipulated, uncovering "the truth" would lead to congnitive dissonance questioning her whole reality, which leads to dismissing it and not caring about it. That's a totally healthy reaction to it.

       I wouldn't be surprised if cancer or other health problems are sometimes manifested due to TV usage. I could care less about TV since I don't have or watch it, but I'm concerned about the entrainment or similar manipulations on the smartphone or the PC because those are things that I can't see myself stopping.

       Yeah man, screw TV. One of my neighbors recently got cable, and I decided to go over to hang out and what not one night. I'm sure it was the weed, but man TV looked so evil to me. It's like I saw right through it. I haven't watched or had cable in years, maybe since like 2013. I saw television in a way I hadn't seen it in before. It wasn't even interesting to me tbh. Brainwashing at its finest. I'm just surprised my friend, along with people around the world, have not seen how much time is wasted watching TV, and how little you actually pay attention to what's actually on.

       Yea i know what youre talking about. I used to hang out with a friend of mine and i never really went inside on a weekend but came in one day and what do you know the pizzagate story about the shooter was on. I told my bud all about it and they looked realy surprized. Tv is evil for sure and the weed makes it apparent especially the longer you have gone without watching it.

       I love watching shows where characters use quaint English, such as "Poldark", just to hear the weird ways they insult each other. Other than watching a bit of sports once in a while I don't really care about TV.

       My mother watches TV ALL  DAY and can hardly feed herself.  If the TV satellite goes off I have to go to her house and try to fix it!  I have to feed her dog because she can't do this simple task!  I tell her to give the dog away but she is too attached to the animal!!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious what a scam the TV is!  I see Steve Harvey and  Doctor Phil making millions and I think to myself who would pay these ugly clowns to do anything!?  They get paid to continue the narrative and if they stray from this story they are gone instantly.  Think about it!  Harvey and Phil couldn't really produce one thing of true value even if their was a gun to their head.  They are paid by TPTB to do what they do.
