Now I know there&#39;s ET&#39;s out there (and if you don&#39;t you&#39;re a lost cause) and I know for a fact the government keeps secrets from us. I figure the government or &quot;super power&quot; is 40-60 years ahead of us technology wise so keep that in mind. If you do some research you&#39;ll come across footage of synthetic clouds being released in the air and not only that, but you can also find evidence of physical weather change that should be impossible. Now to explain the simulation aspect. I put this on my life when I say a friend and I witnessed the big dipper switch to an orange color and then watched as all the stars dropped. We literally watched the big dipper fall apart in the sky. Fast-forward 30-45 minutes and we go outside to find the big dipper completely intact directly above us even though we witnessed fall directly in front of us. Now if we aren&#39;t in some type of geometric simulation, please explain what we witnessed and how we can now alter weather patterns?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to believe in this theory you have to have faith in god. Now I&#39;m no atheist, but I believe there&#39;s a higher power and a lower power. I love the idea of god, but It just seems too easy (if that makes sense) you can always jump to saying god created the earth and everything that inhabits it because that&#39;s what we were taught growing up. Sorry, I really do appreciate you showing me this! It&#39;s just me as a person, after witnessing a ufo in a busy neighborhood for almost 3 minutes without anyone else seeing it has left me to think that what we know as our world is nothing like we thought. Put yourself in my shoes. You&#39;re 13 and so deppresed that you have no will for life whatsoever. You grew up feeling like you weren&#39;t meant to be here and that earth isn&#39;t home, but one day you see the unimaginable and because of seeing this ufo it gave you a better perspective on life. It basically showed me I&#39;m here for a reason and it&#39;s honestly what drove me through most of my teenage life. Now because of this, I myself will always know there&#39;s other life and since there&#39;s other life then could it be that god was maybe an alien himself? So many crazy theory&#39;s pop into my head on what god really is, but it&#39;s something we will probably never know and that disgusts me as a human being ðŸ˜ª</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IDK what phone you have that can take a video of space and get every detail. Why do you think there&#39;s no real photos of UFOs? Because the government makes it so we can&#39;t even film them with our mobile phones. Now getting a meteor shower on a phone can be great quality because how bright they light up the sky, but trying to zoom in from miles away on a constellation is physically impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course! Mind you I live next to area 51 but we&#39;ve watched 15-20 planes one after another spraying chemtrails that were ridiculously noticable, but the scary thing was that when the plane would just leave our eye sight a new one would fly right over our head as if it was the same plane going into a wormhole. These planes were all the exact same in looks and movements which leads me to believe it was the same plane because we could look on the other side of the house and see no plane in sight but once the plane in front of us just barley disappears a new one appeared. Things like this rattle the hell out of me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah those &quot;sun simulator&quot; videos really weird me out. Would def recommend reading &#39;The Holographic Universe&#39; by Michael Talbot. Who knows what the f is going on, gave flat earth videos a shot but think hollow earth with some sort of protective field around our atmosphere to keep extraterrestrial influence to a minimum to be a more plausible theory in this matrix of reality. If you think it&#39;s a simulation as well you should check out remote viewing, crystals, chaos magick, &amp; all those other occult/hermetic tools for hacking the matrix. I&#39;m starting to believe in a lot of that stuff, sacred geometry is also quite fascinating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You explained pretty much the other theory I was leaning towards. What if we are in a dome and we can&#39;t see what&#39;s actually happening in the sky? for all we know there&#39;s a full on war in the sky&#39;s that is covered by chemtrails and other crazy shit? But again, I&#39;ve witnessed a ufo and it wasn&#39;t even 4 stories above me. I&#39;m told the reason I seen it was because the ETs lowered their frequencies to match what I&#39;m use to on earth and that&#39;s the reason there was no noise coming from the ship etc.. so if that&#39;s true then how are they breaking the barrier we are surrounded by? I have so many theory&#39;s and ideas that we can go on forever trying to explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all know the trick where you grab a 3 hole sheet of paper and you fold it to show the quickest way from a to be isn&#39;t straight, it&#39;s through blackholes/wormholes or whatever you wanna call it. Now take into consideration they&#39;re hundreds of years ahead of us technology wise. They can open holes in space and travel straight to earth. If they are advanced as we think they are then what we have protecting us (if it is some type of dome) then they can penetrate straight through it. This leads me to believe that we have something protecting us that we haven&#39;t yet thought off. In all actuality, it&#39;s easier to believe at this point that we are just a tv show for ETs and they control this simulated earth we are now or have been in.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gdzzcAocDaY">https://youtu.be/gdzzcAocDaY</a></p>

<p>He talks about an ancient alien race that transcends time &amp; space that uses all dimensions below them as a battery. I&#39;m halfway believing that aliens don&#39;t exist &amp; it&#39;s a rich man&#39;s trick &amp; I&#39;m halfway believing Blue Avians, Dracos/Reptilians, Archons/Annunaki, Mantids, 4th dimensional humans, &amp; the whole lot exist. The thing I find amusing that I like to envision are the galactic wardens, space cowboys that go around keeping the peace. I just picture them handing out parking tickets on spacecrafts &amp; settling domestic disputes among an intergalactic couple lol.</p>
