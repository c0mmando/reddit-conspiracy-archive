       I can't get links to post from mobile. There is a group of vets out in Arizona that were looking for homeless vets. They stumbled upon sex trafficking camps. LEO and other government agencies refusing to help. The land they found the camps on has been leased out for over 30 years to a mexican company called cemex. Their CEO just turned up murdered not long ago. Lots of ties to Soros, Clinton's. And from what I read the rothschilds. Look into it  I can't get links to work or I would post them.

       You need to add the /s. You can see that accounts have already tried to appeal to authority and seriously insinuated that because the police found nothing there is nothing more to this. Fucked up logic for sure but their fight is to keep new users from waking up. But I am with you, the authorities are most likely complicit

       i liked the theory that signalling /s just helps to train the shillbots and help them better discern what a comment is saying (and how to respond to it). however you're right, in this case clarity is needed

       Nope no team sorry, you're just a believer. I have some more stories you might be interested in, humpty dumpty is a good one.
But being a believer I guess I'm a part of big pharma ready to mind control your pizza.

       Apparantly having a brain with rational and reasonable logic and seeing conjecture and mentally ill people is a tactic. I can see it too, these people want to believe, so they will run with whatever "evidence" they have tampered with.

       Naw dude, they just do the same thing we do to them....story comes out that makes US and/or US Politicians look bad, they go out of their way to disseminate it. We do the same thing; all that shit with Skripal? Anything that makes Putin look like a bad dude, you'll see it plastered all over the post....he's helping assad, he's helping iran, big evil fuckin russkies looking to take over the world with their shitty out-dated soviet-era military.

       We even have a meme....'In russia' and then pictures of drunken idiots in the sticks in 3d world conditions doing idiotic things. Do you think that's 'just what russia is like?'. No, our lens of Russia is distorted through propaganda. It's probably the same for us over there....just like we think they're all drunks in track suits, they probably think we're all school shooters on walmart scooters.

       Only one things for certain, that ain't no homeless camp. The most compelling evidence is the testimony from the locals who swear this is an active cartel sight and describe the same gringo with 4 bloodhounds who has threatened some locals in the past with a gun.

       The guy that the police are saying did the four murders is connected to all four of the people killed through a divorce/child custody case that has been ongoing since 2011. That seems like the obvious motive, but the guy who killed the four people is dead now (suicide in a hotel room) so who knows if he even actually was the killer.

       Ya. When a company that was basically given the contract to rebuild Haiti by the Clinton's has an alleged sex trafficking camp. That kind of thing opens up a world of possibilities. It's no suprise to me that the authorities are saying no evidence. That kind of chain could lead really high up the ladder. People have been paid high sums of money to keep their eyes and ears closed.

       Just to add another layer to the illogic… we know for a fact that there is extensive human trafficking across the border. This is not disputed. We also know there are camps along the way. People who have been trafficked report this, traffickers report this. Some cross voluntarily, others are forced. Some start voluntarily and then find themselves trapped.

       Human sex trafficking, which sadly involves children, is very profitable and very real. So why is it so unbelievable that someone may have found one of their camps along a known trafficking / cartel route?

       I've watched all these videos, I'm not 100% sold it's absolutely 100% for child trafficking.

       Could it not just be a homeless/border crossing camp?  Why does it have to be child sex trafficking?  What constitutes this leap?

       You don't have to be
       <em>
        convinced
       </em>
       it's a human / child trafficking camp. You just have to acknowledge there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that would be consistent with that conclusion (as well as a lot of unknowns) and agree that local and federal law enforcement ought to be serious about investigating and getting to the bottom of it. (Visiting, taking a cursory glance, and concluding nothing is amiss is the problem here.)

       They have investigated, they have said it's a homeless or border crossing camp.  They didn't find evidence of child sex trafficking.  Makes me wonder why it's being pushed here so hard.

       The video shows child toys, a child sized chair with restraints, and children's clothes (with blood on them). Pretty straight forward that kids were there.

       Do you not think families cross the border together?  And I can't say for sure that's blood or dirt or what it is from the video I saw. If you saw another that was clearer please link it.

       In a very recent video Craig Sawyer describes the 'holding chambers' and some very disturbing, as he dubs them, 'rape trees'.  W/O further video/evidence, if you believe he's being truthful, the clear message is that this was NOT a liveable camp of any kind...it was a detention center especially for children.

       I am more than a little concerned that this is a psy-op. Look up Craig Sawyer's wiki page. Scroll down to the people he has worked with and his current profession. Throw in the fact that the way they have gone about everything on this "mission" runs the risk of destroying the evidence and has likely made the evidence in-admissable in court. I worry that if this goes viral and is then later found to be a hoax, it will greatly damage the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am only skeptical about this, not rulling it out. But there is more than enough reason to be skeptical about this.

       We need professionals and someone official down there to verify all of this. ASAP.

       It's probably is too early to draw any assumptions or make any connections but they also had 4 killed in Arizona that were pretty high profile. According to another post here in this sub. The forensic psychologist that worked the Jon Bennett Ramsey case was killed along with a hypnotherapist. The suspect they had in mind was found killed! What the hell. Sure is a lot of ruckus out of a normally really quiet area of the country.

I only spent 30-days in Tucson and it was anything but that.

       Blatant cartel activity, gang violence, and fun fact: one of the biggest "successful" bank heists in American history was committed there.
And by successful I mean, there were no convictions in the case.

       But there is a video of a hole, 100% proof of child trafficking, right?  And a naked Barbie doll, and Hi Maddie written on scrap wood.  What more proof do you think this sub needs?  We're taking this little bit and running with it!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I think about it, my neighbor had a naked Barbie on his yard sale this weekend (10 cents), and I saw an empty pizza box in his trash the week before, that's all the evidence we need to claim he's a pedo too!

       You need to add the /s. You can see that accounts have already tried to appeal to authority and seriously insinuated that because the police found nothing there is nothing more to this. Fucked up logic for sure but their fight is to keep new users from waking up. But I am with you, the authorities are most likely complicit
