       Could you humor me and elaborate? I already have a preconceived notion about that area that aligns with that sentiment. But several people I worry about are relocating to that area in the near future and id like to hear more.

       Just stay away from South Phoenix and you're fine. It's really easy to do, there's no reason to go there. Besides being hot your post could be applied to pretty much anywhere. Shit can happen anywhere.

       Yeah, I've been in Phoenix for 8 years now and can also say probably the safest out of the top five most populated cities by far. Grew up in California where you would see gangs daily. Moved to Phoenix and have yet to see a legit gang.

       My grandma lived in Scottsdale, so my family would go down and visit her every summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think, in any place where there's a lot of old people, the young people are weird. Florida is like this. Couple different types of people in AZ: Geriatrics, Desert Monsters, Younger popular all-american people, younger very very weird serial-killer vibe people. There's also a lot of mexicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously Meth exacerbates this situation. That's everywhere, but shit is weird enough without the meth. I remember walking through my Grandma's little white picket fence suburban neighborhood, and looking over, and there was a kid about my age in the driveway just torturing a cat. Had it pinned down, was stabbing it, it's tail had been cut off. There was an old person sitting on their lawn across the street, seemed to be totally oblivious to this kittens yelps. The kid glared at me and I walked on, I was too young to really grasp how fucking out of pocket that was.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the type of place where it's too hot to be outside, so all the younger people dress like surfers and hang out at the mall. They have to. They're forced to be mall kids. Something predatory and territorial about those kids that hang out in malls. They're not there to shop. I don't know....always got weird vibes.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, if you like golf, it's got amazing links. The painted desert, Monument Valley are all BREATHTAKING. Truly gorgeous. If you don't mind the desert life, Sedona is pretty nice...I'll bet it's weird too, if you live there though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know....what kind of person would voluntarily live in a desert? Weird ones, I'd say. Or old people that are cold all the time. That's pretty much AZ.

       I would have kicked that kids ass and saved the kitty if I could. I'd also call police, kid probably is a serial killer now. And a large desert is just the place for it.

       I mean, you can enjoy yourself in a fashion where you don’t have to see those elements. 
I look at the Phoenix area as a whole, despite its vastness. The hints that it holds within its walls are but a cocktail of “sin”, for lack of better wording.

       The desert is just a different animal altogether, IMO. If you are not from there, it just has an odd vibe. Don't get me wrong, I have loved my visits to various desert places, I could just never live and feel at home out there.

       I concur. I was forced there beyond my will as a teen...I turned into a monster. Finally escaped last year and life is so much better. AZ is a black hole. I swear you forget there is an outside world. Mind control must work better in the miserable desert.

       Everyone keeps latching onto the fact the first guy killed, Steven Pitt, was a famous forensic psychologist who worked on the Joan Bennet murder at some point.  The more bizarre fact in this story to me is the fourth murder was of a hypnoterapist,
       <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/06/marshall-levine/">
        Marshall Levine
       </a>
       .  Maybe I'm reading too much into him being a hypnoterapist.  In my community they are all old woman who love crystals and still rocking the hippy look.  This guy has a PHD in psychology, his dissertation for his PHD was on the invasion of privacy from the Invader's point of view, and he is employed by Fema as a second responder for a man made catastrophic event (biological, chemical or nuclear disaster.

       All 4 were related in terms of family court/divorce handlings. Most likely the suspect was just a disgruntled divorcee who went after those who opposed him. Not exactly thrilling

       The search for the Baseline killer was severely sabotaged because a (possibly hypnotized) man named James Dewayne Mullins admitted to one of the murders. Mullins later changed his story when it was pointed out to him that forensic evidence conflicted with his story. Also, police sat on DNA evidence for 9 months.
