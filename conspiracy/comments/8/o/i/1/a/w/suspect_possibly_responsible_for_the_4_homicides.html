    <div class="md"><p>My grandma lived in Scottsdale, so my family would go down and visit her every summer.</p>

<p>I think, in any place where there&#39;s a lot of old people, the young people are weird. Florida is like this. Couple different types of people in AZ: Geriatrics, Desert Monsters, Younger popular all-american people, younger very very weird serial-killer vibe people. There&#39;s also a lot of mexicans.</p>

<p>Obviously Meth exacerbates this situation. That&#39;s everywhere, but shit is weird enough without the meth. I remember walking through my Grandma&#39;s little white picket fence suburban neighborhood, and looking over, and there was a kid about my age in the driveway just torturing a cat. Had it pinned down, was stabbing it, it&#39;s tail had been cut off. There was an old person sitting on their lawn across the street, seemed to be totally oblivious to this kittens yelps. The kid glared at me and I walked on, I was too young to really grasp how fucking out of pocket that was. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the type of place where it&#39;s too hot to be outside, so all the younger people dress like surfers and hang out at the mall. They have to. They&#39;re forced to be mall kids. Something predatory and territorial about those kids that hang out in malls. They&#39;re not there to shop. I don&#39;t know....always got weird vibes.</p>

<p>That being said, if you like golf, it&#39;s got amazing links. The painted desert, Monument Valley are all BREATHTAKING. Truly gorgeous. If you don&#39;t mind the desert life, Sedona is pretty nice...I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s weird too, if you live there though.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know....what kind of person would voluntarily live in a desert? Weird ones, I&#39;d say. Or old people that are cold all the time. That&#39;s pretty much AZ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone keeps latching onto the fact the first guy killed, Steven Pitt, was a famous forensic psychologist who worked on the Joan Bennet murder at some point.  The more bizarre fact in this story to me is the fourth murder was of a hypnoterapist, <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/06/marshall-levine/">Marshall Levine</a>.  Maybe I&#39;m reading too much into him being a hypnoterapist.  In my community they are all old woman who love crystals and still rocking the hippy look.  This guy has a PHD in psychology, his dissertation for his PHD was on the invasion of privacy from the Invader&#39;s point of view, and he is employed by Fema as a second responder for a man made catastrophic event (biological, chemical or nuclear disaster.</p>
