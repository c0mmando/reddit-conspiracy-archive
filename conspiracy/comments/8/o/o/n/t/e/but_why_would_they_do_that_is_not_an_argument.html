They even had the black box recording of the passengers and crew plotting how to take the plane back despite not having a pilot and you could hear the terrorists being beaten to death.

    <div class="md"><p>The things that&#39;s gets me are the phone calls. Mobile phones even to this day don&#39;t work on planes for longer then about 30 seconds due to flying in and out of range of various signal towers. Some calls lasted more then 20 minutes and none of them had any background noise. One call even ends with a whispered &quot;it&#39;s a fake&quot; as if the people were being forced to make these calls from a secure location. The phone calls for me are damning, you don&#39;t need to be an architect or a engineer to know that these calls were not possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had the benefit off witnessing this unfold. We saw tower 7 reported as collapsed as it stood behind the reporter announcing it. We saw false witness testimonies like the guy at the pentagon who said a passenger plane flew so close to him and so slowly he could read the airline make and model, we also saw as he explained that same passenger jet disappeared over a hill that was about two feet tall. We saw brian Jennings and countless witnesses (all of whom are now dead) talk about explosions in the basements of the buildings. Jennings head was covered as they escorted him out of tower 7 because &quot;there were bodies everywhere&quot; - in tower 7, bodies which Jennings never stepped around or over. Why did the police tell him that? In tower 7?</p>

<p>We had the benefit of being old enough to see this for what it was and this is why it&#39;s important we never shut up about it because unless you were watching it unfold you miss the impact of it and the sheer amount of bullshit information put out there. </p>

<p>7/7 is the same but if you ask the general public about 9/11 in the UK most will say it&#39;s dodgy, ask about 7/7 and they give you a blank stare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the impression I&#39;ve always gotten from people is that they believe the official story when it comes to 9/11. Some may say that the following war had more to do with oil then Bin Laden but most believe that planes hit the towers and Pentagon. </p>

<p>As for 7/7, most people believe the official story here because it&#39;s not the first time terrorist have bombed London in that manor. People who grew up through the troubles in Ireland are all too familiar with terrorists targeting the capital, so the idea of a couple blowing up some backpack bombs on the tube and a bus is perfectly believable. Hell, thanks to tv shows most people think making explosives in your garden shed is so easy a child could do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flight 93 is the one that ended up in a field. That still leaves Flight 77. What happened to that plane? What happened to those people? Where was the easiest place to get rid of this plane? Why would they bother to use two other aircraft to fly into the Towers, but then decide they couldn&#39;t do the same to the pentagon? Why risk people on the ground witnessing either a missile, or fake aircraft evidence strewn about the grounds?   </p>

<p>I swear the whole Missile meme was made up by the government to just make all truthers look bad. It raises far more questions than it answers. Maybe it was an inside job, but if I was planning that inside job there is no scenario where disappearing a plane and using a missile instead when you already have a perfectly good Pentagon to throw it into is sitting right there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because planes didn&#39;t hit the towers. I&#39;ll not dispute two objects that looked like planes hit the towers, but they were not planes. For one I have worked at British aerospace in Middleton in England and despite what you might think there would not be a plane shaped hole. Wings fold in on impact easily, they are designed to do this so planes did not make those holes. People on the ground did report it wasn&#39;t a plane at the time, others reported a military jet, all grey. Then we were told &quot;not to believe first hand accounts as they are unreliable&quot;. They didn&#39;t need a plane for the pentagon because they had already paid actors to go on the news and lie, and lie they did just not very well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, now your theory has 4 planes that must be disappeared. I&#39;d submit that &quot;literally anywhere&quot; also includes flying into the buildings. In fact, if you have 4 planes you need to make sure are never found to discredit your entire conspiracy, the best place for them is right where everyone thinks they are. </p>

<p>Some of us have connections we trust to people on the ground in DC who gave private first-hand accounts it was a plane. I&#39;m been having this stupid debate since the weeks after the event. I&#39;m too old. There is a reasonable conspiracy buried underneath the mountain of bad theories that have built up about nitpicking engineering details. It involves 19 men who got on 4 airplanes that crashed where everyone saw them crash. It isn&#39;t logical to think they would go anywhere else in the world, as that would risk whatever conspiracy you have planned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I beg to differ. I know for a fact planes couldn&#39;t make those holes. I have also been having these debates since it happened but clearly you are not here to discuss. A missile hit the pentagon, that is why there is no footage of it happening and false witnesses. You seem to think it&#39;s difficult to dress a plane up as a missile. We know for a fact that the passengers making those phone calls were not on a plane like they said they were because if they were they couldn&#39;t have made 20 minute phone calls to loved ones. That also means those calls were made under duress because it was a blatent lie. So the planes either never took off, or landed soon after take off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have an answer, so rather than come up with arguments you attack me personally. The thing about toxic conspiracy (as opposed to reality-based conspiracy) is that it is, in fact, a different kind of security blanket. It gives you power to feel like you know things others do not. </p>

<p>Good people covered up what happened in Iraq because if the truth got out, the world would burn to the ground. Muslims would have good reason to try another 9/11 every day. That should keep you up at night. </p>

<p>Disappearing planes? Okay Chris Angel, I think it is time we finished here. If you are frustrated, it is because you have poor arguments. </p>

<p>The 19 hijackers could have been Muslim extremists, it isn&#39;t like ISIS wasn&#39;t able to find anyone to die for the cause. But given that the CIA handed guns to ISIS, it isn&#39;t unreasonable to raise real questions about the standard narrative. It is possible the 19 men were being manipulated by some shadow agency. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be the first time Americans were killed to get us into a war. But if they did, the best way to cover it up is spread the missile meme. It is a honeypot for the typical conspiracy crowd. It has taken on a life of its own. </p>

<p>Either go all the way and tell me that they used transdimensional alien magic through the secret powers of DMT to disappear the plane, or come back down to earth and make better arguments that don&#39;t easily frustrate you when questioned. </p>

Basically ask little pointless questions and lots of them to try and confuse and anger the user. How could anyone other then the government know that? I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a possibility, one of many hundreds of possible occurrences. You are aware they have closed air force bases pretty much all up the country? So it could be any of those. It wouldn&#39;t matter if civilians saw it land because at the time it wouldn&#39;t be landed planes were still in the air. All members of the army that deal with classified operations are made to sign a secrecy act which seals their mouths for at the least 40 years.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s the wrong question. Any answer you get to that is at best going to be speculation, at worst will be implausible speculation. </p>

<p>Just because someone not involved can&#39;t imagine why someone else did something, doesn&#39;t disprove that someone did something.</p>

<p>Also, the opposite applies-- The ultimate reason why someone would shoot a missile at the pentagon could be completely mundane and unsatisfying, like somebody&#39;s finger slipped. Or it could be spectacular, like to cover up the Army&#39;s missing Trillions, or it could be random, that Rumsfeld is a psychopath and the rest of government is embarrassed that he got his hands on a missile button. </p>

<p>The point is, you will never know. You are much better off asking questions examining the plausibility of the event itself than trying to assume a motivation and ascribing the plausibility to a random person&#39;s ability to imagine said motivation.</p>

<p>Is the debris consistent with a missile explosion? Is there footage of a missile from surveillance cams along the flight path of the airplane or missile? Is a passenger plane missing? Are there eyewitness accounts? -- These are all questions that presumably have concrete answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for taking the time to explain this. I want to clarify to everyone here that it isn&#39;t an invalid question. But you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head: We may never know exactly why. It&#39;s a never-ending rabbit hole. We can ask why why why all day. The truth simply IS. It is what it is. If you encounter a giant bigfoot are you going to keep asking why? You&#39;ll probably be more concerned about what the fuck just actually happened!</p>

<p>I argue that &quot;WHAT&quot; is the most important question in this forum. &quot;What is that? What could it be? What is it doing?&quot; The answer to &quot;what&quot; must always be objective, concrete. The answer to &quot;why&quot; isn&#39;t always important. It could be an opinion, emotion, feelings, whim, or straight up lies, fallacy, deceit. There might not be any reason at all! Sometimes people do things simply because they can!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not stopping anyone from asking questions. We all want answers. I just don&#39;t want anyone ending up in a feedback loop where there ARE no answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Can we all agree that we want to know WHAT really happened as well as WHY?</p>

<p>But which answer is more important? People can do things for any reason, and it doesn&#39;t even have to make sense! Therefore if someone can&#39;t give a &quot;good&quot; answer to WHY something happened, that doesn&#39;t disprove WHAT happened!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say a person named Johnny murders another person named Billy, with a knife. There were witnesses present and the knife was retrieved as evidence. In the courtroom, Johnny explains that he killed Billy for no good reason at all. It&#39;s not a good answer. What was Johnny&#39;s motive? Maybe he didn&#39;t like Billy. Maybe Billy was a bad, bad man. Or maybe Johnny is a fucking lunatic. Guess what? BILLY IS STILL FUCKING DEAD. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh so they would just kill thousands of people on 9/11....pffft&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which would seem like a good way to blow off any theory that would indicate the US goverment either allowed or orchestrated 9/11.  But to blow it off because you don&#39;t think the US government wouldn&#39;t use It&#39;s citizens as fodder is a joke.  Just look at Vietnam &amp; the Pentagon papers... Or the military spraying the people of STL, or lying us into war with Iraq... Both times.  </p>

<p>I see the same shit with Bildeberge &amp;  Bohemian grove... &quot;Their just a club, no big deal&quot;... But those same people would shit if Putin attended, but look the other way when It&#39;s the most powerful people in the world meeting off the record.  I can appreciate OP&#39;s point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one of the biggest problems this sub has is trying to tie each small conspiracy to a much larger conspiracy. I think among people here, there&#39;s a large variety in what they see is the overall narrative. Meaning that while people will often see the same base conspiracy, they will have very different final backers (NWO/Aliens/Reptilians/J00z/etc..)</p>

<p>By bringing each conspiracy back to the meta-conspiracy, it harms the research into the actual conspiracy at hand.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean there is no place to discuss meta-conspiracies. I just think that by immediately tying an incident to the larger picture, people end up alienating each other and causing needless dissent.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say most agree something is a false flag. We should work together to prove that, or at lease the falseness of the main narrative. If instead we argue over who exactly is the final puppet master we gain nothing.</p>

<p>The meta-conspiracy should be discussed separately from the conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is right, in a way, in my opinion. &quot;Why would they do that?&quot; shouldn&#39;t be used as a tool to shut down discussion.</p>

<p>In a sort of ironic way, that is actually pretty reflective of what people have come to believe you are supposed to do on the outside. It is essentially an application of Occam&#39;s razor. Occam&#39;s Razor is meant to be a way of simplifying arguments to help in critical thinking, but people take it too far and assume that it applies everywhere and furthermore, use it to shut down lines of questioning that are perfectly reasonable.</p>

<p>-X shooting was NOT a false flag involving crisis actors.. Why would they do that?</p>

<p>-It was a lone gunman what killed JFK, nobody else was involved.. why would they do that?</p>

<p>-The government did not dose people against their will and knowledge with LSD... Why would they do that?</p>

<p>-An airliner hit the pentagon, not a missile... why would they do that?</p>

<p>The implication is that if there is some nefarious agenda going on, a &quot;conspiracy&quot; if you will, that there is always a simpler way to achieve that agenda without doing anything nefarious. Therefore logically, there can never be a conspiracy, because &quot;Why would they do that?&quot;. In truth, you will probably never know why they would do that. But if you can narrow it down to 4-5 reasons, it could be very helpful in enhancing our ultimate understanding of the world. And sometimes the truth narrowed down to 4-5 possibilities is just as satisfying as the truth narrowed down to 1 possibility.</p>

<p>Where I differ with the OP is that I think it&#39;s OK to ask &quot;Why would they do that?&quot;, so long as it&#39;s a starting point, and not meant to end the discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree, I guess where I differ is I don&#39;t consider asking &quot;Why would they do that&quot; in and of itself to be a valid kind of debunking. It should be a starting question, not an ending question. So in a way I kind of agree that someone saying &quot;Nah bro, NO way that&#39;s a conspiracy because why would they do that??? it would be far easier to blah blah blah...&quot; is acting like a shill*.</p>

<p>But if someone goes &quot;OK, let&#39;s look at 911... Why would the government shoot a missile into the pentagon when they could have just flown a plane into it. Well here are 3 plausible reasons... let&#39;s discuss.&quot; This line of thinking might end with dismissing the idea that the government shot a missile into the pentagon, but at least we can get there through discussion and agreement. I would consider that to be useful debunking. </p>

<p>That being said, I know that it is in fact a valid form of debunking on the outside. Snopes uses this technique all the time. People in general use what I call &#39;courtroom logic&#39;, meaning one piece of information that does not conform to the argument can shut the whole thing down, all the time just to shut down arguments.</p>

<p>*Also, I&#39;m kind of wary of the word &#39;shill&#39; in the first place and assuming that because someone disagrees with you they must be paid to do so. Are there &#39;shills&#39; on this sub? Maybe, but I bet it&#39;s a vanishingly small population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can very easy become the end of a discussion, if the general mindset is that asking critical questions is more or less shilling. If the reaction to critical questions is not answering them, and instead calling the asker out as a shill, then it&#39;s kinda hard to go on from there. It is the people that get asked the questions who decide wether its a start or an end to the discussion.</p>

<p>Asking for peoples motives when outragous claims are made against those people, shouldn&#39;t  close a discussion down. Asking the question why someone else would do something, is asking the person making the claim, to somehow back it up with atleast some kind of motive, which would make said claim more believable or plausible and if no such backup to a claim is given, the claim hasn&#39;t been made anymore believable, and the fact that the person making the claim is refusing to back it up, makes you wonder why they wont do that - is it because they&#39;re simply not able to answer the question, is it because they know that they haven&#39;t got a point, or is it because they don&#39;t need anyone to believe what they&#39;re saying, or because they don&#39;t understand that people can disagree with them etc...  </p>

<p>It is a perfectly valid question to ask, and if people wont provide an answer to that question, why have they even entered a discussion, if they wont answer any questions, or they believe that people who ask questions must have some kind of agenda</p>

<p>However, and if I may be slightly contrarian, the argument you decry is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cui_bono">cui bono</a> - i.e. <em>who profits from the crime?</em> I think it is a valid reasoning, investigative, and rhetorical tool. Also, it actually <em>supports</em> conspiracy theories most of the time (when used properly).</p>

<p>They also have a reliance on using keyboards and written words to make their points, but i don&#39;t think anyone want to question when people do that - well unless they do it in bad faith...  </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t the actual problem be the alleged bad faith of those users, and not the methods they use? If someone uses valid methods to puncture another persons theory, that theory didn&#39;t stand up agaisnt scrutiny, and needs improving somehow, but i don&#39;t see how the person asking questions is responsible, when a theory can be punctured by a few questÃ­ons that the person making the theory refuse to answer.</p>

<p>Does it actually matter if a user posts in good or bad faith, when the theory they&#39;re questioning can&#39;t handle scrutiny?</p>

<p>There was no attempt to, for instance, use the Boston Bombings as justification for a new war or anything, so the lack of motive is a fair thing to bring up, as is any school shooting under a Republican-controlled congress. Any group capable enough of faking Sandy Hook AND Pulse AND Parkland AND Vegas, etc., could surely just lean on a few Senators instead. </p>

<p>&quot;Why would they do that&quot; should be asked about every single conspiracy theory (or fact) in existence.

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have an answer, so rather than come up with arguments you attack me personally. The thing about toxic conspiracy (as opposed to reality-based conspiracy) is that it is, in fact, a different kind of security blanket. It gives you power to feel like you know things others do not. </p>

<p>Good people covered up what happened in Iraq because if the truth got out, the world would burn to the ground. Muslims would have good reason to try another 9/11 every day. That should keep you up at night. </p>

<p>Disappearing planes? Okay Chris Angel, I think it is time we finished here. If you are frustrated, it is because you have poor arguments. </p>

<p>The 19 hijackers could have been Muslim extremists, it isn&#39;t like ISIS wasn&#39;t able to find anyone to die for the cause. But given that the CIA handed guns to ISIS, it isn&#39;t unreasonable to raise real questions about the standard narrative. It is possible the 19 men were being manipulated by some shadow agency. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be the first time Americans were killed to get us into a war. But if they did, the best way to cover it up is spread the missile meme. It is a honeypot for the typical conspiracy crowd. It has taken on a life of its own. </p>

<p>Either go all the way and tell me that they used transdimensional alien magic through the secret powers of DMT to disappear the plane, or come back down to earth and make better arguments that don&#39;t easily frustrate you when questioned. </p>
