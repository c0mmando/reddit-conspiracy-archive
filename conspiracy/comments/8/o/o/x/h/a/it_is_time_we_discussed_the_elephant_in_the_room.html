<p>Listen alright. Government conspiracies are reasonable. Corporate conspiracies are reasonable. Military and intelligence conspiracies are reasonable. That is because these groups are fairly closed off.</p>

<p>Saying science is covering shit up is beyond stupid since anyone and everyone can become a scientist. University libraries are public... in most places. This is free knowledge for anyone to check. </p>

<p>I dont think historians have the whole picture. Not by a long shot. Buy saying that historians are covering shit up is beyond stupid just because you cant be arsed to seek these books out. </p>

<p>Your eyes are open so damm wide you cant see shit. This is not about perception. This is about a scientific field doing the best they can with what little you have. And I cant stand... no i cant believe people as ignorant as you exist.</p>

<p>If you doubt a finding. If you doubt an entire field... then do what the scientific principle was founded on. Disprove it. Actually get off your ignorant ass pick up a book and start disproving it. Alright. This basic bitch science denial from some woke idiot isnt questioning shit. Its pissing in sand and calling it litterature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We shouldn&#39;t trust THEM. Physics is the quintessential science. It&#39;s far less political, and therefore far less prone to being distorted towards the biases of its stakeholders. Egyptology began as an aspect of European imperialism and colonialism, and it quickly became a battleground for religious zealots among the major faiths of the world. So there&#39;s an element of bigotry, and element of politics, and an element of religion all at play. It also is a field that suffered through to few interdisciplinary trained researchers. How much truth can an Egyptogist with no training in geology give you on the erosion patterns of the sphinx? Would it then surprise you to know that Geologists tend to view the sphinx as being much much older than Egyptologists have consistently claimed for over a century? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There may be people among them working for their own prestige and while doing so repressing paradigm shifts as these might render their own established views outdated.</p>

<p>A good example for this is egyptology, but in contrast to your opinion of history being fake it is just our current understanding of it based on what we currently know. Some things might be missunderstood but this does not have to be eveil intend. There are a lot of clues pointing to it going further back. Once and IF they are prooven as facts our view on history will be updated bit by bit. This is how it always worked.</p>

<p>And if we are unlucky we might go through another cycle of forgetting our past in another dark age. Our civilization is more fragile than it seems and a collapse can happen and a lot of knowledge be lost.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because the emotions of history have been distorted or disappeared altogether the further time moves along. </p>

<p>Alexander the Great is seen as a great man, who had high-minded ideals for the world. In reality, he was kind of a butcher.</p>

<p>Caesar is revered, and 2 conspirators of his assassination are being chewed by satan in Dante&#39;s Inferno. While he may have had some good ideas about governing, the guy was power hungry as hell, and also a butcher.</p>

<p>Same with Genghis Khan, Roman Emperors, and most others in power throughout history. This is not meant to discredit any accomplishments or actual high-minded ideals they have, just that it is much more of a grey area than &quot;monster&quot; or &quot;angelic savior of mankind and culture&quot;</p>

<p>I guarantee that several hundred years from now, many people will look and see what Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and George W. Bush did well, and how they advanced civilization for the better.</p>

<p>But to say that history may be falsified entirely is simply not true. You can find the original texts of classics, written in Koine Greek, Classical Latin, and Old Norse, among other languages no longer in conventional use. I find it hard to believe someone or some group would find a way to &quot;devolve&quot; languages simply to rewrite history. </p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m getting it all wrong, and I&#39;m an idiot for reading such history and believing it, for the most part (I love classical history, and spend a great amount of time learning about it). But I choose to believe otherwise.</p>

<p>The silver lining here is that other people who read this thread will notice how I am being attacked for merely questioning &#39;ancient history&#39;.</p>

<p>The same way we have all been attacked for questioning the official story of 9/11, the Syrian &#39;gas attacks&#39;, etc etc.</p>

<p>This is no coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a personal attack if it&#39;s <em>true</em>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really all about the truth and answering questions then humour me and explain this:</p>

<p>Why is that you avoid the issue such as when I asked you for actual evidence for your statement that ancient Greece is a hoax? Why did you use deflection rather than answer a simple question that you ask of others all the time?</p>

<p>Why couldn&#39;t you admit that you were using anecdotal evidence when you blanket-claimed that children will send their parents to nursing homes if they smell an inheritance? Why did you abandon the thread once I called you out?</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t you actually address the message when I challenged you to support your own claims with actual evidence and not second or third hand evidence? And instead called me grade school because 
I used lol?</p>

<p>How are you truly interested in improving the understanding of the world when you do not accept other people&#39;s first hand experience as evidence and yet you have no first hand evidence whatsoever of your own? It&#39;s appalling that in the &quot;Are all wars controlled&quot; thread that you simply don&#39;t accept another forum member&#39;s statement that he has been in a war and seen the bombs, fire, etc. That with NO evidence you claim what he said is not true and that all wars are fake. Not everyone in the world is a failure that lives off of others and has not seen the world. There are so many war-torn places around the world and just because you haven&#39;t seen it doesn&#39;t mean that wars are fake. Maybe you should leave your friend&#39;s or relative&#39;s house and see the real world a little. </p>

<p>And even more amusing is when you make a claim and the only evidence you provide is a link to your own youtube video or website. </p>

<p>The reason these aren&#39;t personal attacks is because it&#39;s true and backed with evidence. The evidence being your hypocrisy and illogical statements.</p>

<p>Whether or not &#39;ancient history&#39; is real or fabricated has nothing to do with me, or any other individual on this sub.</p>

<p>So why not focus on the evidence (or lack thereof) to support the stories we have been told about &#39;ancient Egypt&#39; and &#39;ancient Greece&#39;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re not open minded. You’re backtracking because you have ZERO actual evidence for your claims.

<p>You stink up this sub because you’re egotistical and intellectually dim. This is highlighted by your continued hypocrisy, rampant logical fallacies, double standard, and worst of all, lack of integrity to stand up for what you claim.

    <div class="md"><p>Fair question.</p>

<p>I used to believe in &#39;ancient history&#39; until I started looking for <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/primary-source-research-methodology/">primary sources</a>.</p>

<p>What I discovered shook me to the core of my miserable soul.</p>

<p>The thing is that the vast majority of people today -- including &#39;alternative thinkers&#39; and &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; -- don&#39;t even know what a primary source is, or why primary sources are so important when trying to build an understanding of what happened in the past.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t blame them for that, because I also left school as a lemming, just like them.</p>

<p>That is what school is for.</p>

<p>So now I simply try to find the <strong>evidence</strong>, the actual evidence (not just second and third-hand stories), so support the tales of &#39;ancient history&#39;.</p>

<p>This is a very controversial position to take. Humans love stories. Skeptics are hated for challenging these stories.</p>

<p>Excellent question. The kind of question which any critical thinker would ask.</p>

<p>I looked into this for myself and what I discovered shook me to the core of my miserable soul.</p>

<p><strong>There are no extant copies of Plato&#39;s writing.</strong> </p>

<p>Or Herodotus, the &#39;father of history&#39;.</p>

<p>None. Zero. </p>

<p>This is admitted by the &#39;experts&#39;, but you have to spend a lot of time digging through their books to find these admissions.</p>

<p>Who is ever going to spend their own time checking through the sources?</p>

<p>Apart from people like me, almost nobody.</p>

<p>And then when I share my findings on this sub, look how viciously I am attacked for it.</p>

<p>So many people on this sub claim to be &#39;awake&#39; but they act like rabid dogs when their precious &#39;ancient history&#39; fairytales are challenged.</p>

<p>That said, there is no real way to know 100% that anything is really true. IMO it&#39;s largely based on your own perception and what you&#39;re willing to live with.</p>

<p>Even &quot;proof&quot; is very subjective. Case in point being the recent Tucson happenings. Some believe, some don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sorry to break it to you but the universe,earth and history existed before your lifetime and will go on long after you . The proof that tells you Im right is that you were even born at all. As far as the Plato thing goes, no there wasnt copy machines, tape recorders or video cameras around 2500 years ago to provide absolute proof that he existed and wrote stuff. Still, that doesnt mean sometime in the future stuff he wrote down might be found. In the meantime, we have stuff written down from his students among them was Aristotle. This stuff includes copies of Plato&#39;s works and works produced by those students atleast partially and/or mostly on his ideas and teachings.

How old do you think the world is anyway? If anything civilization is way older not younger than scientists say.

I guess what I want to know is when do you believe &quot;history&quot; started? What is the impetus behind your disbelief in the existence of the classical world? There are valid arguments to be made about the historicity of the majority of events from that period. Even going so far as calling the very existence of the 7th - 11th centuries into question.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have the time to become an expert in every aspect of civilization and human life in order to completely avoid relying on experts in other fields, from scientists to historians to my auto mechanic.  Specialization is a natural human phenomena. </p>

<p>As for history specifically, I&#39;m a history buff, and have read more primary sources than most people, but again, I don&#39;t have the time, energy, or resources to consume the whole of historical content at the primary source level.  So, I specialize.  I study certain country&#39;s/regions history more than others.  I study certain time periods of history more than others.  For example, I consume a lot of history about medieval Britain.  That focuses my historical consumption to one fairly small country and one tiny fraction of history, from 1066 to roughly 1500. </p>

<p>Even looking at that one small time period and one small location, one can specialize further.  You can specialize into topics.  You could just study the wars -- the conquest of Wales, the Hundred Years War, the Scottish Wars of Independence, the Wars of the Roses, etc.  There are historians who have specialized into just studying one of those wars.</p>

<p>Even then though, it&#39;s impossible to know everything within that specialization within a specialization within a specialization.  For example, take Richard III, an important figure during the Wars of the Roses.  It wasn&#39;t known for certain until 2012, when his grave was discovered, that his spine was deformed, or how.  He had usually been depicted, most notably by Shakespeare, as a hunchback.  In truth, he had extreme scoliosis.  It still isn&#39;t known for certain whether or not he had his two nephews murdered.  Even the location of the battlefield where he is said to have died, during the Battle of Bosworth, is a subject of spirited debate.  There are things that are always going to be unknowable with any certainty, and that&#39;s in a country, that during this period, kept pretty good records, much of which survive.  </p>

<p>When you go farther back in time, to say the ancient pyramids or the ancient island of Knossos, to regions that either didn&#39;t keep good records, or whose records don&#39;t survive, or who didn&#39;t leave much in the way of archeology (one of the biggest problems with pre-contact Native American research) or in areas that don&#39;t have the funding to do proper historical investigations, there is less certainty we can have history.  </p>

<p>To bring it back to the example of British history, even with the big things we don&#39;t know about Richard III, we know far more about him and life during his reign than we do about the lives of the people who built Stonehenge.</p>

<p>Recognizing that there are limits to what can be known about history doesn&#39;t make the pursuit of history invalid, or make people who are experts in history liars. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the most important point. Recognizing the limitations of your sources and the fact that new information can changes our theories and understanding does not invalidate all human knowledge.</p>

<p>Of course every fact or idea comes with an asterisk of &quot;to the best of our knowledge&quot; but we try to overcome that by trying to approach knowledge systematically and continuing to refine and discover.</p>

<p>This is true of all fields. But to reduce knowledge to only the things that can be experienced tangibly first hand in this moment is incredibly limiting and not even accurate. </p>

<p>For example, if you live at the equator your might think that there is no snow because in your area there is no snow... but you know there is snow, because even if you might not have seen it, people from the north talk about this cold white fluffy stuff...</p>

<p>Also, just relying on what you can see can be deceiving as changes on the molecular level can tell a totally different story. To over simplify, you might think a hyena to be closely related to dogs and wolves when it is in fact more closely related to cats. </p>

<p>But more importantly, when a piece of knowledge is confirmed by various means by various groups and their results converge and make sense given what we know then that knowledge is likely to have merit... just because one person cannot do all that verification themselves, the fact that multiple teams have agreed makes it likely to be true... this is how the human species has advanced knowledge.  </p>

<p>It an incredibly limited way to approach the world by limiting it to your own direct and physical experience. It fundamentally limits how much you can know. Couple this with his inability to concede that he is wrong basically means he wants humans to throw away the main thing that make them unique among animals. </p>

<p>Other animals can use tools, teach tools use to off spring, are self aware and be taught to use language...</p>

<p>But humans alone can use others experience to inform their own existence, to build on past knowledge, to use language to describe abstract concepts...</p>

<p>There&#39;s a field called &quot;Textual Criticism&quot; which is made up of people whose job it is to argue over the dating and authenticity of ancient sources.  You are fully free to learn about it.  As I wrote in the previous comment, you can &quot;Read the arguments and points they bring up, inform yourself of the particulars of the debate, and either choose something to believe, or, not take a side and just be willing to say it&#39;s under debate.&quot;   </p>

<p>For an example you brought up elsewhere in this thread, there&#39;s Plato.  No, there is no surviving copy of Plato&#39;s writings from ~400 B.C..  The earliest copy we have of his writing is from 895.  However, we have a number of copies from around that time or within a century of that time, translated into several different languages.  And they all mostly match.  Other ways we date Plato is that he&#39;s quoted by authors whose ancient texts do exist.  Parts of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri quote Plato and those Papyri date from 200-300 A.D.  Does that take us all the way back to 400 B.C.?  No, but it takes us closer.  </p>

<p>So, you can either say &quot;Plato didn&#39;t exist&quot; because primary sources from his time period don&#39;t exist, but that&#39;s just as ignorant and non-thinking as you accuse others of being.  There is evidence that he existed, even without any manuscript surviving written in his hand, even if that evidence isn&#39;t incontrovertible.</p>

<p>You&#39;re free to scrutinize their methods as you wish.  I have taken the time to learn the methods of textual criticism, and find them, not always, but for the most part, sound.  I tend to do more in depth scrutiny of a particular citing or source within topics I have more interest or understanding of, because again, I don&#39;t have the time or skills to do an in depth investigation of every piece of source material at a textual and physical level.   </p>

<p>There are essentially two ways to know anything, from experience, or from authority.  One person can not know all there is to know about all subjects from experience.  Do you believe in atoms though you can&#39;t see them?  Do you believe there was an American Revolution in the 1700&#39;s eventhough you weren&#39;t personally there to witness it?  I&#39;m not saying you need to have &quot;faith in authority&quot; so far as knowledge is concerned, yet, immediately discounting all information because it comes from authority is a choice to be stupid.  </p>

<p>Carbon dating.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No.  It&#39;s fairly common with ancient texts.  Paper doesn&#39;t usually keep for thousands of years.  A 2500 year old complete manuscript of anything would be an exception, not the rule.  Before the printing press, there were literally people whose job it was (scribes) to take old, worn-out, manuscripts and make copies of them.  </p>

<p>Nope.  New discoveries are made somewhat frequently.  To repeat points I made before, King Richard III&#39;s grave wasn&#39;t found until 2012.  Aristotle&#39;s tomb may have been found in 2016.  A new Dead Sea Scroll cave was found last year.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like Grenfell and Hunt and whoever is &quot;crafting ancient history&quot; needed to invent an ancient text with a few quotes in it from Plato&#39;s works to help bolster the legitimacy of the dating of Plato.  </p>

<p>Yes really.  </p>

<p>Why do you trust &#39;carbon dating&#39;?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s proven to be reliable for objects less than ~4000 years old and when it errs, it usually dates things as younger than they really are.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you swallow these stories without question?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard III&#39;s skeleton was confirmed through DNA testing to decendants (Yes, I trust the results) and I purposely used the words &quot;may have been&quot; because that discovery has not yet been conclusively confirmed.  The point is that historical discoveries are still being made.  </p>

<p>Why do you dismiss historical discovery simply because you yourself weren&#39;t the person who made the discovery?</p>

<p>It is like one myth heaped on top of another with you, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see the number of stories from your authorities you take on faith:</p>

<p>*&#39;Ancient history&#39; documents (which you have never seen with your own eyes)</p>

<p>*&#39;Carbon dating&#39; (performed with instruments you will never get to use)</p>

<p>*&#39;DNA&#39; (which you will also never see with your own eyes).</p>

<p>The amount of dogma taken on faith is truly extraordinary when you think about it.</p>

Let&#39;s see...5200 / 200000 = 0.026. So only 2.6% of human history is recorded. We have fossils and artifacts, but I bet they only tell a tiny portion of the story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sure about that? Mortality from all sorts of things was insane in the middle ages. Yes medicine gets a lot wrong. Life expediencies suggest that it has advanced a bit. </p>

<p>Take your broken arm, if it is shattered modern orthopedist can place titanium pins and rods to reconstruct it so it works. If its open they can stave of infection with antibiotics. They can even repair vessel or nerve injury. And if it is mangled beyond recognition and it is amputated, they can rewrote the nerves in the  stump so you can mount a (experimental) prosthesis that you can control with your mind...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not have the skills, resources, or time to personally scrutinize every single primary source.  For example, I don&#39;t own a carbon dating machine, nor do I know how to work one if I did.  So, in some cases, yes, I do take the word of experts in their fields.  In many cases, there isn&#39;t consensus amongst the experts about a piece of history.  Take for example, the true identity of the man who wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare.  Some experts agree that it was William Shakespeare.  Some say Christopher Marlowe.  Some say Edward de Vere.  Some say Francis Bacon.  There are many cases like these.  In those cases, it&#39;s best to read the arguments and points they bring up, inform yourself of the particulars of the debate, and either choose something to believe, or, not take a side and just be willing to say it&#39;s under debate.</p>
