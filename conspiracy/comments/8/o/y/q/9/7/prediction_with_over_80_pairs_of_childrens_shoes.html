       right now some people somewhere are scrambling to think of a way to cover this up.  phone calls will be made.   plans put in place to divert attention... think harvey weinstein to take attention away from las vegas.

       I feel like for a subreddit with so many subscribers the upvote numbers are quite low for general posts. Or maybe there are a lot of fake accounts used to "moderate" how upvoted something gets plus they are used for gaslighting.

       Funny thing is historically the good people are generally more vicious than the bad people. You want these nitwits to stop? Put me in charge of punishment. I'll go medieval on their dumbasses and put the righteous fear of God in their hearts.

       Well. You're a product of their crimes. They doing what they did created men and women like us. Their actions created so much pain and suffering that it actually turned you into something that you're not.

       You make a good point, maybe you're right!

       I mean, if the tyranny, the royalty didn't exist in England would the United States be what it is today? Or at least what it is supposed to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems ironic, they are creating the circumstances of their own defeat by hardening people like me. I'm definitely not the only one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part of this, for me, is that more than likely if these stories are true and this problem is a world-wide issue that would mean law enforcement somewhere in some capacity is either aware or complicit in these crimes. Where do the real serious child rapists go and work? Social services. Where does a serious drug dealer try to work? A hospital. What is the dream job of a criminal? Law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who can you trust? How do you figure out who is trustworthy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw shooting them into the sun would actually be a fitting demise, as long as the trajectory was a gradual, slow process, cooking them slowly. I'm not a sadist, I don't enjoy other people's torment, unless they are child rapists. In such a case yes, consider me a sadist, I would enjoy stomping a pedo and would do my best to cause as much psychological harm as physical.

       Of course do not believe straight off the bat. But the way people ask for proof here and turn there nose up at cirumstansial evidence is just odd. Certain people here will never be happy until a court of law proves or they seek proof and conviction from the same forces and institutions that are often involved in covering up the crime, or they want the MSM to start covering it. Or they are shills. I'm a skeptic, but then there are militant skeptics that actually don't seem to remain skeptical about those who are being accused and actively defend them - very odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact—like a fingerprint at the scene of a crime. By contrast, direct evidence supports the truth of an assertion directly—i.e., without need for any additional evidence or inference.
      </p>
      <p>
       On its own, circumstantial evidence allows for more than one explanation. Different pieces of circumstantial evidence may be required, so that each corroborates the conclusions drawn from the others. Together, they may more strongly support one particular inference over another. An explanation involving circumstantial evidence becomes more likely once alternative explanations have been ruled out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumstantial evidence allows a trier of fact to infer that a fact exists. In criminal law, the inference is made by the trier of fact in order to support the truth of an assertion (of guilt or absence of guilt).
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimony can be direct evidence or it can be circumstantial. For instance, a witness saying that she saw a defendant stab a victim is providing direct evidence. By contrast, a witness who says that she saw the defendant enter a house, that she heard screaming, and that she saw the defendant leave with a bloody knife gives circumstantial evidence. It is the necessity for inference, and not the obviousness of a conclusion, that determines whether evidence is circumstantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forensic evidence supplied by an expert witness is usually treated as circumstantial evidence. For instance, a forensic scientist may provide results of ballistic tests proving that the defendant’s firearm fired the bullets that killed the victim, but not necessarily that the defendant fired the shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumstantial evidence is especially important in civil and criminal cases where direct evidence is lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       A popular misconception is that circumstantial evidence is less valid or less important than direct evidence.[2][3] This is only partly true: direct evidence is popularly assumed to be the most powerful.[4] Many successful criminal prosecutions rely largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence, and civil charges are frequently based on circumstantial or indirect evidence. Much of the evidence against convicted American bomber Timothy McVeigh was circumstantial, for example. Speaking about McVeigh's trial, University of Michigan law professor Robert Precht said, "Circumstantial evidence can be, and often is much more powerful than direct evidence." [5] The 2004 murder trial of Scott Peterson was another high-profile conviction based heavily on circumstantial evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, the common metaphor for the strongest possible evidence in any case—the "smoking gun"—is an example of proof based on circumstantial evidence.[6] Similarly, fingerprint evidence, videotapes, sound recordings, photographs, and many other examples of physical evidence that support the drawing of an inference, i.e., circumstantial evidence, are considered very strong possible evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In practice, circumstantial evidence can have an advantage over direct evidence in that it can come from multiple sources that check and reinforce each other. Eyewitness testimony can be inaccurate at times, and many persons have been convicted on the basis of perjured or otherwise mistaken testimony. Thus, strong circumstantial evidence can provide a more reliable basis for a verdict. Circumstantial evidence normally requires a witness, such as the police officer who found the evidence, or an expert who examined it, to lay the foundation for its admission. This witness, sometimes known as the sponsor or the authenticating witness, is giving direct (eye-witness) testimony, and could present credibility problems in the same way that any eye witness does.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is often more than one logical conclusion inferable from the same set of circumstances. In cases where one conclusion implies a defendant's guilt and another his innocence, the "benefit of the doubt" principle would apply. Indeed, if the circumstantial evidence suggests a possibility of innocence, the prosecution has the burden of disproving that possibility.

       Yes, I was being condescending because it was in the spirit of your post. Maybe I should type a big wall of text like yours explaining irony.... Images? Yes, I've seen them like most people that still aren't convinced. Nothing there proves child trafficking. A comb, some straps on a tree and some discarded hair dye just isn't gonna cut it as evidence for me, sorry. OMG and a condom!

       Saying words in a camera isn't even circumstantial evidence. It's hearsay at best. If he was surrounded by mountains of evidence, instead of promoting himself, he would be showing the evidence and narrating the video.

       In a court of law it takes three separate credible eye witnesses to take a case to court.
      </p>
      <p>
       By now there are well more than three. And there aren't more for a simple reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one of these poor people posted here - he or she would have people like you demanding unreasonable things and claiming 'attention' or something else odd as the motive. The unwanted and unwarranted ridicule from peers is more than enough to push a lot of people away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can prove this concept as well. Do you have the balls to talk about the possibility of aliens to your co-workers, or even this topic, questioning the mainstream story? What do you risk by talking about it? Probably not nearly as much as those that claim to have been raped as a child by, in some cases, prominent members of society, in fact, you -don't- risk as much as these people would and clearly haven't tried to put yourself in their shoes for even two damn seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a person claims to have witnessed a murder the police don't automatically insist on proof or dismiss it. It's accepted as an eye witness testimony and taken forward from there. Your thinking is dilute and flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen any real evidence you have given this any real thought.
      </p>

       All this and yet you still haven't/can't provide me with anything?
       <br/>
       So have these witnesses gone to the police? made a report? got a lawyer? anything?
       <br/>
       See nothing but some dude talking and saying he's found shoes etc. We he talks a lot but there's a lack of anything substantial or solid in any way. Please do get back to me if you have anything, I'm eager to see anything.

       What? If this is all just ends up being a LARP and this guy gets put on Netflix(/remains on Netflix after), I'm canceling Netflix. There are just some things you don't screw with like this for shameless self-promotion. It would make Logan Paul look like David Attenborough.

       He has a documentary that's coming out on Netflix sometime this year. If you search for it, "Contraland", it brings up almost no results about the movie. Then he posts the initial video that started this whole thing with a plug for his doc and his latest instagram post is just an ad for it. Whether he truely found something here or not he's certainly using the situation to do some advertising.

       It's probably pretty easy to find places where migrants have holed up on foot near the border.  Hell, I could find scenes like this one in dozens of scenes like this in any major city, where someone without a home has found a place to nest.

       But in this case, we have people claiming that all this evidence
       <em>
        is actually out there and right around them

       , yet we see NOTHING of it.  That's super suspicious.

Getting the evidence out there on the internet as soon as possible should be your top priority.  If it's not, I suspect ulterior motives.

       sure, but you can be open to the possibility and still treat it skeptically and ask for evidence.  What bothers me is the people who see one guy making radical claims and then 100% believing that as truth.  Also, this guy bothers me more, because he's making all the accusations without presenting really any evidence besides a hole in the ground and...what else exactly?  His videos are just his talking face, and apparently he's got a movie to promote.  Right now it seems much more likely that he's a huckster.

       I’m annoyed by the blazingly fast transition from claim of human trafficking camp based on circumstantial evidence, to police cover up of human trafficking, to evil elites and unseen forces covering up, where all requests for evidence end up in circles pointing to other threads that point to other threads that point to a vlog of one of the guys saying how they found a bunch of damning evidence, but it wasn’t recorded or documented before
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       after it was
       <em>
        taken from the site
       </em>
       (why the fuck would that ever be a good idea) and we have to rely on the vlog alone, and so many people are up in arms about it and calling any skeptics shills and brigaders. Despite the fact that the
       <em>
        initial
       </em>
       claim has flimsy circumstantial support
       <em>
        at best

       I’ve recently interacted with this group on one there “finds”.  I thought they were a homeless group at first.  Really stinky and not groomed.  Not like cool delta force ungroomed, but cheap trailer park ungroomed.  They acted sketchy and stories didn’t match up.  The recent news story had them making many claims and assumptions but no proof shown.  Example: “this is a belt tied on tree.  It’s a rape tree”     I’m thinking the conspiracy coming is that they are full of shit.

       lol, I'm well aware of that word, it's not new.
       <br/>
       So, really though... all I see is some dude talking a lot but providing very little to back up his claims. I'll keep checking in but until there's any evidence it's just a man's word.
       <br/>
       Insanity to just believe like that, I'm in here looking like anyone should be.

       It is the same people. Its the great awakening/cbts crowd. They try and tone down the religious angle a little in outside subs so they can appear more rational and "red pill" people. But when they are talking in their own subs.......my goodness.

       I’m not including or excluding
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       . I’m just saying that a Facebook live stream by a guy who rambles on and on about “battling unseen forces” and offers vague details about what proof they
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have of some large yet very secret kid banging syndicate isn’t very compelling...and it’s sounding very similar to the pizza thing that also turned out to be a bunch of bullshit (as it was presented). In all honesty it seems a whole lot like a guy who is currently undergoing some sort of manic paranoid delusional episode surrounded by a group of people who want to believe the shit he’s saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, even then, I just asked for some help from someone who wouldn’t use demons or dark forces to explain what’s happening because the video is so damn vague about what the fuck it’s even talking about that it’s impossible to know what the guy is even getting at without prior info on it.

      <p>
       This is nonsense, in no way did pizzagate involve Jews. What the fuck dude? Are you trying to look like a shill because that's how you look like one.

       either da jews or evillll bankers or just “people who have lots and lots of money just want to fuck little kids in a Pizza Hut for some reason you shill” 😂 I just asked a question and said this sounded similar to the other “evil rich people systematically fucking every kid in the world with tunnels and shit” recent conspiracy.

       You know, the more I think about it, the more you start to sound like a shill. You’re not a shill are you?! 🤣

       It's been reported by a few media outlets and shouldn't be hard to find. He's referring to the children of illegal immigrants who have been separated from their parents (I believe). Once again, our law enforcement is above the law they enforce.

       Is that really a bet we should be taking? I think it's more than worth it to invest time and resources into investigating this. If they can prove that this place isn't for child trifficing, then that's fucking great, but they have posted some (admittedly vague) evidence in other videos. Point being, there's no reason law enforcement shouldn't be showing up

       No, I think it ties in. The ICE situation with the children being abused, the Senator not being allowed to go in, the child trafficking sites along the border, this all fits in.

       Not at all what I meant to say
       <br/>
       I don't have a Facebook but have found most videos on other sites and have yet to see anything that connects to child trafficking
       <br/>
       I have seen evidence children were probably there, but no evidence of trafficking as of yet

       If there is a video I have missed which actually shows evidence connecting to child trafficking, please link it and I'll find a way to watch even if it's only on Facebook
       <br/>
       Asking for evidence should not be looked at as a negative, if this were serious, people would be jumping to show all the evidence

       I already answered this in this thread but some physical evidence which shows sex happened (such as used condoms with dba which can be lab tested) would be a start but even that wouldn't lead me to automatically jump to child sex trafficking.
       <br/>
       Child pornography would lead me to have more belief it is connected to something sexual with children
       <br/>
       As for trafficking, that would be hard to prove honestly without some sort of video, audio or documents evidence
      </p>
      <p>
       Also as I've said in here, I believe it is possible it is connected, I just haven't seen the evidence to prove it and personally I'd rather rely on evidence than emotions and assumptions
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you tell me what evidence you have seen that makes you think there is a connection?

       Where is the video of the evidence? That hasn't surfaced yet. The only needs to turn around and show the evidence while talking to the camera. Why does he have to be front and center? He's not the subject of the video, but he seems to relish in the attention.

       Given a similar situation, I would be coming the evidence while talking into the mic like I would hope any rational person would.

       I would think since so much 'evidence' is back at Camp Bravo or whatever, that pictures will soon come out of some of these items. How long could that possibly take? Another 12 hours? If we don't see some children's shoes lined up in the desert, what the hell is going on here?
       <br/>
       And why does this bearded guy say they are 'continuing to clean up' wtf? Why clean up a crime scene? I suppose the argument goes that if they don't collect these items the sites will be destroyed by the cartel / authorities.
       <br/>
       For a second there, this guy seemed like he was under control. 'We are continuing to clean up.' wtf I give it another 12 hours to see pics of something more than a creepy camp site.

       I see the videos of the initial camp they found. Sketchy enough. No piles of labeled 'evidence' at 'camp bravo'. What the fuck are these ex army guys doing cleaning up these sites under the guise of 'collecting evidence'. I find this highly suspicious.

       they have to collect it to prevent it from being destroyed.  at this point it's the only option since every effort they've made to have proper authorities do this have ended badly with them either being ignored or the evidence being destroyed

       This is still an open case with the Tucson PD since they are still analyzing evidence including the bloody knife found at the scene, but the police never even bothered to physically secure the site which is what the should do in an open case and then they allowed the site to be bulldozed. If there is any further evidence it would have been destroyed. The police from the beginning are suspect since it took them days to even come after this was reported. Hell I wouldn't trust any evidence to Tucson PD after all of this.

       This is my issue as well.  I'm interested, but all I'm seeing is some dude talking about things they've found, but only showing me a trash pile.  He's telling people to come down and look at what they've found, but he's literally the only person I've seen talking about it.

       No prob. I guess I'll go check out the other videos. But it seems like that whole video was designed to rile up the viewer's emotions without showing anything tangible.

       You will notice the same trend on his other vids.  Lots of emotion (too much as he looses credibility) and hype, little substance.

       The emotionality, the close camera work, the appeal to religion....everything is designed to trigger an emotional response in the viewer. That's what makes me skeptical, beside the lack of actual concrete content. I'm pretty lazy so I'll take your word for it on the other videos. I 100% believe America has a huge human trafficking crisis. I also 100% believe the focus on it, and tying it to pedophilia is something concocted by a Russian/Trump think tank. We have to ask, why now? Why is this very old story breaking at a time when having Americans divided, afraid, and distracted is exceedingly important to solidifying the Trumputin ambition for extension of the powers of the executive branch? I feel the same about the #metoo campaign. Are people really suddenly giving a fuck about sexual violence against women, an age old American tradition? Maybe. Or maybe it's another tactic to divide and destabilize us. The social fabric of America has been unraveling across a number of axis. That's very, very good news for people who want to grab power.

       Here's how I see what happened.  I don't think he's a blackhat as he doesn't have the intellectual caliber for a BH.  I don't think he's a FF either.  I think he flat jumped the gun and blew whatever capital VOP thinks they had.
      </p>
      <p>
       VOP was looking for homeless vets.  Its what they do. VOP also has a camp for homeless vets they find.  VOP found this 'camp' on Cemex property.  They find buried tanks, lots of kids items and other stuff.  The straps on the trees is odd.  Even for hanging food and such.  The site is in a city so its not like camping in the open desert or mountains where wildlife is more likely to be roaming around.  Not impossible but being next to a freeway tends to keep animal traffic to a minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel group think took over, emotions ran high.  His/their thought was to sound the alarm!   Get as many eyes on this as possible because in their mind it was without a doubt a child sex/trafficking camp.  To them there is no other explanation.  So he makes his vids like he does. Posts them up to achieve his/their end goal of Eyes on the camp.  Gotta admit, he got me at first.  But by the second vid flags began to rise for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       VOP did achieve their goal.  There are eyes on it now.  However I feel he failed in the long game by not providing enough solid info, pics, video of what they found.  I also highly suspect no real documentation of what they found was done.  Like a normal crime scene would.  I feel anything they found is useless at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you look at his history and background and more flags arise.  Its gonna take a child cadaver found buried to bring it back to where they think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not denying the was illegal immigration/homeless traffic there, that's obvious.  Human trafficking?  Also highly possible but here in AZ they tend to use houses to hide them.  They will pack them full with 40-50-60 depending on house size.  If this site was used for human trafficking, it was for a much smaller groups, 10-15 maybe.  Not as profitable for the coyotes.

       That's not true. He found actual trafficking sites and coyote camps with empty backpacks. In one video he found a camp with a backpack with fresh supplies like cookies and deodorant. Why don't you try to actually look at the video instead of just gaslighting.

Stop being lazy uninformed loud mouths. You can’t stage this. There’s literally no ulterior motive for these guys than saving people and you all want to shit all over it.

       Oh, how cute. Someone disagrees with you and you call their comment crappy and imply they're part of a shill effort. I thought we weren't calling each other shills on here anymore. Check my history. I've been on this sub for about two years and I always speak my mind. I'm not going to change that to fit in. Critical thinking and healthy skepticism are important to cultivate.

       Why is that? Because I'm not a Donald fanboy? Because I don't hop on the bandwagon with every conspiracy here? Sorry not sorry. I hope you also disagree with some of the content on here. If you didn't that would be weird.

       This is obviously a migrant camp, you can find these everywhere along boarder states. Shoes, clothes, kids beds, tunnels, all the norm. Probably even sex trafficking, which is terribly common among human smuggling. The problem and story should be how terrible conditions are for illegal immigration, and why we shouldn’t let this happen so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, these nut jobs are turning it into a “George Soros owned camp raping and selling kids to Hillary Clinton” which loses all credibility and commands no attention by anyone with a reasonable mind.

       Yeah, regardless of political affiliation 99.999% of us definitely care about children being abused.  I know I sure do.

      <p>
       I'm honestly convinced, at this point, that Pizzagate is some sort of op because it sure is distracting a lot of conspiracy theorists and causing them to waste their time connecting the thinnest of threads while real, actual abuse of children is happening right in front of us thanks to our tax dollars at work.

       I dunno about it being an op or any systemic effort to distract but it happens every day from coyotes/smugglers who bring these people over in masses in promise of a new life, only to exploit them and their children in various ways. This is an immigration and human rights issue, but when people use it as an opportunity to push their conspiracies it compartmentalizes the issue and people drown it out as another crazy theory instead of paying attention to what’s happening regardless of why.

       pizza gates real tho. Even if its not Hillary or any politician you can name. Google how many political rings throughout history have been busted for child rape. Its not a real secret that people in those sorts of positions have been known for such things. Assuming it's not happening is ignorant.

       Agree with your point mostly, but I'd take it even further, this seems so ridiculous that it almost seems like a reverse agenda to try and dismiss facts about Clinton, so basically pro Hillary propaganda. Like 'look how crazy these people are, as if you can believe anything they say', meanwhile bundle in all the emails and lies etc (not pizzagate obviously, true or not that was just as infuriating as a distraction to the first hand evidence that went public at that time too).

       the lewis meyer guy on the vop alpha videos is likely there to subvert the entire operation like at bundy, that is my call as of now.
      </p>
      <p>
       until someone proves me that his background is clean, that he wasn't at bundy, he is a big question mark.  the other guys might be good and have found it first.  i am kindof curious how they got the idea to look in the cemex plant in the first place.

       I want to see documentation of the pairs of shoes, the number grows larger by the day with no video or photographic proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some evidence I have seen, unfortunately it is poorly covered with low quality film, but it is there.  Some things I have not seen.  Bloody knife, article of underwear, and multiple pairs of shoes + multiple cribs.  I did see one crib, there were straps on a tree that could be wrist straps, some childrens toys.

       There may be something here, but doing sloppy work and telling tall tales will ruin all credibility

       On the video I saw it was obvious that the "wrist straps" were straps that used to hold up logs that were used as cross beams.  Both of the trees with the "wrist straps" had logs strapped to them using the exact same straps.

       This is the primary issue with the narrative. These "rape straps" could be for so many other things. They are just loops of rope attached to trees. They aren't cinchable and couldn't restrain a wrist without another piece of rope anyways.

       VOP presented this as absolute proof, when it was really far from it.

       Well. There is only ONE top story. No one pays any attention to anything else. So use this to your advantage. Literally no one remembers the Chandra Levy / Gary Condit thong because it got buried underneath the rubble of 9/11 (no pun intended).

       A shank? Wtf. Yea still nothing. The original post is gone. Only evidence that that post exists is the comment section. About a homemade shank. Personally I think this whole fucking thing so far is to distract so the enemy can pass a fucking bill or some shit. False flag yet again. I will gladly eat crow if it's not. I am not ashamed to be wrong and admit someone else is right but I shall not blindly follow into the rabbit hole when I b have yet to see a rabbit

       Sure, that’s fine, but it’s gotta start
       <em>
        somewhere
       </em>
       . If it’s true, and every bit of suspicion or tiny bit of evidence is met with skepticism, there’s no point in having a conspiracy theory about what’s going on. 🤷‍♂️

       The emotionality, the close camera work, the appeal to religion....everything is designed to trigger an emotional response in the viewer. That's what makes me skeptical, beside the lack of actual concrete content. I'm pretty lazy so I'll take your word for it on the other videos. I 100% believe America has a huge human trafficking crisis. I also 100% believe the focus on it, and tying it to pedophilia is something concocted by a Russian/Trump think tank. We have to ask, why now? Why is this very old story breaking at a time when having Americans divided, afraid, and distracted is exceedingly important to solidifying the Trumputin ambition for extension of the powers of the executive branch? I feel the same about the #metoo campaign. Are people really suddenly giving a fuck about sexual violence against women, an age old American tradition? Maybe. Or maybe it's another tactic to divide and destabilize us. The social fabric of America has been unraveling across a number of axis. That's very, very good news for people who want to grab power.

       I’ve recently interacted with this group on one there “finds”.  I thought they were a homeless group at first.  Really stinky and not groomed.  Not like cool delta force ungroomed, but cheap trailer park ungroomed.  They acted sketchy and stories didn’t match up.  The recent news story had them making many claims and assumptions but no proof shown.  Example: “this is a belt tied on tree.  It’s a rape tree”     I’m thinking the conspiracy coming is that they are full of shit.
