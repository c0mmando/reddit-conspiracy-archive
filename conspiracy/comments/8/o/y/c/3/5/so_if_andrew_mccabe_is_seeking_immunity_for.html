<p>It&#39;s being reported that Andrew McCabe is seeking immunity in exchange for his testimony regarding the Clinton email investigation.</p>

<p>Now...anyone here that&#39;s been a regular user on this sub for a while knows how much we&#39;ve heard about how if someone is seeking immunity for their testimony that&#39;s a dead solid indicator they&#39;re guilty. (At least when it comes to anyone involved/related to Trump or his campaign.)</p>

<p>So, is McCabe guilty of fudging the investigation into Hillary&#39;s server?</p>

<p>Is the fact that McCabe&#39;s lawyer is unequivocally stating that if McCabe doesn&#39;t get that immunity that he will plead the fifth during his testimony a &quot;sure sign&quot; that he&#39;s guilty?</p>

<p>Or are we going to see another double standard applied here?</p>

<p>Is it a conspiracy when a group of people attempt to create the illusion that a set of beliefs or rules only apply when it furthers their agenda? </p>

<p>Is it a conspiracy when that same group of people do everything they can to suppress people who disagree with that illusion?</p>

<p>Rules for thee...but none for me...</p>

<p>Also, completely different cases imo...because of the deviation of mandate/protocol by the FBI and DOJ in the email investigation.</p>

<p>I still think anyone in the Bush administration that was guilty of similar crimes should have had their asses nailed to the wall...</p>

<p>But hey...as long as they&#39;ve got us arguing from a partisan standpoint they&#39;ll all just keep getting away with these crimes...</p>

<p>I never said that. I said they won&#39;t do anything because that happened. Maybe you should look up the word precedent. </p>

<p>Maybe when Clinton goes to court as a lawyer and having a lawyer they would point out these instances where they gave a none or a lax sentence to people who were negligent with classified information and she would get off just the same.</p>

<p>I honestly think your comment was projecting. And in return you called me an attack dog and attacked my country. Belgium is trash, sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your article says what the immunity is about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>McCabe is the subject of a criminal referral from the agency&#39;s inspector general, which has reportedly found that McCabe acted inappropriately by leaking information to a reporter and then lying about it to then-FBI Director James Comey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are asking for use immunity, which is very narrow.  Definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Title 18 U.S.C. § 6002 provides use immunity instead of transactional immunity. The difference between transactional and use immunity is that transactional immunity protects the witness from prosecution for the offense or offenses involved, whereas use immunity only protects the witness against the government&#39;s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of the witness -- except in a subsequent prosecution for perjury or giving a false statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically he can still be prosecuted for anything he testifies about, the state just can&#39;t use his words from this testimony against him in that prosecution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Justice Department&#39;s internal watchdog has concluded that <strong>James Comey defied authority at times during his tenure as FBI director</strong>,  according to sources familiar with a draft report on the matter.</p>

<p>One source told ABC News that the draft report explicitly used the word <strong>&quot;insubordinate&quot;</strong> to describe Comey&#39;s behavior. Another source agreed with that characterization but could not confirm the use of the term.</p>

<p>In the draft report, Inspector General Michael Horowitz also rebuked former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for her handling of the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton&#39;s personal email server, the sources said.</p>
