      <p>
       As told by Ramses the Pigeon:
      </p>
      <p>
       The song "Tik Tok," as performed by Ke$ha, was written by a guy named
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Blanco">
        Benny Blanco
       </a>
       . Its lyrics include the line "We kick them to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a little bit strange, right? Mick Jagger wasn't exactly at the  height of his attractiveness when the piece in question came out.  Stranger still, it wasn't the only popular song to paint the man in a  pleasant light: "Moves Like Jagger," performed by Maroon 5, was released  at around the same time, and
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moves_like_Jagger">
        Benny Blanco also had a hand in writing that one
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where things start to get creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The song "The Time (Dirty Bit)," as performed by the Black Eyed Peas,  features the following phrase: "All these girls, they like my swagger,  they calling me Mick Jagger, I be rolling like a Stone." It was written  by
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeNicola">
        John DeNicola
       </a>
       ,  who used to produce the music for a band called Kara's Flowers...  although you might know them better by their current name of Maroon 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       The song "Heart and Soul," as performed by The Jonas Brothers,  contains a verse that ends with "Making mistakes, but that won’t matter,  if you can swag like old Mick Jagger."
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonina_Armato">
        Antonina Armato
       </a>
       wrote the piece, and she is managed by
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Music_Publishing">
        Downtown Music Publishing
       </a>
       . Care to guess who else they manage? (Here's a hint: It rhymes with "balloon hive.")
      </p>
      <p>
       This web of connections extends all throughout the recording  industry, but one thing remains unclear: What's the link back to Mick  Jagger himself? There must be something, because if you have a look at  Google Trends, you'll see that
       <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=mick%20jagger">
        his popularity spiked
       </a>
       with the release of each song. The only time in recent memory when it  has been higher is during a period in March of 2014, when his girlfriend  died. Some people have suggested that the man's name is just easy to  rhyme with "swagger," but popular usage of the word (in reference to  something other than a walking gait) came about
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the aforementioned songs had hit the airwaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, "Jagger" prompted "swagger," not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does there seem to be a cabal of artists trying to artificially  inflate the performer's appeal and popularity? What benefit is there in  promoting an aging rock star? Who is actually behind this odd trend?
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to answer those questions, we need to turn to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi">
        Vivendi
       </a>
       . This is a company which owns
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of stuff. Their subsidiaries include DailyMotion, UbiSoft, GameLoft...  and the Universal Music Group. The Rolling Stones signed to Universal  Music in 2008. In 2010, all of the songs listed above were released.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=mick%20jagger">
        Look at those Google trends again
       </a>
       . 2008 marked Mick Jagger's
       <em>
        lowest ever
       </em>
       dip in popularity, and the slump continued until February of 2010  (right after "Tik Tok" became the most popular song on the radio). In  September of that same year, The Rolling Stones
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_and_Gentlemen:_The_Rolling_Stones">
        re-released their rare concert movie
       </a>
       ,  securing the number one spot on four different countries' charts - the  US and the UK being two of them - second place on four more, and a  Double Platinum certification in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strangely enough, though, the only other place (besides the United  States) where Platinum status was achieved was in France... which is  where
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi">
        Vivendi is located
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What if all of this was carefully planned and executed?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if there's a shadowy organization that's intent on promoting Mick Jagger for their own profit?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if I made all of this up on a whim, and just found whatever tenuous evidence I could to support it?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR: Mick Jagger is a puppet of the recording industry.
       </strong>

       Well.....i think you made a great point - in that the american people were easily swayed through a few pop music lyrics to move a certain way *(like jagger)

       Beautifully executed. Also Vivendi lost a $1.2b class action lawsuit related to their acquisition of a host of media companies. IIRC, they were a French utility company as recently as the late 1990s before expanding suddenly and, according to the lawsuit, recklessly.

       Or Mick Jagger is actually a reference to Michael Jackson (MJ, Mic-Ja) and because the record companies owned Mick Jagger but not Michael Jackson that's the only name they could legally use.

       How is this the most upvoted? Lol. Mick Jagger is a legend, people have ALWAYS sung about legends. Of course people in his same industry are going to make songs about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The connections you're making blow my mind due to the stupidity. It's like no one can talk about anything without someone like you saying it MUST mean something shady. It doesn't, all it means is Jagger is a legend in most peoples minds. Also he used to dance crazy if you've ever seen him (moves like Jagger) but for some reason you think it's some crazy conspiracy lol. I wonder if people like you think anything is not a conspiracy ?

       See the "new world order" is kind of like keyser soze said/did - the best trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnt exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a similar fashion, the new world order is already rolling - and we are all puppets having our strings pulled by the media/pop music/internet social media, etc etc - all "they" have to do is tell us to like mick jagger and boom we fall in love with him again.

       IMHO These might be the biggest three conspiracy theories on the Planet!

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Twisting and controlling any and all information of any kind of "sentient alien life" on Earth and Beyond.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Suppression and cover up of having and understanding very advanced technology and ancient knowledge.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Manipulating and maybe even changing History (mainly Origin of Humanity) and ancient sites of any kind.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Honorable mention:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Evil secret societies and their divide and conquer tactics for some sinister agenda.

       My two cents on the moon landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       We did go to the moon, and while doing such the crew saw things of the greatest sensitivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really not all that hard to put together.  Foo Fighters, the Battle of Los Angelas and the Roswell event were old news at the time of the moon landing.  It was way too risky to stream a live broadcast of the event, due to what could be filmed.  Therefore, a simulation of the moon landing was recorded and spliced together with the live feed.  That's why the original film had to be 'misplaced/lost'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we landed on the moon.
Yes, there was a fake video of the moon landing. 
Yes, those in power knew the possibility of encounters.

       is my favorite documentary on the subject but it's very long! If you just want to get your feet wet on what it's all about, watch the movie JFK by Oliver Stone. That'll give you the gist of people's questions on it. If you're still interested, check out Everything is a Rich Man's Trick. That takes the deep dive in :)

       Flat Earth.

       Forget about what shape the earth is. That’s not even the main point of FE theory. I don’t know what shape the earth is. The main point is that all space travel and in fact what we know as space itself is a lie. The heliocentric cosmological model is based on the mysticism of the Kabbalah, which Isaac Newton was a devout student of.

       I'm starting to think Flat-Earthers might be made up to discredit conspiracy theories as a whole. The idea that the sun is at the centre of the solar system is not a Jewish conspiracy theory. Without the heliocentric model, none of our other models of star distances, planetary distances, etc, would even be internally consistent. I'm friends with several research astronomers, and I can tell you for sure that they are not falsifying data to push some kind of agenda. Flat-Earth theories and the like are the worst kind of anti-scientific nonsense, and they throw the entirety of non-mainstream thought into disrepute.

       Because we haven't quite figured out the storage challenges basically.   What happens if due to a storm 1000km away the wind stops for a couple of days and it's cloudier than usual (like the case in Europe).  No solar, no wind   In practice this means that coventional energy sources like oil or natural gas production goes up to compensate.

       A cool storage solution recently built in Australia is pumped hydro. Essentially you pump water into a dam when you have excess electricity, then you use that water to generate electricity through the dam as needed. Look up Snowy hydro 2.0 for more info.

       I’m thinking about compiling a list of the people who make that exact statement about FE being a discrediting psy-op, and showing that they are not even conspiracy theorists themselves for the most part.

       You really think the 'election' of Trump was the turning point?  What about the 'election' of Bush?  Or, the assassination of JFK?  Or, the birth of the Federal Reserve?  Who owned the government before Trump, and how was it 'stolen'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure we ignore it.  The truth is that it doesn't matter who sits in the White House.  That's all bread and circus.   Most of us have moved beyond the idea that Presidents have power.  JFK killed that fantasy for many of us.

       If you still think you can vote yourself free, even if you think voting counts (I don't), you haven't really been paying attention.
