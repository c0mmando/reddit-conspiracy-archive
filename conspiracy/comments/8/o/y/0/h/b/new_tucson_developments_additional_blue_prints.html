        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those not caught up on the situation, watch this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LfuNCZk6PpE">https://youtu.be/LfuNCZk6PpE</a></p>

<p>Not only has 60+ pairs of children shoes been found, further evidence is literally being dug up as we speak. The VOP now have a 3 month stay lined up to further scout more locations.</p>

<p>Blue prints have been found describing more underground tunnels and housing sites. Truly sickening stuff. Watch the video above. They also are not sure who to trust within law enforcement.</p>

<p>Apparently a bulldozer was brought out and the first sight may have been buried? This needs further verification but you can hear whispers of it.</p>

<p>In the mean time, continue to look into Cemex and KEEP PUSHING FOR AWARENESS.</p>

<p>There is a bunch of astroturfing going on and gas lighting. Also many inactive accounts that never posted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are now flooding every Tucson thread to try to steer narratives. Do not let them do this.</p>

<p>We need further awareness. In the mean time, I recommend you guys follow the VOP FB page for up to date information:</p>

<p>VOP-Alpha-Co-Team-Pulaski-1415347948612114/</p>

<p>Here is a strange cemex patent for using blood in mixtures.</p>

<p><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4203674A/en">https://patents.google.com/patent/US4203674A/en</a></p>

<p>I originally saw this here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/8ovwbt/cemex_patent_to_use_blood_in_cement_wtf/">https://www.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/8ovwbt/cemex_patent_to_use_blood_in_cement_wtf/</a></p>

<p>&quot;The present invention relates to the use of blood in the construction and building industry, whereby blood and extracts of blood containing haemoglobin are used as air entraining colloids. The recommended process for preparing a lightened material consists in associating a construction element chosen from the cements, mortars and concretes, with at least one air entraining colloid chosen from whole blood, globules, red blood corpuscles and haemoglobin. The invention also relates to the lightened material obtained according to this process.&quot;</p>

<p>Cemex may be more involved than we realize. We need to dig more into cemex. Cemex is owned by Carlos Slim, with a net worth of over 65$ BILLION he owns Cemex and I am curious how much he knows about this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>Do not let this die.</p>

<p>This thread is my last one for the night but I hope this will help carry discussion over into the morning. Tomorrow I will post more and get back up to date.</p>

<p>Also here is a good Voat thread courtesy of <a href="/u/Jigglyraffe">/u/Jigglyraffe</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2575017">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2575017</a></p>

<p>This is the tip of an ice berg that could lead to more cases and avenues of research and investigation. </p>

<p>Please continue the discussion. Do not let the shills win. Keep the awareness coming, and anyone within Tucson, get down there and take photos of the evidence!</p>

<p>They have been inviting locals to come down and photograph EVERTHING. Does anyone have photos of the blue prints that were found? </p>

<p>In the mean time, we can continue discussion. I personally will not give up on this and I encourage you all to do the same.</p>

<p>The truth of LIGHT will expose the acts of darkness kept under wraps of social fabric of our reality. It is time we stop playing their game and expose this BS once and for all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still extremely skeptical about this but I&#39;m all for letting people investigate. Still don&#39;t see why this can&#39;t be an ordinary homeless camp and I think its very telling that I&#39;ve been called no better than a child rapist and threatened for just doubting these claims. As of now, I&#39;m going with the Tucson police department&#39;s word that they have found no evidence this was a child trafficking site. Of course, I think its great so many people are looking into this and are continuing to investigate but the purposeful spreading of fake news and threatening those skeptical is petty and instantly discredits your investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is there an international standard for homeless camps? Do they all have to follow a strict guideline? Are they all built by the same bums? Its just some shacks out in the woods with an underground compartment and cords on some trees, its only as sinister as your imagination makes it. The cops also had human trafficking experts on scene, people who actually specialize in what the veteran group guesses the camp is and the experts found no indications it was ever a site for trafficking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The few bits of circumstantial evidence that point away from the trafficking conclusion are dwarfed by the myriad of circumstantial evidence that points <em>to</em> the trafficking conclusion. </p>

<p>Just how many &quot;facts&quot; are pointing to it being a homeless camp? The Tucson PD&#39;s word? Assuming they are honest (which I doubt), their response time to investigate is suspicious, and the bulldozing of property after said &quot;investigation&quot; is <em>highly suspicious</em>. You can believe that if they had even a scrap of toilet paper suggesting the faint possibility that place was a meth lab, they would be calling in the tri-state cavalry. </p>

<p>Aside from that Tucson PD &quot;fact,&quot; what else points away from the trafficking theory? Yes, it <em>could be</em> a homeless camp, I think everyone would concede that is a <em>possibility.</em> But considering the veterans&#39; familiarity with homeless camps, as well as the bizarre range of materials found (including a plethora of sexual items), yet equally bizarre lack of <em>sleeping and warming materials</em> that homeless people use to <em>survive</em> (ie cardboard, newspapers or any other kind of warming agent), the vets&#39; impressions of the place being somehow <em>off</em> gives equal credence to the trafficking theory, and their footage provides circumstantial evidence in support of that theory. </p>

<p>So you cannot say for certain that it is a <em>fact</em> that this place is a homeless camp. Right now, we don&#39;t know. And we may never know since they bulldozed the place before a further investigation could be done to quell local fears. Keep that in mind --- whatever we are thinking or suspecting here on Reddit, the immediate possible threat to locals in Arizona must be horrifying to consider. These are potentially child victims, for god&#39;s sake --- that is a serious enough <em>possibility</em> that it merits an in-depth investigation and not just a peripheral tour of the grounds just before bulldozing the place. And maybe there really isn&#39;t anything going on (that would be wonderful!), but <em>on the chance that there is,</em> doesn&#39;t that possibility deserve at least a reasonable amount of investigating so that parents in Arizona can fucking sleep at night??? </p>

<p>&quot;Just because something has happened before does not mean they happen 100% of the time.&quot;</p>

<p>One more time: Just because things have happened before does not mean they are happening now. Like this doesn&#39;t even pass phase 1 of the critical thought process.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be like if I accused you of being a serial killer, and when you asked for proof, I linked you: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer</a></p>

<p>Because I enjoy low-hanging fruit and exposing fallacious thought. People that make wild accusations, provide no proof for said accusations, and then fall back on the &quot;but something like this happened before, maybe&quot; as if that&#39;s on equal footing with evidence.</p>

<p>If you want, you can isolate something from this argument that you believe proves some international globalist pedophile conspiracy and I&#39;ll look at it, but that massive gish gallop wall of text is another common tactic of people that suffer from serious mental problems.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re just gonna throw it all out the window because its a &quot;gish gallop&quot; and one paragraph is enough to have you put your head back in the sand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m going to dismiss it as a gish gallop for a number of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I know for a fact not a single thing said in that thread proves the claims you&#39;ve made here.</p></li>
<li><p>I know for a fact it&#39;s going to be riddled with bullshit like this:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The story never fully hit the streets, as agents grabbed the copies from newstands in the early hours of the morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice how he provides no proof for this claim? Not only does he provide no proof for this claim, the entire premise of this claim is beyond absurd. There aren&#39;t enough agents in the country to &quot;grab all of the copies&quot; in this fashion, it&#39;s fucking absurdist drivel.</p>

<p>And even worse, the guy in your link is bringing up Satanic abuse from the late 1980s. Here you go:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse</a></p>

<p>The reason these absurdly stupid accusations kept popping up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several hundred children were then interviewed by the Children&#39;s Institute International (CII), a Los Angeles abuse therapy clinic run by Kee MacFarlane. The interviewing techniques used during investigations of the allegations were highly suggestive and invited children to pretend or speculate about supposed events.[13][14] By spring of 1984, it was claimed that 360 children had been abused.[2][8][15] Astrid Heppenstall Heger performed medical examinations and took photos of what she believed to be minute scarring, which she stated was caused by anal penetration. Journalist John Earl believed that her findings were based on unsubstantiated medical histories.[16] Later research demonstrated that the methods of questioning used on the children were extremely suggestive, leading to false accusations.[13] Others believe that the questioning itself may have led to false memory syndrome among the children who were questioned.[3][5] Ultimately only 41 of the original 360 children testified during the grand jury and pre-trial hearings, and fewer than a dozen testified during the actual trial.[17]</p>

<p>Videotapes of the interviews with children were reviewed by Michael Maloney, a British clinical psychologist and professor of psychiatry, as an expert witness regarding the interviewing of children. Maloney was highly critical of the interviewing techniques used, referring to them as improper, coercive, directive, problematic and adult-directed in a way that forced the children to follow a rigid script; he concluded that &quot;many of the kids&#39; statements in the interviews were generated by the examiner.&quot;[18] Transcripts and recordings of the interviews contained far more speech from adults than children and demonstrated that, despite the highly coercive interviewing techniques used, initially the children were resistant to interviewers&#39; attempts to elicit disclosures. Recordings of these interviews were instrumental in the jury&#39;s refusal to convict, by demonstrating how children could be coerced to giving vivid and dramatic testimonies without having experienced the abuse.[19] The techniques used were contrary to the existing guidelines in California for the investigation of cases involving children and child witnesses.[20]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The overall point is, the ritual abuse moral panic of the 1980s was horseshit. It had no basis in reality. A decent number of people were put in prison on false accusations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lanning produced a monograph in 1994 on SRA aimed at child protection authorities, which contained his opinion that despite hundreds of investigations no corroboration of SRA had been found. Following this report, several convictions based on SRA allegations were overturned and the defendants released.[56]</p>

<p>Reported cases of SRA involve bizarre activities, some of which are impossible (like people flying),[117] that makes the credibility of victims of child sexual abuse questionable. In cases where SRA is alleged to occur, Lanning describes common dynamics of the use of fear to control multiple young victims, the presence of multiple perpetrators and strange or ritualized behaviors, though allegations of crimes such as human sacrifice and cannibalism do not seem to be true. Lanning also suggests several reasons why adult victims may make allegations of SRA, including &quot;pathological distortion, traumatic memory, normal childhood fears and fantasies, misperception, and confusion&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just picked 2 random lines out of that post and the person:</p>

<ul>
<li>lied.</li>
<li>tried to cite shit that came from the ritual abuse hysteria that took place during the 80s/90s, the abuse law enforcement across the country could find no evidence for whatsoever.</li>

<p>How does it feel to not know what you&#39;re talking about? How does it feel to unironically bring up ritual satanic abuse from the 80s, something that has been debunked hundreds of times by medical professionals and law enforcement? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to see you provide any hard facts for a single claim you&#39;ve made here. I&#39;ve seen you provide things you think are hard facts, things that you think support your arguments, but they don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Carl Sagan put an entire chapter in his book &quot;the demon haunted world&quot; on this very subject. Ritual satanic abuse hysteria is one of the best examples of faulty human thinking and how easy it is to coerce accusations out of people, accusations with no basis in reality.</p>

<p>A good example:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_County_ritual_abuse_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_County_ritual_abuse_case</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Psychologist Richard Ofshe claimed that Ingram, because of his long-standing and routine experiences in his church, was inadvertently hypnotized by authority figures who conducted his interrogation, although no mental health professionals were present, and that the confessions were the result of false memories being implanted with suggestion.[13] Ofshe tested this hypothesis by telling Ingram that a son and daughter had accused him of forcing them to commit incest with each other. Interrogating officers had previously accused Ingram of this, but he denied it, and also denied Ofshe&#39;s accusation. Ofshe instructed Ingram to pray on the idea, and later Ingram produced a full, detailed written confession. Questioning the daughter who was supposed to have been involved, despite many other accusations against her father, she denied that such an incident had ever occurred. Upon being told that no such accusation had been made by either his son or daughter, Ingram refused to believe the incident wasn&#39;t real, maintaining &quot;[i]t&#39;s just as real to me as anything else&quot;.[14] Ofshe was thus convinced that Ingram&#39;s confessions were solely the result of extensive interrogation sessions and questions being applied to an unusually suggestible individual. He provided a report on his theory, but the prosecution initially refused to supply it to the defense, only doing so after being forced by the judge.[15] Ofshe later reported the incident in a scientific journal.[16]</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No. This is called a strawman. Trafficking exists, but when people like you come along and spew conspiracy theories, ones with no basis in reality, you undermine people that are actually involved in fighting global trafficking. You make their job harder. You, with your conspiracies, are not helping anything. Repeating misinformation on the internet is not you fighting child abuse. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point you may as well tell me you don&#39;t believe anything bad happens ever. Good god.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s another strawman. Me putting out the glaring flaws in the stuff you post is not me saying nothing bad happens. You fabricated that because you&#39;re backed into a corner and were called out for failure to provide evidence.</p>

<p>A good example of how little you know is the &quot;blood concrete&quot; patent you tried to pass off as evidence for your conspiracy. Mainly, you know, because if people were murdering Children in an effort to make some type of blood concrete, they wouldn&#39;t file a public patent. You know, that right there alone is enough to dismantle your claim.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the fact &quot;blood concrete&quot; is an actual thing. </p>

<p>The romans used to do this, it seems. That&#39;s why they have a patent for it. But you couldn&#39;t be bothered to do 5 seconds of research. You decided to pass this off as evidence for your conspiracy instead. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it proves anything beyond circumstantially, but false memory syndrome being invented and promoted by people accused of child rape, benefitting themselves directly, with other members of the same group had backgrounds in military intelligence... It kinda calls the whole thing into question, so you can&#39;t really just say &quot;pfffft, the satanic panic, obviously complete bullshit&quot; because you have to question things like false memory syndrome with it&#39;s questions, groups like The Finders with their CIA links, people like Aquino who was military intelligence specialized in psychological warfare, founder of The Temple of Set, accused of raping numerous children, some of whom accurately described the inside of his house, but he was cleared by false memory syndrome, a short time later the on base daycare they were allegedly taken from randomly burned down.</p>

<p>That&#39;s too much to just handwave away, and if you can call that into question the same goes for much of the remainder of your comment.</p>

<p>an &quot;appeal to authority&quot; is only fallacious when said authority is not a credible expert or actual authority.</p>

<p>Appealing to NASA, for example, is not a fallacious appeal to authority.</p>

<p>Your misuse of the term is common with conspiracy theorists because they often find themselves in conflicts with actual experts on a wide range of subjects.</p>

<p>This is motte and bailey dude.</p>

<p><a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/</a></p>

<p>What you&#39;re doing, and what most of you do, very blatantly, is you&#39;ll show up, make absurd accusations with no basis in reality, with no proof, no evidence, no anything, and then when you&#39;re challenged, you fall back to the more rational claim &quot;human trafficking is a problem.&quot;</p>

<p>A good example of this in action:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The feminists who constantly argue about whether you can be a real feminist or not without believing in X, Y and Z and wanting to empower women in some very specific way, and who demand everybody support controversial policies like affirmative action or affirmative consent laws (bailey). Then when someone says they don’t really like feminism very much, they object “But feminism is just the belief that women are people!” (motte) Then once the person hastily retreats and promises he definitely didn’t mean women aren’t people, the feminists get back to demanding everyone support affirmative action because feminism, or arguing about whether you can be a feminist and wear lipstick.</p>

Why did this initially get so much upvotes without any real evidence, and why are all the typical QAnon folks and #Maga people on social media mainly the ones circulating it?</p>

<p>We still have those methods--we can reproduce Roman concrete rather easily--but it&#39;s just that ancient concrete is far, <em>far</em> too expensive for modern-day use. Materials are selected based on the balance between cost and sturdiness they offer; both cheap and short-lived and expensive and everlasting miss the boat.</p>

The great pyramid of Giza is theorized to be a giant power plant emitting wireless energy to power thousands of tools throughout Egypt.

Free wireless energy generated from the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. It&#39;s one of my favorite conspiracy theories.

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever that did it could have possibly been the Tower dismantled by Yahweh for no reason. Yahweh likes dismantling man&#39;s grasp of nature to fundamentally better all mankind.</p>

<p>Honestly, if they were to continue the Old Testament to the current century, it would say &quot;Yahweh got a significant portion of the Gentiles to work 12 hours a day even though their jobs can be automated *simply* for the sport of the Chosen Ones, who walk in at any moment pleasing them and summon Gentiles to be locked up for something they never did (or in some cases killed). Thus, while the Gentiles toiled away not a single Chosen One could be seen in an unfortunate circumstance, and entire municipalities would get back to work every time one of them uttered a sound.&quot; It&#39;s real sick that we don&#39;t need to be working but still are forced to. And that some people live purely leisurely lives of power, strolling around like Yahweh in the first pages of Genesis: cutting off people&#39;s ribs, saying a certain gender is universally treated poorly, filming, producing, and acting in the show East of Eden... It&#39;s sick</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s strange but ultimately it&#39;s circumstantial as evidence. There are legit reasons, as others have pointed out animal blood is abundant in slaughterhouses and industrial usage makes sense, if it has benefits.</p>

<p>However, it is of course a pretty good way to get rid of large quantities of blood too. Although I feel like it&#39;s a pretty elaborate way, it would be much easier to just dump it into a lake/sea or even just in the ground. I&#39;m not sure how traceable it would be in the ground, but in water it would be diluted and untraceable for sure so it doesn&#39;t really make sense to put it in a permanent structure if you want to dispose of it. </p>

<p>Maybe it has some kind of ritual/supernatural use, like infusing the building with some kind of magical potency. That seems like fantasy to me, but it&#39;s not impossible. I find the prospect of raping children to make very little sense as well, but clearly that happens.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think it&#39;s hard to make any conclusions based on this, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I saw parts of beardmans youtube thing and am following this whole satanic pedo-ring thing on this subreddit and honestly so many people are flying into these arguments about how &quot;they&quot; wanna steal childrens&#39; souls, and about how finding a swing nearby some homeless persons camp is evidence of child activity, as if your grown ass never sat on a swing before. </p>

<p>Wanna know why you are finding so many goddamn children shoes? Children tend to grow up, y&#39;know, I remember getting a new pair of shoes frequently when I was growing up. Now that I&#39;m an adult I buy new ones when my old ones are falling apart.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone here is crazy, I think we all just fear the worst. But please, people, just because you can imagine the worst, doesn&#39;t mean that that is the case. I&#39;m not saying that camp thing they found is cosher, but keep in mind that homeless people have a higher tendency for having a mental affliction and the things they collect or do don&#39;t always make sense.</p>

<p>A true open mind can find the worst but also the best possible explanation in things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait let&#39;s think about this for a second: finding children&#39;s clothing in the woods and discarded toys isn&#39;t that unusual. The &quot;restraints&quot; nailed to trees? Come on. Doesn&#39;t it make a lot more sense that&#39;s for a camping purpose (holding up a tarp, etc.) than jumping into &quot;child sex restraint&quot;? Condoms and porn again not THAT unusual to find in the woods. </p>

<p>An unmarked human grave? That WOULD be crazy. But I&#39;ve seen no evidence of that here. And finally a native dude on horseback telling a bunch of crazy people with cameras digging up his yard to get off his property? As someone who grew up in Arizona, all I have to say is &quot;get off that native dude&#39;s property.&quot; </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a dog in this race but people are seriously jumping to some crazy conclusions based on very very little evidence. If you&#39;re going to mistake any homeless camp for a child-sex trafficking site, and any discarded trash around can be interpreted through that lens, you&#39;re gonna find this stuff anywhere you go looking. </p>

<p>I traveled the country mapping out mountain bike trails for years, and I live in the middle of a forest. Having that much clothes and toys and junk food around is a good indicator that there were kids around.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not to me it doesn&#39;t. What are the restraints for? What are the underground rooms for? What&#39;s buried in those graves? How are these homeless people getting a hold of chainsaws, fuel, digging tools, radios, walkie talkies?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As someone who grew up in Arizona, all I have to say is &quot;get off that native dude&#39;s property.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not his property, nor did he try to claim that it is. He simply told them very bluntly to get lost. And just look at how many users have come out of the woodwork to discredit it or brush it off as nothing. I want to know exactly what was going on there.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is more than a bit presumptuous. I believe gravity to be linked to mass not because TPTB told me so, but because there is two centuries&#39; worth of rigid empirical evidence available. The theoretical frameworks based on the premise are so accurate that they were able to make accurate predictions decades before we even had the equipment to verify them. Science is all about rejecting ideas if they are proven wrong, so I&#39;m open to discarding the traditional model of gravity if the need to do so arises, but I&#39;ve never seen a refutation of the mass-based model that goes deeper than &#39;the MSM is nothing but lies&#39;, much less an alternate, flat Earth-compatible paradigm that even comes <em>close</em> to the phenomenal accuracy of the mainstream model.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The post-modern idea that &#39;my opinion is just as valid as ypur evidence&#39; is a cancer to rational thought. To claim that the scientific method is not more or less valuable than any other belief system (or to even imply that it <em>is</em> a belief system) is to demonstrate a complete ignorance of its principles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you and no problem. To back this up with some links too</p>

<p>&quot;According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), every year, more than 200,000 children are abducted by family members. An additional 58,000 are taken by nonrelatives with primarily sexual motives. However, only 115 reported abductions represent cases in which strangers abduct and kill children, hold them for ransom, or take them with the intention to keep.&quot;</p>

<p>The family problem is big enough in itself. I even personally knew a girl that was sold into the sex trade when she was a child and her sister would sexually pawn her off for hard drugs while literal men lined up outside the door. This is the disturbing fact of this subject. Parents literally willingly selling their kids into it. It makes me so sick to my stomach. The low reported number too of 115 abductions alone is disturbing. I&#39;d imagine its far higher and then we have to take into account children being smuggled into the US. Quite the cluster fuck </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judging by your words previously it had seemed like your intentions were not exactly noble. It pays to be descriptive when writing.</p>

<p>I think everybody needs a nap, but that&#39;s beside the point. I cannot tolerate and have no ability to tolerate those that seek to undermine a conversation, which is all this is supposed to be. Like people demanding &#39;proof&#39; or they don&#39;t believe it, speaking frankly what people believe is not relevant and never has been, it&#39;s just opinion spouting.</p>

<p>Given that isn&#39;t the case here with you, my mistake, between your user ID and the content, you fooled me. I really thought you were full of crap. Given your not? No worries, my mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright no worries. </p>

<p>I can certainly understand the frustration. I can also tell you from experience that approach is counterproductive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to dismiss someone as willfully ignorant for not researching this type of stuff but the truth is the average person has been systematically misled their entire life. Most people don&#39;t have the cynical and distrustful nature it takes to question pretty much everything they&#39;ve been taught to believe. To you they seem like an idiot but it&#39;s just someone who&#39;s good nature has been taken advantage of. Granted there&#39;s plenty of willful ignorance as well, but either way in order to get through we&#39;re going to have to be extremely patient. </p>

<p>Maybe I do need that nap though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not an update video, that&#39;s been on youtube for 2 days already on that channel and even older on the VOP fb.</p>

<p>I also want to say I want to believe. Clearly if is was staged, even the police, media, and gov officials would go out of their way to PROVE it is staged. But the fact it is so quiet is concerning.</p>

<p>Here are some of my personal issues with this, and please if you have an answer then enlighten me...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whatever happened to that local newswoman who was driving up to investigate? Last I remember, she pulled up with a pic that the cops were blocking the road. Did she go home? Where are her 20 minute face videos explaining what she saw?</p></li>
<li><p>Which leads me to this. All these claims are 20 minute videos of just his face talkin about things he saw. When the news first broke, I dove right in to this. But every video I click are just his claims with 1 or 2 quick sweeps to a person or a location, then back to his mug. Why not document the evidence for the public when you want the publics assistance? Fuck the photos, we all want video evidence. He has enough space to make all these lengthy videos but not a video of their interaction with the ATV guy? Not a video of their interaction with the police? Not a video actually going through their findings?</p></li>
<li><p>With the amount of people that went over and assisted after this blew up, where are their youtube video confirmations? Reddit post confirmations? ANYTHING to help give credit to this. You would think they would be interested in takin a video as they walk through and &quot;see for themselves&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My conclusion on this whole thing is that I&#39;m still open to ANY possibility. But as a skeptic, these are my issues with the current situation. It seems so many are quick to jump ON a conspiracy, they fail to question the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Does anyone feel like this COULD BE the false flag for something else currently happening?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s an abandoned facility, shouldn&#39;t be that hard to take pictures and post them. Sure post a lot of videos but no pictures... Also location of evidence is key, so if they are taking things (to protect from tampering?) they should have pictures of the original locations. All of this can be shared without hampering any sort of investigation. It&#39;ll give credibility to the claims that are, right now, just a talking head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your 3 points are great and number 2 is my biggest concern.   So many people keep making claims in a lot of the conspiracies/crimes and no one presents real evidence or shows the vidence clearly.  Even when its right behind them.</p>

<p>From day one everything should have been documented and talked about when they found it how they found it.   You have the camera on the whole time recording.  Showing exactly where you&#39;re walking, looking at, ans what you actually see.  That way the viewer can decide.  Also if there is any issue later on you can say &quot;at minute xx:xx we walked to the tree and found 3 pairs of shoes with blood in them.  We did not touch them.  We called the police and stepped away from that scene.  We moved to area yy after as seen in the footage.&quot;</p>

<p>This helps prove you didnt tamper with evidence, you made an attempt to contact authorities, noted suspicion of possible homicide/violent act, and moved away from the scene to prevent any further issues.</p>

<p>Also slowly and clearly show the evidence.  For the love of god why does everyone just do a quick glimpse or hand the camera off to someone who is shaking more than a crack head going through withdraw(who also has Parkinson&#39;s disease)</p>

<p>And it is interesting that no major news source(that I know of. If you have seen it reported let me know) has picked up the story.  I haven&#39;t seen an article or even a quick talk about it on the major news networks.   Granted I don&#39;t watch 24/7.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your bit though and walking us through it all for what you think is up.   There is either a lot we arent being shown or something major is about to go down.</p>

<p>i believe that this lewis meyer guy is highly suspect already from the way he talks and the well worded post on 8chan which was up as of last night still, suggests he was at bundy ranch acting like a CI, has a long felonious record, and is accused in multiple veterans and homeless circles of bad stuff that should disqualify him from work protecting children.  </p>

<p>i personally think that only people with the absolute most spotless reputationss should go anywhere near children in a professional capacity and even moreso to be trusted with in-person investigations into abuse and trafficking.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t pass this standard personally, in my opinion at least so I prefer to do what i do best from a distance, read and write.  </p>

<p>It could also be that the crisis was that one of the more reputable members of the orgahization came on the scene first and lewis meyer just showed up on the scene as sort of fire control, and TPD was told at a high level to respond dismissively while damage control took over.  </p>

<p>They are most afraid of, and everyon who reads this really needs to get it through your head:</p>

<p>The intention of american military and law enforcement, which are now virtually unified, is to completely control the national news narrative for the rest of american history.  There can be no surprises, the system is too fragile.  </p>

<p>That said, every other aspect of this, the pedo logos in local businesses especially the casino, the school with the airport, the global connections of cemex.  the cemex and parker connection, all the businesses the rothchild guy owns, ffs.  This is the most obvious nexus worthy of investigation i may have ever seen, bronfman family is connected ffs.   CGI, carlos slim.  </p>

<p>The most convincing evidence to me thus far is the underground holding cell, if someone can convince me that this was anything other than a cell for a child.  </p>

<p>the strava map of the area, c&#39;mon, that is not homeless people and that is recent.  </p>

<p>show me there isn&#39;t a tunnel system under tuscon.  that&#39;s&#39; what i would like to see, these blueprints.  </p>

<p>the case against super-rich is that they and their descendants always turn into twisted dipshits and children start disappearing. </p>

<p>the problem isn&#39;t so much that the people are extremely wealthy, it&#39;s that there are no other forces in government or business who can question your power.  when you have that much money you can just helicopter it on every part of the system and get away with anything, as our president will soon demonstrate when he pardons himself.  </p>

<p>and if we were to prove any of these people were actual child traffickers and abusers, he would pardon them too.   fake news.  </p>

<p>the scrubbing of videos and the changing of the azcentral site, the bizarre un-urchiveability of a lot of the local websites....the coinciding mass shootings having to do with a child custody case....this starts to even look a little Las Vegasy....that couple that was shot had nothing to do with dwight and their lives don&#39;t add up either.  </p>

<p>I am prepared to discuss all of this with anyone who doesn&#39;t say anything absurd or impolite.  I have been barraged by cheap counter statements(not arguments) which to me indicates there is definite shill forces involved.  </p>

<p>I can say this for absolute sure, there are people being paid to defend trump no matter how absurd the attempt.  </p>

<p>I will say it again, trump is pizzagate.  epstein was caught at mar a lago recruiting 13 year olds, that is not coincidence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude my steemit article has a good dozen archived links from local AZ news proving AZ child services is corrupt and gets away claiming incompetence, and is immune from any oversight whatsoever but basically me at this point.   The parents rally for their kids back because so many are taken away for minor problems and then there is no chance to get them back and they turn up abused.  </p>

<p>ICE loses them, arpaio doesn&#39;t even respond to child abuse reports and there is obviously human trafficking going on with the cartels, now this rothchild/diamond casino/cemex shit.  </p>

<p>Come back and prove you understand why i fucking posted that steemit article and i will start to give you some respect.</p>

<p>If this is about the arthur lewis dude, here....well, isn&#39;t that interesting, i can&#39;t find a single 8chan post about tuscon....odd</p>

<p>if you find the threads, post them and i will go through them but basically just search for his name, if it was scrubbed, that is some confo right there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve told the story in like 10 comments, it gets old.  If I took exerpts from all the articles, then THAT would be a long article you wouldn&#39;t read. </p>

<p>The story covers 10 or so years, involves a good dozen people, and a girl was boiled alive until 90% of her body was burned, in a trash can, by a woman who should never have been a foster parent.  And the little girl was sent to this unfit foster parent from another unfit foster parent, an ex military computer network admin who is now serving 20 years for crimes he did to OTHER foster children he had at the time.  </p>

<p>I want to write a fucking book on this, but I would have to go to Arizona and interview all these people and that costs a lot, and I would probably get killed.  </p>

<p>I am telling other researchers that this is a good place to dig, that all the signs point to something really shitty going on, and everyone responds, &#39;ugh i hate reading so much, why don&#39;t you just give me a snippet&#39; </p>

<p>The fact is all the articles are trying very hard to say the opposite, this is all normal, nothing to see here, sure this kid got boiled alive by a woman who we knew was schizo, but gosh sometimes this just happens, the system has some problems, but we renamed the department and shuffled some stuff around, so don&#39;t worry your pretty head.  </p>

<p>If you are uninterested in reading those articles about this girl who got boiled alive and no one got punished for it and no one knows why and the same people responsible were promoted, then well, you&#39;re just kindof a mental slug like most people.  </p>

<p>since i started doing this, all of these sites can no longer be archived.  during my investigation, my internet was messed with that broke my vpn and i got strange phone calls with no one on the other end.  </p>

<p>read the first article, then the rest will eventually leave you with the question, why did people stop investigating this?  </p>

<p>do you think the situation with immigrant child trafficking camps is totally unrelated from the state child services or from arpaio?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude im saying that if the actual legal forces are themselves corrupt, then that&#39;s going to rot the fish all the way down the entire system, such.</p>

<p>if the child services investigators are in on it, and when they are promoted to the top ranks for overlooking/aiding all manner of shit, when the entire system is absurdly non-transparent, and there are numerous whistelblowers saying something is wrong, when the sheriff of a huge region doesn&#39;t even respond to reports of children being abused, we can extrapolate a few things from this information. </p>

<p>1 people in their system who are currently abusing children are going to be able to continue to get away with it very easily</p>

<p>2 people trafficking children through this area are going to be able to get away with it very easily</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote for you, from the mother of the girl that died (80% not 90% burned, my bad)</p>

<p>“No, not at all. I do not feel that DCS/CPS protected my child in any way,” Tremor said.</p>

<p>And a new development is that there are name changes for the mom, Tremor/Calderon and Devani&#39;s name was changed to Madison.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to find more information on the osteraas trial but i can&#39;t, it should have happend it&#39;s been a year.  A lot of new stories on it.  ont have time right now.<br/>

<p>I don&#39;t know how valid this information is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it looks like anon discovered that the drainage tunnels that end near where that camp was found lead back to the Desert Diamond Hotel and Casino in Tucson. This location has refused National Guard on their land, opposed the border wall, and 50% of all drug seizures in the NATION take place on their land.</p>

<p>&quot;BDA designed an offer in which Cemex would bring its customers greater certainty in their lives by making a promise to deliver a top quality product within 20 minutes of schedule, or a discount of approximately 5%, much like <a href="http://conversationsforaction.com/bda/cemex">Domino’s Pizza ...&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched one of the videos. That shit looks like a straight up homeless camp. Y’all realize homeless people will literally collect anything that is “free” right? Discarded items, stolen items, trash, anything they can get their hands on. I’ve seen tons of camps before where there are some straight bizarre shit there. </p>

<p>Here’s the other thing, why in the fuck would anyone trafficking children have such a shitty setup? Like I’m supposed to believe children are being trafficked through some random ass camp in the desert?</p>

<p>Secondly, why wouldn’t whoever was running that child sex slave camp just burn everything? Why leave evidence out in the open?</p>

<p>This whole thing stinks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think both sides of this are legit in the sub. If it&#39;s a pedo camp, it would be one hell of a conspiracy with the mayor and police basically signing off on it, so people are right to talk and speculate in that direction. On the other hand, it could be merely a homeless camp. </p>

<p>The &#39;evidence&#39; offered so far seems tenuous at best to me that it&#39;s a pedo camp. It might still be a human trafficking operation though. I don&#39;t think coyotes just drop people off at the border with a &quot;Buenas suerte&quot; and a tip o&#39; the sombrero. I&#39;m pretty sure they stage them somewhere and try to extract further money from them. So this could easily be that, which would include kids too.</p>

<p>What&#39;s weird to me in this sub is why people are overly focused on pedos when plain old human trafficking is just as bad. Like if there wasn&#39;t a naked barbie doll and 80 pairs of kids shoes, it seems like it would warrant a collective &#39;meh&#39; even though the misery of adults being trafficked is no less than that of kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s a staging area or transit site? I still don&#39;t buy that it&#39;s a child trafficking site, but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily rule out that it&#39;s just a plain old trafficking site. Due to it&#39;s proximity to Mexico it could easily be a staging area for Coyotes moving illegal immigrants across the border. Like as a place to hold them before they pay off any additional payments/extortion.</p>

<p>Just a guess. I&#39;m not sure why people go right to child trafficking when the area is known for illegal immigrant smuggling, and that often includes kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a comprehensive list of what has been found at the Tuscon site? It seems like people keep upping the ante. First it was a child-sized spiderhole, a naked barbie doll, and a couple rape trees, then the OP added 60+ pairs of children&#39;s shoes and some blueprints, now you are adding cribs, underwear and more toys.</p>

<p>It&#39;s getting a little dizzying trying to keep up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s probably a route that illegals use as well.  The rape tree isn&#39;t particularly surprising - illegals get raped by coyotes all the time.  And I&#39;m sure a lot of the kids get molested.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that pizzagate is real in some capacity because of the evidence and, more importantly, the strangely organized push back by the left on something that is supposedly just a crazy conspiracy.  David Brock put out CREW/Shareblue in full force to deflect and distract from his ex boyfriend and the mainstream media marched in unison to discredit it. That is the sort of push back that only happens when a nerve has been struck.</p>

<p>The reaction to this is partisan but not organized in my opinion.  It&#39;s the usual TMOR trash downvoting any conspiracy that might put their favorite people (Clintons, Soros, Rothchilds) in a bad light. </p>

<p>I have no doubt the Rothchilds are into some evil shit, but they aren&#39;t involved in <em>every</em> illegal or evil act in the world.  We have to consider the most likely of explanations first - and in this case, I think it&#39;s just old fashioned human trafficking and not part of anything larger.</p>

<p>I guess even if it&#39;s the latter, the media is supposed to <em>appear</em> to be independent, so any coordinated messaging is suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there IS an, or any, extensive child trafficking cartel attached to anything that could reasonably be called a global elite - and things like the Saville/chuck and Di connection and Epstein make it look feasible - you won&#39;t find their sites wandering in the woods. You wouldn&#39;t find them at all. If they exist, they&#39;re aware people suspect them in one form or another, and are using their wealth to remain unfound. Every time something like this happens and turns out to be nothing, it makes the overall idea - which is not crazy - seem crazier to the average person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CPS is the biggest culprit- that&#39;s why they are making vaccines &quot;mandatory &quot;.That way, when parents refuse (and it&#39;s usually on religious grounds), they swoop in, take the child or children, and  <em>POOF</em> -they lost track of where little Junior is ! </p>

<p><a href="http://medicalkidnap.com/2015/04/27/senator-nancy-schaefer-did-her-fight-against-cps-corruption-cost-her-life/">http://medicalkidnap.com/2015/04/27/senator-nancy-schaefer-did-her-fight-against-cps-corruption-cost-her-life/</a></p>

<p>Nancy Schaefer was completing a video exposing  the lack of oversight in Georgia’s Department of Family and Child Services (DFCS) as well as Child Protective Services (CPS) nationally.</p>

<p>Less than a year before she was murdered, Nancy Schaefer appeared on the Alex Jones show to discuss the American foster care and adoption business, and the terrible corruption involved with it, including “bounties” on children and child sex trafficking. Her interview is available via YouTube.</p>

<p>After she lost her State Senate seat due to what she believes was her report on CPS, she began to talk to other State Representatives and Senators around the country who were being confronted with CPS issues in their district, but they told her that if they did anything, they would lose their jobs just as Nancy Schaefer had.</p>

<p>Alex Jones asked her if there were “bounties on the heads of children” and Mrs. Schaefer said “yes,” and that in fact just the day before she had learned that “an order” had come in to a CPS office stating what kind of child someone wanted to adopt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Schaefer states that the financial motive for the State to legally kidnap children was put in place in 1974 by Walter Mondale with the “Adoption and Safe Families Act.” This was later expanded by President Bill Clinton in 1997 with The Adoption and Safe Families Act that gave states cash bonuses for every child adopted out of foster care. (Editor’s note: Bill Clinton signed this bill into law, but the bill was passed by the Republican-led House and Senate led by Newt Gingrich, so it was a bi-partisan effort initiated by a Republican majority in Congress.)</p>

<p>People need to understand that in cities there are not many family friendly homeless shelters. Plenty for men and women but they remain separate. and anyone who has ever been in a shelter knows it&#39;s not a great place anyways. </p>

<p>So a family that is unable to provide for itself and has become homeless either gets separated. or they create camps like this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at this place on a map, you can see that it&#39;s across the interstate from a suburban neighborhood.  I&#39;d bet that this place is really just &quot;the spot&quot; for the teens that live across the interstate.  We had places like that when I grew up where we&#39;d go to make out and do drugs.  Eventually you bring furniture and shit you find in the trash.  Sometimes a homeless person finds it and lives there for a bit.   In the case of tucson it&#39;s even more likely that migrants on foot pass through this spot.</p>

<p>What actual evidence have they presented (I mean actual photographic evidence of actual things)?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some &quot;restraints&quot; tied to &quot;rape trees&quot;.  But in the videos of the restraints you can see that there are other logs lashed to the trees in the same way.  These are basically just interior decorating or building structure like a kid&#39;s tree house.</p></li>
<li><p>Some toys strewn about.  Well when I was a kid we used to do shit like light barbies on fire, explode GI-joes etc. in these same types of spots. </p></li>
<li><p>Basic living stuff like shaving cream.  Self explanatory for a homeless person living there.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;bunker&quot; is a water container that&#39;s been cut open and covered over with debris.   Probably a great way to make a weather proof enclosure that can get you away from the elements.  Useful for migrants, homeless, and to make out or do drugs in.  </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of going off topic, flat Earth and hollow Earth don&#39;t provide an explanation for gravity only because you believe that gravity is linked to mass. You only believe gravity is linked to mass because the scientific establishment has linked gravity to mass through experimentation based on the premise that the Earth is not flat or hollow.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s a circular argument.</p>

<p>Now, before you say &quot;Ok smartass, then what is gravity&quot;, I&#39;ll head you off and say that I believe it is linked to mass and that the earth is not hollow or flat. I&#39;m just pointing out that the entire premise is based on a circular argument that we choose to believe one way over the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve told the story in like 10 comments, it gets old.  If I took exerpts from all the articles, then THAT would be a long article you wouldn&#39;t read. </p>

<p>The story covers 10 or so years, involves a good dozen people, and a girl was boiled alive until 90% of her body was burned, in a trash can, by a woman who should never have been a foster parent.  And the little girl was sent to this unfit foster parent from another unfit foster parent, an ex military computer network admin who is now serving 20 years for crimes he did to OTHER foster children he had at the time.  </p>

<p>I want to write a fucking book on this, but I would have to go to Arizona and interview all these people and that costs a lot, and I would probably get killed.  </p>

<p>I am telling other researchers that this is a good place to dig, that all the signs point to something really shitty going on, and everyone responds, &#39;ugh i hate reading so much, why don&#39;t you just give me a snippet&#39; </p>

<p>The fact is all the articles are trying very hard to say the opposite, this is all normal, nothing to see here, sure this kid got boiled alive by a woman who we knew was schizo, but gosh sometimes this just happens, the system has some problems, but we renamed the department and shuffled some stuff around, so don&#39;t worry your pretty head.  </p>

<p>If you are uninterested in reading those articles about this girl who got boiled alive and no one got punished for it and no one knows why and the same people responsible were promoted, then well, you&#39;re just kindof a mental slug like most people.  </p>
