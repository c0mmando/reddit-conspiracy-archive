       Hello and welcome to the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the research and findings of disturbing "ElsaGate" material, I came across recently some very disturbing videos and even live channels playing some very disturbing animated content.
      </p>
      <p>
       The themes of these videos and content I stumbled upon (and I am sure others have too) is straight mind filler garbage and almost suggestive of darker themes. This needs far greater research and investigation which is why I am here today sharing this with you reading this right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Color has more power than we realize.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.colour-affects.co.uk/psychological-properties-of-colours">
        http://www.colour-affects.co.uk/psychological-properties-of-colours
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these videos incorporate different patterns of color and in some cases, incorporate phallic imagery or almost mirrored body functions that bring it in a weird conditioning kind of manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first glance these videos may seem harmless and may seem okay to let your kid mindlessly watch. But as soon as you click on one and actually watch what is playing it is quite disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comments of these videos are equally alarming, and after the big surfacing scandal of "recording from x/x/20" where it would pull up YouTube videos of what appeared to be webcam recordings of very young children, oftentimes scantily dressed and doing various things.. You may ask what the harm is until you read the comments on ALL OF THESE VIDEOS.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a whole different topic or thread almost but I just wanted to compare some lateral search terms and the fact that YouTube is hosting many of these and often times won't even respond to user requests to delete this footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile gun channels and CBD and cannabis channels are being banned and shut down left and right and egotistical garbage stunts fueled into impressionable minds watching "youtube stars" like Paul Logan and many others that totally just exhibit a complete lack of respect and etiquette of social norms and what it means to literally be a human being. Breaking down the social fabric that holds us to a standard of decency and respect towards each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       This too, can be a whole different thread in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now we are going to go back to these ElsaGate themed videos and channels I came across.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took a total of about 25 photos, but there are so many more channels and videos and live streamings of this garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look....

       Notice the use of cockroaches in the bottom video in conjunction with the colors. Cockroaches and various creepy crawlies like spiders and others have long been used by not only cults but also as satanic rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple cases of children describing the use of insects and small coffins and being stuck with insects. This can be a method used to split and fracture the child's mind. Here is a video of a child recounting such experiences of being forced to do things like that involving insects and also other children going through the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       MKUltra has shed light on some dark things and concepts relating to these avenues of splitting the mind and creating sub personalities or whatever. The reason I am bringing all of this up is because there truly is a lot more of this going on behind the scenes and it in some cases can be truly connected in many ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some additional videos and links regarding MKUltra and also some videos.

       Ronald Bernard, "Revelations From An Insider". This is a must watch series of interviews. Not only does he describe these same cult like practices once he got higher up in the banking/financing world, he says several times how he was told to put his conscious in a proverbial freezer. And set aside what he may see. What broke him and made him leave the financing world was involving child sacrifice.

       Something seems to be fishy here because what the fuck is going on. Let's have a respectful discussion about what the hell not only these ElsaGate themed videos are, but how they may impact the childs mind. We all know how malleable children can be and they learn so well and pick up behaviors quickly. What are these kinds of videos, stuck on auto-play, mindlessly pumping the child's head full of this mind filler or god knows what while the parent does not even know and is just trying to cook dinner or whatever the fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excuse my passion here but my lord can anyone else not see how systematically prevalent this type of BS is?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's get a discussion going and I would love like minds and truth seekers to help us find more information regarding this and get some awareness going. Additional research, links, and hands on keyboard help is much appreciated from all of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate your time and let's make a better world for our children to actually grow up in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember love, and stay in the light.

       The Internet is a cesspool of machine generated propaganda and brainwashing. Yet everyday I see kids already enslaved to this shit. They're taught to stare at tablets from the time they're able to read, they're glued to phones at restaurant tables, and hell my sister has a tantrum when she have her phone at all times.

       I don't understand how people are brainwashed through the internet? I get brainwashing up close and personal. But on the internet? Unless they use some sort of technology and not just some tactic of feeding you a bunch of bs over and over. I would think people in general were smarter than to be brainwashed just from reading something unless they have some sort of tech that just shoots something into your brain and can make you think and do whatever they want. I don't get it.

       It's not the Clockwork Orange "strap you to a chair and force open your eyes" style that we see from movies. The Internet is more subtle than that. Take political discussion for example, people shut themselves in and only expose themselves to one set of ideas until it's all they can tolerate. Those ideas become imprinted on to them and they'll refuse to see any situation any other way and will react aggressively to things that violate this worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the Elsagate videos it's more the imprinting disgusting and bizarre ideas on to young, impressionable minds factor of brainwashing.

       In this context it's a little different. You're obviously an adult or at least old enough to be able to read and be like nah this isn't for me. I watch people let their kids run loose with youtube and it's pretty sad the path of autoplay videos in kids stuff.

       Before they can read, actually and unfortunately. I've seen kids that could barely sit up in a stroller or Carr watching phones and tablets where clips like this were literally screaming and barking sounds at them, and they're just hypnotized, crosseyed and drooling while mom gossips into her phone and keeps shopping...

       I think it can be used for good and for awareness and further educational application but many people become zombiefied and get sucked in too easily.

       It's good to set healthy boundaries and realize when it's time to put the phone down. Which many don't do but not all of us abuse the Internet

       I agree with you here.  It is both good and bad like everything else in the world.  It is also healing the world in my opinion.  It is much harder to go to war with another country when many kids are sitting at home and actually playing games with kids from the very country "they" want to contrive a war with.  It is making the world a smaller community.

       Holy fuck this, as if TV wasn't already bad enough... sure, let's just leave our kids rotting in front of a fucking tablet all day! And if you want your kid to watch youtube safely at least make a playlist of handpicked videos... What makes me mad isn't really this Elsagate stuff itself but irresponsible parents who don't know how to raise their kids.

       I can't agree more. It can almost take the place of parenting and in this day and age of working all the time and being busy, parenting becomes a back seat endeavor and they opt for easy routes like plopping them in front of the tv or giving them a tablet. Same things been done for a while and shitty parents have always existed in regards to not properly raising their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this mind garbage? What is it doing and why is there such a disturbing theme among these videos. I just wonder the mechanisms behind it or if it's just an easy cash grab for YouTube creators.

       I've always felt like the whole Elsagate thing was just a way for people to make easy money. Almost all of those videos are around the 10 minute mark which YouTube promotes videos that are around 10 minutes in length.

       The other day on YouTube, I had a few choices in my recommended that were quite a contrast to the usual content I'm given. I clicked on one video, although I can't remember exactly what the video was now. Regardless, it was something very "normie" and out of my usual spectrum of what I watch. After that happened, ALL of my recommend videos turned into these weird, bright-colored kids videos with questionable themes in the videos. It was crazy how literally one video changed the entire algorithm of what it recommended me. It took me a few days for it to go back to normal.

       Same shit happens to adults but more subtly. I always use an adblocker but my buddy was watching YouTube on his ps4 and it tried to show 20-40 minute ads occasionally. Obviously these would only be watched while you're sleeping, kinda creepy.

       Knowing what I know now, there’s no way in hell I’d let a kid have unsupervised access to the internet until they’re old enough to have formed some discretion. It’s no coincidence that the iPads most parents use to tranquilize their children are the points of contact for whoever is pushing this evil content onto their malleable minds.

       I've learned the hard way with this nonsense. As an early cord cutter, I didn't take into account the impact of losing Disney would have on my girls. Figured, might as well use Youtube, so I setup an account and followed the "official Disney" accounts for a few of their favorite shows (P.J. Masks and shit). After one full episode, you're thinking, this is great. However, ALLLL of the "recommended" videos are these crazy "color" videos. You'd think it would rope into the subscribed accounts from Disney, but instead it's endless color videos for kids. If I have my tin foil hat on, I'm wondering if Disney has a hand in these videos somehow. The recommended videos often have Disney characters in the title so it links up quickly with the actual episode you are watching: "Learn to count with colors with P.J. Masks". Shit's wild.

       For all we know, dirty hands could be pushing these videos and I don't understand AT ALL, the obvious obsession with color. Every video. Every single video. Bright colors and sometimes phallic objects as well as straight sexual material or even deranged like injections and also cockroaches and bugs. What the fuck does that do to a child's mind?

       Yes, but this isn't it. These videos are weird because they're created by software. It monitors what gets the most views and creates content to fit. It's an AI feedback loop.

       Haha, bro, It's a logical fallacy to think that just because someone is in the minority, they need to provide the  proof. Being in the minority has no bearing on who is right and who needs to provide proof.

       There was a claim and u/Kushner asked for evidence. He has no responsibility to provide proof of the contrary.

       Yeah, a piece of software creates human actors that film "Elsa/Joker/Spiderman" -videos in empty LA condos on display. Sure. It's not all cartoons, you know. H3H3/Ethan Klein noticed many of the live-acted ones with dry humping and sex stuff are filmed in Hollywood and LA and he even tracked down the exact house one was filmed at on Google Maps and learned they went there illegally to film that shit, with random little kids with them.

       Atleast they actually care about getting you off (even though porn conspiracies is another avenue of moral degradation but that's a whole different topic. And it can be balanced safely just like anything)

       But in this regard, the videos are just straight brain mushing mindless garbage. Another poster said it best how it can overload and stimulate the mind and cause anxiety conditioning

       These videos are designed in such a way to form anxiety patterns in children’s minds. They use childlike objects but the content of the videos induce sensory overload causing the child to experience an episode of anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple bright colors moving across a white screen causes your brain to process a lot at once. This is not something the human brain has naturally evolved to process. Then you add in the weird unnatural subjects of the videos such as red goo squirting from a blue truck or unnaturally colored animals, or insects in weird spots, etc. and your brain says what the fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do the same thing with adults too. Just watch the newest Ariana Grande music video with 200 million views. Watch the video and immediately you can sense the anxiety growing.

       This new age media is designed to make you feel this way. Ingrain addicting anxiety pathways into the brains of everyone. You learn these patterns over endless repetition of viewing media and your brain easily reverts to these patterns whenever you are fearful. When you are fearful you are moldable.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are teaching children these pathways as early as possible to fragment the mind and create new moldable minds.

       I figured it was something similar to exactly what you are describing and I know what you mean about the anxiety!!

       So many videos do it and cause that feeling. I've also been observing some of the "spicy memes" that hit the front page (the super colorful overloading ones) and they legitimately make me feel sick to my stomach

       When I was going through the gallery OP posted I saw a few "suggestive" images but aside from that it was more just...weird, and I felt myself growing anxious slightly but I didn't see anything truly "bad" to me. Or so I thought. What you're saying sort of makes sense and probably answers to why I felt a little uneasy.

       I let my daughter watch these videos for about a year because 1. I had postpartum depression, 2. I was ignorant to all the videos she was watching 3. I was irresponsible and shouldn’t have had a kid at 18 and 4. I lost my dad to suicide prior and was just NOT in the right mindset to be taking care of a child. Luckily I wised the hell up and realized what I was doing and what type of videos she was watching... but now that she’s 3 (she watched them from 6 months old to 1.5) she still has little habits like biting her nails to the stub and staring blankly when she gets in trouble (like a legit PTSD blank stare. Never seen any kid do it before, it breaks my heart).... I have SO many regrets and insomnia because the guilt eats me up so much I can’t sleep at night and its all I can think about is how I fucked up so hard for that one year. Is there any way I can reverse the anxiety it has obviously caused her or did I permanently mess up my kid by being an awful parent and letting her stare at these videos all day? Any advice welcomed... I’ll do anything to help her and try and make up for my past mistakes, immaturity and ignorance.

       . It used to be a daily thing but now only happens when she’s in trouble, I don’t think she needs professional help but I think if it continues I’ll definitely ask her pediatrician... just not exactly sure how to tell him it was from an overdose of creepy YouTube videos.

       And yeah, probably right on #2. The guilt definitely eats me alive.

       You dont know if it is caused by those videos, you have convinced yourself due to guilt. Better to get a professional oppinion, don't mention the videos initially before you get the opinion. Maybe its nothing/normal.

       Side note: do you have a YouTube account? Reason why I ask is because it saves your view history and if you do seek help for your daughter you can show them what exactly she watched and I imagine that could help in the whole process.

       The main reason I say #1 is not because I think there is anything wrong with her personally, but because I think a doctor saying "this is normal" will sound a lot more relieving than a random person on the internet saying it, and if there actually is an issue then better safe than sorry!
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to raise the Youtube videos specifically, certainly not at first. You might be better off explaining the symptoms that you're concerned about, then depending on how that convo goes you could probably raise the idea of her watching content online that you're concerned might have had an effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I would try not to let these things stress you too much. A child's brain is constantly developing throughout their childhood and I don't think a small part of her total development, just over 1 year, is going to have caused some unchangeable or unfixable psychological damage. :) But again, an expert telling you that will probably help more than me saying it!

       Be careful as to whom you choose. These people are (some NOT ALL) in a very evil system and your child is the very commodity they need for ANY NUMBER OF HORRIFIC THINGS AHEAD. Many have shared their experiences with child welfare systems and most things started with something as benign as just pot smoking and turned into a child placed in the hands of foster parents that killed them. Not to increase the anxety in you AT ALL but keep your family business to family and to those that EARED YOUR TRUST AND CONFIDENCE. That doesnt mean titles or things that are manditory "help". PEACE EVERYONE.

       The problem with professionals is that they are quick to prescribe drugs to both adults and children.  Be careful, because what they don't tell you is that psych drugs are a bitch to quit complete with withdrawal symptoms.  They can also permanently change your psychology and not necessarily for the better.

       No seriously, this is it right here.  The sun, trees, leaves, grass, ocean or mountains, or wherever  you may be, it will purge whatever poison modern society has injected into you.  From personal experience, while you are out there hunting for bugs or chip monks or sand crabs, tell yourself that you are a good person and that you are loved and forgiven.  You will both probably be better then ever before.

       The brain is incredibly malleable and the human body is amazing at repairing itself. Your daughter can heal and so can you. I'm a parent, every parent has regrets and things they wish they could redo. Start the healing process, you're already so far ahead of so many in recognising that some changes need to be made.

       When you're fearing something, you bargain and accept anything to reduce that fear. Like being afraid of terrorists and you give up some personal freedoms and agree to be spied on "for safety". Mass hysteria.

       That article is about anxiety becoming triggered by otherwise benign things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't say anything about how when someone is in a heightened state of fear they're more susceptible to be molded, which is my original question because a state of fear seems, to me anyways, to be the time when I'm least open to new ideas.

       You are making a statement as well without backing.  But I hardly think that requiring every person to submit a source for any and every claim is fruitful to inquiry.  If you don't think there are attempts to introduce trauma based mind control in mainstream media, then you are probably in the wrong subreddit.

       And for a source, simply look up the CIA MKUltra files.  Best source there is...primary.  It's far from "pseudo scientific bullshit".

       One thing I recently read was that Jeffrey Epstein has a bunch of prosthetic eyes, and it led me to think about the "band" The Residents (whom Penn from Penn and Teller was an "announcer" for).  They basically make music to elicit negative emotions. And lo and behold, the Residents, who used to perform in giant eyeballs, now wear straight up Illuminati masks and satanic attire.

       Not difficult. Nearly impossible. Hypnosis is bunk. At most it's a way for certain performers to get a crowd laughing by asking their "subjects" not to ruin the fun by not going along with the request to cluck like a chicken.

       Vibration,Frequencies,Sound, and Visuals are all used as weapons against us. They use LRADS (sound cannons) for crowd controll, which is just a cannon that belts out powerful frequencies to render the human body useless. Hitler even used vibration and frequency to install fear and anxiety in the crowds and would turn it off just before going on stage so people felt the massive wave of relief as they seen Hitler come on stage.

       Yeah the cell phone towers are pretty bad I personally would never live right next to one either. And yeah the other towers which are linked with Cell Phone towers are also bad news. A lot of people shut off when they hear the word microwave because people just think its an appliance. But micro-wave technology is very real, and very powerful. Just like Radar and the LRAD sound cannons, using vibration and frequencies, microwave is more direct, harnessing that is very powerful also. I have heard of what is called "Targeted Individuals", even met a self proclaimed one, which with their theory is plausible too. MK Ultra, WiFi, Microwave, yeah I would and do believe it.

       Thank you for taking screenshots instead of driving traffic to the videos. I feel like they have so many views because they are sensational and people share them, which garners more views which help the creators get revenue.

       I've noticed some comments on these videos with other video channels with other color videos all complimenting each other and some of them talking about how good and well made the animations are.
      </p>
      <p>
       These videos aren't hard to find which is the other depressing thing. Live streams as in not only 1, but 3-4+.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also some comments appear to be Russian. Creepy to note that some comments also are sexual in nature or have innuendo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of all this, I want to know why YouTube is allowing such a thing. If one channel created in 2017 has 200,000,000 views already what kind of payout is that? It's very disturbing and either they are in on it or just don't care or aren't aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the true people behind these channels? And the animators? That too, is what I want to know

        Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to systematically frighten, traumatise, and abuse children, automatically and at scale, and it forces me to question my own beliefs about the internet, at every level. Much of what I am going to describe next has been covered elsewhere, although none of the mainstream coverage I’ve seen has really grasped the implications of what seems to be occurring

       I wouldnt put it past google to do that. After all watching some independant comentary like tyt and jimmy dore and after 2-3 videos a cnn or fox or some other big MSM video comes into autoplay...   Like obviously I am watching them for a reason, and yt still pushes big media stories into my autoplay.

       So what ever the reason to brainwash children, getting to them whilst they are young, means they will be far more likely to adopt their pushed ideologies. After all young plyable maluable minds, science is there.

       That girls testimony was a hoax. The events she described didn't actually happen, this was part of the first wave of satanic panic in the 80s and used debunked psychology of "repressed memories".

       Seems there's many themes that are pressed into children's minds. A huge obvious one is the sexualization of children but other ones like the one you mentioned are abundant as well and quite manipulative.

       It's a bit subtle but in the elsagate videos for example they use random punishments or change the answers/order so the child is 'wrong' when right, etc. If you read about it you'll hopefully see the connection.

       would you prefer a nation of free thinkers you cant control or a bunch of drones who trudge through life and can't think of how to help themselves and improve the situation, thus accepting anything. Or it could just be pure business. Tests show kids don't turn over if the cartoon causes them to feel anxiety. So to TV networks cartoons designed with that in mind are better because it keeps the kids viewing and gets more ad revenue. Probably why most disney films start with a traumatic event like a parent dying. Disneys also apparently filled with symbolism, so that could have a subliminal affect too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the feeling there is a huge wealth of knowledge on this that people like us just aren't welcome to.

       disney is the worst. I'd hate to have a daughter who watched the disney channel. Every 5 years or so the latest role model from disney turns into a complete degenerate that all their fans follow. Imagine your daughter loving Mylee Cyrus or whoever else. There's so much going on for so many different reasons. We'll probably never see the full scope of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats room 33? I heard there's a tunnel system or something there that kids go missing in or something but pretty much zero evidence of anything like that happening that i know of. Think the abuse probably takes place at the studios if anything... their child actors have a tendency to become a bit insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know much about Walt either. Wasn't he a Nazi sympathiser and a mason? I still get the feeling he'd hate what Disney has become though.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a video on youtube of a guy drawing all the disney characters and he starts almost all of them with a penis. It's crazy to watch. Draws a dick and then turns into like mickey or goofy or whatever over and over. It's full of it. Google the lion king cover and you see a womans arse bending over at the top, but its also a lions head... god knows what all this symbolism getting absorbed does to a mind.

       I think it really can be a case by case thing and if the YouTube video is well sourced, documented, and linked, then perhaps it has more weight than other YouTube videos.

       As a parent of two kiddos under 4, I've had to navigate what's okay for them to watch and what's not. The random garbage on YouTube is definitely not okay for them, even though I don't think it's a conspiracy to do anything more than crank out cheap content to get easy views.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I completely understand why parents put an iPad in their kid's hands for 20 minutes to they can actually get some shit done in peace and quiet. It doesn't make them bad parents or sheeple or whatever. It just means that kids have a really high motor (especially boys) and really want to help you do stuff that you really don't want or need their help to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some kids shows are fine. Sesame Street is great. Paw Patrol, PJ Masks, etc, are obnoxious but mostly harmless as long as you don't fall down the merch rabbit hole. But these YouTube videos are just junk.

       Off topic, but when I was a teen I once wrote a fantasy story where at the start, the protagonist (a boy) is randomly targeted by a satanic cult (his brother went missing when he was younger)  and has a ritual done to him, involving torture, rape, insects ... all of that. Then I later thought it was too extreme to write into the story (which is about magic, satanists, demons etc. funnily enough ... and strangely very accurate too), but I still have the excerpt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d never seen such a thing before, or even believed in any actual proper satanic cult, so I don’t know where I got it from. Perhaps my intelligent subconscious? It’s just weird how accurate it was to what I’ve read about all these years later.

       Thank you for sharing this!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something I feel would fall under the subconscious. Being a creative writer, I am sure you are familiar with intuitive writing. This is essentially the feeling when you are "in the zone" or very focused and words are just flowing through you. This is a type of channeling called intuitive writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may truly have tapped the subconscious in that instance and wrote of something that has taken place or does take place, which could explain why you felt bad and felt sick afterwards. This ties into the akashic records. I don't want to go too in depth and make this incoherent and I also don't know of your beliefs but the fact you know of the subconscious is great because this is where this kind of information can be pulled from.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I am almost wondering if you intuitively wrote from that kind of perspective. It's fascinating but like you I would get sick from it too. It's sad to know such activities could be happening, but it's certainly not one we should ignore or look away from. So in that sense I do think it can be applicable to raise awareness of these activities even though it may upset people. And in your case it helps paint that perspective as well and then be able to match it up later in life and share it here. I truly believe in synchronicity and everything happening for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless I hope to hear back and thanks for the response!

       The colors in the screenshots you made galleries of are bright and attract the viewers eyes and attention.  That might be the only reason the video creators chose to use them, unless some of the brightly colored things are being advertized for sale.  The pont is still to attract the child's attention with bright color.  (S)he clicks on the brightly colored video to watch it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The content of some of the videos is perverse and victimizes children, such as when they're shown restrained on a bed with duct tape.  It's been pointed out before on r/conspiracy that these videos may lead to outright child pornography available elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, IMHO the US and Europe are being attacked via many strategies, and here it is-in your face-your children are fair game.

       Great response and I agree. Considering how easy it would be to animate such things with such intent while having the knowledge of what it can do. In this case the top response said it best with the anxiety patterning. This can be one way to target youth and as you say too it seems some is done as legitimate grooming and also breaking down of children while they are malleable. The restraint and duct tape being apart of that and then the over sexualization geared towards kids to corrupt them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's absolutely dirty dirty dark stuff that just makes me want to throw up and take a shower. But it needs awareness and that's the only way we can create change. That's why I wanted to create this thread and do what I can to contribute and I'm really happy with the comments and discussion here it's all been great.

       Yep.  There are interesting and intelligent comments here.  It's worrisome that kids are targeted.  I guess it's just about impossible for parents to protect their kids from all this shit.  You might not be old enough (?) to remeber the 1980s and 90s when there was an obvious effort began using TV shows, cartoons and advertizing to make kids believe their parents were stupid and inept, and this really was a method to take kids away from their parents.  Listen to us-not your stupid parents.  It's clearly demonstrated when parents choose to home school their kids sometimes making the law step in and take the kids away from them.  And how much say do parents have regarding the public school curriculum and what it teaches their kids.  Somewhat of a tangent, but it's all part of a plan.

       I saw those shows and I know what you mean. Especially with the home schooling.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a slow moving system of control that has slowly consumed everything and will consume everything if we let it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that chain of control is being broken right before our eyes but we still need to continue to raise awareness
      </p>
      <p>
       You commenting and us talking like this helps and you gave me even more ammo and stuff to look into, which is older children's cartoons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember some dark dark stuff too on some of the shows but maybe that was just the social norm at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless thank you. Cartoons and tv shows themselves are another avenue to research. There's also some interesting awakening insightful shows and movies and I do remember hearing how stranger things had some positive intent behind releasing the show.

       It's crazy how much the children have been targeted... It's because they know that's their best way of enacting control later on down the line because they can't right now or they'd lose. And they are losing because it blew up in their greedy faces

       You're welcome for my input however trvial it might be.

       Something worth checking out is how filmmakers, advertizers, and children's show producers, writers and directors use particular means to influence viewers' psychology.  Those methods include lighting, color, camera angle, music/sound, makeup, and costume and so on.  I can't provide you with any especially good source, but maybe the search terms "film analysis" would take you there.
      </p>

       Perhaps the dark contect in old TV shows is sometimes subliminal "dirtyness" that these creeps who produce them merely put there for their perverted sense of fun, such as for example (going way way back) the Leave it to Beaver show, where the character has the name "Beaver Cleaver".  Apparently Walt Disney productions is filled with innuendo as well.
      </p>

       It's purely evil that kids are targeted, and as someone said here, it's intended to create anxiety in addition to brainwashing.  I think, too, it's meant to destroy the ego and replace it with a zombielike consciousness with no free will.

       Yeah the cell phone towers are pretty bad I personally would never live right next to one either. And yeah the other towers which are linked with Cell Phone towers are also bad news. A lot of people shut off when they hear the word microwave because people just think its an appliance. But micro-wave technology is very real, and very powerful. Just like Radar and the LRAD sound cannons, using vibration and frequencies, microwave is more direct, harnessing that is very powerful also. I have heard of what is called "Targeted Individuals", even met a self proclaimed one, which with their theory is plausible too. MK Ultra, WiFi, Microwave, yeah I would and do believe it.

       I'm more concerned about the advertising for sugary/fatty foods during ads than I am about the content.

       I think the videos are odd but so are kids. I don't find them disturbing or creepy.

       The burden of proof is on the person making the statement.

       I do know that the fear centers of our brain respond like it is a physical attack when our core beliefs are attacked which is why I think what he wrote is pseudo scientific bullshit and why I wanted to know a source for that part of what he said.

       I think it really can be a case by case thing and if the YouTube video is well sourced, documented, and linked, then perhaps it has more weight than other YouTube videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can provide additional links and research if need be but all I was really doing was painting a picture and opening a line of discussion towards this. Thankfully the top commenter really helped piece it together for us

       I saw those shows and I know what you mean. Especially with the home schooling.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a slow moving system of control that has slowly consumed everything and will consume everything if we let it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that chain of control is being broken right before our eyes but we still need to continue to raise awareness
      </p>
      <p>
       You commenting and us talking like this helps and you gave me even more ammo and stuff to look into, which is older children's cartoons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember some dark dark stuff too on some of the shows but maybe that was just the social norm at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless thank you. Cartoons and tv shows themselves are another avenue to research. There's also some interesting awakening insightful shows and movies and I do remember hearing how stranger things had some positive intent behind releasing the show.

       Haha, bro, It's a logical fallacy to think that just because someone is in the minority, they need to provide the  proof. Being in the minority has no bearing on who is right and who needs to provide proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a claim and u/Kushner asked for evidence. He has no responsibility to provide proof of the contrary.
