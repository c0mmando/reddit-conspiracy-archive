<p>Also, there was a substantial report done by none other than Fox News. It&#39;s one of the most jaw-dropping things I have seen produced by the mainstream media. </p>

<p><strong>Massive Spy Ring Uncovered in US.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fox News has learned some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S., who <strong>may have known things they didn&#39;t tell us before September 11.</strong> Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron has details in the first of a four-part series.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Part 1: <a href="http://youtu.be/5fm0_7jVqcE">http://youtu.be/5fm0_7jVqcE</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Tonight, in the second of four reports on spying by Israelis in the U.S., we learn about an <strong>Israeli-based private communications company, for whom a half-dozen of those 60 detained suspects worked. American investigators fear information generated by this firm may have fallen into the wrong hands and had the effect of impeded the Sept. 11 terror inquiry.</strong> Here&#39;s Carl Cameron&#39;s second report.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Part 2: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhAEjSQghj8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhAEjSQghj8</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Last time we reported on an Israeli-based company called Amdocs Ltd. that generates the computerized records and billing data for nearly every phone call made in America.  As Carl Cameron reported, <strong>U.S. investigators digging into the 9/11 terrorist attacks fear that suspects may have been tipped off to what they were doing by information leaking out of Amdocs.  In tonight&#39;s report, we learn that the concern about phone security extends to another company, founded in Israel, that provides the technology that the U.S. government uses for electronic eavesdropping.</strong>  Here is Carl Cameron&#39;s third report. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Part 3: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENwze5owq4w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENwze5owq4w</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>This week, senior correspondent Carl Cameron has reported on a longstanding government espionage investigation.  F<strong>ederal officials this year have arrested or detained nearly 200 Israeli citizens suspected of belonging to an &quot;organized intelligence-gathering operation.&quot;   The Bush administration has deported most of those arrested after Sept. 11, although some are in custody under the new anti-terrorism law.</strong> Cameron also investigates the possibility that an Israeli firm generated billing data that could be used for intelligence purpose, and describes concerns that the federal <strong>government&#39;s own wiretapping system may be vulnerable.</strong> Tonight, in part four of the series, we&#39;ll learn about the probable roots of the probe: a drug case that went bad four years ago in L.A. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m obviously not saying the 5 guys did it. But if you listen to them, they indirectly say that Israel had prior knowledge (otherwise how could they be sent there). If I am being hostile towards Israel, so were the 5 Israelis in question. I am just repeating what they said.</p>

<p>I think it is okay to be a little apprehensive towards Israel and the US as they keep advancing their Middle East agenda. And when these 5 guys <em>implement themselves</em> by the way they acted and admitting they had prior knowledge of the towers falling, am I supposed to ignore it because they&#39;re Israeli? </p>

<p>Not being apprehensive would be foolish when you look at the Middle East now and 17 years ago. It has been crushed. So if that is too much, I am guilty. However, I am not saying that Jews or Americans are bad people, just that I am apprehensive towards the countries foreign policies and I don&#39;t trust their agenda. The reason I don&#39;t is the last 17 years, both in terms of what has been done to the Middle East and the way the US and Israel has put themselves at the front of this development.</p>

<p>Have we reached the point where we cannot reference media and history? If we cannot debate honestly, why debate at all? And I say that with respect towards every Israeli or US citizen. I am from Denmark myself, &#39;we&#39; attacked the Middle East as well, we were in the illegal war in Iraq and in Afghanistan. We have blood on our hands as well and I cannot get behind those actions either. I won&#39;t vilify Israel or the US, but I won&#39;t lie or pretend not to remember history either. That goes for every single country on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Your mentioned reasons entirely lack context - literally pulled out of the air. </p>

<p>They could have been in NYC on a street food eating vacation? Or to go to the Met?</p>

<p>Your reasons are utterly useless in this case, and they don&#39;t address the comments they made about being there to film the &quot;event&quot;. It also doesn&#39;t explain the celebratory nature. They were reported by several people who saw the same thing. They were celebrating the attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were months of advanced warning. The Bush administration was completely negligent. It doesn&#39;t surprise me so much that intelligence from elsewhere would have wanted to bear witness.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know that the Israeli had better intel than we did. We don&#39;t know for example how long those operatives had been visiting. There is as yet no evidence that we knew the timing precisely, but we did know about Al Qaeda having operatives in the U.S. and that they were planning an imminent attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is wrong. There is a video which shows a few seconds from a long interview. It has been heavily edited <strong>in order to deceive you.</strong></p>

<p>In the whole interview, they say that they were in the U.S. as tourists and to work at a moving company. They heard about the plane hitting the World Trade Center and drove to somewhere that they could see what was happening. The apartment complex they were seen at was near the offices of the moving company but wasn&#39;t a particularly good place to see the WTC. It was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/f4mmh9f.png">3 miles away.</a></p>

<p>The interviewer asks why they took pictures and one of them answered &quot;to document the event.&quot; There was no implication that they had advance knowledge or that they were sent by someone else. Hundreds of other people in New York also took pictures.</p>

<p>The same FBI report that said that 2 of the 5 Israelis had intelligence connections also said that there was no evidence that any of them had advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly man, I&#39;m sorry. I felt &quot;How are Jews scapegoated when they literally invented it&quot; was such an absurd question that I responded in bad faith. Let me just tell you where I&#39;m coming from here.</p>

<p>Jewish people didn&#39;t &quot;invent&quot; scapegoating, people have been shifting blame since there were people. If the English word for that comes from Jewish culture, my passing familiarity with the history of Jews in Medieval England leads me to believe that has more to do with their experience as convenient tools of political power than it being a gambit they dreamed up to get one over on the gentiles. Christians couldn&#39;t loan money for interest to other Christians, but Jews could, so they would get dispensations from the kings to be moneylenders.</p>

<p>The other side of this was that Jews couldn&#39;t become knights or establish vassals, and also that they were usually living in minority communities dotted among Christian majorities because of the diaspora. There was some financial power, but the lack of a bulwark of physical power meant they were essentially a piggybank for whenever the crown needed some quick cash or an outsider to blame. Eventually they were expelled and not allowed back for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Jews have been catching this shit all over Europe for centuries and centuries from people who&#39;d rather blame a perceived outsider for the balance of power in their communities, especially from people in power who stand to gain from you not looking too hard at their own bad decisions. In my opinion, it&#39;s a distraction people here fall into way too easily.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t call you Hitler, I said you were parroting his rhetoric, and it wasn&#39;t &quot;just for disagreeing with me,&quot; it was because you forwarded the idea that communism was a Jewish plot and that Jews brought pogroms on themselves.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because class (as opposed to Tsarist ties or religion) was a way to unite with their countrymen that wouldn&#39;t keep them on the outs with the society they lived in. Think about it: a group that has been a people apart for centuries finally had a chance to wash all that difference away by progressing with everyone rather than capitulating and assimilating. Wouldn&#39;t you jump at the chance?</p>

<p>You also conveniently leave out the Soviet Union&#39;s history of Anti-Semitism. Stalin wasn&#39;t exactly a friend to the Jews by the end.</p>

<p>Again, all this stuff is a distraction. I&#39;ve yet to hear why Jews are so special that they can bring down governments as a tiny minority, but I&#39;ve explained to you how and why they have functioned as a convenient distraction for the real power structures in the world. R/conspiracy can understand this kind of &quot;look over there!&quot; distraction when it comes to other things, but we have a l weakness when it comes to the idea of Jewish conspiracies. It&#39;s a shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now were actually getting somewhere. </p>

<p>Stalin wasn&#39;t full-blooded Hebrew, he was part Jewish part Georgian and part mongol, which explains his appearance. If he was so mean to the Jews then why were his wives Jewish?</p>

<p>Karl Marx was a Jew who got most of his ideas abour communism from his grandfather who was a rabbi.</p>

<p>&quot;Because class (as opposed to Tsarist ties or religion) was a way to unite with their countrymen that wouldn&#39;t keep them on the outs with the society they lived in. Think about it: a group that has been a people apart for centuries finally had a chance to wash all that difference away by progressing with everyone rather than capitulating and assimilating. Wouldn&#39;t you jump at the chance&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, your saying a minority of a group has the right to take control of a government and kill or imprison anyone who isnt part of that minority. Why? Why not find another country that actually wants you there instead of taking countries through fraud and force?</p>

<p>So by your logic, if blacks make up less than 5% of the population in israel  then they have the right to institute a coup and put all non-black Israelis into gulags. </p>

<p>They have never tried to assimilate, only dominate. Which is why they have been kicked out of Russia, england, germany, and everywhere else. They don&#39;t want your &quot;progression&quot; you have no more of a right to say taking over governments is progress anymore than Hitler can say &quot;killing all the Jews is progress&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making offerings to the gods by bloodletting and burning are common in ancient religions. I know Muslims sacrifice a goat on their &quot;haaj&quot; pilgrimage to the black cube &quot;qabba&quot; in Mecca. They don&#39;t blame the goat for their sins though.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard that sitchin claims the annunaki brought them when they colonized earth, people often disagree with him, but you need a PHD in the most ancient and complex languages to even begin to debate with him.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read one fantastic book in particular that I would recommend but can&#39;t find on the Google. It explained the templar goat worship. It has a picture of a lion headed winged serpent on the cover, its mostly about the Yazidi worship of a rainbow Promethean god and they are in direct opposition to what the gnostics call the &quot;demiurge&quot;. Which sheds new light on the Iraq war and the looting of the museum of Baghdad before they even got to the oil fields. Its an advanced book on occultism and not recommended to anyone who hasn&#39;t done a lot of previous groundwork because it can fuck with your head.</p>

<p>As long as you don&#39;t mention &quot;illuminati&quot; or &quot;the grand conspiracy&quot; r/occult is the most accommodating forum on the net. I haven&#39;t lurked there in years but everyone was always polite and generously shared knowledge as long as you&#39;re not stupid and don&#39;t ask for &quot;love spells&quot;.</p>

<p>One area of interest that has always held my focus is secret societies.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s the classic skull and bones, the bilderbergs, or whoever, these secret groups caught my attention </p>

<p>I think there may be &quot;good secret societies&quot; just like anything in life, but I am wondering about the nefarious intention behind some of these groups.</p>

<p>You speak of the Gnostics and the Demi-urge which I&#39;m glad you brought up.</p>

<p>May I ask your personal opinion on why some groups would make it a life goal/mission to oppose divine creation and try to corrupt it in every way possible? Where would such a fear or belief system stem from?</p>

<p>It&#39;s really a dark hole but one that has held my interest for a long time </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, I looked at it just now, &quot;Fastest Route, Despite the USUAL Traffic: 8 minutes&quot;. It&#39;s 3:30pm now. What would morning Rush Hour have looked like? Well, according to Arrive by, 5-10 minutes via Willow and 14th, or 6-14 minutes via Park Ave.</p>

<p>The first plane hit at  8:46 am. The second at 9:03. </p>

<p>So in order to make it there and get out of the van and take pictures at 8:50, there is simply no way.    </p>

<p>In order to arrive by 9:03, They would have had to leave no later than 8:57 and hit absolutely no traffic and catch every light green at quarter of 9 am on a work day in the greater New York area. (I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever driven in New York or the surrounding areas, but you should try it some time).   </p>

<p>Best Case Scenario there was absolutely no traffic and they were there in five minutes, leaving immediately after the incident happened (but before it was reported on any radios except Fire/Police.) They claimed they didn&#39;t have a good enough view of it from their company headquarters and came as soon as they saw it. </p>

<p>Do a google street view of the area around their building. You can&#39;t see downtown from there. there is NO view of it.  </p>

<p>You can see it really clearly from the Park Ave overpass, though.  Hell, Harbor Blvd is a half mile away and has a half dozen completely unobstructed views from the waterfront of the WTC. They could have walked to the water front faster than they could have driven to the garage even in the absolute best case scenario.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a dozen other places between their building and the garage with better views. The only benefit to going to the garage is so that nobody saw them too soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Between September 6 and 7, the CBOE saw purchases of 4,744 put options on United Airlines, but only 396 call options. Assuming that 4,000 of the options were bought by people with advance knowledge of the imminent attacks, these „insiders“ would have profited by almost $5 million.On September 10, 4,516 put options on American Airlines were bought on the Chicago exchange, compared to only 748 calls. Again, there was no news at that point to justify this imbalance; again, assuming that 4,000 of these options trades represent „insiders“, they would represent a gain of about $4 million.[The levels of put options purchased above were more than six times higher than normal.]No similar trading in other airlines occurred on the Chicago exchange in the days immediately preceding Black Tuesday.Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co, which occupied 22 floors of the World Trade Center, saw 2,157 of its October $45 put options bought in the three trading days before Black Tuesday; this compares to an average of 27 contracts per day before September 6. Morgan Stanley’s share price fell from $48.90 to $42.50 in the aftermath of the attacks. Assuming that 2,000 of these options contracts were bought based upon knowledge of the approaching attacks, their purchasers could have profited by at least $1.2 million.Merrill Lynch &amp; Co, with headquarters near the Twin Towers, saw 12,215 October $45 put options bought in the four trading days before the attacks; the previous average volume in those shares had been 252 contracts per day (a 1200% increase). When trading resumed, Merrill’s shares fell from $46.88 to $41.50; assuming that 11,000 option contracts were bought by „insiders“, their profit would have been about $5.5 million.</p>

<p>A federal appeals court has given developer Larry Silverstein a new chance to recoup more money for rebuilding the World Trade Center site in New York, on top of the $4.1 billion of insurance proceeds he has received.</p>

<p>The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge incorrectly calculated that Mr. Silverstein lost just $2.805 billion on his 99-year lease for the site, signed six weeks before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and deserved no additional damages because insurance more than offset it.</p>

<p>He bought insurance 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO 9/11 that covered the terrorism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re saying that like he didn&#39;t <strong>sign the lease</strong> to the building six weeks prior to 9/11, something that is paired with buying insurance. What kind of operation wouldn&#39;t have insurance lined up for a $3 billion dollar lease??</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find a lot of sources, but the ones I can find suggest terrorism was de facto covered by insurance unless it was specifically excluded (which was not common before 9/11).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>``It is safe to assume claims will be in the billions,&#39;&#39; said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute in New York, who witnessed the crashes. </p>

<p>``It&#39;s unclear what the insurance arrangements are,&#39;&#39; Hartwig said, but U.S. insurance policies do cover damage from fire, explosions and smoke. However, some firms may have terrorist exclusions, Hartwig said, in light of increased attacks on U.S. property over the past few years. </p>

<p>Unless insurers have such explicit exclusions, they will have to pay out claims, which are likely to hit many firms worldwide. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Insured losses resulting from the 9/11 event were about $32.5 billion. Because much of the financial cost ended up being borne by reinsurers, after 9/11 many withdrew from the market, and primary insurers ended up excluding terrorism from their policies. So, businesses were not able to purchase terrorism coverage. To “help ensure the continued widespread availability and affordability of commercial property and casualty insurance for terrorism risk, and to allow for the private markets to stabilize and build insurance capacity to absorb any future losses for terrorism events,” in 2002 the U.S. Congress enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What lie did I spew?</p>

<blockquote>
<p> 1997 we had about an 80 percent occupancy rate,&#39;&#39; said Cherrie Nanninga, director of real estate for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the complex. Twenty percent of 10.5 million square feet of space is 2.1 million, which would be a substantial building by itself. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But as a result of the last year&#39;s work, Ms. Nanninga, said the complex is over 90 percent occupied and expects to it reach the 95 percent mark by the end of the year. That, she said, would be about as full as the center is likely to get, since there is almost always someone moving in or out. &#39;&#39;Ninety-seven percent occupancy would be full,&#39;&#39; said Ms. Nanninga...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Real Estate Director, a position Mrs. Nanninga has held since 1996, the occupancy rate at the trade center has risen from 78 percent to a healthy 98 percent, retail soared in the trade center&#39;s mall, and available office space in the Newark Legal Center has nearly been filled. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, only about 250,000 of the 10.4 million square feet of office space in the trade center remains vacant. And the legal center has an occupancy rate of over 99 percent. </p>

<p>Who do you think would know better than the building&#39;s real estate director?</p>

I went to college for a journalism degree, and the one thing they kept pounding in our heads was that if you inject your own voice into the facts, people won&#39;t hear the facts, they will hear only your voice. And it does nothing but make you sound good to the people who already agree with you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah man, Osama Bin Laden didn&#39;t hate our freedom. He and much of his family were educated in the west afaik. Osama bombed us because he was still pissed that Kuwait accepted help from the U.S. against the Iraq invasion back in the early 90&#39;s. Remember? It lasted a whole week or two so probably not. Funny though he seems to have been ok with the mujahedeen getting help against the Russian invasion back in the day so idk. Maybe he was actually pissed at Big Billy Clinton for bombing the shit out his peoples in a effort to deflect from his scandal with Monica Lewinsky. Say, anyone here know if Osama was ever indicted for 9/11 because last I checked it still never made it to the FBI&#39;s wanted poster. Afaik, he was indicted only for the 1998 embassy bombings but never for 9/11...hmm... interesting.</p>

<p>From the article above:</p>

<p>&quot;Summary
The 1998 United States Embassy bombings were a series of attacks that occurred on 7 August 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous truck bomb explosions at the embassies of the United States in the East African cities of Dar es Salaam and Nairobi. The date of the bombings marked the eighth anniversary of the arrival of American forces in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Members of the al-Qaeda (terrorist group) were charged for planning and committing the bombing of the Embassies of the US in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Usama bin Laden is the head of Al-Qaeda and as such was amongst the people charged. The charges included also conspiracy to murder of US nationals anywhere in the world, US military personnel in Somalia and the Saudi Arabia Peninsula, US nationals serving in the Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the concealment of any such plans of Al-Qaeda. </p>

Procedural history
On 8 June 1998, Usama Bin Laden was indicted (under seal) on charges of ‘conspiracy to attack defense utilities of the United States’. In addition, the allegations stated that bin Laden was the head of the terrorist organisation called al-Qaeda, and that he was a major financial backer of Islamic fighters worldwide.</p>

<p>On 4 November 1998, Usama bin Laden was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on charges of conspiracy to murder of US nationals anywhere in the world including in the United States, US military personnel in Somalia and the Saudi Arabia Peninsula, US nationals serving in the Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and in the concealment of al-Qaeda activities. The evidence against bin Laden included courtroom testimony by former al-Qaeda members and satellite phone records, from a phone purchased for him by al-Qaeda procurement agent Ziyad Khaleel in the United States.</p>

Related developments
Bin Laden was placed on the American Federal Bureau of Investigation&#39;s (FBI) lists of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives and Most Wanted Terrorists for his involvement in the 1998 US Embassy bombings.</p>

<p>From 2001 to 2011, bin Laden was a major target of the War on Terror, as the FBI placed a $25 million bounty on him in their search for him.&quot;</p>

<p>Bin Laden was never formally indicted for 9/11. Make of it what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

Do you really think they would organize that &quot;techno party &quot; in public, dancing in front of multiple witnesses close to the towers? come on, it doesnt make sense at all. This incident of the dancing secret agents is just another layer surounding the mistery of 9/11, cannot explain what or why they were doing there, &quot;dancing&quot;, but for sure they were not celebrating that they had brought down the towers, makes no sense</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AmerithraxLettersDecoded">www.facebook.com/AmerithraxLettersDecoded</a></p>

<p>The Page features a piece of evidence that was found in the possession of the Urban Moving Systems employees that were on the run across the Washington Bridge when intercepted.</p>

<p>The Contact List in their possession was secretly hiding a very important cipher..... one that revealed that the page had a hidden message and ordered numerous additions to their plans, from an American that they called Mr. Z .  The Cipher showed the patterns were aligned in multiple forms, and set up to be used to not only for a series of individual smaller breaks, but that each one then compounded to form a larger template to be used to pass along future messages, and used as a layout.</p>

<p>Nothing was said about the Contact List as it was stuffed into the piles of paperwork that were entered as evidence in the case and appeared to be a legitimate list of front companies.  These were their American Contacts, and there were a lot of them listed.  In fact one page of the Contact List was completely redacted, whereas the other was only partially edited, allowing the evidence to be found, but left without the second page&#39;s entries shown in full detail. </p>

<p>This person was later known in the Media and by the FBI, as they were quick to fabricate an alternate narrative surrounding the actual evidence in the case, when the Amerithrax Letters were delivered from a mailbox across from Princeton University. </p>

<p>The press labeled the case the hunt for Mr. Z, seeing the initial Path Cipher in the shape of a large Z, but the reality is that nobody could break the actual cipher in the Amerithrax Letters, and the evidence tying them to the 9/11 attacks was covered up.  The Path Cipher was a strange configuration of highlighted/double scored letters that stood out as obvious patterns.  They were comprised of the letters TTAAAGT, which is an RNA Sequence of Candida Albicans.  They had completely left the Israelis alone, and let them return to Israel?  </p>

<p>The ciphers speak for themselves....the results are derived from the use of textbook methods of recognized structures, and the evidence is found by following specific guides and outlines.</p>

<p>They plotted a whole series of operations, and the 9/11 Attacks and Amerithrax Letters were only two of them.....the rest is revealed in the FB page and in these videos, called THE ORANGE THEORY, that shows how far back these two agencies have been using these ciphers to conduct clandestine attacks in the US and abroad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube channel Johhny Gat covers all of this in great detail.  I highly recommend watching and studying those videos.  The best video to start with is titled “Donald Trump, 9/11, CASE CLOSED 2” because it gives a detailed analysis of who, what, when, where and why.</p>

<p>Of course, many people will attack my post and say stuff like, “why would our government lie to us?”  Cognitive dissonace is definitely a challenging hurdle to jump over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A federal appeals court has given developer Larry Silverstein a new chance to recoup more money for rebuilding the World Trade Center site in New York, on top of the $4.1 billion of insurance proceeds he has received.</p>

<p>The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge incorrectly calculated that Mr. Silverstein lost just $2.805 billion on his 99-year lease for the site, signed six weeks before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and deserved no additional damages because insurance more than offset it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>He bought insurance 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO 9/11 that covered the terrorism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re saying that like he didn&#39;t <strong>sign the lease</strong> to the building six weeks prior to 9/11, something that is paired with buying insurance. What kind of operation wouldn&#39;t have insurance lined up for a $3 billion dollar lease??</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find a lot of sources, but the ones I can find suggest terrorism was de facto covered by insurance unless it was specifically excluded (which was not common before 9/11).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/09/11/wtc-attack-to-cost-insurers-billions.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/09/11/wtc-attack-to-cost-insurers-billions.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>``It is safe to assume claims will be in the billions,&#39;&#39; said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute in New York, who witnessed the crashes. </p>

<p>``It&#39;s unclear what the insurance arrangements are,&#39;&#39; Hartwig said, but U.S. insurance policies do cover damage from fire, explosions and smoke. However, some firms may have terrorist exclusions, Hartwig said, in light of increased attacks on U.S. property over the past few years. </p>

<p>Unless insurers have such explicit exclusions, they will have to pay out claims, which are likely to hit many firms worldwide. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Insured losses resulting from the 9/11 event were about $32.5 billion. Because much of the financial cost ended up being borne by reinsurers, after 9/11 many withdrew from the market, and primary insurers ended up excluding terrorism from their policies. So, businesses were not able to purchase terrorism coverage. To “help ensure the continued widespread availability and affordability of commercial property and casualty insurance for terrorism risk, and to allow for the private markets to stabilize and build insurance capacity to absorb any future losses for terrorism events,” in 2002 the U.S. Congress enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But so what? what does it prove? The people who commited the act <em>obviously</em> had foreknowledge! so why wouldn&#39;t they make some put options if they had the capability? </p>

<p>Why would Al Qaeda not simply do this? makes perfect sense. </p>

<p>So my point is, there&#39;s nothing in the reality of the put options that is suspect, so why is it a shocker?</p>
