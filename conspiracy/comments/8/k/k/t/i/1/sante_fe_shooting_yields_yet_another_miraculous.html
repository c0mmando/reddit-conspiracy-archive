        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At Sante Fe High School, we have a young man who sustained a shot in the head and emerged unfazed. <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/18/us/rome-shubert-texas-school-shooting/index.html?utm_term=image&amp;amp;utm_content=2018-05-19T00%3A26%3A06&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twCNN">To quote CNN</a>: “A bullet sliced clean through the back of the Santa Fe High School sophomore’s head during a shooting that left 10 people dead and 10 others, including Rome, wounded. Remarkably, he walked away with just bandages, and said on Twitter he was “completely okay and stable.” The photo of the young man afterwards can be viewed at the linked CNN article.</p>

<p>The young man’s mother chimed in, “The doctors told me it went in clean and came out clean,” “We have to do something. We have to take a stand. America has to take a stand for our kids.”</p>

<p>Yes, those special black magic bullets again: no contusions or bruising, no swelling, no real effect on hearing except “ears ringing”.</p>

<p>There is a pretty <a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.newnationalist.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/images-7.jpg?resize=274%2C184">good size neck muscle</a> located at the exit region. In the non cartoon world this is what we humans use to flex our necks, and keep our heads upright. By “clean” we are assuming it hit no vital nerves, veins or arteries. Did it just go though an air cavity?</p>

<p>The substantial neck muscle there however is impossible to miss.  How could one even hold their head up after being hit “clean through the back of his head” exiting from this muscle? If miraculously it missed the muscle there would still be surrounding swelling and fluid, and the novel concept of supportive muscles. “Through” in English means, “moving in one side and out of the other side of.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree that this is very odd especially since it went through the head/neck area, however things like this do happen. </p>

<p>When I was younger my uncle got jumped at a bar and ended up being shot through the stomach with a .22 pistol. The bullet entered near his belly button and exited  right under his collar bone, no arteries or organs we&#39;re hit at all. He had little to no soft tissue damage or swelling, and after a few stitches to close the wounds he went to work the next day.</p>

<p>The chances that this shot through the neck didn&#39;t do any real damage are very slim, but still possible.. however fishy the circumstances may be.</p>

<p>Hadn&#39;t watched any videos on this, had only read some of the articles. But after watching this, it is kinda suspect looking. This is hours later after he got home from the hospital and he is still wearing his blood stained shirt, maybe he didn&#39;t want to rip off his &quot;bandage&quot;I guess.. but then either way for most of the video it had come loose and is flapping around anyways.  That didn&#39;t seem like what I would imagine a hospital dressing of a gun shot wound to the head to look like at all..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM said the bullet entered his head. The photo shows the exit band-aid back down on his neck near the ear. The shooter had two weapons a shot gun and a .38 caliber. A shot gun blast would have plastered him so I am assuming 38 as the bullet. </p>

<p>If it entered into his lower skull you have the brainstem there. <a href="http://anatomyid.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pain-on-back-of-head-doc-what-does-my-neck-have-to-do-with-my-low-back-pain.jpg">Here is the anatomy.</a> The cortex is right above the stem.  A tight band of spinial vertbrae and critical nerves enters the lower skull. There are a series of other nerves in that region- it is like Grand Central Station. I can&#39;t imagine a worst place to take a round.</p>

<p>No it didnt enter his skull, it entered the lower part of his head. The skull is not the head my friend, sorry to burst your bubble, and it exited in the middle-rear portion of his neck (looking at the video it appears to be about 4 fingers behind and down from his right ear lobe), not below his jaw.

    <div class="md"><p>Again that photo looks mere millimeters from entering the base of his skull. Yet it didn’t. I’m not sure what the issue is here thought to be honest....the kid survived and was discharged. That is what we know. Mere millimeters can be the difference between life and death with nearly all wounds so what’s the issue? That this is unsurvivable? Is that what you take issue with? I’m just not getting what you’re sayibg because people can take a round straight through the temple and survive. It’s uncommon for sure but it happens?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay great. I’d still like an explanation on why you think I’m trolling because here I was thinking we were having a great discussion...</p>

<p>Indeed I’d expect more bruising from a wound like this, it would be expected. However it’s not outside the realm of possibility to not show large bruising that early on. Bruises usually take a few hours or so to appear if there is some internal bleeding going on, though he was certainly a few hours in. It’s a crap shoot on how much bruising we’d see depending on the wound, and the person’s body. The interview video never gave us an excellent view of the wound, I’d imagine if we see a follow up interview within the next day or two we’d see a bit more bruising. If we get that follow up and there’s no bruising then I’ll happily admit that it’s quite funky and something sinister may be at play</p>

<p>However at the moment the interview happened we couldn’t see well enough, didn’t see long enough, and MAY have been too early on to see serious bruising. In addition, there’s a pretty solid chance the network slapped a bit of makeup on him if it was there, most people in interviews get quite the workout from the makeup specialist beforehand</p>

<p>Like I said there’s just to many factors to definitively say they lack of extreme Bruising is a red flag this early on. Hopefully we get that follow up interview and can then make the judgement. I’m sure we’ll see more of this kid. Un-troll-ish enough of a response for you since trolling was never my intention?</p>

<p>Secondly. I’m simply offering one explanation. I’m not saying it’s likely, I’m not saying it’s definitely what happened. I’m saying it is within the realm of possibility to survive this shot and be released from the hospital, depending on literal millimeters as I’ve stated many many times already, that is full stop all I’m saying here. </p>

<p>So fuck off with your attention span insults and consider a POSSIBILITY instead of insulting me, just as I’ve considered the possibility that this is a wonky wound to say the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay double response here but I read through it. Very interesting article. Genuinly fun read so thanks for the link</p>

<p>Now I have to ask, did you write this yourself? The first sentence literally mentions this sub so I fell the need to ask....</p>

<p>As far as I can tell the author isn’t a medical professional. Am I correct in that? At the very least they never mention their experience with gunshot victims, correct?</p>

<p>Look man ALL I’m trying to say is that millimeters mater when it comes to wounds. If you don’t believe me you must know someone that is a trauma doctor no? Ask them</p>

<p>You’ll tell my I’m lying here, but I won’t Fox my family and all I can do is promise you I’m being honest as I dislike foreign intervention yet I’m incredibly proud of my sister for her service.  but my sister was a naval doctor during the 2nd US foray in to the Middle East. She entered as an O-3(leutinent) left as an O-5(commander) she was originally stationed on the USS bonhamme Richard in the gulf, then later at the naval base in San Diego. Her (former) husband was a pilot flying Boeing CH-46 helis on medical flights, also in the 2nd gulf war. Through all they’ve seen, one sentiment was always true and a statement I’ve heard many many times from them and it’s always a variant of this: “if it had just been an inch to the left/up/down/right we could’ve easily saved them” “if it had just been an inch left/down/up/right we would’ve lost them”</p>

<p>Look I get you’re kinda going for the whole bullet shockwave thing here as the reason my entire argument is irrelevant, I get that. But those inches or millimeters matter for the ballistics shockwaves too. I really don’t know what else to say other than millimeters DO matter with wounds....that’s it....full stop it’s massiviely important. 2mm can be the difference between the bullet or ballistic pressure rupturing an artery or leaving that artery entirely Undamaged and it being a minor wound. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote the article. I am an older guy and a Vietnam vet. I have no medical experience- but on the other hand I have seen the non-cartoon world firsthand. Just take it from an elder- I can assure you that gunshot wounds don&#39;t look like or have the imapct of the five examples you have at least taken the time to examine. I have asked other vets I know to look at them and he feeling is universal. </p>

<p>Since your shtick seems to center around &quot;appeal to authority&quot; here is what the <a href="http://www.newnationalist.net/2017/05/26/trauma-surgeons-observations-on-the-boston-bombings-fraudulent-injuries/">trauma chief of a SF hospital said</a> about the fake injuries at the Boston bombing. Unfortunately YT as part of their cartoon world campaign has scrubbed a number of the videos- but Dr. Day makes the point. </p>

<p>It is not really about survival is abour recovery. I have seen people survive horribe wounds, it is quite true that this happens with good medical care. But recoveries are another story. Millimeters don&#39;t matter with the kind of ballastics in play. Examine some ballastic tests, and ask yourself if people shot through the lungs, spleen and head are going to be on the feet in front of cameras? No way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nicely summarised.</p>

<p>The defenders clearly haven’t done enough background research into similar hoaxes.</p>

<p>It’s perhaps understandable to nonchalantly wave away one example of a miraculous bullet and/or recovery, but to do it again and again (and again, and again... <em>ad infinitum</em>) at shooting events, and car attacks, and truck attacks...</p>

<p>You’d have to be the world’s most naive simpleton to fall for the miracle trope after realising it happens <em>every single fucking time</em>.</p>

<p>I agree that MSM story was wonky. I also know that humans due freakishly absurd things when pumped with adrenaline. So that story to me is 1) 30% plausible 70% full of shit. 2) likely the kid exaggerated the hell out of how exactly it happened.

<p>SANTA FE, Texas –*At least 10 people died Friday morning in gunfire at Santa Fe High School, law enforcement officials confirmed, while area hospitals reported at least a dozen others were injured.</p>

<p>Police arrested a student suspect and detained a second person, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said on Twitter.</p>

<p>The dead are expected to include students and staff, according to a senior law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak about the investigation.</p>

<p>The attacker was armed with an AR-15-style rifle, a pistol, a shotgun and pipe bombs, the official said.</p>

<p>&quot;Officers inside encountered a bloody mess in the school,&quot; the source said, adding, &quot;Evidently this guy threw pipe bombs all in there. We don&#39;t know if any of them went off.&quot;</p>

<p>I know a patient who was shot in the chest. The bullet came in from the side, traveled through the anterior mediastinum, a few millimeters in front of the aorta. It grazed the posterior part of the sternum, creating an incomplete fracture before exiting from the other side. The guy had a small pneumothorax and a tiny mediastinal hematoma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A 2011 article from Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery confirms the true severity of a gunshot wound through the neck.</p>

<p>Gunshot injuries cause profound morbidity and significant mortality, especially if they occur in the neck … The high density of vital structures in the neck makes injury to this region highly morbid and often fatal. The trachea, esophagus, carotid and vertebral arteries, cervical spine and spinal cord, phrenic nerve and brachial plexus are all vulnerable [to] injury with neck trauma. Each of these is a vital structure, and any delay in diagnosis and treatment can have devastating consequences. (Emphasis added.)</p>
