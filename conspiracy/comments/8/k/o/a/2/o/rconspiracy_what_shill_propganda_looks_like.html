    <div class="md"><p>well said, we can be friends</p>

<p>it is almost like there is some plot afoot to seduce the american people on a massive scale...some kind of CONSPIRACY</p>

<p>well, there is.  </p>

<p>and wouldn&#39;t you know, the people that for two generations were actually brainwashed to think that brainwashing doesn&#39;t happen and that there are no big conspiracies, became completely, utterly, and totally vulnerable to conspiracies.  </p>

<p>naive and gullible are two very important words, just like criticism, knowledge and conspiracy, because without gullibility, conspiracies would never work and the people who were gullible would never know what to call themselves. </p>

<p>if i were a dictator, gullible and naive are two words I would outlaw first.  </p>

<p>Every day, r/politics is nothing but conspiracies now it&#39;s hilarious.  There is no divide between this and that sub now in content, just in arbitrary notation.  </p>

<p>Mueller&#39;s conspiracy publicizing trumps near infinite conspiracies, maralago, the dnc and obama&#39;s conspiracy against trump, facebook and google&#39;s conspiracies against privacy, jared kushner bought fucking 666 5th avenue HELLO PEOPLE.  </p>

<p>There is no public politics in america, the bills are announced at 10pm on friday night and voted on at midnight from afar by representatives that could be vampires from neptune for anyone really knows, so long as they wear a suit and don&#39;t slobber during their brief softball interview on cnn.  </p>

<p>I am passionate about this topic and have written extensively about it over at steemit, you might find it interesting, if you aren&#39;t in fact, working on some military base running experiments on the population to improve the overall quality of the lies in the longer term and flag individuals who will be problematic. </p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/informationwar/@mindhawk/case-study-in-utter-bullshit-intellihub-com">https://steemit.com/informationwar/@mindhawk/case-study-in-utter-bullshit-intellihub-com</a></p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/news/@mindhawk/analaysis-anatomy-of-a-troll-nest-on-steemit">https://steemit.com/news/@mindhawk/analaysis-anatomy-of-a-troll-nest-on-steemit</a></p>

<p>for instance.  let me know what you think.  </p>

<p>i have determined, for instance, that the obvious tie between Elizabeth Lea Vos and Disobedient Media and Suzy Dawson and Adam Carter and the New Zealand Internet Party are tied to zero hedge and thus russia.  That connects in a sad way Kim Dot Com to russia and in this light all of his crap is totally understandable.  Kim Dot Com pushes russia&#39;s narrative.  On steemit, adam carter&#39;s post was pushed on day one by huge whale accounts like V4vapid and canadiancoconut giving this guy, who has done basically nothing but qvetch ad nauseum about the dnc leaks, a $300 introductory post.  These accounts, however, are also highly upvoted by things that appear to me to be more like American FBI psy ops, like Kenny&#39;s Kitchen and The consciousu resistance and things that could really be russians, like thelastamericanvagabond and thefreethoughtproject.  </p>

<p>I find in general a ton of these popup sites, I call them, to be highly suspect and there are a lot of them that ONLY talk about problems in america and ONLY repost other news articles or commentary.  In other words, journalism that could be done from a cubicle in russia, or eglin AFB or Quantico, VA.  </p>

<p>I have begun taking very seriously the &#39;about&#39; page of a site or source, and i have also begun using archive.fo nearly exclusively for posting evidence.  </p>

<p>I and others have determined that we will create methods of computing and communication which aren&#39;t simply weapons for institutions and their rulers to use against their users.  </p>

<p>I say of every source, website, account, &#39;could this be faked by  someone in a cublicle being paid to lie to me?&#39; </p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&#39;would a government agent ever say this?&#39;  (that said the guy showing up to an anarchist meeting bragging about his plan to do something really big is a cop) (that said, the government can afford to pay people full time to infiltrate your group and they operate from deep psychological profiles of you specifically)</p>

<p>Another pattern I have noticed is that they post and respond in really odd patterns, frequently unavailable.  </p>

<p>I am sure though about this, Kim Dotcom, Disobedient Media, Suzy Dawson, are russian spies.  So study them.  </p>

<p>The Conscious Resistance is cops though.  Study that if you want to learn about what cops are up to.  what utter bullshit that whole thing is.  </p>

<p>thefreethoughtproject is not a real news site.  it is just anti-american propaganda.   notice the name is absurd, like they are the free thinkers and everyone else needs them to think freely.  it&#39;s a horrible name for anyone who actually thinks freely or wants to do any journalism.  </p>

<p>enough for now, hope this helps shed some light on what&#39;s going on, good idea for a thread.  keep it up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See but i think there‚Äôs an abuse of the term shill. A mass disagreement with a post does not = shilling. Now does it happen? Sure we all know it does. However I think (no proof, tbh, but no proof to the contrary either) it is MUCH less prevelant than it‚Äôs accused here. All this ‚Äúunnatural activity‚Äù or ‚Äúclearly the shills are out‚Äù is an excellent way to deflect for why some people may disagree with you. Sure shilling happens. But just because YOUR (not you, using ‚Äúyour‚Äù as in the person accusing ones of shilling) post isn‚Äôt as popular as you want doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre being shilled. It could be, but CHANCES are people just disagree with you. Also this whole ‚Äúpaid‚Äù shill thing is even MORE overstated. I‚Äôd bet the total number of paid shills on this sub are less than 10ish. There‚Äôs just not enough reason to invest in shilling this sub, not enough return. This sub largely does not convince the public so it would be a horrific waste of resources for some shill factory to devote hundreds of thousands of bucks to shill this sub. It‚Äôs only reasonable that people end up here through various links on reddit (that‚Äôs how I discovered this place) and simply have dissenting views on different things </p>

<p>Downvoters on unpopular opinions will always outnumber up voters, that‚Äôs how life works. You‚Äôre much more likely to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like that‚Äù vs saying ‚ÄúI love that‚Äù....just look at the hate/bad deeds in our world and ESPECIALLY the internet vs good deeds EPSECIALLY on the internet. The internet is largely ‚ÄúI hate you screw you‚Äù and very little ‚ÄúI agree, you‚Äôre a wonderful person‚Äù....</p>

<p>While I agree with your general point here, and while I would add the NYT has <em>always</em> supported lies before wars, I do not think NYT is a good example of fake anonymous sources. They rarely get it wrong in these cases, and have been shown many times to be correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn&#39;t help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn&#39;t help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. They had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn&#39;t remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day. Sometimes I stood there thunderstruck. I didn&#39;t know what to be more amazed at: the agility of their tongues or their virtuosity at lying. Gradually I began to hate them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Reddit Gold thing can really irritate me. Last week there was a post on r/worldnews (or r/news, can&#39;t remember) about how Israeli soldiers have injured over 2000 non-violent protesters, including two 12 and 14 year old children. </p>

<p>One of the top comments was given thousands of upvotes at least one Gold effectively sayin &quot;non-violent? The protesters were throwing rocks at the gates and guards&quot; and then going on to say how Palestinians were being so violent and rioting that the Israelis had effectively no choice but to shoot to kill and terrorize them. The whole thread of this comment were people agreeing and saying how Israelis are just doing their jobs, getting thousands of upvotes, with no mention of how they were shooting aid workers (a war crime) and anyone they wanted (search up Israeli soldier one shot two kills - soldiers wearing shirts that brag about how shooting pregnant women gives you two kills with one shot.)</p>

<p>When I first joined Reddit I&#39;d see a comment that had reddit gold and thought &quot;damn this guy must know his shit&quot; but soon I realized how Reddit gold is a tool for swaying the narrative </p>
