<p>It&#39;s also interesting that whenever they mention &quot;Daesh&quot; specifically in a tweet...an ISIS attack happens soon after.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching this account for almost a year now...I see certain patterns over and over.</p>

<p>Regarding this specific tweet..I&#39;m going to predict that there will be a terrorist attack (specifically by ISIS, not the Taliban) in less than 24 hours..we will probably be hearing about it in the morning news tomorrow.. </p>

<p>The fact that the tweet mentions &quot;multiple axis&quot; leads me to believe this will be a multiple threat event.</p>

<p>Meaning...bombs and shooters...either suicide bombers or a car bomb, followed by shooters.</p>

<p>Recently the attacks in Afghanistan have taken a very dark turn in targeting journalists...also, locations related to upcoming elections..</p>

<p>Laugh all you want..but I&#39;m very serious when I say I fully expect to hear that there was a coordinated multi strike attack by ISIS in Kabul tomorrow morning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely believe it is. As far as who is actually behind this twitter account is still a big mystery to me.</p>

<p>They recently experienced a serious lack of activity on this account when the Ghouta/Douma evacuations in Syria occurred..so, I believe at least one important submitted to this account was located in Douma til the last of the evacuations.</p>

<p>I know think they are probably operating out of Idlib..we shall see soon enough as their activity is increasing again.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve made numerous posts about this account...first one was June 8th of last year..</p>

<p>Somebody posted that post on 4chan (I didn&#39;t know this til almost a year later)...it didn&#39;t gain traction because they thought no attack happened the next day..</p>

<p>An attack did happen the next day...in Karbala...major news didn&#39;t run with the story tho...so no one heard about it.

    <div class="md"><p>Well it’ll certainly be interesting to see if we have an attack soon. Tbh I won’t click your link because I don’t read anything 4chan related I hate it. But I’ll be keeping an eye out for any attacks soon and if one comes out you may want to report that account to some authorities that can track it down, who knows you could help destroy Isis or some shit by unmasking some terrorist that would be clearly on the inside if he’s this accurate </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the Jedi are evil from my point of view. 4chan appears to be a great resource is you’re more willing to believe them than the MSM. I get that’s a common sentiment around here, but here’s how I view it:</p>

<p>If I posted on 4chan tomorrow than I’m DJT himself (not political here at all, just using the current man that has nuke codes) and said I was launching all nukes we have at NK or Iran or hell let’s throw Iceland in there....90% wouldn’t believe me. Good for them. However 10% would and even if no nukes would launch they would swear I’m DJT himself because 4chan is where you go for 84926D chess. I view 4chan as “I can saw what I want when I want and as long as I use some cryptic words people will buy it”. Now I’m not saying there’s never any good stuff on there (I genuinly wouldn’t know I’ve gone there a handful of times total) I’m simply saying that the anonymity leads to WAY to much cesspool BS to make it worth my time. </p>

<p>If you enjoy it good on you, I do not because it appears to be filled with people who think they operate in an entirely different dimension than the rest of us. But this is all personal opinion of the site after trying to read through and being exhausted by the circle jerk BS</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating stuff, good job OP.</p>

<p>Do you mean large scale atrocities? The reason I ask is almost everyday there is news of people dying at the hands of terrorists somewhere in the middle east so it could be argued that it&#39;s a case of confirmation bias. What about all the attacks that happened when the account was quiet? is it just small scale stuff it ignores? </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked past the first couple of pages yet to check it out for myself and see if the term &#39;Daesh&#39; tallies up with major attacks. I love this stuff. Need more of this stuff here imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The patterns I see/bother to research on, are usually fairly large events. I consider anything over 10 people dying and 15-30 people wounded a fairly large event.</p>

<p>As far as when the account was quiet during other attacks..that&#39;s something I&#39;ve been working on..involving other twitter accounts...(something I recently started)</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the instagram and whatsapp routes..that are pretty much impossible to track. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Syrian war basically started with the US, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and several gulf countries started something called operation Southern Volcano meant to overthrow the Syrian government at least in the South and South-East of the country, it was operated out of the MOC operation room in Amman, Jordan, on the southern border of Syria.</p>

<p>There was a similar, simultaneous operation run from a Syrian room by Turkey with unclear allies (Probably Turkey, the US, some European allies) and communication with the southern room.</p>

<p>My guess is that they had something similar in Iraq, in Afghanistan, etc. Where they were training terrorists (and painting them as &quot;rebels&quot; for external consumption).</p>

<p>My other guess is that this kind of shit is a way to coordinate between all those command centers.</p>

<p>Back in the day there were numbers stations. The US government then developed and moved on to The Internet (Infrastructure for command and control communication - ARPA) and TOR (Infrastructure for encrypted communication, NAVY). Of course those technologies were developed with private industry and universities, and eventually went out to the world at large. I wonder what command &amp; control system they have piggy-backing on all of this now?</p>
