I’ve recently been pondering what was the most important point in history? Personally I think it’s World War I. But I’d like to know what the fine folks of r/conspiracy think is the most important point in history. Why do you think its so important? After all this is a conspiracy theory sub. </p>

<p>Was the most important point the first nuclear bomb tests? Was it the creation of the Federal Reserve? Was it the American Revolution? Was it the Black Plague decimating the globe? Was it the signing of the Magna Carta? Was it the fall of Rome? Was it the destruction of the Library of Alexandria? Was it the building of the Giza pyramids? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that was the catalyst but the reason things went south was because of political ties. If it wasn&#39;t the shooting of the Archduke then it would have been something else. Europe was in a state of flux and still largely operated under the right of conquest (If you take it by force it is now rightfully and legally yours) when it came to national borders. </p>

<p>Everyone was on edge pretty much all the time because of this, and when a united Germany came on the scene it pretty much because the local super power overnight. France was particularly worried and as them and Germany fought over land a lot. Political lines were drawn and alliances made that more often than not had a clause that said &#39;if we go to war you <em>must</em> help&#39;. Once these were done it was only a matter of time before two countries squared off and started a chain reaction of people calling in others as part whatever deals they had.</p>

<p>Pretty much Austria and Serbia had beef and just so happened to have powerful friends. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Djjg5A2rU">It&#39;s pretty much this </a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story, like many things in history, is a bit contested, but never actually disproved.  The Rothschild&#39;s themselves have pushed that it is an exaggeration, but they do admit that Nathan Rothschild did back much of the war effort and funded Wellington&#39;s army almost exclusively.  They also have public record of nearly prescient luck in backing governments and various activities that have succeeded in grand fashion.</p>

<p>200 years ago that Napoleon’s troops were defeated, and the era of Napoleon forever ended. South of Brussels near the town of Waterloo the French ruler battled against British, German and North and South Dutch soldiers.</p>

<p>The real winner of the battle of Waterloo have been the banker Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Knowledge is power, and that investors knew two centuries ago Nathan knew in 1815 to be very rich by making use of the most advanced communications technology of his time. The homing pigeon. The rest have moved on horse. Thus he was the first in London who knew that Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo, after which he bought in mass in the English state funds, which later increased in value.</p>

<p>The Rothschild banking family grew under the leadership of Nathan Rothschild to become one of the most influential families in Europe. Nathan was eventually knighted for his services to the British crown, the main merit funding the armies of the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, the baptism and the crucifixion are two events in the life of Jesus <strong>which are subject to &quot;almost universal assent&quot;.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to historian Alanna Nobbs, While historical and theological debates remain about the actions and significance of this figure, his fame as a teacher, and his crucifixion under the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate, <strong>may be described as historically certain.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman states that <strong>Jesus &quot;certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees,&quot;</strong> and also states that the existence of Jesus and his crucifixion by the Romans is attested to by a wide range of sources including Josephus and Tacitus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While <strong>there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus as a historical figure,</strong> the portraits of Jesus have often differed from each other and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.</p>

<p>Boy, are you going to be embarrassed when you realize we’re having an argument.  Go read Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy’s works, like <em>The Jesus Mysteries</em> or <em>Jesus and the Lost Goddess.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>just because people make claims doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s actually debate; that doesn&#39;t qualify as debate. The situation is this: yes, some people claim this, some people claim that, but at the same time, among academics, among historians, there&#39;s a consensus, and there&#39;s no debate. You can&#39;t just write a book and say, yeah, the earth might be made out of cheese, it&#39;s a debated issue. It&#39;s not debated just because you wrote a book, or somebody else wrote a book. There&#39;s a consensus; it&#39;s known; it&#39;s unanimous; the earth isn&#39;t made out of cheese, that&#39;s absurd. Same thing here with the historicity of Jesus. You can disagree if you want to!

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_myth_theory">Christ myth theory</a> is the proposition that Jesus never existed, or that if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">Christianity</a> and the accounts in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospels">gospels</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus#cite_note-120">[111]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus#cite_note-121">[112]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus#cite_note-OTHOJ-122">[113]</a> This theory has very little support among current scholars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t a whole lot from his actual time.  There is Josephus, who was a Roman/Jewish historian who wrote about the year 100.  His history is mostly about the Jewish revolt that culminated in the destruction of the 2nd temple about 30 years after Jesus&#39;s death.  However, he makes a reference to Jesus, and his execution by Pontius Pilate, another reference to James&#39;s (Jesus&#39;s brother) stoning, and a reference to John the Baptist.  </p>

<p>Tacitus, another roman historian, mentions Christians and that the founder of the sect was put to death by Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius.  </p>

<p>Historians dispute whether these accounts are genuine or not.  There is good evidence that at least parts of the Josephus account were altered by later Christians, and references to Jesus in the Jewish Talmud are particularly tricky because Jesus, or Yeshu, was a fairly common name and it&#39;s tough to pin down whether the passages were referring to Jesus of Nazereth or a different Jesus.  </p>

<p>Still, if you&#39;re looking for non-Biblical sources on the existence of Jesus, that&#39;s where you start.</p>

<p>I tend to agree that there was a historical person named Jesus, or Yeshua, who lived around that time, and was the leader of a small Jewish sect that rapidly grew after his death.

<p>That&#39;s straight up bullshit. It&#39;s not a consesus. Although there <em>&quot;&quot;some&quot;&quot;</em> evidences that there were people named Jesus back then, there&#39;s literally no evidence of a guy performing miracles or being the myth that people ridiculously believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lack of historical evidence for Jesus Christ was well-known by the time the Early Church hierarchy began to develop around the turn of the second century. There was a great deal of pressure to insert &quot;evidence&quot; during transcription of old books and historical records. Historians have been plagued by these forgeries ever since. It&#39;s actually pretty obvious that the character of Jesus was most likely not based on a real person. The basic acceptance of his historical reality is a deep part of Western conditioning/programming which has been going on for a very long time.</p>

<p>I guess it depends on your definition of contemporary. 20-30 years after Jesus&#39; death we get Paul&#39;s new Testament stuff, and 60 years after there&#39;s Josephus&#39; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, and 85 years after there&#39;s Tacitus&#39; &quot;Annals&quot;. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus">source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite to this answer is Terrance McKenna story. He suggested the imaculate conception was real, and the most pivotal because it caused a ripple in space and time, creating 2 side by side universe&#39;s.  One where the conception. And thus Christianity occurred the other didnt, and so certain religious events didn&#39;t take place, which ultimately caused us to advance slower in the time line with the conception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of parallel world always exist and the religious texts are ones that are more used to this.</p>

<p>If someone could see or have visions of different world, even going to these like that famous case of man who came from another universe, could you really say that all would work the same ?</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a God, will he always be the same one that did the same things in all the universes ?</p>

<p>Islam, Judaism, Christianity and a lot of other religions followed a similar idea of the creator, what if everyone universe had it creator making different decision based on the situation ?</p>

<p>Thus making every religion true but at same time different enough in any universe.</p>

<p>The tons of religions that exist may be glimpse of another universe versions of God, angels and demons</p>

I can&#39;t prove or disprove any notions of the true nature of our universe, be it simulated or made by a God, nor can I speak to the certain physical attributes seemingly found in what I perceive around me. That could all be an illusion, my sense of self could be a lie, even free will may not be right. Let along history as has been told to me. As such, the only thing I can be sure of, regardless of its nature or reliability, is that I&#39;m seeming to experience anything at all. That&#39;s what important.

    <div class="md"><p>1242.</p>

<p>Genghis Khan&#39;s #2 man, General Subutai had just pushed the Mongol army through Russia, through Ukraine, and had sacked Hungary, then the most powerful European military. The Mongol army was months or weeks from sacking Germany and Paris and Italy. Nothing could stop them.</p>

<p>Except Genghis Khan&#39;s successor back in Mongolia suddenly died. The Mongol army had to return home to vote in a new Khan.</p>

<p>Europe was spared.</p>

<p>Had Subutai continued, there wouldbe no Europe as we know it, no Catholic Church, no Protestant Reformation, no Rennaisance, no Enlightenment, no Industrial Revolution, no American Revolution--none of that would have happened.</p>

<p>The whole world would probably be Mongol right now but for an accident of history.</p>

<p>&quot;Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (one Muslim and two Mongols) to meet the shah himself and demand the caravan at Otrar be set free and the governor be handed over for punishment. The shah had both of the Mongols shaved and had the Muslim beheaded before sending them back to Genghis Khan. Muhammad also ordered the personnel of the caravan to be executed. This was seen as a grave affront to the Khan himself, who considered ambassadors &quot;as sacred and inviolable&quot;.[7] This led Genghis Khan to attack the Khwarezmian dynasty.&quot;</p>

-x00 BC Battle of Marathon 
-x00 BC Battle of Salamis </p>

<p>I agree with another poster that the death of the khan in 1242 was pretty major.</p>

<p>Winston Churchill refusal of peace in 1940 combined with Hitler&#39;s decision not to invade with the army. </p>

<p>But had hitler not attacked Russia until after Britain had surrendered was the biggest mistake, and perhaps the stupidest thing a relatively smart person ever did.  Although I believe by this time hitler was high as a kite on meth and oxy.  </p>

<p>But the death of JFK I think overshadows all of these, the coup taking over the united states was such a huge change in american history I can&#39;t help but think that if I could go back and instead find a way such that all of the conspirators, LBJ, Bush, Israel, would be caught and imprisoned, the world would be 100x better.  </p>

<p>9/11 I believe overshadows all of these and the same applies, if the military and police had actually protected america and caught the perpetrators, which was the israeli mossad and cheney&#39;s traitors, then the total change in the situation would be so much more positive than any other change I could think of.    </p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_myth_theory">Christ myth theory</a> is the proposition that Jesus never existed, or that if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">Christianity</a> and the accounts in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospels">gospels</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus#cite_note-120">[111]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus#cite_note-121">[112]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus#cite_note-OTHOJ-122">[113]</a> This theory has very little support among current scholars.</p>
