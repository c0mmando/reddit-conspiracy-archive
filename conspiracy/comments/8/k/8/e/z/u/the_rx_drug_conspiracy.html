<p>Why is it that the gov chooses to legalize certain drugs while strictly outlawing others? Most people would say it&#39;s profit related, I say it&#39;s all spirituality related. Most of the Rx drugs which are pushed on people are specifically designed to stunt and hinder our connection to God. Ever wonder why they haven&#39;t made mushrooms or LSD into a medicine? This is why, I mean they turned poppies into morphine, they can easily do the same for mushrooms. </p>

<p>Anyone who has ever gone through withdrawal from opiates, ADHD meds, antidepressants, etc all eventually experience that same feeling of sudden reawakening. Your dreams, emotions, and general awareness increase like crazy. Not only that but you are also elevated to a higher spiritual plane, closer to God, which gives you many things you wouldn&#39;t have while addicted like real happiness and contentment.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t outlaw marijuana because everyone can grow it but because it increases spirituality and makes it easier to spot propaganda/programming. With marijuana, even a person of below average intelligence will begin to question things as an intelligent skeptic would. This is also why reggae will never be a mainstream genre, as awesome as it is. It&#39;s too anti-establishment, always singing about righteousness, revolution and smoking weed, 3 things they despise. Yet you have rap music, with the typical dumb you down trap beat, playing on every radio station telling you to drink syrup, pop percocets, and sell crack. All drugs that severe our connection to divinity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paraphrasing here, but jesus said something like &quot;unless you can become like a child, you can not enter the kingdom of heaven.&quot; Which, in context, means that unless you can look upon all things with an open mind, as a child does, as opposed to how most adults are already set in their ways and close minded on a lot of things, then you won&#39;t be able to find soulful liberation upon death.<br/>
Also, adding on the &quot;witchcraft&quot;/&quot;pharmacy&quot; point - I hadn&#39;t heard of that before! That&#39;s very interesting! But bear in mind how witchcraft was only demonised by the Catholic Church because it primarily refers the process of utilising forces/energies arising from consciousness in order to change aspects of reality. The church wants to hoard the power. They don&#39;t want the people to realise that they naturally have limitless conscious potential. So they propagated the idea that spiritual practice had to be done under the authority of the church and through a church-appointed priest. It&#39;s only been recently (last ~500-1000 years) that the concept of medicine and healing was separated from its spiritual counterpart, and based entirely in the material. For millennia before medicinal and spiritual healing had gone hand in hand, and in much of the eastern world they still do. Look at yogis, gurus, shamans etc for example. It&#39;s those types who got demonised and called &quot;witch doctors&quot; by the Church.</p>

<p>Yes, I can prove that &quot;God&quot; doesn&#39;t exist, not the &quot;loving, fatherly and merciful God of the Bible.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you have kids, but I do. I would die protecting them.</p>

<p>A few towns over from ours, a 14 month old baby was raped to death a year or so ago.</p>

<p>Where was the loving, fatherly and oh so merciful God of the Bible?</p>

<p>How fucked is it that you&#39;d stand by and watch your own child be brutally murdered in front of your eyes yet do nothing?</p>

<p>No parent would.</p>

<p>How is it that I, merely a worm in his presence, has more empathy and humanity?</p>

<p>God would allow this to happen to one of your children, yet you worship him.</p>

<p>Religion is a bubble that people choose to live in because they can&#39;t handle the world as it is. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a cop out. You just roll with the flow, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s what&quot; God&quot; wants, he provides. </p>

<p>You &quot;pray&quot; for yourself, how selfish. </p>

<p>Yes,  &quot;He&quot;cares&quot; that your cake for the bake sale turns out delish. He&#39;s got your back, Jesus take the spatula. </p>

<p>Yet, thousands of men, women and children are killed each day in this world. Either through violence, Illness, suicide or accident. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not entirely sure who you are arguing with.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly sure we partially agree on a few points. Acknowledging that, there are two assumptions you are resting your entire belief system on that makes what you are saying not add up. </p>

<p>You are assuming a god can only exist based on your ideas of morality. Ideas you only formed in response to the life you&#39;ve lived. As you readily admit you are miniscule on a cosmic scale how could you with a limited experience of reality possibly understand the morality of a universe at large? As you admit things happen that you cannot comprehend, is this not a invite to humility rather than anger? </p>

<p>You are also assuming that God is/does/should intervene in human affairs to prove its omnipotence. Anthropomorphising God to fit human morality. Which as you rightly point out would make God a very shitty entity indeed if it did intervene and allow such things to happen. Which is a contradiction. Either god exists and is evil or doesn&#39;t exist, restricting God to fit a tiny paradigm which neither proves or disproves anything. </p>

<p>Or imo it points to a different acceptance that if God exists it certainly is indifferent to human affairs. Meaning that we are free to either create heaven or create hell and it maybe in this freedom that you should focus your morality. You find certain behaviour abhorrent (as do I) clearly some Entities that exist here do not share such morality (they are clearly not that small in number). Would it not then make sense for you to take the mantle of the God you wish existed and work to make the universe a better place? </p>

<p>Ultimately as I tried to point out in my original comment we can&#39;t <strong>know</strong> for certain if God exists or doesn&#39;t exist we can only be agnostic and react to universe as we experience it. Clearly the universe or God is indifferent to human affairs and so it seems wise to live true to your inner sense of morality and not expect or need to universe to do the same. </p>

<p>I imagine it&#39;d be quite boring if it did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you!</p>

<p>A doctor’s goal should be to see his patients <em>the least often possible</em>. If a patient needs to come back, it is in a sense a failure on his part. Each consultation should end with: “take care, and I hope never to see you again!”.</p>

<p>Yet somehow with psychiatrists, it’s the opposite. Most of them expect you to keep consulting for life (or a large portion thereof), even if they don’t say so. They are experts at <em>creating</em> dependencies (towards the drugs they prescribe or their own person). They are glorified drug dealers.</p>

<p>Drug dealers on street corners are actually more honorable, as they aren’t subsidized, are more entrepreneurial, and don’t try to convince themselves (and others) their occupation adds value to society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over a decade ago,  I was having severe anxiety which was impacting my ability to work. I went to a psych for the first time who suggested I try a drug called &quot;Abilify&quot;. </p>

<p>That drug made me feel insane. It exacerbated my anxiety to the point that I refused to leave the house after getting home from work. I soon had a mental breakdown,  quit my job, and went to work on a farm out in the middle of nowhere that I found advertising for &quot;apprentices&quot; on the internet.</p>

<p>A few years later,  after getting my life back together,  I found out that Abilify isn&#39;t supposed to be prescribed on it&#39;s own.   It&#39;s intended use was to increase the effectiveness of an antidepressant which is already being taken.</p>

<p>Problem was,  I wasn&#39;t taking antidepressants. This fucking doctor prescribed a single medicine to me which isn&#39;t intended to be used on it&#39;s own,  and wasn&#39;t intended for the purpose which he prescribed it to me. </p>

<p>I had no idea at the time that doctors got huge kickbacks for prescribing specific medications regardless of the needs of their patients. I guess my first clue should have been his clock,  pens,  and coffee mug had the &quot;Abilify&quot; brand name emblazoned on them. </p>

<p>I have often wondered how much extra money he received for the prescription he wrote for me.  Probably not much,  it was only one prescription. </p>

<p>That one improperly prescribed medication affected my life in extreme ways,  and that piece of shit doctor has no idea the years of anguish I suffered for his monetary kickback. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just always take low doses and don&#39;t keep increasing your dose and you should be alright.
I would also recommend trying out a ketogenic diet. It seems to be helping many people to get rid of anxiety without having to take meds. 
Since going ketogenic I have stopped taking the anxiety meds I was prescribed.</p>

<p>Here is a playlist I made of a bunch of good videos I found online that discuss keto and mental health. Very interesting stuff.

    <div class="md"><p>Ex pot head now but having been a heavy dope smoker, if half an ounce a week or so qualifies for 14 odd years. I can&#39;t confirm or deny if it caused me to question things more than I would have because there was no single extended amount of time beyond the very rare occasion of a day or two off it to compare it with. I would however consider myself to be generally more inquisitive, skeptical, critical and open to ideas than quite a few people I know. If I ever had kids, in light of personal behavior and actions, I&#39;d be absolutely 100% times more comfortable and less worried if they chose to smoke dope predominately whilst hanging out with mates in their late teens rather than getting pissed.</p>

<p>Having also done LSD, although never in doses like some people I knew who would take up to 600ug and having consumed mushrooms both numerous times. In my experience I&#39;ve witnessed two different groups of distinctly different personalities. One is the self anointed, self described, so called intellectual deep thinking, non judgmental and open minded variety. For all the self awareness and bullshit they talk, I&#39;ve only ever felt them to be insincere and anything but open minded. I sense they jump on the whole enlightenment and spirituality shit train because the truth is if you don&#39;t think or behave the way they perceive themselves to they&#39;re more judgmental than anyone. Having deeply discussed their disgust of other drugs and casting judgement on those who elect to do so in the past, and now being faced with the plain and simple truth that they are going to use drugs, they blow smoke up each others arse holes with th fkn spiritual claptrap to avoid the reality and hypocrisy that they expunge. AVOID THESE INDIVIDUALS AT ALL COSTS. If you see through their bullshit they&#39;ll leave you feeling cooked by the end of it all. Truly a deluded who in my opinion are more likely to end up permanently a bit different following acid than anyone else.  If dropping acid, do so and get the fuck out of there because you&#39;ll soon wish you had of, I assure you. </p>

<p>The other type are normal, down to earth and who are basically the complete opposite of the other group. Actually open minded, aware and real. Just as paracetamol is for pain, lsd is for anywhere from a 4 - 6 hour time frame where perceptions can change, hallucinations can happen, interesting and uncommon conversations and what&#39;s been often my experience is random everyday shit can suddenly become hilarious. These are the people you want to drop acid with. It&#39;s a drug that isn&#39;t going to change your life unless for whatever retarded reason you believe you can fly, funnily not up to the roof but off the roof! That&#39;s your demonized anti drug propaganda at it&#39;s finest. Like all drugs though, it has a place and a purpose and can be rather fun, just don&#39;t expect anything earth shattering and keep in touch with reality following it. The most I&#39;ve ever dropped is 200ug at a time and re-dosing a few hours later which didn&#39;t greatly effect it. Colors have always been more vibrant, along with innate objects seemingly appear to pulse with energy and the occasional hallucination of something being there that shouldn&#39;t.        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok i&#39;d like to add my counter opinion to your argument here. You are opting for government sedation or non government sedation if you choose to pertake in drugs. It&#39;s your choice but both are not good at least in my opinion. They are trying to rob you of your freedom to think and have a life of discipline. The powers that be have created this drug war so that they can profit and cash in when they inevitability legalize all drugs and then what will we have? The masses sedated on prescriptions or legal drugs. They want you to be sedated so that you can&#39;t think for yourself and realize when they take away your guns and your freedom. You will be too strung to resist. The only way to resist is to not drink, and give up all drugs. That is the real counterculture. </p>

I never liked rap too much growing up, but I decided to revisit the genre because one of my teachers told me about Immortal Technique. Listening to that I realized that rap gave voice to those that were marginalized and silenced the most. I wish I could give more examples of rappers but he&#39;s definitely the one made me give a second look at the genre; a different perspective from what&#39;s peddled by our radio station and mainstream media.</p>
