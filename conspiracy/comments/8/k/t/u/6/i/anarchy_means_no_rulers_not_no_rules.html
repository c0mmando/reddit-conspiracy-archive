        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Equating anarchy with chaos is a deliberate trick by those who psychologically rely on the state for emotional support. Democracy causes a form of Stockholm syndrome in the host population. People are led to believe that they can vote the corruption away. That voting can cure any and all societal problem.</p>

<p>Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules. A society can exist without a sovereign but it cannot without societal norms, a system of morality, and a loose legal framework to protect contractual agreements and property rights.</p>

<p>Anarchy can exist with a system of &quot;true community policing&quot;, and though a individual sovereignty of the citizenship or anarcho monarchism.</p>

<p>Stateists will have you believe that a centralized authority is necessary for a stable system. I dispute this. We must decentralize everything. A decentralized world is a free world. A decentralized world is an anarcho monarchist world.</p>

<p>Who needs to entomb societal norms in paper. Societal norms are fluid and changing. Enscribing them in stone only gets in the way of progress. The same goes for contracts imo. Enscription only serves to benefit the more or cunning tradesmen. It gives them an edge over the other. Promises of what an uncertain future holds are always lies. It&#39;s why some people refuse to swear to tell the truth in court and instead consent to affirm. </p>

<p>Very nice straw man. Where did I ever say the police would be armed with guns? No that is not the case at all. Not every person will be equally a community policeman upon entering the community. A vetting process will take place..</p>

<p>Laws will be determined by the community. Very simple stuff like adherence to the non aggression principle. Don&#39;t steal, don&#39;t kill, no usury, and other parasitic economic functions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so each community can have different laws? seems like you would have to walk on eggshells. do you plan on educating your vetted officers on all laws? or just the ones you community votes on? how would you determine punishments? would you also pick out your judges or does the community get to pick an appropriate punishment.....by establishing some form of policing, you have already embodied a form of government which was what you were trying to avoid in the first place.</p>

<p>also another topic. let&#39;s say EMS. who is going to established guidelines and protocols for a scope of practice? or is each paramedic going to get to decide whatever treatment they feel is appropriate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no paramedic operates autonomously. every EMS agency has a set of standards operating procedures which are set in place by a medical director (usually an MD) a paramedic can only do interventions that the medical director approves of in specific situations. </p>

<p>uh main reason I like structure is because people like to do stupid shit when there is no supervision. usually what keeps people in check is rule of law. if there were no laws, repercussions are minimal. we are like small children who don&#39;t know any better but like to act like we know everything.</p>

<p>I think we should all be equipped to deal with such situations. No point in waiting for a cop when my life is on the line. Cops aren&#39;t crime fighters. They&#39;re managers of inequality.

    <div class="md"><p>The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn&#39;t help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn&#39;t help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. They had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn&#39;t remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day. Sometimes I stood there thunderstruck. I didn&#39;t know what to be more amazed at: the agility of their tongues or their virtuosity at lying. Gradually I began to hate them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with this approach is that, without codified laws or an actual police force, you are depending upon the community taking action. If a woman acts like a bitch to everyone and someone offs her, will the community care? She was mean and egotistical. Maybe the community will decide that she&#39;s better off gone. No one liked her anyway, so should her killer really be punished? What about the town drunk? Or maybe a Christian community will turn a blind eye when a Wiccan or a Muslim is killed.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they may  decide that someone who is popular in the community doesn&#39;t deserve to be punished for their crimes. We see this in schools where people will defend a popular football player who has been accused of rape on the basis of how important they are for the team, and how everyone likes them.</p>

<p>Under anarchy, it seems that in place of actual rules and laws, the legal system is now nothing more than a popularity contest.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I ask you this because you demonstatre that you either are not capable of imagining a different way of doing things, or too lazy to do so. So, asking if your imagination is dead is a valid question, because without it NO change can ever happen within an individual or a society. If YOU cannot even ponder a new way of doing things, then your imagination is dead just like TPTB <em>wan&#39;t you to be</em>.</p>

<p>Sounds like you basically want to have the current constitution, just unwritten with no legal recourse.  </p>

<p>I fail to see how that would be better than actually having a written manifestation of our liberties.  If it is written in our government and the psychopaths still rise to power, how would an unwritten &quot;understanding of liberties for all men&quot; be any different, if not worse?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can find faults with any system. Americans don&#39;t have a real oligarchy. Just a meme one and it did get strengthened by Trump&#39;s tax cuts. </p>

<p>America&#39;s political system is all I&#39;ve known and it created this society. Without laws and government pedophiles can roam free. People can just call others a pedophile and kill them in your system without any real recourse other than murdering back. There will be nothing but blood until someone forms a cooperative community... or a government. </p>

<p>I&#39;m against all types of those abusive practices human and capitalistic and America has eliminated it for the most part. Also we have police that catch pedophiles. Perhaps not all of them but when people say it&#39;s more of an epidemic than in the past, it&#39;s just wrong and blind.</p>

<p>Obviously best form of government is a monarchy with me as ruler. DUH!</p>

<p>Who said anything about not having collectives? Community doesn&#39;t disappear if we abandon coercive and compulsory states, nor does organizing voluntarily for common goals. </p>

<p>You have a very depressed view of human nature if you feel we can only coexist peacefully with a powerful state to constrain us. It&#39;s also contradictory that you think giving power to these killers and rapers you go on about somehow helps anything. Those with the worst impulses and integrity are inevitably drawn to positions of authority over others, and giving those positions and institutions more power and authority leads to the worst among us making rules for the rest. </p>

<p>You can make those comments if you like. </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a substantial difference between saying that there exist people who give in to their destructive and harmful impulses toward themselves and other which are exacerbated and encouraged by the structure of our society, and saying that humans are incapable of existing without being told how to act by an authority. </p>

<p>Simple: they don&#39;t organize, and sink or swim based on their fortune and ability. No sweat off my back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where can you even claim a &quot;sovereign&quot; place to be that you and other no state people &quot;control&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re asking about how we get from here to there, which is a valid and pertinent question in anarchist circles. I don&#39;t think the solution is direct opposition or confrontation to states, but agorism and counter-economics. Essentially (but vastly simplified), if we stop feeding the state and corporations with our time and labor, they will lose power on their own; their power comes from our participation in their games. If we meet our economic needs and desires through black and grey markets, through gift economies, through time banks and other such practices, we rob coercive institutions of their power. </p>

<p>Ah I forgot. For an anarchist moving is as simple as murder and take a new area. </p>

<p>We should all be against fiat currency. But what your saying is just sort sighted. I hate corporations as much as the next person but what if in your anarchist society if you can even call it a society without going communist, the &quot;corporations&quot; assume the means of production. They take the land, they take the resources and all you have to do is &quot;move&quot; right?</p>

<p>There&#39;s way to many problems. That&#39;s why even some of the most primitive tribes and civilizations have a leader. Religion has a leader. </p>

<p>Corporations do not exist independent of the people who take action on their behalf. Corporations don&#39;t &quot;own&quot; anything except insofar as other people respect their claims of ownership, and under statism as far as the state protects those claims against others. </p>

<p>Ah, and what a glorious bringer of peace that has been!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how property rights are enforced. What changed? Are we all just conquerors now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think private property is a right; it is only by mutual consent that we may use the land. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How are people going to pay for it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Connected meshnets. Each community has a meshnet (or more permanent infrastructure) to connect with the community, and communities connect to each other through backbones. Say town A and town B want to connect. They agree upon an approach to connect the towns and how traffic will be allocated. Most of the infrastructure already exists. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who controls it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re not getting it. No one controls &quot;the internet.&quot; People just network themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who produces it? Everyone that makes computers and routers is a corporation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, everyone who makes computers and routers are people, namely the workers and the managers and the accountants and everyone else needed to produce them. Corporations are simply one form of organizing complex projects where the owners of the corporation receive the profits. </p>

<p>My actual solution to this is syndicalism and worker-owned cooperatives. You should check out the Mondragon Corporation in Spain for an example of this working today. </p>

<p>Why go through meshnets when we have an existing infrastructure in place that allows us to connect with Beruit if we wanted. </p>

<p>Do people still own individual resources? Like oil, steel, internet, are people going to take control of water? If not, we are just going into communist territory. Like real theoretical  communism not the fascist shit Stalin did. </p>

<p>Respecting claims of ownership is what usually scares anarchists into a state. The fear of losing everything when a bigger force comes to claim what was &quot;yours&quot;. </p>

<p>But if you want to go as far as no private property then obviously you&#39;re going to encounter a lot more opposition on that topic but not from me. </p>

<p>He is. I agree with him on a lot. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why go through meshnets when we have an existing infrastructure in place that allows us to connect with Beruit if we wanted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I imagine we still would to a large extent. The meshnet&#39;s are for those communities who don&#39;t currently have robust infrastructure or want a certain amount of redundancy for outages outside their direct control. If Verizon/Comcast in your neighborhood goes out, you&#39;re disconnected from everyone, even in your own community. </p>

<p>But I see no reason not to use existing infrastructure if its already there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do people still own individual resources? Like oil, steel, internet, are people going to take control of water? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very few people control the majority of our natural resources today, mostly through corporations. I would say no one has exclusive control of natural resources in situ, and those who extract them can claim the fruits of their labor. Individual communities can come to their own agreements on how to avoid tragedy of the commons situations. (I think global capitalism is horrible in this regard, and if you believe in anthropogenic climate change I think you&#39;d have to agree). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If not, we are just going into communist territory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, sure. I&#39;m not afraid of that word like so many seem to be. Differences between left and right economic theory tend to become much less distinctive as one moves toward either the authoritarian or anarchic pole. State fascism under Hitler or Mussolini and state socialism under Stalin or Mao had much more in common with each other than either do with anarcho-capitalism and anarcho-communism respectively, and I would say vice versa (though less certainly).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I expect it. At least you give arguments for your positions rather than lame one-liners like PLC.</p>

<p>I appreciate it. Sincerely. </p>

<p>You said it yourself. Are those places going to give them a piece of land? </p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s not really an anarchist group if you&#39;re protected by a massive state. You&#39;re just living the lifestyle of everyone helps each other and there&#39;s no leader. Except there is... hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>In the Kurds case they are spread between like 4 countries and had to organize and create leaders to fight ISIS.</p>

<p>Well, if you&#39;re big enough to be called government, that&#39;s democide.  All the murders from war doesn&#39;t even compare to the millions of dead people caused at the hands of their own government.  That&#39;s not a good track record to be defending. </p>

<p>In what reality does private murders surpass the atrocities caused by government?  Am I in the wrong subreddit?  Just who are these non-government murderers that rally large community support?  The drug cartels?  They don&#39;t even come close, and I would argue they are the result of governments war on drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the context was clear. You seem to be concerned about unchecked murder in the absence of a ruling class (i.e. anarchy).  I wanted to make a point that unchecked murder still happens in the presence of a ruling class (i.e. government), and historically the overwhelming majority is caused by governments murdering their own citizens.  Not hypothetically, but in actuality.  Not by a few dozen, but kind of a lot.  Like tens of millions of murders.  I didn&#39;t think this was up for debate.  Haven&#39;t you ever heard of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Political science professor, Rudolph Rummel, who coined the term democide estimated over 272 million civilians were murdered by their own governments. &quot;To give some perspective on these numbers, Rummel pointed out that all domestic and foreign wars during the twentieth century killed in combat around 41 million.&quot;  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Rummel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Rummel</a></p>

<p>First, I reject your premise that anarchy (a society without a ruling class) causes &quot;rampant unchecked crimes against humanity&quot;.  Secondly, I prefer to stay on topic regarding murder in the presence and absence of government.</p>

<p>I reject your rejection. People cannot be made to destroy civilized society because past governments have committed atrocities. </p>

<p>Are you going to go out and build the roads? Are you going to pay them? Are you going to farm? What&#39;s your value? </p>

My point is that in the Belgium example, the power to create rules was absent, therefore there were no rulers even though existing rules were being enforced.  Your claim that this is not anarchic is not backed up by any evidence other than repetition, however I provided three independent counterexamples where they consider the Belgium example as anarchic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>States will dissolve and disappear as we advance. They serve no purpose. Communities can self-govern and with freedom of motion and lack of borders the like minded can associate freely. </p>

<p>Bowing to central authority is a memetic disease deliberately cultivated by those in power. It has no place in the age of the internet. We could have actual democracy instead. Put bureaucracy on the blockchain. </p>

<p>Anarchism seems foreign to most because the only conversation allowed to play out over the past 200 years has been Capitalism vs Communism, both requiring oppressive authority. Said oppressive authority has approached a synthesis, an international aristocracy of sorts. </p>

<p>But Empire and Economy are both religions presented as something else. It doesn&#39;t matter that economics is backed up by mathematics. Like any other language math can be used to tell any story you want. We can tell a better one. </p>

<p>You want anarchy? Go live in a shack in Montana like Ted Kaczynski. At least he lived what he wrote. Everyone else can take your empty teenage rebellion &quot;fuck you dad&quot; lifestyle Anarchy and fuck off.</p>

<p>Human beings require some minimal a priori structure which evolves into Laws and Govt and systems of punishment and reward. Even if you think the same fallacy as the pink ol&#39; Commies that &quot;Pure Marxism just has never been implemented correctly&quot; and claim that Pure Anarchy just needs a  chance, you&#39;re no better than a Commie.</p>

<p>Anarchy will never happen for the same reason Total Communism will never happen. It&#39;s physically impossible. Human nature has an instinct for Evil. There will always be some Warlord who instead of Leading the Revolution of the Proletariat becomes the next tyrant and who starts anew the ancient cycle of Regicide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go watch the ISIS movie &quot;Makers of Illusion&quot;, which was released around October 2015.</p>

<p>Links to it are on Telegram if you know a few Arabic keywords.</p>

<p>The 45 minute long film take place in a cattle slaughter house. Half a dozen ISIS mujahid with swords have about 30 prisoners dressed in orange Gitmo jumpsuits.</p>

<p>The prisoners are all hanging upside chained the ceiling.</p>

<p>The lead Jihadi makes threats to the kafir and preaches as he walks past each prisoner. One by one, he saws off their head with his sword. He pulls off each head, then holds the upside body over the drainage trough on the floor. Blood flows like a flood. After about the 10th beheading, you get numbed to the hypnotic ritualist reptition. The worst part is seeing each prisoner is completely docile and makes no jolting moves in resistance to their final end.</p>

<p>That movie was the worst thing I have ever seen and you could call that my &quot;come to Jesus&quot; moment. Whatever disgusting horrific demon-pit of Abaddon that made CIA and Brennan and Obama and Crooked Hillary and a cast of thosands of Deep State lackeys hatch their plot to create, fund, arm and help ISIS--pure Satanic Evil which hasn&#39;t been seen in centuries--whatever forces of This Present Darkness who would do that must be utterly destroyed for the sake of the world.</p>

<p>It was then that I declared Total War on the Deep State. It was then that any Enemy of theirs became a friend of mine.</p>

<p>You mock Christ because you&#39;re a snivelling Shitlib ensconed in your bubble in Elysium and so you don&#39;t have any idea just how bad it is outside your safe space of privilege and decadence.</p>

<p>Whatever disagreements I might have had with Christianity flew out the window after seeing the evil that is ISIS.</p>

<p>You think wishy washy pussy Liberal Atheism stands a chance against a fanatical doctrine like ISIS?</p>

<p>Christianity is the soul of Western Civ, and if that light ever goes out, so the the West. Then ISIS moves into to fill the vacuum and &quot;Remain and Expand&quot;, as its motto goes.</p>

<p>You want that shit to happen? You want fucking ISIS to win?</p>

<p>Jesus needs all the help he can get. If everybody thought the same way as limp wristed cucks like you, then ISIS would have already won.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying everybody has to become Ned Flanders, but everybody does have to agree on the same core theological map that got us this far.</p>

<p>Preserving Western Civ and the Glory of Rome is worth fighting for. Being unashamed to be a Christian, even if you&#39;re far from perfect, and even in the face of a mocking and jeering pop culture that has brainwashed everyone into Nihilism and Atheism and Marxism, is a conscripted duty for every descendant of Western Civ.</p>

How did humanity start? Small tribes. Then larger.... Then larger... other communities would take over communities. Or band together. Creating cities. Then it&#39;s gets larger and larger and larger. Having counties, states.... countries.... supranational identities. Having kings, prime ministers, presidents and emperors. It&#39;s human nature. In the end these small communities and countries are just the same. Just in a larger form.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even necessary for them to convince everyone that these redefinitions are the legitimate meanings, just enough people so that those who do express these beliefs will be unable to effectively communicate with those that don&#39;t.</p>

Maybe groups of anarchist&#39;s, yeah.. but not an entire state or anything. I think a lot of people are too afraid to abandon their trust in government because they don&#39;t know what to do next. It&#39;s just stepping into unknown lands pretty much. I think that&#39;s why a lot of people call it a ridiculous idea. There may be a ton of other reasons though. But I know for sure that we&#39;ve lived with this system long enough  that we don&#39;t know anything else. And it continues to do more harm than good. </p>

<p>Anarchy is the default condition between nation-states at this point. The UN and international law does not constitute a state, but mutual agreements between sovereigns. If it&#39;s good enough for states, why not for individuals and communities?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but there&#39;s not enough of &quot;us&quot; out there. I don&#39;t think everyone is on board with going full and true anarchism. It goes back to not knowing anything else besides the system we&#39;ve been brought up in. Even if you say you hate the systems or government, you don&#39;t really know anything else besides it. So you just keep living in it. Unless you decide to be homeless or something. Those are the true anarchists in this time period in my opinion. Everyone thinks differently I guess. </p>

<p>The admins have given us neither the tools nor the support to stop brigading and vote manipulation. It&#39;s evident that it happens, yet we as mods have no power to stop or contain it. We&#39;ve tried contest mode in the past, which only further ruins the chance of constructive dialogue to emerge. Contest mode took away the power for you, the user of this sub, to determine how you got to see your content.</p>

<p>We&#39;re trying a different path. We&#39;re setting the default sort for this thread to /controversial, which we think will reflect the comments of those who question mainstream narratives more so than the /hot sort does. Yet we fully respect your decision to consume the content of this sub and comment as you see fit, so it&#39;s easy enough to change the sort back to /hot to see this sub as the votes determined, to whatever degree you believe those votes to be either fair or manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Etymologically anarchy literally means &quot;without rulers&quot;, it comes from a combination of two ancient Greek words. At some point a couple of centuries ago, Proudhon coined the term anarchism to mean the political beliefs surrounding a society without rulers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>anarchism is a human ideology is as natural as its gets. no matter what kind of ideology, rule, systems, governing body we create, in the sense of a grander scale of time, they&#39;re fragile and temporary at best. </p>

<p>but there is one law no being can ever ignore while living in this 3d particle simulated reality and that is the rule of nature, survival of the fittest. this very law is embedded into our own laws and systems we create to cope with the pain and suffering that stems from our animalistic existence. </p>

<p>predatory lending, tax cuts/havens for the wealthy, (or just taxation in general), requirements for a license, degrees that makes you so indebted before hitting the work force is all to make it harder for new players to compete with the powers that be and to have us abide them to the rules of the powerful to keep their monopoly.</p>

<p>i just wanted to paint a picture that survival of the fittest has never gone away, it just took shape to make it easier for predators to harvest upon the weak mindless sentient beings. and that is how we are sheeples(arguably hardly sentient). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>anarchy is the starting point/base line for any societal development and in cases were things dont work out it reverts back to the basic. </p>

<p>for human society on a smaller scale like tribes it was morals and ethics that dictated our behavior. a society with a good moral background and common sense can maintain peace and order during a state of anarchy. but through out history we showed that we tend to become raging primates, common sense is hard to come by when the group expands and the need for rules and laws were vital as guidelines on how to behave and treat each other.</p>

<p>i do want to point out that between anarchy and order, it is not a black and white, switch on and switch off, dual state. they always co exist within society with gradient tones and degrees.</p>

<p>the country that threats you doesnt abide by your laws, goes by their own rules and there is no force above them to say knock it off. they are about to commit a crime according to our rules but to them its justified. most people imagine anarchy as riots and looting but is it safe to say there is anarchy on the national front of geopolitics if there are no entity governing the nation? then it goes back around to start where nations has to act like tribes and base their judgement with common sense, ethics and morals.</p>

<p>now lets take that analogy to a more personal level.
you be walking down the street. got cornered by a hobo that looks pretty squanchy and huuungry. ah shiet he got a knife out. now you&#39;re about to get either mugged, beaten then mugged, maybe a dash of rape since you happen to be on the floor unconscious, or just straight up get eaten alive cuz he on PCP and fuuungry AF. anywho in any one of the chaotic scenario there is a clash of two modes of operation with no higher force to mediate and enforce the rules that is commonly excepted. so in this moment this scene is in a state of anarchy.</p>

<p>criminals in general are just anarchic. with no regards for law, rules and common sense. when there is an act which nobody likes and a consensus will be reached to ban the act and enforce it with a punishment accordingly. in most cases the act has to exist for the law to be even thought of. laws are mostly reactionary while the acts like stealing, raping, murder is sucks to say, part of the nature of our universe. where those who will usually do</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word anarchy is often conflated with Anarchism.  Anarchism is a broad political philosophy that entails a general disapproval of hierarchy and elitism.  It comes in many different flavors and variations, but it tends to advocate for rule by the people rather than rule by a codified state.  Some modern modern Anarchists(adherents to Anarchism, Noam Chomsky being the most famous) have proposed that a society run by true adherents to Anarchism would be both highly organized and highly democratic/participatory.  It is all highly theoretical/difficult to implement, but so is each and every political philosophy when you boil them down to their essence and observe how they behave in the real world.  Socialists are allowed to be Capitalists, Capitalists are allowed to be Communists, Conservatives are allowed to be anti-conservative, Liberals are allowed to be...well you get the idea.  Anarchism is put under a more stringent microscope, and accused of being a hypocritical philosophy, than any other major political philosophy.  It has historically been one of the most brutally oppressed, both with propaganda and violence.  Why is this you may ask?  Well, if you were an elite oligarch who had enough power to influence public discourse, would you want a bunch of people running around with a brazenly an anti-elite ideology?</p>

<p>No, this is wrong. Look at the etymology of the word &quot;anarchy&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>An =  Lack or absence of</p>

<p>Archon = Ruler or master</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anarchy means no rulers and no slaves. Just as &quot;monarchy&quot; means one (mono) ruler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah yeah i get the etymology and all but if we&#39;re to have a decent conversation why not use the terminology that is accepted by all modern sentient primates. just because you know the archaic primitive meaning of a word doesnt make you right. even words evolve and change its meaning...</p>

<p>also ruler and rules come hand in hand... one in the same and can&#39;t have one with out the other... obviously there is no need for a ruler if there is no rules. and here is a brain teaser </p>

<p>&#39;should laws that is unenforceable be considered to be a law?&#39; and what about the laws that nobody abides or never enforced...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no.  Anarchists I self identify with would disagree with much of this.  </p>

<p>Yes, anarchy means without rulers (an=without, arch=ruler).  Just like monarchy is one ruler, and matriarch means woman ruler, etc.  I don’t believe the fact that anarchy has come to largely mean chaos is a “deliberate trick”, but instead what is generally assumed will be the end result of a society without rulers, thereby lending to its negative connotation.  This is why I feel many who believe in the same principals prefer to call themselves libertarians (not to be confused with the political party) or voluntarists, and not anarchists.  </p>

<p>I also have a problem using the word “system” when describing anarchism.  Anarchism is NOT a system, but a strict belief that we own ourselves.  You are your own property.  That’s it!  Everything else is simply an extension of this core principal.</p>

<p>It can be argued one such example in-line with this belief is the “golden rule” (treating others as you want to be treated).  However, the most often heard example from anarchists is the non-aggression principal.  This states that every human interaction should be voluntary, and it is inherently and morally wrong to use coercion, by initiating or threatening violence against another.  Again, if we agree I own myself and you own yourself, it would be a violation for either side to impose their will on the other, and defense against such aggression is justified.  </p>

<p>This is why anarchists believe government is inherently wrong.  To rule or govern literally means to control, and all governments assert their dominance using threats or violence.  Therefore, governments by definition violate the non-aggression principal, and the concept of self-ownership.  Anarchists view the words control and freedom as polar opposites, just as you would never associate slavery with freedom when describing how a slave master (owner) uses coercion to control their slaves (property).</p>

<p>noun</p>

<li><p>a political force or movement based on belief in anarchism.</p></li>
