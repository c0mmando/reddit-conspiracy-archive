<p>I have been trying to figure out the whole Clinton cabal in the 2016 Election. The problem is that it is an intricate web of deceit leading back to decades of events.</p>

<p>What created the animosity that seeded our current political war taking place in Washington. Like soros&#39; attacks on South Africa that eventually lead to the complete destruction of a leading world scientific and nuclear power, the environment in America can be linked back to an act of disinformation. BJ clinton signed the Church Fire Prevention Act and forever changed the world&#39;s view of American society. Shortly after this act was signed people across the world began to see the United States as a racist stronghold.</p>

<p>Glorifying the Guilty
March 1996
<a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/National_Council_of_Churches">National Council of Churches</a></p>

<p>Center for Democratic Renewal</p>

<p>Two Marxist Institutions</p>

<p>President clinton, BJ the First, spoke with emotion about his memories of black churches being burned down Sparking a national debate about the festering racism in American life. BJ clinton pledged to place the full power of the federal government behind the investigation of the fires and stop the racism that was an abomination in this country.</p>

<p><a href="http://people.duke.edu/%7Eldbaker/clippings/black-ch.html">Burnings of Black Churches to Be Investigated by Congress</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not the fires are linked, civil-rights leaders have started to blame what Rev. Jesse Jackson calls &quot;a cultural conspiracy.&quot; While there may be no single organization plotting the torchings, these leaders say, the fires reflect heightened racial tensions in the South that have been exacerbated by the assault on affirmative action and the populist oratory of Republican politicians like Pat Buchanan.</p>

<h3>The problem is the whole plot was a hoax.</h3>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2011/06/fanning_imaginary_flames_a_look_back_at_the_great_church_fire_propaganda_campaign.html">Fanning Imaginary Flames: A Look Back At The Great Church Fire Propaganda Campaign</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fifteen summers ago, America&#39;s news media informed us that black churches throughout the South were being torched by white racists.  The purported wave of arsons dominated the airwaves and generated thousands of newspaper articles.  Pundits, politicians and preachers decried the terrorism and the hate it represented. </p>

<h3>In fact, it never happened.</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the fact that the story was a complete myth, clinton signed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/104/plaws/publ155/PLAW-104publ155.pdf%5D%20and%20the%20damage%20was%20done.%20Groups%20like%20the%20%5BCenter%20for%20Democratic%20Renewal%5D(https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Center_for_Democratic_Renewal">Church Fire Prevention Act</a> a marxist group [
](
)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Black_church-burning_hoax">The black church-burning hoax of the 1990s was started in 1996 and received nationwide attention</a>. The flames of the hoax were fanned by USA Today writer Gary Fields and by the liberal group Center for Democratic Renewal.</p>

<p>While many black churches were burned, reporter Michael Fumento proved that there was no evidence to support the claim of an increase in arsons of black churches in America. Moreover, he points out that only three of the fires were actually racially motivated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the story was a hoax the people&#39;s ability to fact check the news was far more limited in the 90&#39;s and the damage was done. The national conversation had turned to a racist America. Internationally people thought the United States was becoming an apartheid state like south Africa.</p>

<p>Center For Democratic Renewal (CDR), Atlanta, GA, was formerly the Anti-Klan Network. Its research director is Lenny Zeskind. who was formerly publisher of The Hammer, an &quot;anti-fascist&quot; magazine in Kansas City, MO. In the past several years. Zeskind has established himself as an authority on right-wing extremism. The public record of Lenny Zeskind shows that in 1978 he was on the editorial board of Urgent Tasks: Journal of the Revolutionary Left, a publication of the Chicago-based Marxist-Leninist group, the Sojourner Truth Organization. Zeskind also ran notices in The Hammer promoting Searchlight, a UK-based &quot;anti-fascist&quot; magazine with a long history of support from Marxist-Leninist groups, including the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Another former key player at CDR is <a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/docs/CDR/Levitas2.html">Lyn Wells, a veteran Marxist-Leninist activist</a> who is also a board member of Zeskind&#39;s Kansas-City-based Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights. She was a member of The October League, which later became the Communist Party -Marxist-Leninist in 1977.</p>

<p>Why am I writing about a law that clinton passed in 1996 and relating it to today&#39;s Russian plot to hobble the American election process and Meuller&#39;s current assault on the Trump administration. I have been reading Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa book disinformation and it dawned on me the similarities to current events are undeniable. I believe that the spark the started the fire currently burning down the American political system and our country is a well crafted assault on the United State&#39;s greatest protection, The American People. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.aim.org/aim-column/communist-defector-speaks-out-on-americas-marxist-future/">A top communist defector is warning of an unprecedented “alliance” between the Democratic Party and the Communist Party</a>, reflected in the CPUSA’s endorsement of Barack Obama for president in 2008 and the party’s continued support for Democratic Party policies. But is this warning going to be too hot to handle for the media? And the Republicans?</p>

<p>Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, the highest-ranking official ever to have defected from the former Soviet bloc, says in an article for <a href="http://pjmedia.com/mihaipacepa/2012/06/04/the-socialist-mask-of-marxism/?singlepage=true">PJMedia</a> that any doubt that the Democratic and the Communist parties had secretly joined forces was erased in 2009, “when Van Jones, part of a left fringe of declared communists, became the White House’s green jobs czar.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The real problem is most people don&#39;t understand the fundamental differences between the different Communist, Marxist, and Fascist factions. While the American Progressive movement might find uses for the CPUSA they, at the highest levels, are <a href="http://fabians.org.uk/">Fabian Socialists</a>. They are competitive factions, and in the end they will destroy each other until only some version of one political philosophy is left to shape their vision of the world. Just as the NAZI party and the Communists fought viciously in World War II they were both socialist philosophies. What fueled the animosity?</p>

<p>Left and Right are not Liberal and Conservative, they are Socialist and Fascist. Until we require a command of the language and an understanding of political philosophy the American people will never understand the nuances the actually shape the narrative presented in the media.</p>

<p>Our leaders have been selling out the American People for at least 100 years, but until recently no one could break the belief of the people that, despite our faults, the United States is the greatest force for human rights on the planet. I have come to understand that it was not our government, it was our people and founding principles that was the world&#39;s hope for freedom. It is becoming clear though, that government has been fighting to destroy our beliefs at least since the <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2810091/posts">Wilson Administration</a></p>

<p>I realized that I constantly digress in to the past when trying to describe what is happening in the current news cycle, but nothing happens in a vacuum, but each current action is built on a foundation of every prior action that created the current environment and put the players in place. Unlike the fire hose of the current news cycle that quickly forgets the recent past, the disinformation attack that is currently assaulting our political system has been built over years, even decades of attacks great and small chiseling away at the American belief in our founding principles.</p>

<p>The most in depth look at the decades of collusion assaulting the Trump Administration is the <a href="https://www.bongino.com/">Dan Bongino Show</a>. Bongino since episode 628 has done almost 100 hours of connecting the dots between all the players connected in the assault on the Trump Presidency, the clinton email scandal, the clinton foundation, uranium one, Skolkovo, arms shipments in to Syria through Bengazi, it&#39;s all a cover up. </p>

<p>Like Bongino has said countless times, remember the names, learn the history. This is an unbelievably deep story that touches on decades of history. The one fact that the clinton progressive army counted on is that the American public are too lazy to unravel the greatest spy story to even come to light.</p>

<p>Your liberty, your future, your family&#39;s future all hangs in the balance, and America is the last stronghold holding back a world ruled by fascism and corruption.</p>

<p>Besides adopting the Leninist strategy of seeking greater control over the commanding heights of the economy, if one reviews Marx’s 10-point platform for how to socialize a country’s economy in stages (“The Communist Manifesto,” chapter two), one finds that Team Obama and his congressional progressive allies have taken actions to further the goals laid out in all 10 of the planks in the Marx platform. Here are some examples, with Marx’s wording being revised for simplicity’s sake:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Trump has gone great lengths to help people come together. </p>

<p>He began his 2016 presidential campaign with a speech disparaging Mexican immigrants as criminals and “rapists.”</p>

<p>In December 2015, Trump called fora “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” including refusing to readmit Muslim-American citizens who were outside of the country at the time.</p>

<p>Trump said a federal judge hearing a case about Trump University was biased because of the judge’s Mexican heritage.</p>

<p>In June 2017, Trump said 15,000 recent immigrants from Haiti “all have AIDS” and that 40,000 Nigerians, once seeing the United States, would never “go back to their huts” in Africa.</p>

<p>He called some of those who marched alongside white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., last August “very fine people.”</p>

<p>Trump pardoned – and fulsomely praises – Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff sanctioned for racially profiling Latinos and for keeping immigrants in brutal prison conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I guess you don&#39;t follow MSM but a specific person, Lisa Desmont since almost all of your misquotes come from her.  But here we go:</p>

<p>&quot;He began his 2016 presidential campaign with a speech disparaging Mexican immigrants as criminals and “rapists.”&quot;</p>

<p>FULL CONTEXT:  QUOTE: &quot;When Mexico sends its people, they&#39;re not sending their best. They&#39;re not sending you. They&#39;re not sending you. They&#39;re sending people that have lots of problems, and they&#39;re bringing those problems with us. They&#39;re bringing drugs. They&#39;re bringing crime. They&#39;re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.&quot; </p>

<p>Trump called fora “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” 
Full CONTEXT: &quot;My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror,&quot; Trump wrote in a Jan. 29 statement. &quot;To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.&quot;</p>

<p>a federal judge hearing a case about Trump University was biased because of the judge’s Mexican heritage.</p>

<p>No, he was more concerned that the judge belonged to a Hispanic Group called, La Raza. Donald Trump says U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel is &quot;not treating me fairly.&quot;  Translated, “la raza” means “the race.” Imagine the outcry if white attorneys from Mississippi, such as this author, started a a legal association called “The Race” with the stated mission to promote the interest of white, Southern communities. </p>

<p>It is true that Mexicans bring over gang crime, drug crime and that Mexico is a clear reason as to why there is such a massive illegal import on drugs, weapons etc. Now, because of the mainstream media and left-wing outrage at Trumps&#39; admittance into the White House, it&#39;s fair to be open to the possibility it was bias. I don&#39;t condone the actions, and I&#39;ll admit, he may have said something out of line, but nonetheless still an opinion in a free-country that he is legally allowed to have.</p>

<p>There is SOOOOOO MUCH more, but it really looks like you will keep your bias without looking at the truth of the matter</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is an opinion of his. He assumes &quot;some&quot; are good people, therefore most people from Mexico are not good people - rapists, drug dealers, criminals. &quot;Trump supporters are retards and inbred. And some, I assume, are good people.&quot; Paints me as a someone that hates trump supporters, right?</p>

<p>People will interpret things however they tend to be biased. But you&#39;ll never change my bias that Trump is a racists at heart.</p>

<p>Both Bill and Hillary Clinton rose from modest means. Do you really believe that they overturned the world order while so many multi-generational superrich are around? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>South African apartheid was basically a slave state where the long time locals were not given power on their own land. That may have played a role. If you are looking for oligarchs attacking other nations, you might want to look at Nicaragua, Chile, Iraq, and Iran for starters. That would implicate people like Milton Friedman.

<p><strong>No such thing.</strong> The site &quot;American Thinker&quot; makes this same mistake. Is that your source? You probably should have a correct name for something so important that it &quot;changed forever the world&#39;s view.&quot; The act you seem to be referring to, Church Arson Prevention Act was introduced by a Republican Congress and signed by Democrat Bill Clinton. The law created a task force that investigated about 900 cases, and it has since shut down. Doesn&#39;t sound very important.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the story was a hoax the people&#39;s ability to fact check</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re talking about fact checking when you can&#39;t even get the centerpiece of your essay correct: it is called the Church Arson Protection Act.</p>

<p>The &quot;Black church-burning hoax&quot; seems to come directly from Conservapedia, with a source claim of &quot;USA Today&quot; but no actual article sourced. Your source?</p>

<p>Based upon <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics/Occupancies/oschurcharson.ashx?as=1&amp;amp;iar=1&amp;amp;la=en&amp;amp;hash=FBD50951A48C300DF34F482024672740A303B364">this graph</a>, the trend in church fires was in fact dropping in the long run, although there was a spike in 1996. That probably had something to do with the concern. It was also an election year, so pandering likely played a role.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The national conversation had turned to a racist America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basic understanding: as long as people continue to deny the plights of minorities, and especially with population growth tending toward more of them, we will be divided. Oligarchs love that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zeskind has established himself as an authority on right-wing extremism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leonard Zeskind and his Center for Democratic Renewal has been in the press for his views on racism, true. His views on economics (aka socialism or communism) are not his claim to fame -- he got into the press despite those views, not because of them. It&#39;s called &#39;appropriate expert&#39; use. Obviously he is not that well known and certainly no centerpiece of running America, or he would be very well connected to actual people known to hold great power. This whole thing is a sideshow of misdirection to discredit people who are concerned about racism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another former key player at CDR is Lyn Wells, a veteran Marxist-Leninist activist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another guy in the same organization is not some kind of revelation of connections. It is actually the opposite. Connections to power are seriously lacking here, save a few MSM articles over the years. Have either of these two even been on television much? Show me their influence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A top communist defector is warning of an unprecedented “alliance” between the Democratic Party and the Communist Party,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excuse me for laughing, ROFL. This article from the well-connected Koch brothers funded PJ Media speaks more about the power of the oligarchy in putting out Fake News than it does about the object of its article. Ironically, it is often the people who suffered most under communism who come to America to make false claims about the &#39;communist Democrats.&#39; The father of the infamous &quot;Koch brothers&quot; himself was one of these types.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>communist Democrats</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama praised capitalist deregulator Ronald Reagan and continue to hold him in high esteem. In fact, Bill Clinton signed tons of bills providing deregulation and Barack Obama instituted the Richard Nixon plan of mandatory corporate health insurance. So, it wasn&#39;t just what they were saying, but the acted upon their words.</p>

<p>In fact, in 2001, Democrats offered an 850 billion dollar tax CUT to counter the GWB cut of 1.6 trillion (which eventually went on to become 4.5 trillion).</p>

<p>Communist Democrats? ROFL again.</p>
