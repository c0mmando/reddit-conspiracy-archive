        yesterday's post

       didn't go so well, I thought I'd make another depository for ineluctable evidence that a real shooting really killed and maimed people at a real high school in Texas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here you can post convincing and vivid imagery, video, and other media that let you know that this shooting could never be a staged drill/hoax, and give you the confidence to authoritatively put people in their place who suggest it might be a mere fabrication!

       It does NOT mean that the event did not occur. 
It means the event was organized &amp; planned.

       Those are 2 pretty huge stories within the past few days.
They probably deserve national attention &amp; some follow-up reporting, right?
Can you find any information about these stories on your news source(s) today?
How about the Santa Fe shooting?

      <p>
       Would you be willing to make a bet with me? Nothing crazy - let's say $250. There are services that will hold our money in escrow and empower an impartial third party to determine a winner based on strict guidelines that we both agree to beforehand. I'm willing to cut you some slack, even - she doesn't even have to go to gitmo, just prison. How long do you think it will take? 5 years? Longer? I'm completely serious about this - I think it would be fascinating, and if we both play our cards right we could potentially get some press for it.

       This is exactly what we're waiting to find out. How on Earth would either of us have the full picture? In the event that they do have the grounds, they still won't have the nuts.

       Irrelevant question! We don't know if this were a real or staged shooting yet. Trying to find that out, but for some reason people seem unable to focus on the simple task of posting evidence for a real shooting.

       With all the media evidence provided for any event be it war , protest , bombings , shootings being from media outlets you are saying everything is a false flag then and our reality is just an illusion brought you by CNN , Fox News,  Pmsnbc , MSM . And in order for any of it to not be a false flag we need to be there front and center and see it with our own eyes , well yeah that’s what I have been saying and practicing for years ,but  for obvious reasons I can’t be everywhere at once to actually witness any of these types of events, so I dont believe a thing that comes from any of those sources

       Dude look at my history. Confirm I live in the area (r/Houston and  r/Clearlake) and  past comments here of which I've never deleted any. That's all I can advise. But this now seems like a slide. Focus on a flat Earth type of absurd distraction to avoid looking at real issues.

       How stupid do you think we are? We know people were claimed to be killed; obviously there is a list of victims and "details about their lives."

       I don't get it - doesn't having names and photos of the dead 
provide some evidence that there were actual people were killed?  It's not conclusive, but yeah, it's a start.  Some names, and what they looked like.  They also have funeral services coming up.
      </p>

       What exactly should you need for evidence?  A photo of the bullets hitting one of these victims?

       Thank you for the list of victims. I suppose you're right...... it's a start.

      <p>
       If you have no further evidence for a shooting other than a list of victims names, you may reply "I have no further evidence for a shooting other than a list of victims names" or, better yet, don't reply at all and further crowd the thread with comments devoid of evidence!

       This is a thread for evidence of a real shooting. You are yet another commenter unable to provide it. That you choose instead of this simple task to levy a personal attack is a great way of demonstrating to any onlookers that we aren’t dealing with a real shooting in this case, hence the entire reason I make these threads. So thank you.

       Hey joe, I’m your previous thread about this I posted some evidence to you, asked if you consider it evidence, asked why you do not consider it evidence if you do not, and asked (multiple multiple times) for you to explain what you would consider as legitimate evidence. Even mentioned your name in a comment below it so I knew that you would see it. You chose not to respond over the past 2 days despite being active on Reddit. Would you care to venture over there and respond to me with answers to my questions or not?

       Well I suppose that’s a no as you continue to post on reddit without acknowledging me. This simply confirms what many of us know, you’re not looking for evidence you’re looking for something you can scream “no!! You’re wrong!!” Too...you seem to make similar threads after any shooting, asking for evidence, and seem to disappear when evidence is shown. It’s a shame, you try to appear or present yourself as wanting to have evidence presented to you then disappear when it is shown. Though I know you won’t, I’ll go ahead and ask you to stop making these threads after every shooting. If you want evidence that they happened you need to engage when faced with evidence instead of instantly abandoning the thread, or even creating multiple ones (like this instance). It’s pathetic, hurtful to victims, and transparent as hell. u/joe_jaywalker you’ve played your cards too obviously and your bluff has been called.

       Brooooooo....I’m asking you to RESPOND to the evidence that I posted in a thread ABOUT THIS EXACT TOPIC THAT YOUVE ALREADY CREATED yet you’ve abandoned that thread after I posted it for you. It’s not my job to re-post evidence just because you’ve abandoned YOUR OWN THREAD seemingly right as I posted said evidence
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s the part where you say “see you can’t post any evidence” and I’ll say that I already fucking did, you just chose to create a duplicate thread because you didn’t like your old one. Cmon man you’re coming off as a joke. So go ahead and respond to the evidence I’ve ALREADY posted in the thread YOU ALREADY created about THIS EXACT TOPIC. And don’t worry I already know your response to this comment will be something like “you typed so many words but no evidence” and I could repeat that you have already ignored my comment of evidence in a seperate thread of the exact same subject that you yourself created, then we could go through some itteration of that exact comment and response 5 times over. Quit your fucking dodging your transparency is horrific man, you’re only making yourself look scared of evidence or scared to engage in debate over evidence. So just don’t. Unless you respond to my evidence in the other thread I’ll just go ahead and respond to any comment you make with: “I’ve already posted in the thread YOU CREATED earlier with my evidence”.....it’s up to you to either go look at it or look like you’re plugging your ears and screaming “I can’t hear you!!”

       Give it a read, you should recognize it well enough, you created the thread then left right as I appeared to post the info you so desire. If you have a long enough attention span you can read down to our final exchange where I posted the info. Have fun, though I assume you’ll choose to ignore it.
