        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The question seems simple enough.  I&#39;d like to have kids someday, but I think it would be unimaginably cruel to bring them into this world.</p>

<p>When I think about all the programming, subtle poisoning, vaccine controversy, new invasive technology, etc etc etc...  I don&#39;t understand why someone would purposefully bring a child into all of this.  I have no pity for myself in this situation, but there are thousands of ways an innocent child could be ruined by the world we live in today.</p>

<p>I understand proper parenting is a necessity now more than ever, but how can you even fight this shit?  Kids nowadays are close to being fully on board with everything from being chipped to a full on surveillance state.  Yes, when they&#39;re children you have a small modicum of control; but as adults how can you guarantee they wont be extorted or worse?</p>

<p>When TPTB are shaping your children until they are free from your control, how do you justify having a child when you know what you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being redpilled and having kids you raise redpilled is actually the best thing you can do.</p>

<p>Because otherwise, you will be getting taxed into paying for a society where other people&#39;s kids will grow up. And these other people aren&#39;t red pilled.</p>

<p>So in fact, the only way to create change throughout the generations is to have many kids and raise them red pilled. This is actually how the elites got into power. They started to look at it long term, rather than short term which is what everyone is obsessed with today. </p>

<p>No. That would be too easy. </p>

<p>I can empathize with your point, but ultimately I find it to be a weak mindset. Even in this darkness we can find happiness. Finding someone you love and creating with them is the most beautiful thing. Nature can be cruel, but why give up? This world is beyond beautiful, these systems of control are not permanent. </p>

<p>Also the cryptic omnipotence you seem to employ does little to prove your point here.  I understand it&#39;s the internet, I&#39;m sure you do too; why is that necessary though?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finding someone you love--I don&#39;t think that exists. I had a lot more romantic thoughts when I was younger and I think my thoughts I was having are a huge joke now. Maybe my mind just got poisoned when I was younger, I was somebody made fun of frequently and that was something that took root. It&#39;d be a joke for anybody to like me in a romantic way. People need to be aware of that. Even though that&#39;s an insignificant topic compared to the shit we face in this existence. All I&#39;m say is that it&#39;s possible that the well will be poisoned for your kids. Just cause you talk about raising them to be aware of their surroundings doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll take. </p>

<p>Crazy thing is I&#39;m not even sad about abandoning the stuff I used to believe in. Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t like or trust people, just figure that I need to concentrate on surviving and romance is just opening a door to more shit imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe JFK once said something to the effect of, &quot;Our children are hostages to fate.&quot; We could live in a dreamy utopia and children would still be &quot;hostages to fate&quot; - they could be riding on a unicorn and go tumbling off a cliff, for example. The point is, we don&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) have children because we hope to control what happens to them. We procreate because it&#39;s a biological impulse and because some people decide that having a family enriches their lives - but even the most loving, well-intentioned parents can&#39;t help but make mistakes, nor can they protect their children from all the variables of life. 
Having kids is a big gamble. Personally, I&#39;d rather go to the casino. </p>

<p>but even the most loving, well-intentioned parents can&#39;t help but make mistakes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This. There&#39;s no handbook for the future.</p>

<p>I imagine some scenario where my kid wants to get a microchip in their brain so they can go to virtual prom, and I&#39;m like, &#39;No, you can&#39;t get a fucking microchip implanted in your brain.&#39;</p>

<p>And they&#39;re like, &#39;But ALL THE OTHER KIDS have microchips! You&#39;re ruining my life! Gawld!&#39;</p>

<p>My partner gives me a withering gaze, shaking their head as they get up to go comfort our beloved child. Another family dinner ruined, and I&#39;m the asshole just because I don&#39;t want to let Apple insert a literal microchip in my kid&#39;s brain.</p>

My parents made a lot of mistakes in their personal lives that effected me. But I don&#39;t hate them for that and I don&#39;t hate them because things were &#39;somewhat&#39; better when I was conceived or else they just weren&#39;t aware that this world is a toxic place.

But your kid is gonna be eaten by the wolves every single time they leave that little bubble you created where you taught them right from wrong, love, etc. Cause that kid&#39;s gonna go out into a world where everybody didn&#39;t get those same lessons. I&#39;m not even talking about &#39;going into the world&#39; when they&#39;re an adult. I&#39;m talking something as simple as being a kid and going to school. Bullying is bad. And so many older people have the attitude of &quot;Don&#39;t be a pussy, everybody goes through it!&quot; And so many CAN&#39;T deal with it. It&#39;s no surprise so many are ending their lives because of this shit. Goodness knows I think that&#39;s when my problems started showing up.

No occultism, no &#39;too much&#39; brainwashing, no &#39;too much technology&#39;. YET. We used to poke fun at how we were always 10 years behind the rest of the world, but as I grow up, I realize that this is actually a BLESSING. Most of us live very peacefully and we are a very connected community. My parents did a great job at raising me and my brother and I&#39;m thankful to them. So when I do have children, I&#39;ll make sure they receive the same kind of upbringing so that we can continue fighting back against bad people and raise children who have free will, who aren&#39;t afraid to question things and that are strong minded. I have my father to thank for this because he raised us with this kind of mentality. Which is why I&#39;m found here, on this sub-reddit, questioning, searching for the truth and fighting the good fight. I&#39;ll make sure to continue the pattern because it&#39;s what the new generation needs. </p>

I believe we are encoded to have hope and to create - children are the ultimate expression of that. Life is hard no matter how awake you are, but the opportunity to balance the difficulties with the joy of being with people you love, doing what you love far outweighs any pain in life.  One evening sitting around a campfire laughing with my family heals weeks of struggle and stress. And who knows? Maybe if I can’t make a difference in the world despite my constant efforts to do so, maybe one of my children will! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not truly redpilled or even blackpilled unless you want to pump out blue eyed cherubic baby clones of yourself like a Mormon prophet with 50 fertile prime breeding age teenage waifus on a cult compound.</p>

<p>The-you-know-who&#39;s work overtime flooding the public mindscape with propaganda to brainwash and subtly influence the goy to embrace any and every perversion and degeneracy to stop them from reproducing. </p>

<p>You enjoy your iPhone and your fat-of-the-land Western lifestyle, well, you caused global warming and ecologic collapse and pollution, so you better do the right thing and accept your moral fate to live as a barren solitary elderly incel. All those horrible wars your govt is doing to 3rd world peasant farners? That&#39;s also your fault, so you should get sterilized and then adopt some crack babies. The past several centuries of colonial exploitation which established a permanent birth lottery caste system? That&#39;s also your fault. To atone for your ancestor&#39;s sins, you should chop it off and start taking hormone injections which will slowly drive you insane and to your eventual suicide.</p>

<p>Experiment with putting stranger&#39;s dicks up your ass in a SF bath house, go through your chemsex gangbang phase, embrace free love and bang the whole basketball team in your dorm, swipe left, hooking up is now as easy and ephemeral as shopping, never commit to anything or anyone, move to the city and build your identity around your consumer choices, do drugs and get drunk every weekend as a lifestyle choice to liberate your higher consciousness from the tyranny of conformist society, score as many free abortions as you can, live for today because you can live for tomorrow on some other day, and immerse yourself in libertine media that reinforces the promotion of hedonism.</p>

<p>Instead of getting married and having your first kid at age 23, you&#39;ll be coddling your inbred mutant toy puppy while wondering why you&#39;re alone at age 33.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, certain other races on other continents have so such problems as you, and in fact they birthed too many children, who now need Lebensraum and so are illegally migrating to come live in your country and make your daughter into their 3rd wife.</p>

<p>And especially a certain tribe of Rootless Cosmopolitans who exclusivlely marry within ethnic lines and who all have enormous welfare-state bursting families.</p>

<p>This is why I say the instinct to have as many kids as you can support is the final red pill, because once you see what&#39;s really going on at the global scale--specifically I mean White Genocide-you can&#39;t unsee it and that existential racial fear awakens your instinctual drive to be fruitful and multiply the same way as your father&#39;s father&#39;s forefathers did.</p>

I suppose the earth revolves around the sun too.&quot; </p>

<p>The &quot;things are really bad I shouldn&#39;t have kids&quot; is kind of an over reaction. We are not literally slaves or meat machines...yet. Red Pill yourself from your own bias, misconceptions, unconscious drives, etc. I like to remind myself to, &quot;question your own authority&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta admit your post took my breath away, I love how you worded it. And I&#39;ll agree with it. Like I&#39;ve said on other sites, it doesn&#39;t take brains to make a kid.  You can have your &#39;oops&#39; and then you can have the demanding type of &quot;I WANT kids!&quot; &quot;But my biological clock, I NEED kids.&quot; I think to have a child that you need to examine yourself, examine what kind of life the child(ren) will have in the family, examine what kind of future the child(ren) will have in the world you&#39;re about to bring them too. So many things to examine and I just get the feeling the majority of parents in this world don&#39;t do that. &quot;I WANT kids&quot;. Well, we had the kids. They&#39;re the ones gonna be fucked if they have severe health problems, if they&#39;re in a family that&#39;s gonna screw them up, being stuck in a world that they hate, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d have to be crazy to have kids if you see the shit in this world for what it is. I didn&#39;t really have much of a choice, I don&#39;t like kids is my first explanation for why I refuse to have kids. Second reason is I have health problems that I KNOW would pass down to any kids I have because they got passed down to me. And the last reason is I see this shit for what it is. It&#39;d be beyond cruel for me to have kids when I think/know this world is a miserable place to be and it&#39;ll never get better, it&#39;ll only get worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;d also be interested to hear from the kids that were born to parents that were also aware of the shit going on in this world. Were they brainwashed into believing they can be in the &#39;army&#39; for the good side, how they &#39;chose&#39; to be here right now or would they tell you something that might make a lot of their parents squirm? How many of these kids would say something along the lines of &quot;I wish I could rip my own skin off and leave this world immediately. All the bads outweigh the goods and I&#39;m just sick of being here. And this isn&#39;t depression talking.&quot; Any of you parents asked your kids how they feel about being in this world? Straight up ask them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m seeing on this thread is no different than all the struggling couples having kids because they thought the kids would be the ones to &quot;heal&quot; the family, relationship, marriage, etc. Pretty hefty weight for a kid to have on their shoulders and no doubt it&#39;s a recipe for failure. And here you have people wanting their kids to help save the world. I&#39;d laugh if it weren&#39;t so serious.</p>

<p>Life is beautiful.  We live in a time with less war on the planet than ever. Modern medicine means a general scrape normally will not kill you. Simple sickness like strep throat won&#39;t kill you anymore. Crime is down.  Shit, compared to the 70&#39;s this time is a fucking picnic.</p>

<p>Perception is the Key.  We are never going to make it to utopia. People are way to selfish for that. According to science and economists, we could end world hunger and poverty. We could end the housing crisis, but we are too Greedy and selfish to do that. </p>

<p>The world is Fucked, the world is beautiful. The world is what is what you make of it. I will bring children into this world that is way better than the world my Parents or grandparents lived in and give them a chance at life. For good or ill. </p>
