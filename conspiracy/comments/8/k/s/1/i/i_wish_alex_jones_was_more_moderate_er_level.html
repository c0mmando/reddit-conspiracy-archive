       Jones is controlled opposition.  I suspect some people who stitch together weird media attack pieces on Jones to also be controlled opposition, e.g. Fintan Dunne:
       <a href="http://breakfornews.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4945">
        http://breakfornews.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4945
       </a>
       .  Besides the weird attack, note that the admin tries to convince people with a tinyurl hoax that Alex is CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is don't trust any of them.  Research, but research alone.  Never attach yourself to a group, and go by simple wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just consider this little source I found:
       <a href="http://www.aimovement.org/csi/index.html">
        http://www.aimovement.org/csi/index.html
       </a>

       According to these hundreds of declassified pages (obtained through the Freedom of Information Act), we see that controversial figures in the Native American community Russell Means and Ward Churchill are FBI informants and in bed with other intelligence sources.  Why does this matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ward Churchill helped the government kill Natives in the 1970's at Wounded Knee
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_incident">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_incident
       </a>
       .  Afterwards Churchill and Means (who eventually got rich) stood by as the government came through and enacted forced eugenics programs on Native women.
      </p>
      <p>
       So of course after 9/11 we saw Churchill stand up as the controlled opposition.  He was the old model, the 60's radical.  But his purpose was clear: To galvanize the public in fury against his 'little eichmann' comments. To drive support for the war and attention away from any investigation into 9/11.  As disgusting as it was, it was brilliantly clever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russell Means is still being used.  In the mid 80's he was used to run against Ron Paul for the libertarian presidential nomination.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Means#Other_political_involvement">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Means#Other_political_involvement
       </a>
       Why? Maybe to ensure Ron Paul as the nominee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently Russell has been a monthly guest on the Alex Jones show.  Yet Alex's fans never raise an eyebrow to Mean's clear informant/agent past. Why is he chummy with Alex, who is now friends with Ron Paul?

       The tragedy is that this is what journalism is for.  The working public just don't have time to research primary sources.  The vast majority of journalists are betraying their profession through either laziness or being bought off.

       Alex leads to a road to nowhere, always ending with undefined "they" with multiple euphemisms like "Bravarian death cults."  It appears you're suggesting Ron Paul is of their ilk.  I fail to see how that's the case.  He identifies real people and problems and provides real solutions.  Here's naming names:

       This is the second time I have seen you type "Bravarian".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's
       <strong>
        Bavarian
       </strong>
       . As in the region of Europe known as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria">
        Bavaria
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Bavarian Death Cults you regard as euphemisms are indeed an accurate description of secret societies such as the Order of the Death's Head (the cult of the Nazi Waffen SS) and their supposed American offshoot, the Order of the Skull and Bones.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I see you type Bravarian one more time, I shall mock you mercilessly and heap great scorn upon you! Good day sir!

       I really don't care that I didn't get one of Alex Jones's rantings correct.  As important as making sure the name of a space alien is spelled correctly.  If it draws attention to the substantive links I give, maybe I should keep writing it as is so you can wail about the irrelevant.

       I just thought you might want to correct that particular habit of misspelling an historic geographical region as it gives the impression that you are ignorant and poorly educated about the world you live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you have now clarified with your above statement that you were previously ignorant of existence of Bavaria, I assume you will now concede that the existence of Bavarian Death Cults is a topic of which you are wholly unqualified to discuss.

       So in your opinion, is Alex Jones doing us all a disservice by using all of these "Bravarian Death Cult" and "New World Order" euphemisms instead of openly blaming the Jews? Would you say that he is a crypto-zionist? Remember, his wife has a slightly Jewish name!

       I'm not trying to smear the guy, I love his show and think he has great info.  I just wish he would tone it down a bit and be more... um... civil.  Kinda can't think of the word, sorry.  He's just so out there in how her presents stuff sometimes.  Not to say he's wrong, because he's right a lot.  But the presentation turns me off.  It's like conspiracy porn.

       I'd like it if he could just STFU for a second and let his guests speak instead of constantly interrupting them mid-sentence to yell about something. Sometimes he gets so worked up he turns into a clone of Bill O'Reilly. Really annoys me.

       He's a frequent guest, and yes, Alex admits to toning down for the mainstream audience.

       Alex knows he goes overboard, but it's in jest. If you ever see youtube clips of him doing the radio show, he is being sarcastic often, even to the point of coming across as kooky... but that is what Alex is going for.

       My biggest problem is despite having so much information at his fingertips, he can believe that Christianity is somehow relevant. Maybe I'm mislead but doesn't he think that evolution was made by the Eugenicist to control the population? I also think he blows stuff out of proportion at times and fails to really cover too much about the Israel link to the white house.

       This bothers me a lot too.  not that he has personal a belief in Christianity or any religion, but that, at times, he apparently doesn't mind using his faith as wedge that seems to be driven between those who share his religious beliefs and those who don't.  mebbe all this goes hand in hand with his overemotional personality but i often wonder why he would want to call attention to whatever insignificant divisions may exist among his audience instead of focusing on what he claims to be the important issues of the day...  also some of his guests and sponsors can be kind of 'extreme' and intolerant when it comes to their religious views...

       He's tricky, I used to like him but I think he's sold himself out as the conspiracy guy. Is he trying to make a career out of it or tell people the truth. A lot of the shit he talks about is important, but his story is too much about himself. His voice is fucking irritating especially when hes yelling through a bullhorn and he doesn't believe in global warming.

       So then it must be easy to point them out. Start with the bigger claims like "controlled demolition at the WTC", perpetually imminent martial law, the Bush Administration's plot to invade Iran, the Bush Administration's plan to cancel the 2008 elections, vaccinations, and fluoridation.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you get done with all of that please substantiate Alex Jones' claim that Barack Obama is a puppet of the CFR/Illuminati/Zionist/etc conspiracy and all that jazz with some mainstream media sources.

       I believe you are being downvoted because the posters in this thread are generally fans of Alex Jones, and they feel you are coming across as a troll / unobjective interloper.  I listen to the show, and generally agree with a lot of the criticisms leveled against him.  Additionally, I would add that he often falls into the "Since time began" conspiracy narrative, which I think is of dubious veracity.  That being said, a lot of the things he brings up I consider to be legitimate avenues of inquiry.  Take 9/11.  You know as well as I do that neither of us are probably ever going to really know what happened on that day.  So we basically have two options:  believe the official story, or disbelieve the official story, and if we fall into the latter category, we can argue about how much we don't believe.  I do not believe the official story, and I think that there is clearly a lot of evidence to point to some kind of criminal activity that points to the government as accomplice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examining the conspiracy narrative over the longer term yields similar results, although the evidence is generally more abundant, yet not reported on by the MSM.  To put it more succinctly:  The battle humanity is party to, has been the same since we started cultivating land and building cities; it is the battle between state power (coercion) and individual sovereignty (freedom).  Whether or not Alex Jones is right about everything is not really the point - the fact that he is fighting on the side of freedom and liberty is enough for me to conclude that his heart is at least in the right place.

       Quite a bit, actually.  First off, it remains unclear what exactly happened aboard flight 83, which crashed in western, PA.  I suppose that is a tangential element.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I am having trouble understanding how either of the world trade centers basically exploded mere hours after being struck by an airplane.  There are the numerous reports by first responders detailing explosions in both buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, how two very tall, very overbuilt buildings collapsed through the path of greatest resistance (themselves) and turned to dusty piles of molten-hot metal and debris (the heat signature being given off weeks after the event indicates temperatures far hotter than what would be considered possible given simple kerosene as the only combustible agent) I consider to be suspicious, and not adequately addressed by the 9/11 comission.
      </p>
      <p>
       How building 7 collapsed is another mystery.  At first,the explanation was "thermal expansion" - an explanation so ludicrous it was hardly even reported on by the MSM.  they later retracted that explanation and have yet to issue another one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, a Danish scientist recently reported finding active thermitic material in WTC dust.  The dust's authenticity is traceable.  No one has yet come forward with an explanation as to how it got there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, bud,if at this point there isn't something about the 9/11 commission you don't believe, you are either a liar, or a fool.

       What about flight 83 remains unclear?
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC towers didn't fall into the path of least resistance. They fell into air. The melting point of aluminum is low enough to have been melted by the fires that were preseent. WTC 7's collapse is a result of massive damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers and the ensuing inferno, and
       <a href="http://www.structuremag.org/Archives/2007-11/SF-WTC7-Gilsanz-Nov07.pdf">
        actual scientists
       </a>
       have come up with scientific explanations for why this happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not too sure if I believe this Danish scientist. It looks like he worked with Stephen Jones, who is known to have overlooked the presence of sulfur from drywall when making his false conclusion that there was thermite at the WTC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, bud, to call me a liar or a fool right after posting all of that conspiracy theorist nonsense is laughable.

       I think we must have different definitions of
       <em>
        refuted
       </em>
       . The link you have provided merely argues that the passport could have miraculously survived the flames and rubble. In fact, after reading this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The passport was recovered by NYPD Detective Yuk H. Chin from a male passerby in a business suit, about 30 years old. The passerby left before being identified, while debris was falling from WTC 2. The tower collapsed shortly afterwards.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ... I am even
       <strong>
        more
       </strong>
       suspicious. Who was that mysterious business man who so miraculously got his hands on a damning piece of paper evidence to prove who was on that flight? Why did he disappear without a trace? Doesn't pass the sniff test, bud.

       OK. I'm not trolling here. What about the "official story" do you not believe?

       My apologies if I have misread your insinuation, but in the immortal words of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, it's the impression that I get.

       I think it's adorable how you both posted the same debunker site. You're like a well-oiled machine!

      <p>
       And as I stated to your shiny little friend above, that article doesn't disprove anything. It merely states that it is not
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       for the passport to have survived the impact. It's just one of those many little fortunate coincidences that helped to build the official narrative of what happened that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Happy little coincidences!
