       Last night I watched a documentary about the TWA flight 800 that crashed/shot down near the coast of Long Island in July 1996.
Documentary is on amazon prime
       <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3040528/?ref_=nv_sr_1">
        https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3040528/?ref_=nv_sr_1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a fascinating documentary, but I think it did leave out a lot of evidence that pointed to the central tank explosion and relied heavily on eyewitness reports - which are the least accurate.
Having said that, many people reported seeing a missile approach the
aircraft AND I have no reason not to believe that the FBI were bossing around the NTSB and tampering with evidence.

       I think this is probably true, but it's hard to imagine a ship full of sailors would know this and not say anything to anyone.  AFAIK there has never been a sailor come forward to say anything.

       I'm just saying it is one thing to admit complicity in something like faking a moon landing and quite another to admit to accidentally shooting down a civilian jet liner. Those in the know are likely grateful that they weren't held accountable.

       Yes there were eyewitness accounts of lights/missile in the sky.

       However I dont see much of a rationale for a shoot down.

       Central tank explosion still looks more likely to me.

       You are right about witness testimony being generally inaccurate however when many people corroborate the same story it gets taken a lot more seriously. Remember this is why the CIA has to release the whole zoom climb video back then to explain to eyewitnesses what they saw. Except it never did and the radar tracks showed a primary blip falling straight out of the sky....that alone is one of the biggest pieces of evidence against the CWFT explosion. I was very much on the fence until I saw this documentary a few weeks ago...very interesting stuff.

       Do you mean eyewitness accounts saw missle trails / plumes? Because i dont remember people seeing missles.

       Your response is just plain wrong. I spent a lot of time in the late 90’s early 2000’s inside 747 Center wing tanks doing bonding mods to prevent this sort of thing happening again. Nowadays any large aircraft has a nitrogen inerting system for the tanks as a preventative measure.

       I'll have to take your word for the first part of your response, though it is still interesting that the FAA had a fix when, in reality, nobody really knows what actually caused the ignition
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         "The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty"

        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also, it's interesting that you were doing modificatons to 747's in the "late 90s early 2000's", when the fix was only proposed in 2008, well over a decade after the actual incident
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         Accidents due to design deficiencies included TWA Flight 800, where a 747-100 exploded in mid-air on July 17, 1996, probably due to sparking electricity wires inside the fuel tank;[222] this finding led the FAA to propose a rule requiring installation of an inerting system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in July 2008

       I argue that it was mostly the crash that contributed to it's demise, because what was widely reported afterwards was that it happened as a direct result of the inherently flawed design of the Concorde, not of any specific mechanical failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll admit that, after 9/11, all airlines were in a horrible slump for several years and passenger numbers across the board were way down for everyone.  So, yes, the economy played a part, but I do not believe it was the sole contributor.

       I recall there being a lot of worry surrounding WHO was on the plane that died and possible political motives as well, but i haven't looked at any of this in a loooong time. Also the reconstruction of the wreckage indicating the use of a missile. Does this documentary go into that? Can't watch now but might later.

       Not sure about VIPs aboard, but my set design colleague from Ohio State University's Theatre Dept. was on that flight to Paris with her younger sister to study design. A terrible event I've never forgotten and was so pissed no one in the Navy was found responsible although I did hear there were internal personnel transfers to move those guilty to faraway posts..

       Get the fuck out of here. My Dad investigated multiple airplane crashes with the NTSB. There's no way anyone would be able to tamper with the evidence. You should probably stop talking out of your ass about things you have no idea about. You sound really fucking dumb.

       Your response is just plain wrong. I spent a lot of time in the late 90’s early 2000’s inside 747 Center wing tanks doing bonding mods to prevent this sort of thing happening again. Nowadays any large aircraft has a nitrogen inerting system for the tanks as a preventative measure.
