        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-05-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/RMFN.html">RMFN</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Owls and others birds of prey, the highest apex predators outside of man, have been observed to mate for life. Monogamous relationships can be observed in nature and many times they are observed in the species with extremely high &quot;intelligence&quot; for example, swans, grey wolves, and gibbon apes. Animals with low intelligence such as fish, and cattle mate promiscuously. </p>

<p>There definitely is an evolutionary advantage to mating for life. If an individual wants to secure success for their genetic material they will first select a compatible mate, one that will be a good compliment to their own genes. Then they will want to mate, but the natural world is dangerous and full of strife. That&#39;s when seasonal mating comes into play. Having more offspring means that more of your genetic material will spread. One might argue that if a alpha male mates with 20 females much more of their genetic material will spread, this is true but the &quot;apha&quot; genes are dominating the male expression and the ratio of male to female genetic transmission shifts drastically. This can cause some problems in the behavioral expression of proceeding generations.</p>

<p>In modern slut culture that progressive society has brought us it is popular to be promiscuous. But, many men in this society are alienated like the beta bulls in any herd they will never pass on their genetic material. In a promiscuous society hookup culture dominates and traditional relationships are replaced. This actually leads to far fewer men having sex on average compared to the 1940&#39;s when 80% were married by 22. We have become like a fenced in herd of cattle. One alpha asserts dominance and bangs the majority of the females. This process favors one type of genetic material over another. Maybe that is why we are seeing a rise in &quot;toxic&quot; masculinity? Slut culture favors the breeding of the assertive alpha over the more average man. The decline of marriage coincides with the rise of toxic masculinity, rape, and patriarchy because I&#39;m slut culture the average man has been out competed by alpha male. Now single mothers raise the children of a father who has moved on. Much like the captive bull. The fence provides safety first his offspring so that he does not have to. He can move on and breed then eat rather than protecting the herd.</p>

<p>Low testosterone is rampant in western man. Having sex actually makes your body produce testosterone. Whereas masturbation saps testosterone and stifles the production of testosterone. The men who have sex have higher T. And the men who are weak and effeminate stay soy boys because their body&#39;s are not primed for producing testosterone. Yes lifting is important. But the endorphins and hormones realised during sex are much more important to self actualization. Tests have shown that population density has a correlation with sexual orientation. A study showed that as a rat pit filled with breeding rats would display a higher ratio of homosexual activity as the population grew. The scientist concluded that the genes were identifying a possible lack of sustainable food and possibly triggered a gene responce to increase the rate of homosexual rats so that the population would be able to live within the food provided by the environment. Here is where we get to agenda 21 and the rise of urban man. Alex Jones would have us believe that homosexuality is caused by chemicals in the water, plastics, and soy, this may be a cuase of the feminization of men but not the increase in homosexuals. Feminine and weak mean =! Homosexual. The vast majority of homosexual men are in fact quite alpha. It is the vocal femme few we see elevated to the image of &quot;gay&quot; man. But that is besides the current point. It is the massive populations in cities that is the cause of a higher rate of homosexual men. The human genome is reacting to what it sees as a threat to its future existence. What can we conclude form this? Lifestyle and cites themselves have an effect on gene expression.</p>

<p>Finally this is where we get to sexually transmitted diseases. What was the origin of a sexually transmitted disease? It is like any other entity, it has no clear origin. It logically does not follow that a population without such diseases, I.e. primitive man, would develop them through sexual intercourse alone. Maybe these diseases began as something else and found a evolutionary niche in the moist tissue of mammalian sexual organs. Sexually transmitted diseases can only exist in a culture of promiscuity. If every person mated for life the only stds would be from rape or a promiscuous underclass that went around the hypothetical societal norm. In this way a monogamous lifestyle can be seen as far healthier for the physical body and for society as a whole. Could we argue that promiscuity was demonized not because of prude religious morals but because the ancients knew the dangers of such behavior to a society&#39;s collective gnome.</p>

<p>A monogamous relationship is not only psychology healthier, I.e. it aides in the production of oxytocin and other hormones, it is healthier in general. For yourself and for society, find someone and love them. Love them good. And love them for a lifetime. If we fall in to the trap of promiscuous sex we will collectively destroy modern medicine and the effectiveness of antibiotics. If we want our society to last past this Weimar phase of degeneracy we must return to imitation of the other high predators in nature. We must secure a healthy society through long lasting healthy monogamous relationships. We can end sexually transmitted diseases in one generation if every virgin picked one virgin to be with for life.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote &quot;Outmoded notion of the alpha wolf
The concept of the alpha wolf is well ingrained in the popular wolf literature at least partly because of my book &quot;The Wolf: Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered Species,&quot; written in 1968, published in 1970, republished in paperback in 1981, and currently still in print, despite my numerous pleas to the publisher to stop publishing it. Although most of the book&#39;s info is still accurate, much is outdated. We have learned more about wolves in the last 40 years then in all of previous history.</p>

<p>One of the outdated pieces of information is the concept of the alpha wolf. &quot;Alpha&quot; implies competing with others and becoming top dog by winning a contest or battle. However, most wolves who lead packs achieved their position simply by mating and producing pups, which then became their pack. In other words they are merely breeders, or parents, and that&#39;s all we call them today, the &quot;breeding male,&quot; &quot;breeding female,&quot; or &quot;male parent,&quot; &quot;female parent,&quot; or the &quot;adult male&quot; or &quot;adult female.&quot; In the rare packs that include more than one breeding animal, the &quot;dominant breeder&quot; can be called that, and any breeding daughter can be called a &quot;subordinate breeder.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to look up marriage statics over the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The pathways in the brain that are created by a promiscuous sex lifestyle have statistically shown that divorce rates go up the more partners you have. So yes it actually does. Being a slut early in life means you have a much higher chance of getting a divorce later in life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow,  this is written as if a woman has no choice in the matter at all!  Perhaps it&#39;s because men who view woman as cattle that are to be rounded up for a bull are viewed as assholes, and women just don&#39;t sleep with them.  I was confused here also about all the issues mashed togther here.  Show me stats on the following,  and we can have a reasonable discussion- sexual partners in relation to monogamous relationship  both long and short term, happiness and longevity of monogamous relationships in relation to sexual partners, womans choice since 1940,</p>

<p>I with I had the time to rewrite this from a female perspective and show just how truly one-sided this perspective is. </p>

<p>Also,  the idea that any genetic material from the strongest individuals is important is a bygone idea now for humans. When there are no longer essential environmental pressures making it important for strong key genes to be passed on,  it&#39;s become  a crap shoot. It&#39;s a moot point now in relation to environmental evolution. </p>

<p>Arranged marriged are as pretty close as you are gonna find these days to virgins marrying virgins, and,  surprise surprise, I don&#39;t think that the man is expected to be a virgin.  Reassess that relationship in 1,3,5 and 10 years and tell me just how happy they are. </p>

<p>You are pretty much saying, overall,  that anyone who has more than one partner is contributing to societal downfall.  </p>

<p>Find someone you love? 100% yes.  Be open and honest and work out a situation that works for you? 100% yes.  Anything else won&#39;t stand the test of time or emotions. Do you honestly expect folks to just wake up tomorrow morning and be honest with themselves about how they feel then come clean with the world? Because if they don&#39;t love the person they are with but slept with already,  oh no! Now they break up, and are contributing to slut culture by having to find someone else.  </p>

<p>Tell me also,  if sex is <em>so important</em> to you,  and the person you find yourself with has zero chemistry in the sack, will you be happy in a week? A month? A year? Ten? But you can&#39;t leave,  because that&#39;s contributing to slut culture, and Lord forbid you have a mature conversation that ends in someone having their sexual needs filled elsewhere because that&#39;s no longer monogamy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the contents of your post, but it seems to me that you’re talking about one mate for life and not necessarily monogamy, which are two separate things. I believe it’s imperative to be monogamous with your partner. I also believe it’s fine (preferable) to have multiple monogamous relationships throughout one’s life. Relationship dynamics are not things that can be taught and must be learnt through experience as everyone deals with situations differently. This is more to learn about yourself rather than your partners. That’s my opinion. </p>

<p>Monogamous relationships can be observed in nature and many times they are observed in the species with extremely high &quot;intelligence&quot; for example, swans, grey wolves, and gibbon apes. Animals with low intelligence such as fish, and cattle mate promiscuously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, swans - the Einsteins of the animal kingdom.  </p>

<p>Jesus dude at least try starting with a true statement.  There&#39;s no link between intelligence and monogamy in animals.  Monogamy does sometimes happen in animals, but even socially monogamous species are actually genetically promiscuous (they cheat on their spouses).  Fish, who are dumb as shit, are frequently monogamous.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some animals noted for their intelligence - Dolphins, elephants, chimpanzees and bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, squid and octopi.  None are monogamous.</p>

<p>In the future, if you want to use an animal to support your baseless argument, use crows instead of swans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you asked for a thought-out response and here it is. I&#39;ll start off by saying the first paragraph is a very stupid comparison.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One might argue that if a alpha male mates with 20 females much more of their genetic material will spread, this is true but the &quot;apha&quot; genes are dominating the male expression and the ratio of male to female genetic transmission shifts drastically.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is meaningless. First of all, there&#39;s a mix of male and female genes for offspring, there&#39;s no &quot;alpha&quot; genes and male to female genetic transmition, whatever that is, and what exactly is behavioral problems in the offspring? Surely you don&#39;t mean that anti-trans bullshit...    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, many men in this society are alienated like the beta bulls in any herd they will never pass on their genetic material. In a promiscuous society hookup culture dominates and traditional relationships are replaced. This actually leads to far fewer men having sex on average compared to the 1940&#39;s when 80% were married by 22.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spoken like a true incel. There&#39;s no more alienating in society than there ever was, it&#39;s called natural selection and there have always been people who didn&#39;t get laid or passed down their genes. This illusion of the alpha Chad is just stupid. Also, are you suggesting women marry guys they don&#39;t like just for the sake of having children? Excellent points you make.     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whereas masturbation saps testosterone and stifles the production of testosterone.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <a href="https://www.anabolicmen.com/ejaculation-testosterone/">actively false</a>.
&quot;In multiple human and animal studies, it has been noted that ejaculation does not acutely change serum testosterone levels, busting the common myth that ejaculation would rapidly deplete the body from testosterone.&quot; Sex does, indeed, increase your testosterone. But saying that &quot;<em>the men who are weak and effeminate stay soy boys because their body&#39;s are not primed for producing testosterone</em>&quot; is just unbased discriminatory bullshit. And then you proceed to mention lifting, which is what is always suggested to incels... haha   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the endorphins and hormones realised during sex are much more important to self actualization     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Continuing with the unbased bullshit. I&#39;ve searched a bit and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-hormones-are-produced-during-and-after-sex">the hormones released during sex</a> are all regular hormones you can get through other means (also like endorphins, released during sex but also... while laughing). Nothing about &quot;self realization&quot; to be seen but the projection is nice. Also, on the whole homosexual rats thing, which isn&#39;t a particularly fructiferous google search, I only found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3960032/">this study</a> which does indeed talk about increased rate of homosexuality on rats... via Pavlovian conditioning post-birth. They even state the conditioning is much more inducing than any genetic traits. Also, I&#39;m not arguing on anything Alex Jones, if that&#39;s your definition of a source I don&#39;t know what to tell you.     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of homosexual men are in fact quite alpha. It is the vocal femme few we see elevated to the image of &quot;gay&quot; man.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you re-read what you type? What does &quot;quite alpha&quot; even mean, isn&#39;t an alpha a dominant guy that bangs all the chicks? Are you complaining gay men are taking... all the men? Also, nice lack of source on the whole human genome expression;    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the massive populations in cities that is the cause of a higher rate of homosexual men. The human genome is reacting to what it sees as a threat to its future existence     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty safe to say this is unbased horseshit. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/10/homosexuality-may-be-caused-chemical-modifications-dna">This study</a> on gay/straight twins concludes that genetic differences might be caused by &quot;differences in their exact locations within the womb and how much of the maternal blood supply each [son] receives&quot;. Nowhere does it mention population size, and how exactly would the genome know? Beyond my simple brain, at least. <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2006/060531/full/news060529-6.html">This other study</a> also links sexual orientation to differences in libido between individuals, and yet again - no population factor is involved. And then we get to the STI part;    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sexually transmitted diseases can only exist in a culture of promiscuity.      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is factually incorrect and/or doesn&#39;t correlate with your previous &quot;slut culture&quot; story. A quick glance at [Wikipedia]() shows that &quot;<em>The first well-recorded European outbreak of what is now known as syphilis occurred in 1494 when it broke out among French troops besieging Naples in the Italian War of 1494–98</em>&quot;. Also, the first medical center for venereal diseases was founded in early 1746. So, has promiscuity culture come to be only recently, or has it been around since the XV century?     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If every person mated for life the only stds would be from rape or a promiscuous underclass that went around the hypothetical societal norm.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again with the forced marriages side-suggestion. First off, some STIs like AIDS can (without proper care, granted) be  passed down to offspring, so this would not be 100% effective, not to mention falling outs/divorces/relationship breakups which are what has kept STIs around for centuries already. Or are you suggesting couples don&#39;t ever break up, and single people don&#39;t ever have sex until marriage and with only one person in their lifetime? No thanks, for me at least. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a great deal for incels though.      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could we argue that promiscuity was demonized not because of prude religious morals but because the ancients knew the dangers of such behavior to a society&#39;s collective gnome.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, we couldn&#39;t, because &quot;ancient&quot; knowledge of STIs was literally non-existant and <em>very</em> ill-informed at best. As per the previous Wikipedia article; &quot;Prior to the invention of modern medicines, sexually transmitted diseases were generally incurable, and treatment was limited to treating the symptoms of the disease&quot;. So no, people in ole medieval towns weren&#39;t being monogamous for fear and knowledge of the dangers of STIs, more like they were <a href="https://www.medievaltimes.com/teachers-students/materials/medieval-era/marriage.html">arrange marriaged without any say whatsoever</a>. From the article: &quot;Women didn&#39;t have a choice as to who they would marry and, most of the time, women didn&#39;t even know the man before they wed.
However, men were sometimes able to choose their bride. Marriage back then was not based on love; most marriages were political arrangements. Husbands and wives were generally strangers until they first met.&quot; Again, no thanks, but it <em>does</em> sound suspiciously like an incel wet dream. After medieval times, Victorian morality gained dominance through Europe and much of the world, which encouraged people to be prude and conforming of their relationships.       </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For yourself and for society, find someone and love them. Love them good. And love them for a lifetime.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you think having multiple sexual partners and settling down are polar opposites? It&#39;s like you think you can&#39;t possibly have sex out of a commited, life-long relationship, which damn near nobody even has before their 30s. I know I wouldn&#39;t want to marry at 20, and certainly wouldn&#39;t want to be forced to wait for sex until my 30s or until my parents pick a girl for me. Also;    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we fall in to the trap of promiscuous sex we will collectively destroy modern medicine and the effectiveness of antibiotics    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does even mean? What part of modern medicine are you trying to destroy? Certainly not things like abortions, safe sex measures, or other surely meaningless stuff like cancer or alzheimers research...? And a non-existent link between antibiotics and promiscuous sex which doesn&#39;t exist. Do guys who bang lots of chicks take cold medicine more often? Or are you talking specifically about STI-treating medicine, which has actively reduced the number of STI-related casualties in the last 60 or so years to an almost non-existant minimum?       </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We must secure a healthy society through long lasting healthy monogamous relationships. We can end sexually transmitted diseases in one generation if every virgin picked one virgin to be with for life.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aaaand now you&#39;re not even being cautious about the incel shit. Again, I don&#39;t really know how to tell you that most people aren&#39;t ready to choose a life partner at 18, but you should know that. This sounds like a government-tells-you-who-to-mate-with kinda dystopia off a fantasy book. It&#39;s not that there&#39;s no truth to your statement, only that everything you support goes against basic aspects of human behavior. Kinda like saying &quot;if you kill all disabled people in a society, there will certainly be next to no disabled people in a single generation jump&quot;, which din&#39;t exactly go well for the Nazis.     </p>

<p>Ah, writing all this felt good. It&#39;s nice to call someone out, have them not provide proof of their claims and have you provide them instead. But hey, I&#39;m sure <a href="/r/braincels">/r/braincels</a> will take you back.</p>
