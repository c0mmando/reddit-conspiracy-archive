       I've been following Q for a little while now, and I still don't know how to feel about it. But this post isn't about if I believe Q is legit or just a fraud or a psyop or a LARP.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is about the coordinated effort (mainly in this sub) to downvote and mock/discredit anyone who is even
       <em>
        remotely
       </em>
       supportive of the Q narrative. Anything outside of complete condemnation and mockery and you will get downvoted (but usually still have a red cross, at least in my experience).
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed the efforts against Q posts to be ramping up over the last few days. Now this unsealed document about a Weiner search warrant gets posted, and everyone is up in arms about how much full of shit Q is, and how they can't believe there are still people that buy that LARP, and every anti-Q comment is at the very top of literally any post about him. Just go look at the "proof" that "debunks Q once and for all!" (which came out of fucking TMOR no less) and check out the comments section. It's just absolutely ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like the fake support I see for Net Neutrality (because Reddit is obviously EXTREMELY in favor of not having to pay more as the #3 website on the web compared to a site that uses much less of the ISP's resources, and because they are a free service that cost will just impact their bottom line, not the consumers), the same type of irregular voting patters seem to be at work for anything related to Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought I'd share a different opinion on the matter, since I haven't really seen any posts other than ones that support the narratives being pushed. And even though I know this probably won't go very far out of New, I just wanted to make this post anyway in the hopes that there are at least some people out there that see what I'm seeing as well.

       I can’t really say much other than I don’t think it’s an Eagle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among the ancients a fabulous bird called the Phoenix is described by early writers ... in size and shape it resembles the eagle, but with certain differences. The body of the Phoenix is one covered with glossy purple feathers, and the plumes in its tail are alternately blue and red. The head of the bird is light in color, and about its neck is a circlet of golden plumage. At the back of its back the Phoenix has a crest of feathers of brilliant color ... The Phoenix, it is said, lives for 500 years, and at its death its body opens and the new born Phoenix emerges. Because of this symbolism, the Phoenix is generally regarded as representing immortality and resurrection ... The Phoenix is one sign of the secret orders of the ancient world and of the initiate of those orders, for it was common to refer to one who had been accepted into the temples as a man twice-born, or reborn. Wisdom confers a new life, and those who become wise are born again. [p. p. 176-77]- manly p Hall
      </p>
      <p>
       People see Eagle because of the bird being representative of the USA and the dollar bill. Well it was originally a Phoenix on the dollar bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to the symbolism. The important number is 500. Now is it exactly 500 or give and take that the Phoenix dies and is reborn? Probably give or take.
      </p>
      <p>
       500 years ago, give or take, something big was dissolved... the Roman Empire. Maybe we are starting to see the return of the ‘great empire’?
      </p>
      <p>
       We could also look to Hermes and see a transformation of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way there’s a lot from a little. As usual.

       You put Q in the title, enjoy the downvotes from the usual suspects lol
      </p>
      <p>
       The main talking point used to "discredit" Q is one of the first posts where he said Human and HRC would be indicted in november (written 11.04 for example) and that would have placed those indictments 2 weeks later of those posts, that is an insanely small timeframe
      </p>
      <p>
       But notice that he didn't say a year and everybody assumes it must have been 17, but a lot of posts from Q have a "mirror" meaning or usage, I'm thinking this is one of them
      </p>
      <p>
       He's basically saying those indictments will be open/activated on those dates in 2018 and with the current timeline of things, I could see it happen
      </p>
      <p>
       There had much to be done still when Q
       <em>
        started

       posting so people saying "his first post" is wrong while ignoring

       My question is why has he had to post so many hundreds of crumbs of BS that dont really mean much even if you really try and put it together all you end up with is some boring shit that 99% of the time isnt clear about its signifigance.

       Very interesting you say this, I believe that it doesnt really matter who won this election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point was division amongst the citizenry, both Trump and Clinton had radical appeal to certain demographics and caused extreme anger and frustration in other demographics, leading to us having 2 factions of normal citizens hating each other and ready to kill each other in the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hadnt considered it but both Q and Russiagate both play the same role to both factions, they give each group hope that things arent as bad as they seem, that the "team" they bought into may still do what they claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And both Q and Russiagate have managed to stay relevant and even grow in followers, Q for almost a year and RG for 2 years

       Predicting specific dates is such a jerkoff gimmick to string people along. Q is doing the same thing those Rapture-predicting religious nuts do, and when nothing happens, he'll have a prepackaged excuse all his retard followers will gobble up without question.

       Q orchestrates his own discrediting attempts on himself. I think it receives a gratuitous amount of backlash, because, well, it's stupid. Painfully, obviously stupid. I said this in another comment, but why on earth would someone divulge valuable information as if they're the Riddler?

       Do you have any issues with PBS putting liberal talking points into Sesame Street and other kids shows?  If your "entertainment" is causing others to believe untrue things and/or pushing a narrative, is that good, bad, or indifferent?

       The Q LARP has been downvoted for months.  Trying to link Q to anything recent like the wiener story is just wishful thinking.  Q hasn't given anything concrete and the predictions are awful.  Also I don't think anything will happen with this weiner thing, its just another leverage move for some other purpose, the people wont see shit. Ever.  Thats how the system is designed.

       I checked to make sure all of the timestamps and timezones matched up and they do indeed. I just dont know how anyone could possibly still say its a larp after this shit happened. there is a very clear narrative being forced on us, and that is that Q is fake and to just move along and ignore it. doing that would be the biggest mistake you could possibly make.

       Consensual vs consequential sounds like a case of auto-correct. If he had spelled “conseuential” then I’d believe it. Trump being Q is towards the bottom of my list of possible scenarios.

       I didnt say even once that trump is Q, did you just ignore the part where he tells us 2 times in a row what the time differences will be between trumps tweets? did you also miss where he mentions goodwin and then trump puts goodwin in his tweet?

       My bad, tbh it was hard to read on my phone, and I got hung up on the “misspelling without the q” part. Could you give me a TLDR?

       1)Q draws attention to the term goodwin and implies the time difference between tweets to be 15 minutes
2)trump tweets 2 times after Q's post, both are 15 minutes apart from each other. The final tweet has the name goodwin in it, another thing Q told us about.
3) somone noticed that the word consensual was misspelled and needed to be corrected to consequential (not depicted in this picture). Q then tells us the next time difference coming up is to be 1 minute apart.
4)trump edits his previous 2 tweets that we just talked about to have the spelling correction that the anon pointed out, turning consensual into consequential. the time difference between these two tweets is one minute just like Q told us would be the case.

       Interesting. So I take it that would mean Q is not only close to POTUS, but Trump has helped him coordinate his chan posts in the past? Wouldn’t the President need to be in on something like that in order to pull off?

       indeed, people will try to tell you its cold reading, or that Q is some kind of psychic. however it very clearly isnt cold reading at all because of the specificness behind these posts. while i agree a psycic could potentially tell us in advance about the term goodwin in trumps tweet, that doestn even come close to explaining the time differences he tells us two times in a row.

       there are many pieces of evidence so far, but none as specific as this one. most are just wild coincidences that can be explained away by themselves, however Q recently posted a picture of what is to be an EO with most of it covered up accept for the letters rti and a right below that. if the next EO that comes out has those letters in that same position, it will be 100% completely undeniable proof that Q is legit. honestly i could show you all the rest of the pictures but i have enough faith in Q's legitimacy to feel that that will definitely happen with the EO. When it does happen im sure you will hear about it as well, such a thing occuring will get a ton of people to pay attention to this whole thing.

       Yea I saw TMOR already try to "debunk" that picture as a Photoshop. Will be very interesting to see if that comes true. Thanks for this info! Really appreciate it, now I know what to keep my eye on.
