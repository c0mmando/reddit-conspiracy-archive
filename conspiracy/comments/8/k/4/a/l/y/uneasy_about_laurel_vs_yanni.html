       Like most others, when I heard about this phenomenon I enaged with it, listening to the clip and encouraging others to do so, in order to compare results. However, the more I think about this, the more I feel uneasy about it's emergence. I've read about the alleged backstory and the science behind the phenomenon, but I can't help but think that this is being carefully watched, or perhaps managed by those who have a vested interest in observing (and controlling) how we behave.
      </p>

       It plays with the social vs individual consciousness. It's telling us something, but we don't know what it is. And we feel compelled to ask others with a near-urgent curiosity. I don't know enough about NLP etc, but for some reason I'm suspicious.  It inherently drives us into camps, and the result is that the other team's perspective is literally incoherent to our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else have thoughts on this?

       It's easily manipulated by what you expect to hear. If you think one, you'll hear that one. I can easily hear all 4 variants: brain storm, green storm, brain needle, green needle.

       I clearly hear 'needle'. Either 'brain needle' or 'white needle'. I do NOT hear 'brainstorm' AT ALL. Not even when I only think of the word 'brainstorm'.

       Its the same as an optical illusion. Theres so many different illusions where theres 2 faces or which way a train is going, and people see one of the two options. I think the reason its easier to be able to see both sides of an optical illusion is because we are much better at controlling our eyes than our ears, so once we hear it one way we cant easily hear it the other.

       Indeed, I believe the science behind it.  Rather, I'm questioning whether or not this could be used as an exercise to observe (and perhaps control?) our perceptive abilities. I realize this is way out there with no supportive evidence, but that's why I posted to this sub!  Just wondered if anyone else has some ideas along these lines.

       Im pretty sure it has something to do with the level that the two words are played at. One of the words is played at a different bass level so since human ears are not all the same, some people hear one word while some people hear the other.

       It’s got to do with low and high tone I’m fairly sure. Yesterday morning I was hearing laurel and then when I played the same video a little louder (or the other way around, can’t remember), I was hearing Yanni

       Same. I've listened to it closely for over 15 times and It doesn't even remotely sound like anything near 'Yanni'. And I'm incredibly familiar with the word 'Yanni' because it's one of the most popular names here in my country and my dad is called 'Yiannis'.

       The conspiracy angle you've made me consider is the use of this in public. Like, imagine a crowd of people at some event, and there's speakers around for announcements, and them doing something like this to tell one group of people one thing, and tell another group of people a completely different thing at the same time.
       <br/>
       I mean, the tech isn't too complicated. One sound is based in the low bass frequencies, while the other is based in the high treble frequencies. Both are played at the same time, but what you hear depends on your how good your ears are and the frequency settings of the speakers that the sound is played from.

       Well, that's at least one possibility, if you wanna go worst case scenario. But more likely simple, subtle crowd manipulation. You can target different people by playing with the EQ balance of the speakers and placing them at specific points around the area which carry certain frequencies better. It doesn't have to be two entirely different things. It could be just one word in a sentence which is changed. There's plenty of options for how this can be utilised or abused.

       No problem. I actually said that just kind of out of intuition and when I just looked up the biblical story I realized I've conflated it a bit, maybe related myths, maybe witg movies about it, I'm not sure. 
The story in the Bible is an origin myth to explain where all the languages of the world come from. The city of Babel, it says, came together to build a huge tower, the top of which was swallowed by the clouds. When it got this tall and reached Heaven, God caused everyone below to speak in babel, He confounded their speech. 
As I had remembered it, they then turned on each other, unable to understand what each other was saying they became angry. A war was waged, destruction, and utter chaos ensued. So it was more than why everyone speaks different languages; it was why all natons can't get along harmoniously either.

       The way they do the test is bullshit. They ask people upfront which name they hear. People are lying their asses off.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a real test they should play the sound &amp; not tell them upfront it's Yanny or Laurel.
Just write down what they heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can load the sample the sound editing program &amp; analyze the sound for it's plosive, fricative and aspiration components.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is some conspiracy element it may have to do with testing how readily people are willing to lie about what they actually heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously people are willing to lie about it for conversation sake so taking it further you could plant the idea thru the mass media that "people naturally understand spoken word differently even within their own spoken language !!!!!"

       To me? Initially Laurel, consistently. Then today, using the same audio clip and phone, it reverted to Yanni. Quite odd in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as another person commented, I'm concerned about the possibility that this may be used to bio-hack human consciousness in some manner. Imagine a television broadcast, perhaps a public emergency message, where the same words are used and yet varying messages are communicated. Perhaps they are trying to aggregate data to see what types of people hear which word (by gender, race, age etc). I don't know why, but I just don't trust it.

       to do this, so even if no one was doing it before now they might ;)

       Indeed, I believe the science behind it.  Rather, I'm questioning whether or not this could be used as an exercise to observe (and perhaps control?) our perceptive abilities. I realize this is way out there with no supportive evidence, but that's why I posted to this sub!  Just wondered if anyone else has some ideas along these lines.
