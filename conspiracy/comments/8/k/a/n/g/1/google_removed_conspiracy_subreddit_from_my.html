       I more inclined to think the whole fake news agenda, is being used against us two fold. Now we have algorithms to protect the masses from this stuff. By allowing so much of it to be pushed here, this place will be stripped of its seo purpose.

       The censorship has gotten worse. it is difficult to find a search engine that doesn't engage in censorship and shadow banning. The top three search engines are mainly Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo. There used to be others trying to create their own search engines and directories like DMOZ but they have gone down under now. Many Web Directories have kinda started to sink under and it is difficult to find a quality directory that doesn't have spam, maybe i am wrong on that but who knows. It has become like a monopoly or duopoly or trippoly. A very tiny number of private corporations can dictate what we see in search results thus can be the ones that decide who gets to be elected to President and Congress because they can censor what they don't like and essentially can game an election process.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that means only special political candidates that Google approves of will ever be a Government official. Nobody who wants to be independent will ever win. The private corporations can dictate and manipulate who becomes President, a Congressperson, a Senator, a Federal Judge. They can now dictate our Government and policies by the manipulation of their algorithms. Now that is the "Russian Collusion" that they are accusing Trump of. It is a handful of private corporations, FBI Agent Mueller, and other corrupt SWAMP creatures that are sabotaging and manipulating the United States elections. It isn't really Russia and neither is it Trump but a handful of corporations decide and manipulate as to who may become the next newly elected politician.

       Best comment for me. 2016 Google's results for Clinton &amp; Trump were all mostly positive or minor negative Google news top results.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were Bernie Sanders you had major negative Google news results in the top results constantly from major 'news' organizations even though he had multiple mile lines of people cross country trying to get into his filled to capacity rallies.

       I looked up "conspiracy subreddit" and it was my first result.  Putting it in as "reddit conspiracy" makes it seem like there is some conspiracy **about** reddit versus just looking for the subreddit.

       Weirdly enough that subreddit wasn't the first for me, but it is now.  Point still stands though.  If you word something weirdly don't be surprised when you get weird results.  Like "reddit conspiracy" where it is going to make the search engine look for a conspiracy about reddit versus "conspiracy subreddit" where it is going to look for subreddits with conspiracy in the name.  I get different results when I switch the words in my search as well.

       You have to understand that, as every modern product, Google is tailored for the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The masses are not considering conspiracy theories reliable, usually mocking them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this sole reason, it's in Google interests to not show those results, especially as top ones, because it would actually hurt their credibility as seen by the average joe.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a conspiracy, it's systemic. It's just capitalism collateral damage.

       What the hell. Everybody here knows thats not what is going on. Also the vast majority of people now believe in conspiracies. Times have changed. We have pretty much had decades of presidents that refuse to even mention things people care about like campaign finance reform, reinstating of the 4th amendmemt, and other political parties being allowed into debates.

       I think the point would be was that you didn't have to type it so explicitly in google before. Google would autosuggest it &amp; it was always the top results BUT now it's Finland conspiracy.

       Cmon...... if I can type out '
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       And yet white supremacy and news propaganda site searches come up just fine. This sub has been targeted for the same reason Julian Assange has. It's a matter of convenience to the establishment to say "while we're campaigning against the misinformation machine with public support and an underlying sense of legitimacy, let's throw a few "undesirables" on the train car to Auschwitz as well."

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       because of it's controversial nature, and I think that's not cool.

       over the past year.

       What a world we live in... now you have to explicitly ask to hear another side of a story. It used to be the case that people would enjoy hearing different views on a particular topic, and then use their own judgement along with further research, but now that's just all too "upsetting" according to the G-Men.

       The "upsetting" wording is really telling. Users of their services are being steered away from points of view that Google deems so jarring and unpopular, that they aren't even shown whatsoever. Causing cognitive dissonance equals micro aggression? I'm still stunned that a tech giant is
       <em>
        catering to
       </em>
       easily offended simpletons.

      <p>
       How did this happen? Did an executive meeting come to the conclusion that returning opposing viewpoints in search results, causes a user to react by using their services less, and therefore generates less advertising revenue?

       Those are human experiments (isn't that illegal?) done by Facebook, but I'm sure Google is doing the same and they're just better at keeping quiet about it.

       I just did a quick search "google experiments on users" and 8 of the top 10 results are about the Facebook experiments...

       And the same people who cry about "net neutrality" will say that Google is a private company and can do whatever the want.

       They don't give a fuck about net neutrality, they just got on the bandwagon because facebook and twitter said it was what the cool people were doing.

       I don't really use bookmarks, sometimes I make them but never go back to it. My bookmarks are a mess. But most people visit the same sites every day and every modern browser will autofill in sites based on visiting frequency

       I've been waiting for someone to make a post like this. I usually get to this sub by googling "conspiracy reddit", but over the last few months that doesn't work anymore because this sun doesn't show up in google's search results on the page 1. Now I have to type "conspiracy reddit sub" to get it to show up on the first page.

       They're either manipulating the results, or the algorithm is just broken.

       Whether I search "reddit conspiracy" or flip it around to "conspiracy reddit" I see that FinlandConspiracy sub as the #1 result... despite the fact that
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy

       is roughly 90 times more popular right now (based on the number of users online).
