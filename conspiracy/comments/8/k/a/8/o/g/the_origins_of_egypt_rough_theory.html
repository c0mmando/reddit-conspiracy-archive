       What if there was indeed a 10 thousand year old civilization that lived hand to hand with nature, agriculture and didn't really care for expansion, where the giza plateu was a magnificent tropical spot, with rainfalls, lots of vegetation as geology indicates? This way they would've delevoped a great technological knowledge involving acoustics as suggested, and through this they may have been able to "levitate" objects, drill and so many things that we cannot really imagine, this would explain how the great pyramid was built (on this time and then yes restaured on a way that it could be a tomb, this would explain why it only took the 20 years to be "built", maybe the same for the other pyramids..), and I do believe it's acoustic power generated energy that was somehow related to increase plant growing, or even actual electric wireless power? May sound crazy, but one thing is for sure, it was not built originally to be a tomb, how can we explain the small tunnels on the queens chamber? And the small "doors" with two wire spots? A negative/positive polar engine perhaps? And the lower chamber could have been filled with aqquiferal watter for sure, a great sorce of energy combinated accoustically with the great gallery was purposed to generate something for sure. But back on track to my original point, this population got extinct at some point due to a natural disaster, such as meteors, earthquakes, solar activity and on this case the glacial change (I'm not really an expert on this point, correct me if I'm wrong or improve my point), I mean we're talking about thousands of years, relativisingly thinking natural disasters are not so uncommun. As it got extinct, a massive load of knowledge got lost, and popular stories refering to Gods and all that stuff to have caused the disasters got strong amongst the community and that's how Egiptian religion may have started. They still had technological knowledge for sure, but with the time it got lost due to Egiptians obcession with the after life, they just didn't improve anything on the technological knowledge, they kept the drilling ones (there is just so many evidence) to build tombs for sure, and surely more and more disasters happened and they started writting their records, keeping them secure on a really safe place to conserve the knowledge, the great Sphinx maybe, and even the old library which held knowledge from thousands of years and as it burnt away, all the acient knowledge went away too, it's just devastating to think that so many knowledge was lost, we know about Plato, Socrates, Aristotle among others knowledge but imagine how many philosofers knowledge got lost there, we're talking about thousands of years.. And since that, wars and human futility domained, and just recently we redescovered electricity, we may be able to unlock the secrets from the past, but most of all we got to make our times on earth worth, we have to make freedom prevail, conserve the nature and live with it, side to side, to keep the world "healthy" where everyone can have the best of it, just like the 10 thousand year old civilization that I refere to may have intendedï»¿

       You are correct.  It was not built to be a Tomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually research into the pyramids, a power source is what if most likely was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramid shape works perfectly with a Tesla coil device

       Check out Joseph p Farrell's Giza deathstar series. He examines the power plant theory but says it's more likely that it was a weapon. The case he presents is pretty compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically his hypothesis is that the great pyramid is a giant analog computer that represents the solar system and could be used to cause a nuclear explosion inside a person, a chair or even another planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm really not doing him justice but all of his books are fascinating. The main thing that has drawn me to him isn't his hypothesis itself, though like I said it is very compelling, it's the fact that he touches on and incorporates so many other ideas, from the electric universe theory to David Icke. With other authors I'm continually frustrated that they're not taking other research or points of view into account. It's my personal view that no single alternate researcher is 100% correct rather they all have some piece of the puzzle and all those pieces need to be stitched together. Farrell does this better than anyone else I've read.

       It has also been suggested that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The Great Pyramid was supreme among the temples of the Mysteries. In order to be true to its astronomical symbolism, it must have been constructed about 70,000 years ago."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Who was the Master dwelling in the mighty Pyramid, the many rooms of which signified the worlds in 
space; the Master whom none might behold save those who had been "born again"? He alone fully knew 
the secret of the Pyramid, but he has departed the way of the wise and the house is empty. The hymns of 
praise no longer echo in muffled tones through the chambers; the neophyte no longer passes through the 
elements and wanders among the seven stars; the candidate no longer receives the "Word of Life" from 
the lips of the Eternal One. Nothing now remains that the eye of man can see but an empty shellâthe 
outer symbol of an inner truthâ and men call the House of God a tomb !
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The technique of the Mysteries was unfolded by the Sage Illuminator, the Master of the Secret House. 
The power to know his guardian spirit was revealed to the new initiate; the method of disentangling his 
material body from, his divine vehicle was explained; and to consummate the magnum opus, there was 
revealed the Divine Nameâ the secret and unutterable designation of the Supreme Deity, by the very 
knowledge of which man and his God are made consciously one. With the giving of the Name, the new 
initiate became himself a pyramid, within the chambers of whose soul numberless other human beings 
might also receive spiritual enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the King's Chamber was enacted the drama of the "second death." Here the candidate, after being 
crucified upon the cross of the solstices and the equinoxes, was buried in the great coffer. There is a 
profound mystery to the atmosphere and temperature of the King's Chamber: it is of a peculiar deathlike 
cold which cuts to the marrow of the bone. This room was a doorway between the material world and 
the transcendental spheres of Nature. While his body lay in the coffer, the soul of the neophyte soared as 
a human-headed hawk through the celestial realms, there to discover first hand the eternity of Life, 
Light, and Truth, as well as the illusion of Death, Darkness, and Sin. Thus in one sense the Great 
Pyramid may be likened to a gate through which the ancient priests permitted a few to pass toward the 
attainment of individual completion. It is also to be noted incidentally that if the coffer in the King's 
Chamber be struck, the sound emitted has no counterpart in any known musical scale. This tonal value 
may have formed part of that combination of circumstances which rendered the King's Chamber an ideal 
setting for the conferment of the highest degree of the Mysteries."

       Great post! The consensus among Lewis Spence, Robert Stacy-Judd, and Edgar Cayce is that Egypt was founded by immigrants and/or refugees from Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Cayce, the Atlanteans preserved their knowledge in three "Halls of Records", one in Yucatan (perhaps at Piedras Negras in Guatamala), one under the Sphinx, and one that is submerged near Bimini in the Caribbean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully, at least one of them will be found in the next few years, or decades.

       That's right! And I do believe that Atlantis was located on the Richat Structure, which is communly said to have been the result of a meteor impact, but it has no sign of impact at all.. And clearly has marks that have been underwater at a certain point, due to glacial transition perhaps (I have no idea xD) and has the exact configuration described by Plato
And then they moved a little further to the surroundings of the Giza plateu, close to the river, cultivable land, a great spot to keep their culture alive! The evidence is there, right in front of us
Even if they find the records, It's not so likely that it will come to the public.. The ulta conservative and manipulative Egyptian authorities won't let that come out, even the Vatican will have a word on that, it's a colossal change on the way we see the world, certainly not something that the uptown folks want us to know.. Not even Tesla had the chance to have a word on the coil project

       I think you're in the right track with your theory. I visited the Pyramids in January, and it was amazing! Highly recommend. They looked NOTHING like the tombs in the Valley of the King. Egyptians carved/painted hieroglyphs in every inch of stone they could, however the pyramids have none of that...

       Alien theories are just ridiculous, and I didn't refere to them at any point
      </p>
      <p>
       No one talks about those because there's just no physical evidence to support an ancestral origin for those, nothing suggests that they had massive knowledge about electricity, but in Egypt it's all present, perfect drills and unfinished cuts on granite walls clearly indicates a great knowledge technological knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another physical evidence for a 10.000 year old (or even older) civilization is supported by the water erosion on the Sphynx, it could've only be created with massive rain falls, and we have to go back indeed 10.000 - 800.000 years to find a weather that provided this conditions
      </p>
      <p>
       But once there is evidence of acient Greek/Roman civilizations, we'll be very happy to get into it, it's all great!

       I wasnt refering to you but some other commenters. Also erosion can be caused by sand, time etc. And if they knew of electricity -that doesnt mean their knowledge came from outer space. It just means they were ahead.

       It is indeed water erosion, it's consensual to all geologists, and you can really differ that erosion from wind erosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's right, but think about it.. We are talking about thousands and thousands of years, where as we mainstreamly know, there was no way in hell that they had technological knowledge, even the major Egyptologists still guarantee you that it was all made with sticks and stones, and only on the last century we rediscovered the basics of technology, isn't it fascinating?
