       For nearly two years, the Democrat party and their supporters in media and government have used every available resource to discredit those who are trying to get to the bottom of the Seth Rich case. Anyone who suggests a motive other than a robbery gone awry is immediately pounced upon and labeled a conspiracy theorist. Nevermind that the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange has all but blatantly admitted Rich was a source of Democratic National Committee leaked documents. To the left, even armed with this information, there’s absolutely no possible way Seth was involved.

       He can't reveal his sources directly.  One can gather that he was attempting to send a message that authorities may want to broaden the scope of their investigation, giving them a clue that he may have been assassinated as a result of potentially being a leaker.  Investigating this would give law enforcement the opportunity to rule out any connection.

       What makes you think that this wasn't investigates anyway?

       Should it be investigated more closely because Jiam Assange hintes that Rich might have possibly been a leaker?

       If Rich was a leaker, a complete investigation would require the DNC to have allowed the FBI to have physical access to servers, which they have refused to do.

       Actually, in the greater scheme of things, they filed a lawsuit alleging their own conspiracy theory.  Also, we've seen in the leaks that party members, including officials, worked with reporters to shape a certain narrative, so why should anyone believe the same isn't the case with news coverage of the Seth Rich case.

       Just a guess, but I'm thinking there is a lot of reasons for you perceiving they have been silent when maybe they haven't. Again, mostly guestimating, here goes:
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC media matters machine, Share Blue, whatever they are called, is gonna bury as much of it as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously getting real vocal about shit has consequences as may be evidenced by Seth's mysterious death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if I remember right the family of Seth Rich asked people to settle down.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also probably a split among Bernie's followers, some probably voted for Hillary and probably just don't buy the conspiracy and/or think Trump is worse than Hillary. Although, a significant amount voted for Trump, which isn't exactly silent. Unless I have my facts wrong, he may not have actually won without them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, IDK, unless you have your fingers on the pulse of the Bernout community you have to take your perception of how they are acting now with a grain of salt. DNC did a lot of work to silence them, especially online and in the media. T_D types seem to be kinda split,with some of them (the smarter ones) being very open and welcoming to Bernie's followers and some of them being very condescending. Anyway, Trump was a surprise win for a lot of people. Maybe Bernie's supporters are hoping he'll make another run and that if no one sees it coming enough to take it seriously as a threat if they stay on the down low that he'll have a better chance.

       I think there's a good possibility that many anon conspiracy subscribers are Bernie supporters.  They see the collusion between Clinton and the DNC as the atrocity that it truly was.  There are irrefutable facts proving the DNC plotted with Hillary against Bernie, and later (or more likely concurrently) against Trump using similar tactics.  To know Seth Rich was a man of strong character is to know he was capable of resorting to activities that would expose such profound corruption as was taking place around him.  I feel that his belief system aligned with that of other Sanders suppporters, and I also believe these supporters will be the group who will ultimately be the driving force for the exposure of any residual factors remaining unresolved.

       Hey man idk if you are right and I'm a little late responding but I just wanted to make an observation that has been a recurring theme for me personally. I feel the comment I made above was fairly well thought out and I was quite clear that I was mostly hypothosizing yet still I get down voted with no clear rebuttal to anything I said. Now I get down voted all the time for being an asshole, but I don't think I was being an asshole here, just sort of conversing and making admitted guesses. You know what does strike me though? I mentioned Share Blue. Like I said, it's a recurring theme for me. Good thing I didn't mention CORECT THE RECORD too! They might have downvoted me to -7 or -8. Ohh, the horror! Don't you assholes know I feed on the salty reeeeeee tears of libtards! Just joking, I'm pretty much non-partisan...but I probably would have voted for Bernie. Lololol....

       Assange didn't happen to hint hint Rich was his source while in the midst of trying to get Donald Trump elected over Hillary Clinton, did he? The only "big breaks" on the Rich case have been politically-motivated fake news schemes that were eventually retracted or are otherwise unverifiable. It's almost been two years and none the theories out there (particularly the one so heavily promoted around here before and after the election) have gained one aiota of credibility-- in fact, the huge claims and subsequent retractions of Fox News and others have only hurt that case.

       There's absolutely no evidence Assange was working to get Donald Trump elected.  Do you disagree that voters should be made aware of proven  political corruption that these documents reveal?

       Dougan was raided on March 15 2016.  If he did meet with Seth that early on ... whatever it was that he had... would have been before Podesta was phished and was before the DNCLeaks were acquired.
