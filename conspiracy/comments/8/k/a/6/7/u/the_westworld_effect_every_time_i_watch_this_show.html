       I've really enjoyed WestWorld for one main reason. After every single episode, and it never fails to be induced, I reach the freaky strange Unreality of our existence. I seem like a bot, as does everyone else in this fake ass simulation that is being controlled by who knows what.

       It's definitely as intense as westworld, but instead of from a robot perspective, it's about a psychic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Set in the X-men universe, but not your average  superhero show. The cinematography alone is mind blowing, let alone the story.

       I would think so, I try to be above board as much as possible but the high seas are the only way to find season one without paying for it. FXnow only has season two. And commercials :(

       Legion is great! Probably the best "superhero" tv show out there. The cinematography is
       <strong>
        insane
       </strong>
       and the exploration of a damaged mind has never been done like this before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also gets bonus points for having Aubrey Plaza in it.

       Its very well done, but I do think it may be some high level mind control. Many of themes in it are very hermetic, maybe the biggest being the machines trapped in a false paradigm, coming to an awakening then overthrowing their flawed creators.

       We are all bots living in a simulation. That's how it's always been and that's how it will always be. But hey, the computer running your robot body is all organic. No silicon boards or mass produced electronics or anything. So that's one thing that's different from that scifi show you're thinking of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if the question of free will in a deterministic world is getting you down, and you feel like a puppet on strings, I suggest you do some deeper research into those ideas. Maybe do a web search like "determinism vs free will". It's entirely possible to reconcile the idea of having free will despite the world being deterministic, people have had these ideas before and there's a lot of material exploring it. It's a popular idea in speculative fiction overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also point out that just because the way the universe works may suggest that our thoughts and actions are pre-determined, that doesn't necessarily mean that these pre-determined actions are "controlled" by any external power. Our thoughts may be pre-determined, but we each still make those choices. It's a bit like that scene in The Matrix where the Oracle tells Neo, "You've already made the choice, now you have to understand it."

       Consider the automatic behaviors and patterns of your daily life. Consider some of things you KNOW as truth, consider the paths that led you to such surety. How many times a day do you "that doesn't look like anything to me" without thought?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you ever stop at a red light at 2am on an anbandoned road? Do you ever let someone think for you? Do you ever wither before even the most powerless authority figure? Do you ever sing along to an advert jingle?  Do you ever fight for ideals that enslave you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you ever record yourself pooring ice water on your head? Do you ever go somewhere you don't want to be in order to earn the right to pay for a place to rest your head at night, so you have the energy to go back to the place you don't want to be to trade the only finite resource you have so you can do it all again tomorrow? Do you own a snowblower even though it only snows more than 3" once or twice a year? Do you ever push a bladed machine across the plant that grows in front of your house and say "what the fuk am I doing?

       Repent and believe to be saved:

      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
