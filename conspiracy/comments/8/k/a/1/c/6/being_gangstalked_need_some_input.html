    <div class="md"><p>Assuming this isn&#39;t a LARP, which I would consider more likely than not, my advice is to not let it faze you, try not to travel alone whenever possible, and document everything in-depth and objectively without sounding paranoid in the event it should be needed at a later date for legal purposes. </p>

<p>Although it may be futile, file a police report, get his license plate number, take a photo of the individual, post about it on social media and again don&#39;t let it get to you because that would be their key objective, assuming you aren&#39;t making it up and it isn&#39;t just some random manic individual with a vendetta against you. Meanwhile, don&#39;t do anything stupid, reckless or illegal, or to make yourself vulnerable and an easy target. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt your a normal guy. Sometimes the mind will do some weird stuff if it isn&#39;t getting enough of a certain chemical. This could be some real crazy legit shit you&#39;re experiencing,  but why not take the better safe than sorry route, and try to talk to a therapist/general doctor.  If they don&#39;t think there is an issue, then that only gives yourself validity something weird was up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are spiritual attacks from devils.  You could be letting them in by practicing mysticism such as meditation, astral projection, or Sorcery (pharmakeia) such as DMT, LSD, Mushrooms, Iowaska, Salvia Divinorum etc.</p>

<p>The next time you are attacked demand that these unclean spirits stop attacking you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Repent and believe to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like it could be a scene from the old Stephen King novella about &quot;Low Men In Yellow Coats&quot;, where extra-dimensional wizard-hitmen persecute Ted Braughigan for his being able to tap into the power of The Dark Tower.</p>

<p>There is only one solution.</p>

<p>Next time you see Mr Gold van Stevie, you have to kill him. Open fire. Get Sum. Gangstalkers may have magic and Deep State spy tech, but they&#39;re not bulletproof and they certainly fear death as any indivual.</p>
