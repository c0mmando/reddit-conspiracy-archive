       i had an experience a few months ago where i was convinced (still am) that my phone was listening to me (link:

       ). i just had another.
      </p>
      <p>
       i usually leave my phone in my room upstairs while i watch tv in the living room downstairs. today however, i brought it with me as i watched "the kissing booth," starring joey king and jacob elordi.
      </p>
      <p>
       after the movie, i went on my phone &amp; went onto youtube. &amp; there were about 3 videos all with joey, jacob, &amp; THE KISSING BOOTH MOVIE ITSELF. i have never searched them up or anything even close to them, yet they still appeared in my feed.
      </p>
      <p>
       not only this, but during the movie, i was talking about how cute joey would look with bangs. CAN YOU GUESS WHAT HER HAIR WAS LIKE IN THE YOUTUBE VIDEOS??
      </p>
      <p>
       i am beyond freaked.

       Man no offense, but this is getting fucking old.  You really believed two cameras, a microphone, high speed internet capability with real time gps compacted into a few inches that could fit in your pocket was all concocted for your convenience and advertisements?

       Information is power.  we are already divulging far too much in one place on a subverted platform called reddit, but do what you can to obfuscate, confuse, and poison the well.

       In 2011 large capacity hard drives were in short supply.  The NSA bought up so many to record an avalanche of data it actually affected market prices.  Itâ€™s that bad.  Yes they are watching.  Yes they are listening, and YES they are recording.

       doesn't mean you aren't able to see traffic.

       As OP pointed out, in case of real-time eavesdropping the traffic would be considerable and some wireshark nerd would most likely have found out about it by now.

       Well in terms of cost benefit for setting up this surveillance infrastructure, there should be at least two systems to justify data collection. 
One should revolve around intelligence gathering for crime prevention, measuring political opinion, tracking political dissent, personal data collection for demographic control, analysis for social experimentation etc. 
The other branch might be for making commercial messaging/company advertising, more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what it looks like, you were used for the latter category, which looks like minimal consequences will be suffered.

       It does seem illegal. Unless the cell phone comes with a disclaimer and usage agreement that discloses that it listens into your conversations.

       well, there are those notifications that come up asking for permission to use the camera &amp; microphone for videos &amp; photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       but it's assumed that the apps only use it when you use the camera. i guess not.

       Leading on from this, anyone else think their phones somehow know what you buy? If I buy an item or brand that I haven't for a long time, I'll get an ad on instagram or something for the brand...

       As someone who works in IT Security...They do. Do you have a debit/credit card? Do you purchase things online? Do you carry a cell phone with you?
These things are all linked in one way or another, and they all talk to eachother.
Target, for example, can track where you're at in their stores and see how long you stood in an area (using their cartwheel app) and then they target coupons based on that data.
You're browsing Facebook and see something interesting, say a nifty gismo one of your friends is talking about...you stop and look at it for a couple seconds...that information is tracked that you had potential interest and you will start seeing targeted advertising.

       It goes on and on. I used to be paranoid about it, and Im still consciously aware of what is being done with my digital persona, but Ive come to accept it. In the digital age we live in, the only way big brother wont directly keep tabs on you is to live in the forest with nothing but the air you breathe (But the satellites will still watch you if they care enough to)

       Wow.... that's creepy as hell. I assume it's because I have an app for my bank on my phone, though I like to think my bank wouldn't let other apps track my purchses. Huh.

       My questioning this as a conspiracy theory stopped when I said something about a cats foot in a picture looked like a rabbits foot and then got that same day just an hour or so later a petition calling for RABBITS FEET CHARMS to be taken off the market. A 70's gimmick gross thing was actually on my feed after saying the words rabbit feet in context of a CAT....Accident or design? You decide I say design. You cannot convince me that that was a coincidence...As George Clinton would say "There is no chance coincidence or accidents...Free your mind and your ass will follow"

       On phones you arenâ€™t able to see all data up/down.  You arenâ€™t charged for everything.  Speak with any Verizon/at&amp;t network engineer for details :)
