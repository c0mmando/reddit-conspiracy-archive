This is really just personal experience, but lately when I ask google a question it doesn’t answer it like it use to.  It used give me the answer to anything within the first 1 to 3 links. Now it seems like I have to search for an hour to find answers. I’m not even just talking about conspiracy stuff; it’s everything.  Is this because they promote so many things now that their search engine doesn’t work as well anymore because it’s all promotion even if it doesn’t really apply much to what you searched?  Just wondering if you guys have experienced the same thing or have any thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, in fact, <strong><em>I noticed 17 years ago</em></strong> when Google bought Deja - the hub of UseNet archives, back in 2001, renaming &quot;Google Groups&quot;, and then destroying the content:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2001/02/google-buys-deja-archive/">https://www.wired.com/2001/02/google-buys-deja-archive/</a></p>

<p>Back then, UseNet was THE Social Media hub, and Deja had a massive archive -- easily and thoroughly searched by keyword, author, group, etc. -- until the Google - the <em>&quot;Search Engine Geniuses&quot;</em> bought it.</p>

<p>The search features immediately went to SHIT. You couldn&#39;t find info on anything using the Search results of the Boogle.</p>

<p>Why? Because the MISSION of GewGel is as it has always been: To obfuscate and bury &quot;inconvenient facts&quot;, <strong><em>and to control the narrative</em></strong>.</p>

<p>It will only get worse, as GewGel continues to buy up or destroy any company that allows content that <strong><em>&quot;they&quot;</em></strong> disapprove of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example: when I search &quot;Behr paint ingredients&quot;, there will not be a single useful result that provides any information on the topic. The first results are the Material Safety Data Sheets, which were what I was looking for, but a layman could not know what that is, thus would not have access to that information.</p>

<p>No paint forum results are listed-- all sponsored results. Using brand names in search queries is now a sure-fire way to bunk results with ads. However, when one finds a paint forum or community and browses that page, one can easily find discussion on paint ingredients which do not show up on google.</p>

<p>Easy peasy! They have always controlled the information. Now its becoming increasingly obvious how valuable that info is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell yes, DejaNews was a great search engine for finding decades worth of user generated usenet content... until as you Google took it over, merged it with their own NON-usenet shit, make the search engine shit, further made the search engine shit, and now bury the  thing so deep within googles menu system that you&#39;ll never ever even find it until you know its there and are willing to work hard to find it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if it helps, I&#39;ll rant a bit more and you can give me a second upvote.  :)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Each of the major functions of Google (maps, news, videos, etc...) have their own search engine, and each is inconsistently shit at knowing what the other knows.</p>

<p>Example: If I read about something interesting happening in &quot;Puraesan&quot; then I can do a Google search and the front page knows what it is and can give me links to pages that describe the place in North Korea.</p>

<p>If I then click on the &quot;maps&quot; tab then suddenly the Google company has amnesia and no fucking idea what I&#39;m asking about and says &quot;No results found.&quot;</p>

<p>If I then MANUALLY scroll over to North Korea and try again, then miraculously the Google company&#39;s memory comes back and it knows exactly where to find the place.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Sometimes, but not always, the individual search engines are &quot;<a href="https://www.bca.uk.com/blog/Have-you-created-a-dead-end-website-Its-time-to-link-out">dead end</a>&quot; pages, but not always, just sometimes a one way street.</p>

<p>I can type a word in the main page, then click the &quot;maps&quot; tab and the word is fed into the maps search engine. But the opposite is not true. From maps, you&#39;re trapped and cant get back out.</p>

<p>You can get to news searches by clicking the &quot;news&quot; tab and continue to do more searches of news, and the top bar stays to let you get back to the main search engine... but if you actually go to the Google News page, then its a black hole that you cannot click your way out of anymore.</p>

<p>From the main search engine page to a youtube video is only one or two clicks, but if you&#39;re in youtube then you cant click back out again to the main page.</p>

<p>Its nuts. The Google company control ALL of these search engines but its like they&#39;re half disconnected, sometimes but not always.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Shifting tabs. </p>

<p>Sometimes it is &quot;Gmail images dropdown menu&quot;</p>

<p>Sometimes it is &quot;All Flights Maps News Images More&quot;</p>

<p>Sometimes it is &quot;All Maps Images News Videos More&quot;</p>

<p>Sometimes it is &quot;All Images News Videos Maps More&quot;</p>

<p>Sometimes it is who the fuck knows what combination of options in the menu bar.</p>

<p>None of this is difficult to fix, all of it is just a shit user interface, breaking &quot;good design&quot; rules that have been around since markup was first invented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was 2001. Usenet (aka &quot;newsgroups&quot;) was in the public domain (more or less) but Deja was a private company who, at the time, had become the best source for accessing the content, and it was Deja who created and hosted the massive archives, and made them searchable.</p>

<p>When Google bought Deja, they became the owners of these archives, and they promptly <em>and without warning</em> dismantled Deja&#39;s search engine, making much of the database inaccessible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that other entities such as universities also had some archives, but to my knowledge, nothing as thorough and searchable as Deja.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The early days of the net had alot of genuine red pills, as they never bothered muddying the information primarily as no-one was using the net much. I found usenet way too late me thinks, a shame we will likely never have a decent historical archive the platform had alot of interesting newsgroups.
I feel looking at most forums today and the subforums/reddits/groups they pale in comparison to the discourse and information from way back then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes indeed, for the most part, Usenet was Free Speech in the raw -- with all the &quot;good and bad&quot; that comes along with it.</p>

<p>In the early days, no moderation existed, and there was no &quot;upvoting&quot; or &quot;downvoting&quot; that could bury content -- posts appeared in chronological order, and comments were judged by each individual based on the substance of their argument, the cites they provided, and on the reputation they earned as a contributor.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t begin to put a value on the education I received by participating there --- and perhaps not surprisingly, I learned far more from the LIARS than from the straight-shooters; Researching the claims of agend-driven asshats led me down rabbit holes and into realms of the human psyche that I would never have imagined existed, and that continue to unravel to this day.</p>

<p>Yes, I am grateful for having tasted the bitter-sweet experience of Usenet. It was, for a brief time, an amazing, almost otherworldly realm wherein all were on equal footing,  and the narrative was NOT controlled by moniker Shadow Masters, but by those who could articulate their position with honesty, sincerity and veracity.</p>

<p>RIP, Usenet.</p>

One of the ways they do this is that when you search for something with (say) two search words, they show you the results of one without the other (and actually show the other crossed out).  And they do this on the FIRST PAGE OF RESULTS!!!!!</p>

<p>In other words, they appear to be saying: &quot;We found NOTHING that is relevant to both search terms.&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing? On a world-wide web with MILLIONS of pages? And they call this an &quot;improvement&quot;.</p>

<p>We have information-overload, and limiting access to right wing propaganda, jew-conspiracy theories, islamist recruiting, socialist-left wing activism, incel-women hating sites, gay/transgender degeneracy, and most half-baked conspiracy theories, will be a good thing for the country for the long run.  </p>

<p>people are idiots, and obviously can&#39;t handle the information-overload with a lack of critical thinking.  </p>

<p>We don&#39;t need to take guns away from citizens.  We just need to ban all forms of social media for anyone under 24, and limit access to the internet.  The problems of school shootings, isis recruiting, alt-right propaganda, and SJW activism all diminish by half, or more.  </p>

<p>Use private browsing features, no google products, some combination of obscure sec focused browsers with ublock origin, noscript, https always and useragent anonymizers.  You can also use a search engine anonymizer that sends random searches.  </p>

<p>ultimately you can&#39;t evade all tracking but you can evade most corporate non-nsa level tracking, and you can create blind spots in their profile out of which you can have some actual freedom.  </p>

<p>in china and russia however, this is no longer possible.  it is possible to build the internet in such a way as everything is known, and if you government wants to do this, that is a sufficient condition to know they are evil and see you only as an expendable tool.  </p>

<p>if the united states and europe go down this road, we&#39;ll be lost in history, as that will be the end of the technological lead we have attained by fostering freedom of thought.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. Worked heavily in SEO and SEM and google is heavily incentivized to provide the best user experience. I think it&#39;s more a function of the algorithm not knowing how to keep up with the recency and volume of material. When you think &quot;bad&quot; searches, I bet most of them are related to highly sensational news events. Most static subjects you search still have good results </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s very fair to argue Google has a monopolistic control on a very important arm of information dissemination. At times they can be biased, but on the whole I think it&#39;s paranoid and unfounded to say they are actively curating results in a way they want. Their product is too big by nature to even account for that, there are billions of search terms in billions of results constantly it&#39;s just not feasible on a per subject basis </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi - late to discussion, but in the 5 days since this posted, I have seen the effects dramatically, so...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why the hell did your comment get downvoted? (I see -1 for no reason I can tell)</p></li>
<li><p>Your statement &quot;Most static subjects you search still have good results&quot; - would apply to software coding??? Currently google is doing a horrible job directing me to the hundreds of top stackoverflow solutions I usually see when I type in an error snippet, for instance. Instead, the results come is as 2-3 topics with outdated and unhelpful leads, and then the search shows &quot;business level&quot; stuff. I used to get literally 3 pages of good, relevant material!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Basically the new search algorithm seems to have killed one of the driving forces of modern software development - our ability to solve tricky coding problems in seconds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The printing press allowed Martin Luther to trigger the Protestant movement by declaring the Catholic Church in apostate and then showing people it in the book.</p>

<p>Most people weren&#39;t on in the early days of the internet, and the government hadn&#39;t yet started to freak out over it. So much alt-info.</p>

<p>I&#39;m left wing, I was a writer at one point in life, so I believe freedom of speech and of the press is the most important thing. I grew up in rural England and my dad listened to the local independent radio and watched the local news (being northern I don&#39;t know if it was independent or just critical of the government to keep us voting Tory) and hanging out on 4chan before the Anonymous movement even started. I think after 7/7 I logged on on dial up to check 4chan to see what bullshit was already being burried because we were getting London feeds.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve been watching as right-wing content got burried. It increased 10 fold after pizzagate, which is what made me dig into it. And after this Qanon thing started it went into overdrive. I&#39;ve googled Breitbart articles by name and they&#39;re buried under MSM articles. Truepundit only exists in the news feed until a MSM article on the topic gets published.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started using duckduckgo for any actual research, because I can&#39;t find anything on Google. I was telling my friend about some of the Egypt discoveries like the Tomb of Osiris and that&#39;s when I find out it&#39;s burried out of existence by a &quot;replica tomb of Osiris&quot; and I had to use old Reddit posts to find the stupid dailymail article from 2 years before.</p>

<p>That one got me researching the ancient astronauts, UFO bases, and then DUMBs. Like this filter shit is dumb, it just shows confirmation bias to anyone who was suspicious. All the conspiracy communities have gone into overdrive because of it. Shit, even my mother in law asked &quot;what&#39;s the illuminati&quot; the other day because of the Taco Bell advert.</p>

<p>Like c&#39;mon guys, I liked it when I was the crazy loner not the guy with the answers. I feel like Shrek with all the magical creatures in his yard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been dumbed down. It started when they eliminated Boolean operators. Now, quotation marks don&#39;t even work reliably. People had a hard time using it and couldn&#39;t get it to return the results they wanted it to. It seems that a large number of people aren&#39;t capable of expressing their thoughts in a way that is structured or precise enough to formulate a proper query. So, in order to help them get the results they wanted, rather than the results most closely matching what they typed in, Google changed how it interprets a query. Now, it guesses what the lowest common denominator probably meant when they typed that into the search box. If you&#39;ve seen the inane things that the average person types into the Google search box and how unclearly related it is to what they actually wanted, you know what I&#39;m talking about. Many people do not seem to be capable of understanding the underlying logic. They include words that aren&#39;t really what they want. When they don&#39;t get enough results, they make their query even more specific. I suspect that these kinds of people are also the most likely to click on the ads, not even understanding that there is a difference between the real results and the advertising. Even if they weren&#39;t more likely to click on the ads, they make up a substantial portion of Gooe Search users, so Google adapted to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but now in <em>addition</em> to <em>all</em> of that, it seems to want to fight your queries if it detects or thinks your search is even slightly political or about social issues. It wants to &quot;debunk&quot; your question rather than deliver what you asked by spamming you with Buzzfeedy sites about how your imagined search term is &quot;wrong and this is why&quot;. It doesn&#39;t even have to be what you asked - it just <em>thinks</em> &quot;This is what you meant, right? Here&#39;s why you&#39;re wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>Try it. Go ask it stuff like &quot;why are neoliberals sometimes so angry&quot; or &quot;good things Trump has done&quot;. It will deliver you 2-3 pages of articles about &quot;why <em>conservatives</em> are <em>always</em> angry and dangerous&quot; and &quot;<em>worst</em> things Trump has done&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never asked those things literally but sometimes search for things based around observations that are centrist or not necessarily pro-&#39;any side&#39;. But it will refuse to let you see answers that aren&#39;t major condemnation of the worst possible interpretation of my search terms. It used to give me exactly what I wanted, my exact search term on some nice and active discussion forum where they pondered my question and came to an interesting conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that it&#39;s much more predictive. It&#39;s really noticeable after looking at a popular post on reddit.  If you read an article from a popular post and then see a term or phrase or whatever that you either don&#39;t understand or want info on, if you then start typing it on google it will often display it in the top 2 or three predictive results.</p>

<p>I guess it reads the last page you were on and then lists a search that is common from others after they looked at the same page.</p>

<p>It used give me the answer to anything within the first 1 to 3 links. Now it seems like I have to search for an hour to find answers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this <em>might</em> be a good thing. . a search algorithm ain&#39;t a magic box which knows what you are searching for so it depends on a) what other persons were searching for (i.e. what was popular), b) what you have been searching for and c) what actually mets your search criteria. (and d) which advertisments of google might fit you search parameters)</p>

<p>Now, the first questions would be: </p>

<p>1) Have my searches changed? 
2) Has my profile changed?
3) Has google changed?</p>

<p>First question is up to you, dunno what you are searching for and if you started using uncommon search parameters. </p>

<p>2) is rather easy to check: A sandboxed/incognito/TOR search compared to your normal search. </p>

<p>3) only google can answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it depends how you use it. They are moving more and more towards &quot;profiles&quot; so if you search something out of profile, your results will suffer at first. </p>

<p>Example: I like tarrots cards. I search for stuff like &quot;The hierophant&quot; regularly, google now gives me excellent results for upside down cards as well as stuff I might need to interpret. </p>

<p>But if someone else sits at my computer searching for &quot;the moon&quot; that search is going to suck, because he meant the real moon and my google account profile says &quot;the moon&quot; is likely a tarrot card. </p>

<p>Makes sense ? </p>

<p>tldr: it works if you use the account and let it know everything about you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>20 years ago, searching on the internet was magical. I would be able to enter a string of words which related to specific info I was looking for and adding, removing, or changing just one word in the string would greatly narrow down the results in extremely particular ways which resulted in being able to find very,  very specific information merely by toying with word combinations.</p>

<p>That magic started dwindling about 6 years ago.   Now,  I can&#39;t find Jack Shit using my previously successful techniques. My string of keywords is merely a suggestion now;  Google has a much better idea of what I need to see,  and gives that to me instead.   </p>

<p>Finding something on the internet takes 4 times longer than it used to. When I think my keywords can&#39;t manipulated for results any longer, I&#39;m reduced to searching deep in the many pages of search results for something I should have been able to conjure to the front page on the first try. </p>

<p>Fuck Google in the face;  they&#39;ve ruined information retrieval for the world,  and they did it on purpose. </p>

<p>The biggest problem I have is how Google really prioritizes fresh pages, the most recently posted stuff. Look at the dates of the pages it returns, all from the last few months. The internet is almost 30 years old, there&#39;s tons of more relevant content out there but Google buries it for some reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, absolutely. Google has stopped all of the things that allowed it to become the industry leader.</p>

<p>The first screen of any search is nothing but advertising. That was something Google refused to do when it first started. YouTube is the same, focusing only on advertising friendly content, when being ad free was what made YouTube popular in the first place.</p>

<p>To be fair, I rely heavily on Google&#39;s other functions in my job as an attorney. Google scholar has a repository of every published opinion that saves me loads of time and money not having to pay a publisher like Westlaw or go to a law library to do research. And Google street view lets me learn all sorts of things about distant accident scenes from my desk. But the search function is garbage. I go to Google knowing what I want to find, or I don&#39;t find it.</p>

<p>For instance, when I was looking for the NBA draft lottery time (&quot;What time is the NBA draft lottery tonight?&quot;), it would bring up all these pages with the title &quot;NBA Draft Lottery - Time, Date, Predictions&quot; etc. Then when I click it, it&#39;s a bunch of shit with the information I&#39;m looking for buried in there somewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair to Google, it is in their best interest to provide results that are as relevant as possible. I think part of the issue is that sites have gotten very good at ensure their content is visible in googles search results. They are gaming the search algorithm so that it displays their pages even if they aren&#39;t the most relevant. </p>

<p>Google is constantly adjusting the algorithm to weed out black hat tactics. Link directories used to be a big thing but now google does not give back links from link directories much weight. Key word stuffing also used to be effective. Now with Googles emphasis on organic content, it&#39;s much harder to boost your rank without considerable effort. Unfortunately, massive corporations and news outlets have the time and resources to produce content across all their pages and monopolize search results. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Searches on Civil Forfeiture in Canada and the US used to have many many stats and articles of excess. Until 2014. That&#39;s when all the results changed to laws about or lawyers. All the statistics and stories of abuses all disappeared. They are not even on the 40th page. They have just vanished. You can do the search yourself today and see that there is no statistics or stories of abuses. Each Province in Canada has stolen $44 million since 2001. A kid smoked a joint and the cops came back a year later and seized the car and the parents house without laying a single charge. Cops robbing people on the side of the road at traffic stops with any money in their pockets. It hasn&#39;t stopped they just hid the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google is increasingly applying the CIA&#39;s &quot;need to know&quot; mentality to people&#39;s searches.<br/>
As far as they&#39;re concerned, all you need to know is the latest Amazon sales, the latest pop songs &amp; celebrity gossip and the latest MSM/CIA narrative you&#39;re supposed to adopt.<br/>
Any other information is there to maintain a facade of unrestricted information access.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
They removed a lot of the advanced search syntax as well, making it even more evident that they support a dumbed-down ultra-consumer society with people just smart enough to run the approved machines, write the approved code, invent the improved inventions and discover the approved discoveries.<br/>
If you try to use the remaining advanced syntax, you typically get flagged for suspicious behavior after a few searched and a CAPTCHA pops up.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
Google also has billions of old web pages cached which it will not let us search. They have unlimited access to the world&#39;s Internet history forever, while we have access to a tiny filtered fraction of it.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
Also, search for <strong><em>fuck google</em></strong> and see what comes up near the top. A video that says Google is run by ni**ers. It&#39;s been coming up for a couple of years. They want want to give the impression that people who are oppose to Google are hateful, ignorant or racist. Legitimate <em>fuck google</em> criticisms that used to be near the top are now buried further down (if they appear at all).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed this too- As others have mentioned, it might have something to do with the search terms being used, or it might have something to do with how google attempts to tailor your search results based what you&#39;ve searched for before. on as others have mentioned, but I&#39;m more apt to believe it has more to do with the concept of &quot;relevance&quot; within the sub-field of information science called &quot;information retrieval&quot; (IR).</p>

<p>The recent decline of &quot;relevant&quot; search results retrieved by google might have something about google&#39;s algorithm scraping pages and pages of unstructured data + the exponential growth of unstructured data + the manpower and training it takes takes to structure data properly so that it can be identified and retrieved by google&#39;s (or any) algorithm. Too much post-coordinate indexing, not enough pre-coordinate indexing, perhaps. </p>

<p>Culturally, I imagine there continues to be too much of a disconnect between the fields of computer science and information science. </p>

<p>We tend to forget that successful coding depends on correct language/syntax <em>and</em> the complete and correct data structures. It notoriously difficult to create consistent standardized metadata. Web developers can exploit this inconsistency, gaming the system, so to speak, so that some pages can appear, to a computer, as more relevant than others, despite human determination of the contrary.</p>

<p>In a lot of ways it&#39;s better there are way less ads, it&#39;s easier for me to find things Im searching for, and the biggest thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the &quot;shopping&quot; option dosent show up so if I look up &quot;lawnmower&quot; they won&#39;t be giving me deals for buying a lawnmower in HK</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I just did a test of Google&#39;s image search function that I&#39;d like to share but I don&#39;t know that this is the best subreddit.</p>

<p>Basically, I was trying to find an image I saw probably over a year ago of a woman laughing out loud because a cat has poked its head out from between her thighs. Visual pun. My results came back with nothing relevant until at least the third row, and even then not the photo I was looking for. Lots of cats, no surprise. Some smiles, a few people laughing but without animals, men, a man with a woman in his lap, a woman wearing a Christmas hat holding a cat, a kid with a cat, scenes from black &amp; white movies (no animals), women dancing, a few shots of women smiling with cats on their laps (but not laughing) and a man sitting at a laptop with a bottle of booze and a gun on the table.</p>

<p>I just want to rant about it.</p>

<p>Use private browsing features, no google products, some combination of obscure sec focused browsers with ublock origin, noscript, https always and useragent anonymizers.  You can also use a search engine anonymizer that sends random searches.  </p>

<p>ultimately you can&#39;t evade all tracking but you can evade most corporate non-nsa level tracking, and you can create blind spots in their profile out of which you can have some actual freedom.  </p>

<p>in china and russia however, this is no longer possible.  it is possible to build the internet in such a way as everything is known, and if you government wants to do this, that is a sufficient condition to know they are evil and see you only as an expendable tool.  </p>

<p>if the united states and europe go down this road, we&#39;ll be lost in history, as that will be the end of the technological lead we have attained by fostering freedom of thought.  </p>
