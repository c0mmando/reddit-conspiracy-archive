Our career politicians probably have a high presence in the dark government orgamizations that are being exposed daily. To reveal their names makes them worthless to their masters as they will be voted out of positions of power. Also, the fake shootings will pick up pace as misdirection to keep the population from seeing the true evil masters and their agendas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it happens get yourself a King James Bible (probably will be banned soon after), repent and start reading/praying and die for Jesus Christ&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much easier to just be part of the catching away by repenting today and believing the gospel:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>We are all sinners heading to a lake of fire.  The only way to be pardoned is to receive the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ via his blood atonement.  You receive that when you repent and believe the above gospel.  Nothing a person does saves them.  Not water baptism, not being a good person, not going to Church.  Only what Jesus Christ did saves us.</p>

<p>Cicero was assassinated. Old John boy thinks he’s being clever. It’s too late for these fucks though.

<p>I think you should pay more attention to the quote than the history of who made it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One possible scenario is a tsunami caused by volcanic activity in Hawaii. If it reaches California, we&#39;re talking about trillions of dollars of damage.</p>

<p>The thing is: It&#39;s not this physical tragedy that would constitute the real catastrophe. It would be the collapse of the insurance companies (whose Ponzi scheme would be exposed by the event), which would cause a domino-effect across the rest of the fragile economic system.</p>

<p>The banks would start to fall, one by one.</p>

<p>The dollar would collapse. And the entire world would be plunged into Instant Depression. Wars would break out, left and right, as the weakened U.S. would not have the capacity to stop them.</p>

<p>Catalonia would break off from Spain. Scotland would secede from Great Britain. Quebec would chip off from Canada.</p>

<p>Domestically (inside the U.S.) riots would debilitate the government as the food stamps dried up and the EBT cards ceased working.</p>

<p>At the present time, we only have a sum total of 3 million law enforcement personnel (including all police forces, sheriff&#39;s departments, national guard, army, navy, marines, etc.) Only 3 million!</p>

<p>We&#39;d have enough people to lock down a mere 6 U.S. cities. The rest of the country would experience massive riot, looting and crime. The State would be powerless to protect its own people. Which will lead to vigilante militias, and a breakdown of civil order.</p>

<p>The scary thing is: This could all be touched off by a tsunami that reaches California (like the one a few years back that devastated Indonesia.) And it&#39;s not far-fetched, unfortunately (given the activity that&#39;s currently taking place in Hawaii.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always have that feeling, it is especially strong this year. However you need to learn to control your anxiety - as that shit isn’t healthy in large doses. Always being alert is helpful, over time the anxiety will subside. Also - don’t deny yourself R and R just because you are concerned some things may go down. Just be prepared for the shit to fly and you’ll be ok - have a plan in place and somewhere to go that is not in or near a major city. then go about the rest of your business as if something wasn’t about to happen. The city is the LAST place on earth you want to be when the shit flies - you will not be able to get out. If you have to be in the city for work so be it, but try not to live in the city or at least be ready to bolt with a bag packed (with some bottled water and non perishable food) and easily accessible to you. In the event of an emergency you will not be permitted to remain in your home (FEMA), so you will need to be able to sustain yourself long enough to get to your designated “bug out” location. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im so confused why so many responses to this are “no, you’re completely misguided” and “people say this here daily” (they don’t) and the meant to demean “it’s my hamsters b-day,”
Like if you don’t think so and you don’t care and you don’t agree then why the fuck are you going to the trouble of responding ? </p>

<p>Could you be trying to diminish the impact when the shit hits the fan?</p>

<p>You have a vast majority of Music, Tv, Internet and films all located on that coast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it happens get yourself a King James Bible (probably will be banned soon after), repent and start reading/praying and die for Jesus Christ&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much easier to just be part of the catching away by repenting today and believing the gospel:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>We are all sinners heading to a lake of fire.  The only way to be pardoned is to receive the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ via his blood atonement.  You receive that when you repent and believe the above gospel.  Nothing a person does saves them.  Not water baptism, not being a good person, not going to Church.  Only what Jesus Christ did saves us.</p>
