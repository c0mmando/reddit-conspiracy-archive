        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I fear I may end up getting banned for even saying this, but what the hell is happening.  I usually don&#39;t make many posts and just lurk on this subreddit, but I felt like I really needed to post something about this.</p>

<p>I first want to say that I am not a huge fan of Qanon personally.  But to be honest my opinion of him is irrelevant to what is happening here.</p>

<p>Second I want to clarify, I am not trying to attack this mod, but it feels like a clear abuse of power here.  If he/she wants to post as a user on this sub, that&#39;s fine, but why are they posting with the moderator flair and why has it been stickied for 3 days?  Completely unnecessary.  It&#39;s been up for 3 days and has BELOW 0 POINTS.  Obviously this is not something the community wants to see at the top of the subreddit.........</p>

<p>Now on to the thread itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although content from both QAnon and InfoWars doesn&#39;t get much play on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, recent events have been intriguing enough to warrant further discussion on this forum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is honestly a joke.  As was clearly shown by this exchange here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8jguqa/no_meta_qanon_infowars_alternative_media/dyzmw68/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8jguqa/no_meta_qanon_infowars_alternative_media/dyzmw68/</a></p>

<p>OP asks for a source and is given 10 direct post of Q claims made on this sub with tons of upvotes/comments.  </p>

<p>I feel like I am taking crazy pills over here Jesus Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m with you, I was banned for suggesting that a post put in by that mod of a political nature was a smokescreen. I asked the different mod who banned me why, very cordially and explained I didn’t understand sliding in the context of a comment “It was a smokescreen “.
I then looked it up on the sidebar and replied to the mod that I had looked it up, but still didn’t understand the context. I asked them to please let me know when I was unbanned. The muted me from asking anymore questions of the Mods. When I was unbanned I was told I had attacked the Mod and if I did it again I was outta here. I thought it was unusual, but I have noticed a big difference in this sub since the 2016 elections (no matter who you supported).
Either way TLDR:</p>

<p>I’ll keep enjoying the cool threads, but I’m unsure of the direction of this sub and whether or not after this post I will be allowed to participate.
I’ve got my political bent and you have yours, but just the vitriol in the discussion of open ideas on this sub has me wondering. I think I’d rather go fishing.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the election really was a big turning point for the sub, I&#39;ve always been outspokenly liberal but I was raised by and grew up surrounded by conservatives so I&#39;ve always enjoyed the discussions between opposing ideals, and that used to be the norm around here, there were crazies on both sides but for the most part everyone was just hear to talk about the shit no one else would. Now it&#39;s like everyone is just here to prove how much more woke they are than the other team and it&#39;s suffocating discussion on the sub. Im in the same boat of enjoying the few threads that do pop up nowadays but I really don&#39;t see how the sub will come back from where it&#39;s gotten to.</p>

<p>Something like that - I don&#39;t know the specifics but it&#39;s not as black and white as saying &quot;150 votes always ranks higher than 17&quot;. Because you&#39;re only seeing the amount of points it has, not the ratio of upvote to downvote (like you can see on YouTube for example).</p>

<p>If you sort by controversial you will most likely find that that the comment with 150 is more &quot;controversial&quot; according to Reddit than the comment with only 17 upvotes because... something to do with the ratio of ups to downs.</p>

<p>It was brigaded by the Top Minds, so you can&#39;t blame the community here on that one. Personally, I enjoy Q posts and I dislike that they consistently get downvote brigaded by Top Minds. The only solution is to sticky them occasionally, which is why I&#39;m ok with it.</p>

And he doesn&#39;t say how rationally discussing that topic, or really any topic, discredits a conspiracy forum.  And who cares about &quot;credit&quot;?  I don&#39;t think discussion forums are for looks or seemliness, it&#39;s for figuring things out.  </p>

<p>That is probably true but it doesn&#39;t matter. If certain topics are downvoted, some people will say that it&#39;s only downvoted from brigaders. &quot;Real users&quot; as they like to call them wouldn&#39;t downvote a thread about [Topic X]. There are some things here that certain prominent users don&#39;t like to see reach the front page of this subreddit. Why do you think it is that threads about Obama or Hillary are never placed in contest mode or have &quot;prominent users&quot; proclaiming that it&#39;s been brigaded, but it&#39;s likely that if a thread that makes Trump look bad gains traction it will be put into contest mode? Think about it.</p>

<p>Can you give some examples?</p>

<p>Did Trump pay off a British spy to collect &quot;intelligence&quot; from Russian agents? Or was that choice #2 in the election?</p>

<p>So, there&#39;s your choice. We know for a fact that Hillary Clinton colluded with Russian agents in an attempt to damage her political opponent. This isn&#39;t a conspiracy theory. She did that. 100%.</p>

<p>We do not know if Trump did the same, although it&#39;s safe to say that he did not. His entire campaign was spied upon - he has had the world&#39;s journalists digging up anything they can find for about 3 years - he has been under investigation by the most powerful, unrestrained investigative body there is for a year, and... nothing.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We know Hillary Clinton colluded with Russian agents and other foreign spies in an attempt to win the election. It&#39;s more than likely that Trump did not. Your choice.</p>

You don&#39;t like a subject so it shouldn&#39;t be stickied? That&#39;s complete arrogance.

    <div class="md"><p>This is simple though: Trump is not a conspirator where as Hillary and Obama are. The establishment is who this sub was designed to go after, because the establishment is the main facet of the conspiracy itself! Here we have a man who is undoing that by making peace with North Korea or by not entering the TPP. A man who destroyed the Iran Deal and fought back socialistic healthcare... The list goes on and on. </p>

<p>Quite frankly, if your conspiracy theory is about Donald Trump; it&#39;s more than likely wrong unless it includes him taking down the Deep State. (Hillary, Soros, Halper, Brennan, Obama, The Rothschilds, ect...) ALL of those people HATE Trump and have invested billions into destroying him. ALL of those people are in the Deep State, too...</p>

No major heads will roll, Trump will just follow their playbook to build his own Dynasty. Mark my words, Trump is no friend of the common man. He&#39;s a greedy opportunistic deep state firster and Zionist water carrier. You really think he gives a fuck about us?</p>

<p>John F. Kennedy. </p>

<p>You need someone who has seen the inner workings of the Deep State in order to destroy it. His legacy was insured, by running for president against the Deep state, he put that same legacy in jeopardy. He put his whole family in jeopardy. He has destroyed much of what the Deep State has worked towards in the last two decades in a little under a year and a half; and it seems he&#39;s not stopping there, either! You can peddle this theory; but recent events within North Korea(to give a single example) have proven it to be incorrect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If nothing else, Q is probably the biggest thing to happen to conspiracy since, wow, I don&#39;t know.  Something between 9/11 and Q maybe, but it&#39;s huge deal in conspiracy right now.<br/>
I&#39;d like to think I see some of the &quot;wisdom&quot; of Q, but even if I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of Q, I think a sticky for 3 days is hardly anything earth shattering.  There&#39;s plenty of posts I never bother to look at because they don&#39;t interest me.  For instance, I hardly ever click on the stickied Roundtable discussion, nor the documentary discussion.<br/>
So I guess I&#39;m wondering what the point of your post was?   Just to say please delete the sticky so it doesn&#39;t take up real estate on your mobile device screen when you open the sub?  Because you have to scroll one more mouse wheel turn?  lol I mean come on.  What is your actual point then?  I not sure if you ever get that far, the closest you get is &quot;this is honestly a joke&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna ask if you can separate yourself from how you personally feel about Q and the legitimacy/veracity of his posts for a second.  </p>

<p>This is about a couple of things:
1. It was posted by a moderator of this sub WITH the mod flair.  I don&#39;t care if that mod has a different opinion than me on a subject, but when a post is made with the mod flair I expect it to be a mod doing something mod related.
2. By keeping it up for 3 days, he is basically pushing his opinion/agenda on us even though you can clearly see from the comments in the thread that his opinion is in the minority.
3. While you personally may not click on the sticky posts, they automatically get more visibility and views by being at the top of all users pages.
4. It has below 0 votes.  The community doesn&#39;t want it there.</p>

<p>I hope you can see what about this that made me upset.  I would have been just as angry if I saw a mod sticky some anti trump post for 3 days.  It&#39;s not about the subject matter, it&#39;s about the manner in which it happened and an agenda trying to be pushed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I don&#39;t really speak to Q&#39;s veracity, that&#39;s for everyone to decide for themselves.<br/>
1.  He&#39;s a mod on a conspiracy subreddit.  Again, with arguably the biggest thing to happen to conspiracy in decades.  It should be stickied.<br/>
2. Everyday, the conversation is growing.  I personally haven&#39;t been in that sticky for the past few days, but new replies are happening.  The discussion is not over yet.  So why would it get unstickied?  If nothing else, the normal time for stickies is 7 days.  So if day 10 rolls around and it&#39;s still up I&#39;ll agree with you.<br/>
3. So again, you&#39;re upset you have to scroll one more post?<br/>
4. Bots maybe?  Or just people with a knee jerk reaction such as yourself?  You&#39;re right in that this sub is mostly anti Q.  But discourse must still happen.  </p>

<p>I get where you&#39;re coming from, I&#39;ve had meta ideology/habits differences with a few subs.  You know what I did?  Clicked Unsubscribe.  Waited a few months and the idiocy died down so I resubscribed.  Please don&#39;t take this how I think you&#39;re going to take this that I&#39;m gatekeeping lol.  Just you know, if it bothers you that much, for your own sanity, you should stay away from things that upset you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so I am gonna try to respond unemotionally to what you and <a href="/u/WeaknessExitsTheBody">/u/WeaknessExitsTheBody</a> just said...and maybe it&#39;s partially my fault for using Antarctica as an example, as I should&#39;ve assumed anything I said was going to be nitpicked.  </p>

<p>Having said that, I think that you are both misrepresenting what I have a problem with.  If you read my response to <a href="/u/troy_caster">/u/troy_caster</a> you can see that I was not even speaking to the validity of Q, but rather the manner in which the information was presented a la forcing it down users throats and with the flair of a mod and stickied.</p>

<p>So the way you responded without the mod flair is great.  I welcome the discourse and discussion so that we can both present our points of view as users of this subreddit and not a person shaping the manner in which the subreddit is ran.  As some one who also moderates a very large cryptocurrency slack/discord community, I understand that my personal biases and opinions need to be separated from managing the community and not pushing my own agenda.</p>

<p>I also think that the way you responded with &quot;well obviously you&#39;re just not as woke as me&quot; is the other part of the problem.  It&#39;s the same thing that people give &quot;god damn liberals&quot; shit for, ie their opinion is right and all other opinions are just not as informed as them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like Q because I personally believe what he is doing is similar to how psychics/mediums do their dirty work.  (Ie, tapping into peoples emotions and saying things they want to hear while making them disregard all the inaccuracies).  When you come in and condescend to someone from a &quot;not as woke as me&quot; perspective then you are putting yourself in the same bubble as the people you condescend to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah my goal is to separate the belief in Q factor from the equation here.  While I personally don&#39;t believe it, I am not going to step on the opinions of some one who does.  I just don&#39;t want something jammed down my throat and that&#39;s what it seems like is happening here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take you at your word, as unbelievable as it seemingly is.</p>

<p>So your saying since 2001 to 2017. Not one of the mass school shootings, wikileak releases, Snowden, Rich, The email servers, The Cunt Foundation, Haiti, Manchester, Paris, London, Belgium, Vegas, Batman, Orlando, The Airports and any other of the numerous &#39;terrorist&#39; or &#39;madman&#39; murders PLUS the many more  events I haven&#39;t listed. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t not feel that you&#39;re taking the piss for there&#39;s examples above that are 100% proven to be true  and factual. Admittedly the others are on the level of Q, but we have visual evidence and records of the the event to analyse at least. We probably may never find out but I&#39;m positive some will have been nothing but smoke and mirrors, some will have been false flags(r.i.p) and others just fair dinkum tragedies(r.i.p).</p>

<p>You consider a faceless individual who speaks in disingenuous riddles  to be the biggest thing since The Beatles? If true, then fair enough, but fuck me I&#39;ll NEVER in 10000 years understand that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I left it open to interpretation.  You suggesting that me saying that Q is a big deal means that none of these other things have caught my attention is a bit misleading.  Not sure how to respond to that other than, yes some things you list have caught my attention as well.<br/>
Let&#39;s pretend we&#39;re talking about sports.  Q. Anon, is one of the fastest Quarterbacks to reach 10,000 yards or batters to hit 1000 base hits if you prefer baseball.  And he did this all in his rookie year lol.  It&#39;s a big deal.  Have other quarterbacks eclipsed the 10,000 yards?  Sure.  That&#39;s the only point I make.  Apologies for the sports anthologies.  I&#39;m not here to convince you he&#39;s real, merely that it&#39;s a big deal.  Like a really big deal.  You tell me what you think is the biggest thing out of what you just listed, I&#39;d like to know.<br/>
haha I never said Q was bigger than the Beatles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey mate, I didn&#39;t intend to insinuate that nothing else has caught your attention as such, I was just surprised that dating back to 9/11 you consider Q anon to be the biggest conspiracy in the 17 years that have since passed. </p>

<p>Like a lot of people I followed Q for the first few day&#39;s, followed up a week later with a quick recap and then concluded I&#39;d rather spend my time on other things. In all honesty I wasn&#39;t aware until earlier this week that he/she was still operating. I&#39;m just as equally unaware of the relevant accomplishments that have been witnessed  to be fittingly bestowed of said sporting analogy&#39;s? I did just spend 10min on bit of a search to enlighten myself but discovered literally.....nothing. </p>

<p>What mystifies me, all things considered with my following points is how anyone can believe its anything but a game to some bored mother fucker. I understand it&#39;s thought to be an &#39;insider&#39; close to Trump? So we&#39;re meant to believe Trump finds it acceptable behavior and let&#39;s it carry on, right? If I was a supporter I&#39;d be disgusted with such behavior, it&#39;s insulting not to mention embarrassing when you consider the contempt he considers is appropriate for followers, not to mention how it reflects on him. If that&#39;s not enough there&#39;s the saying, &#39;actions speak louder than words&#39;. Weighing up those facts it fails me how people can still believe it&#39;s legit. In case anyone does, the final nail in the coffin must surely be their awareness that Q has an incessant need and total aversion towards constructing clear, concise and properly structured sentences. Talking in riddles say&#39;s it fucking all at the end of the day, it leaves the whole post open to interpretation for the fact is the poster is making educated guesses. A broken clock tell the right time twice day. It&#39;s all nonsensical lunacy wrapped up in some charade.</p>

<p>I consider wikileaks to be the stand out selection among those examples. Being it&#39;s the computer age now, what was impossible 35+ years ago is now a possibility, they&#39;ve provided real actual proof behind conspiracy&#39;s, no government has come out in denial adding further weight behind their legitimacy, numerous government figures have called for his life and patriotic respect. In second place is the Cunton Foundation and their shameful disgusting behavior in Haiti. And third place, for what appears as total bullshit fuckery is the Manchester Ariana Grande Bombing.......notable exceptions are quite a few of  the others.</p>

<p>If any of the Haikus indicate that the Clinton Crime Family will hang in the gallows, I wouldn&#39;t just be happy to be wrong about Qanon, I&#39;d be over the moon!</p>

<p>Bullshit like &#39;Qanon&#39; allows these mental midgets to feel as though they have <em>proof</em> to support their conspiratorial beliefs.</p>

<p>If there were a r/conspiracy only for people above 115 IQ, any mention of &#39;Qanon&#39; would be laughed at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on the original discord - where being a MK survivor I was appalled that no one was being objective and considering  Just Objectively -the direction was obviously being set -having being subjected to an actual covertly run mind altering experience as a child w/ all that entails ( I hope I don’t have to go into detail but I was a kiddy pornstar&amp; when I tried to get out was accused of everything done to me ) WAS I BEING ACTIVATED? Probably- but the everyone else was being programmed &amp; Without a doubt( being in MKSEARCH wasn’t all bad I was given an education no one can imagine I say this because of some of the Amanda work that came out of it like the Remote viewing &amp; Gateway Jazz ) regardless - the community wasn’t stopping  harassing me to tears on a daily basis till I couldn’t take it anymore/ I was later asked ,on another discord to join a discord where there was a room for “survivors” &amp; TI’s I never used RedSaturnalia or any SocialEngineeringMeeds till then (hmmm?suspicious?) nevertheless I kept all the discord links and I have noticed a new set of players on most all the different discord’s? Coincidence? There’s a enough info on the Web on Corsi &amp; InfluxWars but not on these new players but there soon will be - hopefully anyone with a little more than 2 eyes can see that we are all being primed for war - a war for everyone everywhere to end all wars the disarming crap is just one of millions of primers ! The difficult part for me/us is that I was told would happen as a child in this institution where the past 30 years have had the appearance of being totally scripted long long ago - perhaps in a another galaxy-as well ( who knows ? I remember that’s all but then when bla bla bla happens &amp; then we would bring in Apocalyptic Appraisers to assess thee situation for “you know who to come back as one “ for all religions by 2020 - 
“For those of you who do not understand the meaning of these words you will be ignorant of their implication “ 
As for those that obviously are here that presently do I think we should all meet at a fresh water source and start a forever offline community in the woods - a found a new settlement based on ethics and principles-? We are not masters of all we survey ! Here in the US+A there are tons of UN-SURVEY-ABLE lands !
Otherwise I don’t think “they” have changed the Process/Program ...... do you ?</p>
