<p>The LA congressional candidate harassing a trans woman in a bathroom.</p>

<p>An MSN story about how depression is on the rise in the US.</p>

<p>A US Navy doctor talking about Gina Haspel.</p>

<p>A website about opinions on the golden rule.</p>

<p>A video of a record album from 1999.</p>

<p>An article from HuffPost about how the rich are screwing us over.</p>

<p>A video of the volcano in Hawaii. </p>

<p>And even certain posts about the school shooting (the ones that simply post the news with no claims of a conspiracy).</p>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, I&#39;ve just noticed a <em>whole lot more</em> posts where my reaction is &quot;Okay, yeah, but where&#39;s the conspiracy? Where&#39;s the <em>secret</em> that someone is trying to hide from the public?&quot;</p>

<p>Just wondering if any other long time posters and lurkers have noticed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to realize that there is a large percentage of the people here who believe that TPTB control everything. Every little event is part of some massive conspiracy that involves a ridiculous number of people coordinating everything without a single one of them really having a conscious that would think these types of acts are disgusting.</p>

<p>To them, these stories are all part of the big conspiracy, as demonstrated by the user you are responding to. It&#39;s not so conspiracy to water down the sub, I believe it was the inevitable direction of this sub based on the fact that the theories posted here and upvoted don&#39;t need to be based on anything substantial, but simply a creative way to explain how some event fits a desired narrative.</p>

<p>Far too often, the approach here is backwards. It&#39;s not &quot;Does this event justify my hypothesis&quot; but &quot;how can I make this event fit my hypothesis?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s almost like there should be more megathreads with posts on similar topics? IDK</p>

<p>I definitely think its due to the increased popularity of this sub. (I&#39;m new-ish here myself). </p>

<p>But for example: Any link about Gina Haspel&#39;s dangerous confirmation could be compiled into a megathread. Only problem with that would be decreased ability to discuss the issue (harder to find comments..etc). </p>

<p>Another potential solution is that posts should not be just links to articles but the user should themselves write up why it is a conspiracy. I think this is what the submission statements are for, but maybe making it a bit more rigorous? </p>

<p>Food for thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe a conspiracy theory is &quot;legit&quot; when there&#39;s enough backing proof to at least add plausible questioning to an otherwise &quot;regular&quot; event. E.g. there&#39;s lots of pieces of proof that some weird, to say the least, things went down before/during/after 9/11, therefore making it a legit conspiracy theory, even though you may agree or disagree with it on a personal level.    </p>

<p>There has also been a rise of &quot;fake&quot; conspiracy theories (for lack of a better word) in the sub as well, though, which are just wild speculation and randomly connecting dots without any sort of evidence behind it. Those, I deem unnecessary and distracting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without doubt there&#39;s more &#39;news&#39; type posts here, which imo is largely unavoidable due to it&#39;s medium as forum, it&#39;s intent and purpose and the sheer volume of traffic it attracts.</p>

<p>If it was to be policed and operated in a manner so that it resembled a bona fide conspiracy forum in it&#39;s more pure sense. Members would need not visit more than once a week to consume the half dozen or so new threads that might be lucky to be posted. For that it requires &#39;larger&#39; type events and then time for those willing who are willing and able to piece together an opposing narrative to what is sold to the mainstream.</p>

<p>Mid/Late 90&#39;s to early 00&#39;s was the real golden age thanks to the brand new opportunity the internet offered for material to be spread far and wide with ease. A lot of the sites I recall have long gone but it was dominated by freelance journalist, shills and disinfo agents publishing any number of articles of various subjects, yahoo groups come about a little later and then the forums. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I can&#39;t help anyone with direct links, but for those bemoaning the lack of classic conspiracy type material I&#39;d highly suggest trawling through search engines for the journalist, shill and disinfo agent personal web sites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK; I&#39;ll take the bait here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The LA congressional candidate harassing a trans woman in a bathroom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>meh... this probably relates to the MSM distraction thing, which itself relates to the idea of humanity being dumbed down ( ie smart enough to operate the machines but not enough to think ) The transgender thing tho relates to the idea that &quot;the elite&quot; have been doing their best to pervert and twist the natural principle of gender... it&#39;s a bit woo for me, but I could see this being used as an example. Or it could touch on the golden classic idea of just general political corruption... politicians getting away with whatever... who knows. that just a guess based off your headline.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An MSN story about how depression is on the rise in the US.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK this is easy; surely you know about the profitability of legal drugs in America right? I could take this title to probably mean something about SSRIs, maybe the opiod epidemic, maybe the shooter connection to depression/prescriptions (notice anymore of that lately?), maybe it&#39;s a native ad for an anti-depressant (which would touch on the idea of social media manipulation or astroturfing) But then again, the title itself isn&#39;t suprising at all; most of us lead hopeless empty lives with nothing but our phones and screens to save us from oblivion...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A US Navy doctor talking about Gina Haspel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>c&#39;mon bro you aren&#39;t even trying. Gina haspel is in line to be the head of the CIA, <em>and</em> she&#39;s all over torture. Fuck even Snowden <em>tweeted</em> about it. (she&#39;s probably into BDSM i bet [note the author is attempting satire here, please no black bag in the night])</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A website about opinions on the golden rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck man that one&#39;s hard...i haven&#39;t participated in (thus far, to my knowledge) any of these threads... does it mean the golden rule like that Jesus cat or like the ratio? If jesus; there&#39;s an obvious effort to obfuscate <em>the message</em>. I won&#39;t even comment further on that. If it&#39;s the ratio; I&#39;d probably like to read that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A video of a record album from 1999.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bet it&#39;s some kind of pop-culture reference to &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; or some shit that could easily be interpreted as anti-establishment or &quot;fight the power&quot; type shit. again, no idea, just off your titles. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>An article from HuffPost about how the rich are screwing us over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK at this point I think your entire premise is completely disingenuous. This is the whole of this whole thing, holmes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A video of the volcano in Hawaii</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this could be about how the MSM shapes our perception (due to the lack of coverage I&#39;ve seen on MSM) or if you want to get a bit woo you could take about earth changes and use this as a likely example.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And even certain posts about the school shooting </p>
</blockquote>

<p>eh again these are examples... school shootings are rife with &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; ... too easy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Okay, yeah, but where&#39;s the conspiracy? Where&#39;s the secret that someone is trying to hide from the public?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I don&#39;t believe this is a good-faith argument. Nothing in this reality can be so isolated as to not effect the things around it. <em>Context</em>, homie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m by no means trying to minimize the sheer scale of the manipulation here and other social media platforms, I&#39;m of the opinion most of those submissions are likely from new subscribers.  You know, the people opening their eyes to the world and going, &quot;Hey, maybe those conspiracy nuts I ignored when I was younger had a point; something&#39;s not adding up here.&quot;</p>

<p>So they come to this subreddit and they&#39;re not patient enough to lurk but maybe they go to the top posts of all time here and see they&#39;re 90% politically-charged submissions due to the aforementioned manipulation.</p>

<p>So they&#39;re still subscribed to world news or politics or the_donald, or getting their news from mainstream sources.  But now that&#39;s not doing it.  They&#39;ve peeled behind the curtain and want to hear the conspiracy angles for what&#39;s currently in the MSM news cycle.  So someone submits it here even if it doesn&#39;t really fit the theme of the sub.</p>

<p>This change isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing - it has good aspects as well as bad - but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with 600k+ subscribers isn&#39;t the same as when it had 60k.</p>

<p>tl;dr: The demographics of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have shifted as the number of subscribers increased, resulting in a more diluted subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to realize that there is a large percentage of the people here who believe that TPTB control everything. Every little event is part of some massive conspiracy that involves a ridiculous number of people coordinating everything without a single one of them really having a conscious that would think these types of acts are disgusting.</p>

<p>To them, these stories are all part of the big conspiracy, as demonstrated by the user you are responding to. It&#39;s not so conspiracy to water down the sub, I believe it was the inevitable direction of this sub based on the fact that the theories posted here and upvoted don&#39;t need to be based on anything substantial, but simply a creative way to explain how some event fits a desired narrative.</p>

<p>Far too often, the approach here is backwards. It&#39;s not &quot;Does this event justify my hypothesis&quot; but &quot;how can I make this event fit my hypothesis?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>all systems are interconnected. these kinds of things are all data for the set; if we can&#39;t see their context the points become irrelevant.</p>

<p>tbh, I don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; these posts... &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; could just as easily be called History. Even the very heart of MSM distrust comes from connecting dots, looking at and seeing other sources, etc... </p>

<p>How can we be expected to take OP seriously?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t that its hard to weed through posts which pique my interest, its that I don&#39;t come here for crossposts from politics, T_D etc. The point of my comment wasn&#39;t even about that - I believe if you saturate the sub with enough BS, you can shift the topics a sub talks about.</p>
