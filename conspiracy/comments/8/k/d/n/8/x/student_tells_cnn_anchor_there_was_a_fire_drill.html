       Student: We assembled outside for a fire drill, then we heard gunshots
      </p>
      <p>
       A Santa Fe High School student described the moment they all heard gunshots.
      </p>
      <p>
       "So, it was just a normal-like class day. We all were doing our work in first period. And then all of a sudden like it's a fire drill," 14-year-old junior Angelica Martinez said.
      </p>
      <p>
       "So we followed the fire drill procedures. And then we went outside. Like we were all standing there, but not even five minutes later, we all start hearing gunshots."
That's when everybody starts running, she said, despite teachers telling them to "stay put."
      </p>
      <p>
       "But we're all just running away."

       Can’t confirm the timeline but a student told KTRK-TV that his friends saw a shooter with a shotgun so they pulled the fire alarm to warn other students.  That’s a very possible explanation for the fire drill report.

       Yeah, I think it's too soon to go off quotes about the timeline in the aftermath of a chaotic situation. My guess would be that if the fire alarm went off before the shooting, the shooter or someone else pulled it, like you said. A teacher would assume there was a fire drill or it was pulled by mistake, but by law, you have to leave the building.

       I saw that once a teacher started to hear shooting, he pulled the alarm to get the other kids out of harms way. Doesn’t make sense to do that but, it could have saved lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a report is a kid used a shotgun too.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to William Cooper’s 1991 book titled “Behold A Pale Horse,” the “secret government” have long planned to abolish the Second Amendment via a series of false flag events designed to drum up support for a total gun ban.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government encouraged the manufacture and importation of military firearms for the criminals to use. This is intended to foster a feeling of insecurity, which would lead the American people to voluntarily disarm themselves by passing laws against firearms. Using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients in a process called Orion, the CIA inculcated the desire in these people to open fire on schoolyards and thus inflame the antigun lobby. This plan is well under way, and so far is working perfectly. The middle class is begging the government to do away with the 2nd amendment.

       I heard one of the kids say that he was pretty sure there teacher pulled the fire alarm becuase the wing they were in was kind of away from the rest of the class room and he wanted to give the students on the other side of the school a warning.

       It's odd that this one also occurred during a fire drill, but there really isn't a better time to start your shooting. Yeah its morbid to think about but fire drills can be a bit chaotic and you tend to see lots of people moving together in groups, no better time to start your massacre and ensure you inflict the most damage possible.

       Even if we are suggesting that there is some evidence that this was done to cover up the IG, the timing makes no sense. These things capture headlines for a couple of day, maybe a week, and then the public's attention has moved on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the IG report hasn't even been released to anyone yet, is still in a draft form, needs to be reviewed by multiple agencies, needs to go through some back and forth, and then finalized, chances are we aren't seeing this for
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       a couple of weeks, it may even be closer to a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are close to a month out from the actual public release, and considering how often school shootings are happening in this country, if something this far away from the release confirms the "prediction" then it is a safe prediction because you can bank on the fact it is going to happen, even if none of them were any conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it happened within a couple of days of the public release, one way or another, that would be something. But this? No way.

       The leaks from it are already in the news,
      </p>
      <p>
       "As we reported earlier Thursday, a long-awaited report by the Department of Justice's internal watchdog into the Hillary Clinton email investigation has moved into its final phase, as the DOJ notified multiple subjects mentioned in the document that they can privately review it by week's end, and will have a "few days" to craft any response to criticism contained within the report, according to the Wall Street Journal."

       It's out there for political junkies and of course those in Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shooting will dominate headlines for another week at least. Anything released or leaked about the IG report heading into this weekend and next is now buried by the shooting.

       What substantial leaks have there been?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, honestly, after the spin and trumping up of the "leaks" leading up to the Nunes memo, I think it would be ridiculous for anyone to believe anything anyone tells them about what is in the memo, before seeing the whole thing, because people are going to try and make it appear like what little information we know will confirm their prejudicial beliefs about the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if this dominates for a week, the real release, which is going to get the most headlines, is not going to come out before then. So I still think the timing doesn't support the hypothesis or the prediction.

       That would be the news going into the weekend but no longer. It gives these people another week of cover in the press and this shooting will, of course, be campaigned on. The complicit media will cover this excessively and make it into a political story against the GOP.
      </p>

       It is impeccable timing for them and was accurately predicted by some in the conspiracy community. You dont find it a little weird that people are predicting tragedies?

       Citation of the actual leak that says this? Are you sure you aren't just spouting someone's opinion of what might be in documents? This is exactly what I warned about with the Nunes comparison.

       No, not at all. As I already pointed out, these have become commonplace in America, and we are probably a month away from the release. Something that happens seemingly monthly (such as a mass shooting) happening within  a month of something isn't hard to predict.

       They took them to UTMB (in Galveston) because it’s the closest Level1 trauma center. You don’t take severe gunshot wounds to the shitty county hospital unless it’s literally the only option. UTMB is a great hospital. Unrelated, it’s considered one of the top-3 burn centers in the US strangely and randomly enough

       Ok, no problem. In our area, we say, "they're at UTMB...or Mainland..."
      </p>
      <p>
       UTMB is a Level 1 trauma center, Clear Lake is a Level 2 and Mainland is a level 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically,for something like a gunshot, it's no surprise to me some victims with more serious injuries were taken to UTMB. If my kid was shot, I would be very concerned if they ended up at Mainland. I get what you're saying; better a hospital than no hospital. Personally, I have had some bad experiences with Mainland, so maybe my own issues with them came across too crass.
      </p>

       Oh about how it was secret government operatives that made a child go into that school and shoot people to help push their anti gun agenda? That's a terrible conspiracy. Kids lost their lives today because of an irresponsible, mentally ill individual. The only conspiracy I see is how a person who should not have had access to a weapon, did in fact, have access to a weapon.

       Don't you think the problem is a little deeper than guns? I mean, you are dismissing this kid as mentally ill and blaming the guns. This seems to happen after every shooting in America. Don't you think its strange that there is suddenly an overwhelming amount of kids who are shooting up their schools? Kids have always had access to guns, have always gone to school...
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it an issue with the schools? Are the teachers missing obvious red flags? How do these kids go to school everyday planning to shoot it up and nobody notices? Are they being isolated? Are these kids really just desperate for attention?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it an issue with society? Is it an issue with the parents? Why do these kids feel life is so cheap?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it the medication they are being prescribed? I know a huge majority of the shootings come from kids on medication, why isn't this being seriously looked into?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean wouldn't it be a lot better if we were able to stop kids from shooting up their schools because none of them wanted too...

       Why don’t schools get a different alarm that kids can pull. The fire alarm problem has repeatedly happened. They need gun wielding horrible person alarms that sound completely different.

       That is not a great idea. At my highschool kids for the fun of it will pull fire alarms just to get out of class. Imagine the chaos and intensity that would happen because a stupid kid decided to pull it for shits and giggles.

       Thing is, modern fire and security systems can be programmed so that it takes multiple initiating devices being activated for the system to go into alarm mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can think of several schools in metro Atlanta that are programmed that way.

       If the shooter pulled it the kids would be able to lock doors, hide behind desks. Better idea than being lined up outside.

       Yes there is fear. Kids these days have to try to deal with mass shootings. It sucks. Tornados were my fear as a school kid.

       Okay, so I understand the far-fetched theory of these being false flags, and I am struck with grief over these deaths. But is it not weird to anyone else how regularly this seems to be occurring now? Like what fucking happened in the last 15 years (since gun control and regulation has only got stricter mind you) to make make high school kids so eagerly take up guns all of a sudden? There just has to be a common denominator because it doesn’t make sense.

       Could very well be the media playing a role in copy-cat shooters. Everytime one of these mass shootings take place the MSM focuses on the kill count, the shooter and the planning/preparation of the gunman, an open challenge to other possible disenfranchised potential gunman to beat the previous record and killcount. It also does not help that these shooters faces and names are broadcast everywhere leading to copy-cats ltying to leave a legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not for some agenda, its what sells best to the public (violence, tragedy and fear) as these "news" corporations are most interested in turning a profit, not benefiting society, preventing this happening again.

       My personal theory on it is it’s similar to the serial killer fascination during the 80s and 90s, basically you stage one or two and put a lot of focus on these events, and through social engineering you make these crimes very desirable to a certain demographic and soon enough you have high school kids shooting up schools. I have no evidence for this at all, just my personal tin foil hat theory.

       Mainland Medical is about 10 miles away (it's a horrible hospital). Clear Lake Regional is about 14-15. UTMB is where most are now, which is on Galveston Island and is about 25 miles away. I work on the Island and I saw one of the ambulances with two vehicles following with their hazard lights on, along with another emergency vehicle.

       Could very well be the media playing a role in copy-cat shooters. Everytime one of these mass shootings take place the MSM focuses on the kill count, the shooter and the planning/preparation of the gunman, an open challenge to other possible disenfranchised potential gunman to beat the previous record and killcount. It also does not help that these shooters faces and names are broadcast everywhere leading to copy-cats ltying to leave a legacy.

       Its not for some agenda, its what sells best to the public (violence, tragedy and fear) as these "news" corporations are most interested in turning a profit, not benefiting society, preventing this happening again.
