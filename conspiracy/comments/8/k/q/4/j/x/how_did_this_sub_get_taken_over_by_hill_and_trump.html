       I’ve been on this sub for years, but don’t post or comment much. I usually don’t even sign in. But after a significant absence I thought I’d check it out and I can’t believe how it’s been taken over by Z-grade DNC types who just want to argue about CNN-level tripe.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did the mods let this happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       It might as well by a Yahoo “news” comment section.  Just dreadful.
      </p>
      <p>
       We’re the regular politics forums filled up so it spilled over into this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do DNC fellaters reallybgave nothing. Enter to do but run around acting like junior David Brock’s?
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s disgusting and this place is almost destroyed.

       Welp, sometime late 2017 early 2018 the TD bots seem to have stopped manipulating this forum and then a bunch of us liberals got super excited about the Trump/Russia collusion thing and flooded here in our excitement and well, then TMOR and the other META subs caught on to our excitement and well, That's it.  Liberal reddit liberalizes a sub that was being manipulated by the right wing.  Happened a lot on this sub since the beginning/

       Hate to break it to you but when all the major MSM bands together on conjecture it's NDAA 2013 operation mocking bird.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is the abuse we knew would happen when they passed that Patriot Act. And NDAA and Freedom Act ( Freedom is Slavery after all).  Weaponized IRS and DOJ and from inception FBI and CIA under Obama were the most blatant ever and no one will say a thing to tbe man to stop it nor Bush before him.  Media was complicit in creating a police state and is now part of the cog of the mill wheel grinding away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well some in Congress have tried to push back like Ron Paul amd to a lesser extent his son.  And tge two who actually tried to question the 9/11 lies and dug in their heels on passing an unread bill that was ready to go as WTC7 free fell into its foot print called the Patriot Act in true Orwellian fashion.  And those men were targeted by high weapons grade anthrax in their mail. What a coincidence!!
      </p>
      <p>
       And two scientists were framed for it by none other than Mueller.  One proved his innocence though the media destroyed him as guilty immediately.  The second was starting to pepbe his innocence whdn he "suicided".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clintons have a lot of bodies in their wake so it's no stretch of belief they set this whole Russigate up and killed Seth Rich for exposing her rigging rhe primary and buying delegates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pretty sickened at our choices for President but after watching Romney and the RNC do what DWS and Hilda did only the election prior.  Ron Paul had massive crowds and yet was denied debates and sjdn he fot one barely eas given air time to answer.  Once the crowd roared demanding he get his turn and the other candidates couldn't even compare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hilda though is the greater evil except maybe for anorher Bush then tied.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I bid you welcome to our tin foil hat world of getting scorned but so often proven right while the masses sleep on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lesson 1) distrust all MSM and the harder they lockstep on a narrative and push it non-stop the more you know it's propaganda and/or lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) most of us here are pretty liberal as far as free speech and all that goes. Lors of libertarian which is my closest label though I hate labels.  We have some reie liberals but not Leftists nor real Alt Rights like that asshat Richard Spenxer (who worked for Occupy first and CNN web editor before that so I believe he is a paid actor and provacator and not genuine though he probably has some legit racist low life followers.
3) Leftists are lock step with NWO globalist or are their puppets. Many believe Zionists like Rothschild really run the machine with puppet princes and Pope.  Pitting us against one another lest we realize we have much in common and band together against those monsters.  Monsters that have had at least our last 4 presidents in their pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russiagate is a conspiracy. One of rogue FBI, DOJ, CIA and Obama Administration to frame and destroy a political rival.  Their desperation to do so is because now they are vulnerable to a sitting President without the massive donations he can be more autonomous which isn't allowed. Just look into Reagan and when he tried go be his own man he was shot.  He can release the Fast and Furious files and 9/11 and even JFK though I think he risks ending the same if he does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the President I wanted? No way. And maybe it's a false hope but I do have it with the obvious fact the deep state criminals and MSM hate and fear him now when they didn't before.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at least now we can see how did he us crazy conspiracy theorist are and have been watching our Republic crumble behind illusions of normalcy.  Now you all can see how they unmasked citizens, had moles not just spying but setting up various entrapments and hpw the guilty project their crimes onto a rival.  Trump disnt sell our Federal Land stolen from States to China or 20% of our Uranium to Russia or keep billions in aid instead of rebuilding Haiti they scammed the world.  And then there is Pedogate which is a world wide epidemic infecting so called Republicans as well as Democrats and the European leaders as well.  Justice Scalia died at a Texas lodge ranch where it is reported they hunt children for sport.

       What really is new about r/conspiracy is the need of a large number of participants to defend the current government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way, opposing the current government != "Hill bots."
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the tricks the government supporters like to do is make false claims about Hillary Clinton, thereby coercing those who like to have their facts correct to point out that some of the claims against Hillary are wrong. This leads to false claims that people are "Hill bots."

       FTFY, and it's on all "sides". Anti-Government, was the norm in the conspiracy theory community, until recently. Being against a large Government (Government) in general, was always on the more Conservative/Libertarian side of the spectrum. Less Government == more personal freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't only until recently, that a vast influx of Statists infiltrated here, and by doing such... they stomp out all opposition, by design. Statist cannot build. They steal and destroy. That's all they are capable of doing.

       Your comment is even about conspiracy, it is about ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is that your ideology was fed to you by the oligarchy to get you to believe that government should be eliminated so oligarchs could rule you directly without that pesky interference of regulations and human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a conspiracy is true or false and to what extent has little or nothing to do with your ideology
       <em>
        or any other
       </em>
       . Rather, your ideology is the conspiracy itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern "anti-governmentism" conspiracy grew directly out of the attempted coup by the American Liberty League against four time elected president Franklin Roosevelt,
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, it was refined by people like Adolf Coors, Harry Bradley, Fred Koch, John Olin, Richard Mellon Scaife, and Lewis Powell, with help from trade groups including the Chamber of Commerce, and companies like RJR Nabisco, Exxon, Dupont, and more recently AT&amp;T.

       Are you seriously suggesting that because governments do bad things, we would be better off without them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Argue that nonsense with someone else.

       While I'm here, it should be known that both the Bradleys and Kochs, two of the biggest funding sources of libertarian ideology also happen to love war. They aren't really anti-government -- they only like the killing part of it. They funded PNAC. :)

       Ah, I see where you're coming from. Problem is anybody can say that about any ideology / theory - X hasn't worked in practice because it hasn't been
       <em>
        genuinely
       </em>
       implemented. Merely pointing out that something has never existed in trying to prove your point proves precisely nothing. Moreover, it's an inadequate understanding of what theory and practice are and how they relate. Neither is hermetically sealed from the other. If you don't appreciate this, then your supposedly liberatory philosophy just becomes another repressive apparatus - who develops and implements the theory if not just another elite?
      </p>
      <p>
       And as u/safespacebans says, this is hardly the place to discuss ideology.

       He wants to argue ideology in r/conspiracy. You're right and good point. The proponent of a viewpoint should be able to support their view. Nevertheless, there are example to disprove it beyond the book Lord of the Flies.
      </p>
      <p>
       We got prehistory when life was absolutely awful and the Dark Ages when governments folded. Then, we have places like Congo and Somalia in recent times. We can also look right here in the United States to see that life got much better for the masses with the addition of Social Security and so many other things.

       It's sad that people fall for this far right libertarian Ayn Rand style bullshit economics. No government regulations = FULL RETARD CORPORATE RULE.

       (bear in mind, "free market" has a strawman/bullshit definition and a real defintion -- I did not know this back when I made this graphic
which I still need to update)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the sad state of the U.S. two party system, same NEOliberal horseshit:

      <p>

        https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your eyes on government AND CORPORATIONS.
Who controls the government? Secret societies, elite central banksters AND CORPORATIONS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like holy shit, do people even know "libertarian" is not limited
to the Libertarian party shills?
That party pumps out EXTREME right libertarians, not reasonable libertarians.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are left, centrist and moderate right libertarians, this is legit anti-establishment stuff. But the Libertarian party™, has pumped out pro-TPP shills like Gary Johnson who is at a similar point on the spectrum as Ron Paul (decent social issues, fucked up survival of the fittest economics,
wanting to remove social programs and accumulate insane wealth at the hands of a few oligarchs).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mafia corporations would screw us over so hard without government regulations.
I am NOT saying all regulations are good (some are lousy)
but to remove all of them is 100% an establishment trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so what's the solution?
Get money out of politics, (fuck off corporations) remove secret societies from government (fuck off freemason satanists), nationalize the FEDs (fuck off elite central banksters), break up banking/corporate/media monopolies and strengthen local grassroots movements (stronger democratic republic).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decent governments have existed before. But far right libertarian bullshit
is like Victorian England era shit, or modern Hong Kong (NEOliberal, different to the rest of China which is authoritarian state capitalist centralized economics).

       There are those of us here who are anti-Trump and anti-HRC/DNC, yet whenever I try to explain this to people, they claim I'm a
       <em>
        secret Trump supporter
       </em>
       . It's fucking insane.

       The best way to browse this sub is by /new, it's ground zero in the fight against the shills and it allows the generic users to set the tone of discussion.

       Yeah I'm a Bernie supporter who has given Trump the benefit
of the doubt in playing "3D chess" but my patience is going down fast
with the fact his administration is not impressing me so far,
we're still in corporate bullshit economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also the fact Correct The Record/Share Blue and Cambridge Analytica (or whatever crap Trump/GOP/zionists are using these days)
have had millions of $$$ to shill for Clinton and Trump. That dishonesty sickens me.
If you're gonna shill, shill the truth, but I see lots of retarded comments (T_D and elsewhere)
kissing zionist warmonger ass and pretending the economy has improved....it seems like almost the same bullshit to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care if the shills are Israeli, British, Russian or whatever, this dishonesty is one reason
I can't stomach the two party system horseshit. Far right vs far right (economic) candidates over and over again.
Corporate rule, no thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say I hate all Trump supporters but I'm 90% sure
there are Trump shills out there, and a LOT.
Trump (or his zionist handlers) have a LOT of money to burn.

       This sub reached a point where the number of subscribers scared MSM and something had to be done. That and training the shills to understand and comment about cute pictures was too tough to do.

       Hate to break it to you but when all the major MSM bands together on conjecture it's NDAA 2013 operation mocking bird.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is the abuse we knew would happen when they passed that Patriot Act. And NDAA and Freedom Act ( Freedom is Slavery after all).  Weaponized IRS and DOJ and from inception FBI and CIA under Obama were the most blatant ever and no one will say a thing to tbe man to stop it nor Bush before him.  Media was complicit in creating a police state and is now part of the cog of the mill wheel grinding away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well some in Congress have tried to push back like Ron Paul amd to a lesser extent his son.  And tge two who actually tried to question the 9/11 lies and dug in their heels on passing an unread bill that was ready to go as WTC7 free fell into its foot print called the Patriot Act in true Orwellian fashion.  And those men were targeted by high weapons grade anthrax in their mail. What a coincidence!!
      </p>
      <p>
       And two scientists were framed for it by none other than Mueller.  One proved his innocence though the media destroyed him as guilty immediately.  The second was starting to pepbe his innocence whdn he "suicided".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clintons have a lot of bodies in their wake so it's no stretch of belief they set this whole Russigate up and killed Seth Rich for exposing her rigging rhe primary and buying delegates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pretty sickened at our choices for President but after watching Romney and the RNC do what DWS and Hilda did only the election prior.  Ron Paul had massive crowds and yet was denied debates and sjdn he fot one barely eas given air time to answer.  Once the crowd roared demanding he get his turn and the other candidates couldn't even compare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hilda though is the greater evil except maybe for anorher Bush then tied.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I bid you welcome to our tin foil hat world of getting scorned but so often proven right while the masses sleep on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lesson 1) distrust all MSM and the harder they lockstep on a narrative and push it non-stop the more you know it's propaganda and/or lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) most of us here are pretty liberal as far as free speech and all that goes. Lors of libertarian which is my closest label though I hate labels.  We have some reie liberals but not Leftists nor real Alt Rights like that asshat Richard Spenxer (who worked for Occupy first and CNN web editor before that so I believe he is a paid actor and provacator and not genuine though he probably has some legit racist low life followers.
3) Leftists are lock step with NWO globalist or are their puppets. Many believe Zionists like Rothschild really run the machine with puppet princes and Pope.  Pitting us against one another lest we realize we have much in common and band together against those monsters.  Monsters that have had at least our last 4 presidents in their pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russiagate is a conspiracy. One of rogue FBI, DOJ, CIA and Obama Administration to frame and destroy a political rival.  Their desperation to do so is because now they are vulnerable to a sitting President without the massive donations he can be more autonomous which isn't allowed. Just look into Reagan and when he tried go be his own man he was shot.  He can release the Fast and Furious files and 9/11 and even JFK though I think he risks ending the same if he does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the President I wanted? No way. And maybe it's a false hope but I do have it with the obvious fact the deep state criminals and MSM hate and fear him now when they didn't before.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at least now we can see how did he us crazy conspiracy theorist are and have been watching our Republic crumble behind illusions of normalcy.  Now you all can see how they unmasked citizens, had moles not just spying but setting up various entrapments and hpw the guilty project their crimes onto a rival.  Trump disnt sell our Federal Land stolen from States to China or 20% of our Uranium to Russia or keep billions in aid instead of rebuilding Haiti they scammed the world.  And then there is Pedogate which is a world wide epidemic infecting so called Republicans as well as Democrats and the European leaders as well.  Justice Scalia died at a Texas lodge ranch where it is reported they hunt children for sport.

       There are those of us here on the Left who don't believe in Russia Collusion...and who won't forgive nor forget what HRC and her Corporatist ilk did to Bernie and to this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to be a "Liberal" that's your Right...but Liberals are Centrists, who compromise their principles for what ultimately results in gains worth nothing. Join us on the True Left...abandon those Centrist fools who have attempted to contain you...
