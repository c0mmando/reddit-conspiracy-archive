        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, as I often do I was laying here in my bed and asking myself questions about the world around me when I asked myself, &quot;Does gravity effect photons other than around a black hole?&quot; The answer to which can be seen in my link description above.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give any consideration to flat-earth theory of for nothing other than gravity&#39;s pull would form a sphere of the water on our planet. &quot;But, but.... My peetri dish!&quot; Yeah sorry, but earthquakes. </p>

<p>Anyway, this flat-earth LARP did open my eyes to oddities in the space program and I tend to side with the idea man has never walked on the moon. When I really think about it, it makes more sense that no man ever stepped on the moon than the opposite being true.</p>

<p>Just laying the groundwork in my thinking process here.</p>

<p>So, is it possible that the further we get from earth&#39;s gravitational field, the slower time moves for the traveler? It&#39;s stated and accepted that space and time are bound together and space is manipulated by gravity, is it not a logical conclusion that time is also subject to gravity? Do we not tend to agree (within the scientific community) that the closer we get to the event horizon of a black hole, the faster time accelerates for the traveler? Os the opposite not true?</p>

<p>Man launches into space, comms start to see delays, many ventures further from earth, comms delay further. Words drag out and become unclear. Mission must abort, travelers return to earth. Has anything ever left orbit (ie: Earths gravity)??? I know we&#39;re told it has, but how can that be when anything leaving gravitational fields would be subject to slow-motion travel?</p>

<p>Should I post this in r/space?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That (this universe or dimension&#39;s) physics of &#39;mass&#39; has been found to quantify or compute just the same as &#39;wavelengths&#39; and that array of probabilities in turn quantify or compute as &#39;observer effect&#39; strongly suggests it is then up the algorithms within this program but yes based on existing experiments (ie clock on high-altitude plane) it has been proven that the farther that plane terra is orbitted, the slower time passes for the traveler although tis acute compared to the relatively extreme time dilation if were to relocate closer to a black whole where say 1 hour near BH would equal 7 PT years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s probably what kicked off this thought process in my mind. Now that you say it, I watched the Falcon 9 launch yesterday and it suddenly started going &quot;sideways.&quot; I put in parenthesis because it did look sideways to me, the observer, but no way of knowing if it was in fact sideways for the rocket?</p>

<p>I know it seems a bit far-fetched (hence my posting here and not in /space) but maybe time comes to a near stand-still without gravitational influence? The ISS is what, 200 miles from earth? The f&#39;ing moon is 250,000 miles from earth.. Or is it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there is some form of gravitational effect at any point between the earth and the moon, but wouldn&#39;t minimum gravity also mean minimum time elapse for the waves that measured the distance between the earth and the moon?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve basically been told that time is effected by gravity, unless it doesn&#39;t fit the narrative. I&#39;m understanding that one extreme of gravity (near event horizon of black hole) is not countered by the other extreme of gravity. The complete lack thereof.</p>

Most of what your saying is correct in some manner. Trying to wrap your head around space and time is a real mind fucker though.
I&#39;m not denying the fact that these are your original thoughts as I&#39;ve had thoughts about things I&#39;ve had no prior knowledge on only to find somebody has already asked the same question or has already made &quot;my&quot; idea a reality.</p>

ISS is fake that&#39;s why they&#39;ve done extensive clock experiments on even commercial planes but never these alleged space craft like ISS, or have they? If they wore real there would be scientists calculating how much ISS astro-nots slowed their aging, etc.
Light not escaping black holes is a common demo of how extreme timespace dilation also applies to mass-less photons. Proof the speed of light waves - just like mass particles - depends on the strength of the gravity. Although it could be argued light is moving across space even in the black hole but it curves back inward, right? Same with mass - frozen light - travelling fast but getting nowhere &#39;in a hurry&#39; relative to observer.</p>

<p>See, this is where my mind fails to bond together the current theories and the reality around us. When we&#39;re told accelerated matter becomes energy at C, then wouldn&#39;t object A traveling at .5C be traveling at C in relation to object B traveling the opposite direction at .5C? This seems to allow the idea that everything is simply energy, depending upon the observer.</p>

<p>Time is obviously subject to gravity (more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation">here</a>), but the effect is the other way around - time is experienced more rapidly away from gravitational sources. On our tiny Earth, this effect causes a shift of roughly 0.022 seconds/year, but still means that corrections to satellites&#39; time measurements (e.g GPS) must be applied. </p>

<p>Jesus....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravitational time dilation is a form of time dilation, an actual difference of elapsed time between two events as measured by observers situated at varying distances from a gravitating mass. The higher the gravitational potential (the farther the clock is from the source of gravitation), the faster time passes. Albert Einstein originally predicted this effect in his theory of relativity and it has since been confirmed by tests of general relativity.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation</a></p>

<p>No, it is not possible that time moves slower the further we get from Earth&#39;s gravitational field because it has been proven that the exact opposite is true - time moves slower the <em>closer</em> we get to Earth&#39;s gravitational field. The effect is, however, exceedingly small.</p>

<p>With a black hole an observer well outside the event horizon would note that as an explorer approaches the event horizon his time appears to slow down, relative to the passage of time for the observer. The explorer will note the opposite - as he approaches the event horizon he will note that the passage of time for the observer speeds up relative to his own time.</p>

<p>When the explorer crosses the event horizon, from his perspective the passage of time for the observer will become infinitely fast compared to his own time, while the observer will note that the passage of time for the explorer will become infinitely slow relative to the observer&#39;s time. From the observer&#39;s perspective, the explorer&#39;s time will effectively stop.</p>

<p>Your idea of how time works is completely and utterly wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also wanted to add for you to look into the Higgs Field. This might answer some of your questions about mass. (And re-reading over your post, I&#39;ll say the space mission photographs are staged simply because it&#39;s not possible to actually take a photo in space due to it being a vacuum. You need a radio telescope in order to do that since it takes the photos as data and sends it back to earth and we do not have the technology to make a small hand held one)
When we travel at the speed of light or a fraction of it time slows down for the people traveling at those speeds. Example if we went from here to alpha centuri at a fraction of the speed of light and it takes 20 years it might be 20 years for the traveller but in earth time it would be somewhere around 60 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time dilation only happens when 2 objects are in motion towards each other.</p>

<p>Take a Muon for example. Those little fuckers can move REALLY fast. And decay really quickly Normally a Muon would collide with the first molecule they find in the outer atmosphere and that would be that. or they would decay within splitseconds. From the point of view of the Muon that will still happen. If you fly next to one it would just decay at a normal time. But for a outside observer the time is much much longer. Space contracts for the muon which means its capable of going much deeper into the atmosphere even until pretty deep mines. The effects of the Electromagnetic force has much less time to interact with the muon due to its speed, so the interaction is zero to none (for all intends and purposes the Muon would still decay if it hit the nucleus of a atom smack dab in the middle, but the chance for that is rather small) So it gradually looses speed over a very long distance until its slow enough for time to normalize and then decays. </p>

<p>They are a huge nuisance for current neutrino detectors, so those things have to be build deep within the earth or mountains. </p>

<p>But timedilation only happens when 2 objects are in motion relative to each other. If you are not in relative motion there will be no timedilation. The affects of gravity itself obviously still apply. But for everyday purposes they are negligible. Otherwise the universe would be considerably more redshifted. Rotation also comes into play at massive speeds or distances. Since a rotating massive object can &quot;fling&quot; spacetime in a certain area (this is  how we can detect gravity waves from merging blackholes and or Neutron stars). Dark matter and Energy makes things complicated. But that doesnt matter since those effects only become apparent over millions of lightyears. Posting it in <a href="/r/space">/r/space</a> would just invite ridicule im afraid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Man launches into space, comms start to see delays, many ventures further from earth, comms delay further. Words drag out and become unclear. Mission must abort, travelers return to earth. Has anything ever left orbit (ie: Earths gravity)??? &quot; 
Not sure what you are getting at with that comment but Radio waves travel at the speed of light. Time = distance / speed 
Time = (238,857 miles) / (186,282 miles/second) 
Time to the moon = 1.28 seconds
Time to the moon and back = 1.28 seconds x 2 
2.56 seconds
Any Comms failure or degradation wouldn&#39;t be a result of gravity or even how far they went out (Except for the back side of the moon where the orbiter antenna was blocked by the moon itself). Its good to be a sceptic but there&#39;s a line between being a sceptic and being foolish and disregarding science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, I have the book Relativity something something general something... Anyway, I did read it but retention is very difficult when you aren&#39;t well-versed in a subject. It&#39;s quite possible that I subliminally retained a portion of the book. I think original thoughts are very rare and I hope I&#39;ve had one, but there&#39;s always the possibility I have not. Well, anything that matters, anyway. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m the first guy to think about a squirrel fucking a pelican who is eating a snake while standing in a river of pine cones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they say that somebody travelling at the speed of light is not experiencing the same time as somebody who is on earth.
I watched a really interesting video on the subject by Matt O&#39;dowd.
I wish I was more educated in the subject myself.<br/>
Most of what your saying is correct in some manner. Trying to wrap your head around space and time is a real mind fucker though.
I&#39;m not denying the fact that these are your original thoughts as I&#39;ve had thoughts about things I&#39;ve had no prior knowledge on only to find somebody has already asked the same question or has already made &quot;my&quot; idea a reality.</p>
