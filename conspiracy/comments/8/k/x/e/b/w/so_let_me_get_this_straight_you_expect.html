       We're so used to companies treating the customer like the boss that we've forgotten that we're ignorant and almost powerless. Our only power is to withdraw labour. Once the mind control technologies are perfected (which allow them to control your body like a puppet) you will be totally powerless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time to learn about cutting edge neuroscience? Nah that shits too hard. Let's just fingers crossed hope that Billionaires and the industrial military complex love us and will give us cool new toys and won't enslave us.

       The only obstacle to making this video a reality is the difficulty in engineering a medically safe neural-electronic interface.  But once that's perfected, game over.

       Again, and as I said above, I don't understand the reason or motivation for having a few newscasters speak jibberish - and I'm not being a jerk here by saying this, but I'm not going to read a 123 page article when, if you read it, perhaps you could just tell me why.

       That is, if it's simply not the case that they're having strokes or something.

       I've told you but you don't get. Take for example the CIA's heart attack gun. If they wanted to sell it to other countries as a service rather than a product, they might say "we're going to kill X Y and Z" and then tv presenters X Y and Z have heart attacks on air.

       The reason I don't "get" your explanation is because it doesn't seem to hold any weight.  That's not a very good explanation for what is happening on air.  First of all, what these newscasters are exhibiting aren't symptoms of a heart attack.  If anything, they're symptoms of stroke - which is actually quite a different thing altogether than a heart attack.  Secondly, if some sort of CIA agency wants to show prospective "clients" their effectiveness at remotely inducing heart attacks in people, they don't need to do it by causing them in unsuspecting newscasters on national television.  They're the C-I-fricken-A.  They can simply go to the country in question and demonstrate the effectiveness on whoever the prospective client wants it demonstrated on
       <em>
        in their presence
       </em>
       .

       The heart attack gun was a hypothetical example I gave you because I thought you were too simple minded to understand the actual EMR interfering with speech scenario.

       How much does that cost? Why would the country agree to observe a target without any indication the technology worked?

       It's feedback. Newscasters have ear pieces and read off a prompt. It's extremely easy to get your words mixed up in that environment. This is basically like those voice jammer apps.. hence why they sound exactly like someone using a voice jammer. No conspiracy here guys from what i can see and know.

       This doesn't seem to hold water since you KNOW if you're talking jibberish, and once you realize you are (which, for a normal person, takes maybe a fraction of a second or so to figure out you're not saying anything that makes any sense), you will stop and correct yourself, etc - especially if you're on live tv and know you're being watched and judged by millions of people.  These people aren't even reacting to the fact they're speaking absolute jibberish.

I can only imagine how kids are easily conditioned to this and will only be able to communicate in crazier environments in just a few years.

       Revolution of what though? There are small revolutions happening everyday whether your tv tells you or not. It seems that every day there is a new hole poked in the official narrative, a little air deflated from the status quo. Do you want a hollywood modeled revolution where we take up arms and kill everyone and maybe somehow reach an agreement and form a new society? The real revolutions come in change of thought, change of public policy, change of engrained ideas. Im of the mind that these revolutions, while not as pretty or badass, are just as important.

       Your totally right. It's easier to look back in hindsight and see, "wow that really was the start of something huge" than it is to see change in the present moment.

       A revolution doesn't necessarily happen where you are looking, either. You can miss a meteor shower if you are watching and waiting and staring at a different part of the sky.

       I'm not the person you replied to but I think while capitalism is flawed,
there are waaay better models of it than the corporatism that the extreme right NEOliberal Dems/Repubs use. Unfettered extremist corporate capitalism sucks but there are alternatives (center left, centrist, and moderate right economics). But we won't get them until we get money out of politics.

       Well I would say no to anarcho-capitalism (which isn't really that anarchistic since corporatism would just become the new governing force) but I would say yes to non-authoritarian forms of center left/centrist/moderate right economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like FDR/JFK economics is way better than the far right corporatist NEOliberal shilly economics of Reagan/Clinton/Bush/Obama.
It's important to dodge extreme economics and extreme authoritarianism as those are the tools of control used by the elites.

       Forget Elon Musk. He could be a saint. It doesn't matter. He'll be dead in a couple of decades at most at which point someone else will control the technology, and then someone else, and sooner or later, it will be used against us. The personalities involved just don't matter. The

       Best way to remove smartdust is through detoxification. Drink distilled water and consume a lot of fruit and quality herbal supplements, especially targeting the kidneys which filter the liquids of the body.

       Because that is the best method of detoxifying the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fruit based diet helps the kidneys function optimally, kidneys filter the lymphatic system which is the waste removal system/main part of the immune system of the body. It cleans you out really good, you are not getting anything out unless you are getting things out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add herbalism on top of that and you further increase the ability of the body to function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Distilled water is the most pure water available. I recommend getting your own distiller and distilling at home, not buying prepacked distilled water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Distilled water removes inorganic rock minerals that build up in the body and cause calficiation, as well as removes acidic waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sauna helps you sweat, and sweating is a method which the body uses to remove toxins. Do it 4 times a week. Everyday can be too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combined it is a very effective detox. Detoxification is the only way to remove this unless you want to wait for some scientist to invent a magic pill. It is the best we can do for now, and quite frankly is very effective of detoxing from anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Distilling also removes all chemtrails and fluoride from water. Personally I distill rain water, not tap water, but you can distill tap water.

       Because it works for detoxing other things, so it is the most likely method to cleanse from smartdust/chemtrails.

       If you want more info though I do recommend you check out the work by Dr. Robert Morse who has helped lots of people perform lymphatic system cleanses.

       not with smartdust directly. but you can see this website for more info on what smartdust is. they don't publish the cure on their website directly though to avoid lawsuits for giving medical advice.
They do grow the smartdust in piety dishes and find chemicals that inhibit their growth:

       So a method ONLY works if your last sentence is true?  Seems to me that if your body can efficiently break down the components subdermally, than macro structures need not perforate the skin.  And it also seems to me that you are talking QUITE broadly about something that is not known very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you didn't link to their method.  But I would surmise by the Alex Jones interviews with them that they are gatekeepers more or less anyhow.

       Well, Alex Jones has been shown to be less than honest on MANY occasions.  That's the big thing these days...it's getting easier and easier to spot the liars.  Bombard's Body Language on Youtube is good for that as well.

       What's creepy is people have this stuff in their body already, the protocols just drawed it out. Anyone doing the protocols would have something, though tumors coming out and falling out are an extreme effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are different levels of the protocols, doing the more extreme aggressive protocols initially without slowly easing in will result in a lot of detoxification reactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I've heard of the Wim Hoff method, it is good and can be used in conjunction with these healing protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way the whole extreme tumor coming out thing was just fruits and herbs that wasn't even using the saunas which add another level. Of course by sweating you will release toxins faster and thus actually mitigate a lot of the negative symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wanna buy a sauna myself lol, it's one of my goals once I get the money.

       You don't need minerals in water you get it from food. Water is highly polluted, you need to distill it to get out all the contaminants. The amount of crap I get out of water with each distillation is disturbing. I wipe out my distilled after each use and this pure black residue comes off every time, I'm distilling rain water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tap water is even worse, all sorts of screwed up shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The minerals in water (besides all of the added chemical garbage and pollution) are just dissolved rocks, the body cannot utilize them. They clog up the body and cause calcification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally just rocks that it picked up from the dirt.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a concerted effort to keep people  from trusting the only pure source of water on this planet, I guess you can call it a conspiracy. Everyone has been made afraid of the only pure water source, and the machine to make it yourself isn't expensive, and it doesn't require expensive filter replacements.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as you consume foods that contain minerals you will be fine, and when used in conjunction with the protocol I mentioned you would get plenty of minerals.

       Yep and on a quantum level, what you "expect" (know) is what becomes manifest! ;)

      <p>
       It'd behoove you to begin to trust your fellow man, regardless of social status. We are All one. Why fear each other? If you wish to run fear-based programs, then expect the results of fear-based programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are sovereign enough to now choose how to conduct your consciousness. Drop the victim mentality. I'd start replacing it with compassion and peace. At a bare minimum, gratitude ;)

       That's just about the strangest way to attack his argument.  There is still societal conditioning to overcome.  But people by and large DO get along, which is what the elite really DON'T want.

       The elite are people. If people get along, why don't the elite just get along? It's almost like some people are scumbags and not everyone has the best intentions for other people.

       Because the elite are embroiled in "mystery schools" that cause them to subvert their humanhood to lesser entities.  And others are mind-controlled sock puppets with literal
       <em>
        hand
       </em>
       lers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the elite have no problem taking out other elites that don't go with the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that is the double-edged sword of the surveillance society we live in....the bad elite are gonna get screwed over by their own system.   Which is perfectly fine by me.  :)

       It has to align on all levels, Mind(brain/pineal/5d); Spirit (Heart/Intuition/4d; and Body (gut/microbiome/3d physical reality), not just the mind alone or intuition alone, which a lot of New-Age shenanigans focuses on.

       I see a lot of people insinuating that it would be done wirelessly through satellites, thus the lead walls.

       Though to be honest if this were to be done it would be done with telephone towers most likely, not satellites but who knows?

       Though I do think virtual reality gaming would be pretty sweet, I do wonder if when they  achieve that it would require such a chip? You just know people would buy that one up.

       Check my list of documented cases of seemingly random violence institaged by 'voices', the list is huuuuuge

       ALSO, the websites, also without any media scrutiny, that claim to aid people who are being gang stalked or attacked by mind control, ie 'biggerthansnowden' are obvious traps.  This is scary stuff.

       billions of dollars accomplishes that - you don't need "control everyone" to be above the law.  all you need are a few good lawyers and USD 10mm.

       The biggest difference is that you are not forced to pay for whatever Elon Musk does. There are no men with guns that will kick down your door if you don't want to pay for Musk's services or products. Whether moral or not having individual choice is paramount, government taxation and programs do not provide that freedom. There is no enslavement without force, at most voluntary brainwashing which is no different from any religion or free market social engineering programs.
