<p>We&#39;re so used to companies treating the customer like the boss that we&#39;ve forgotten that we&#39;re ignorant and almost powerless. Our only power is to withdraw labour. Once the mind control technologies are perfected (which allow them to control your body like a puppet) you will be totally powerless.</p>

<p>Time to learn about cutting edge neuroscience? Nah that shits too hard. Let&#39;s just fingers crossed hope that Billionaires and the industrial military complex love us and will give us cool new toys and won&#39;t enslave us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; your explanation is because it doesn&#39;t seem to hold any weight.  That&#39;s not a very good explanation for what is happening on air.  First of all, what these newscasters are exhibiting aren&#39;t symptoms of a heart attack.  If anything, they&#39;re symptoms of stroke - which is actually quite a different thing altogether than a heart attack.  Secondly, if some sort of CIA agency wants to show prospective &quot;clients&quot; their effectiveness at remotely inducing heart attacks in people, they don&#39;t need to do it by causing them in unsuspecting newscasters on national television.  They&#39;re the C-I-fricken-A.  They can simply go to the country in question and demonstrate the effectiveness on whoever the prospective client wants it demonstrated on <em>in their presence</em>.</p>

<p>The heart attack gun was a hypothetical example I gave you because I thought you were too simple minded to understand the actual EMR interfering with speech scenario.</p>

<p>Stuff like FDR/JFK economics is way better than the far right corporatist NEOliberal shilly economics of Reagan/Clinton/Bush/Obama.
It&#39;s important to dodge extreme economics and extreme authoritarianism as those are the tools of control used by the elites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that is the best method of detoxifying the body. </p>

<p>A fruit based diet helps the kidneys function optimally, kidneys filter the lymphatic system which is the waste removal system/main part of the immune system of the body. It cleans you out really good, you are not getting anything out unless you are getting things out.</p>

<p>Add herbalism on top of that and you further increase the ability of the body to function.</p>

<p>Distilled water is the most pure water available. I recommend getting your own distiller and distilling at home, not buying prepacked distilled water.</p>

<p>Distilled water removes inorganic rock minerals that build up in the body and cause calficiation, as well as removes acidic waste.</p>

<p>Sauna helps you sweat, and sweating is a method which the body uses to remove toxins. Do it 4 times a week. Everyday can be too much. </p>

<p>Combined it is a very effective detox. Detoxification is the only way to remove this unless you want to wait for some scientist to invent a magic pill. It is the best we can do for now, and quite frankly is very effective of detoxing from anything.</p>

<p>Distilling also removes all chemtrails and fluoride from water. Personally I distill rain water, not tap water, but you can distill tap water. </p>

They do grow the smartdust in piety dishes and find chemicals that inhibit their growth:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s creepy is people have this stuff in their body already, the protocols just drawed it out. Anyone doing the protocols would have something, though tumors coming out and falling out are an extreme effect. </p>

<p>There are different levels of the protocols, doing the more extreme aggressive protocols initially without slowly easing in will result in a lot of detoxification reactions.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;ve heard of the Wim Hoff method, it is good and can be used in conjunction with these healing protocols.</p>

<p>By the way the whole extreme tumor coming out thing was just fruits and herbs that wasn&#39;t even using the saunas which add another level. Of course by sweating you will release toxins faster and thus actually mitigate a lot of the negative symptoms. </p>

<p>I really wanna buy a sauna myself lol, it&#39;s one of my goals once I get the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need minerals in water you get it from food. Water is highly polluted, you need to distill it to get out all the contaminants. The amount of crap I get out of water with each distillation is disturbing. I wipe out my distilled after each use and this pure black residue comes off every time, I&#39;m distilling rain water. </p>

<p>Tap water is even worse, all sorts of screwed up shit.</p>

<p>The minerals in water (besides all of the added chemical garbage and pollution) are just dissolved rocks, the body cannot utilize them. They clog up the body and cause calcification. </p>

<p>Literally just rocks that it picked up from the dirt.</p>

<p>There is a concerted effort to keep people  from trusting the only pure source of water on this planet, I guess you can call it a conspiracy. Everyone has been made afraid of the only pure water source, and the machine to make it yourself isn&#39;t expensive, and it doesn&#39;t require expensive filter replacements.</p>

<p>As long as you consume foods that contain minerals you will be fine, and when used in conjunction with the protocol I mentioned you would get plenty of minerals. </p>

<p>billions of dollars accomplishes that - you don&#39;t need &quot;control everyone&quot; to be above the law.  all you need are a few good lawyers and USD 10mm.</p>

There are no men with guns that will kick down your door if you don&#39;t want to pay for Musk&#39;s services or products.
