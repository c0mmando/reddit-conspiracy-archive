<p>Basically says RO removes minerals, but they believe adding back in the minerals is probably needed due to the poor absorption rate from water. </p>

<p>However, as we all know from basic chemistry, Mother Nature loves equilibrium. So decide for your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Before today, I didn&#39;t know some people would have sensitivities like this.</p>

<p>I myself am very much again ingesting it (or worse, what is practically forced ingestion against consent, which is what water fluoridation is about). </p>

<p>For enamel strengthening you might try low dosage topical method, like sipping tea slowly over an hour. The concentration would be a few hundred times less than F- toothpaste, and the exposure with an 8 oz cup would be minimal. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked them up in a while but as very roughly concentrations are about: toothpaste ~1200ppm,  F- mouthrinse ~250ppm, tea: 2.5 ppm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to hear that. (I&#39;m a frequent snacker so it&#39;s more challenging for me). I do wonder it you might experiment different concentrations. What if you just put a surface dab (a few mg, as in &lt;10mg) of a high quality F- paste like Novamin, and then add a little under a gram of fluoride-free toothpaste. </p>

<p>I also use F- and non-F- toothpaste alternatingly, as the non-F- has different nice active ingredients like xylitol.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about experimenting with different concentrations of it too. Because I still have a little bit hard time believing it could be the fluoride that caused me to break out. (And it wasn&#39;t a little breakout, it was like nothing I&#39;d ever had or seen before). And it happened when I was older, so I&#39;d been using fluoride toothpaste for years before, and nothing happened.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is maybe that brand of toothpaste increased their fluoride? Or maybe it was a different ingredient that caused it? Who knows?!?! It&#39;s a mystery!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes both are possible, but I googled it and yes, people and dermatologists both seem to know this is a symptom for some, apparently from the fluoride. </p>

<p>You could have gotten an unlucky tube, where the factory failed to evenly mix and distribute the F-.  Goofups like this happen some time. There was a small town in Alaska where the city water supply had a hardware malfunction in the device that doses and mixes the water into the supply, and one man died from it. (First got really ill, complained of thirstiness, and drank more of the town&#39;s toxic water, only to fall more ill and eventually succumb. ). </p>

<p>If you changed brands and all the sudden this happens, then it would seem is is another ingredient you might be allergic to. </p>

<p>Thirdly, the body does develop allergies sometime. It gets stressed beyond a certain point too enough and then sometimes develops an allergy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t change toothpaste brands at the time of the breakout. But that is a good theory that perhaps that certain batch had more fluoride in it than other batches. You are right, things like that do happen with products and mixing ingredients.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Invest in a water distiller. Not one with a plastic spout that distills into a plastic container, but a stainless steel one that distills into a glass container. Then add PH booster drops as it naturally becomes acidic when exposed to carbon dioxide in the air, and then add a very small amount of salt for electrolytes and a drop or two of iodine. Then look on amazon for a shower filter that removes chlorine and other stuff, including fluoride. When you distill your water you will start to notice there is different contents in the water on different days. I have had very chalky leftover residue, and lately an olive-oil like residue has been building up. Water treatment facilities only have to run tests to make sure about 30 compounds don&#39;t test positive, so there is no way to tell what else is in the water, or what else is in those giant bags of white powder they call fluoride that they ship in from china that they add to the water <em>to help our teeth</em>. I would use reverse osmosis but I honestly don&#39;t trust the filters to remove everything in the water. </p>

<p>Fluoridated water is used in so many food, beverage, and pharmaceutical products it is nearly impossible to avoid. Maybe there is some other magic way I&#39;m not thinking of but the only option I can think of is growing all of your own food completely organically. No pesticides, no growth inhibitors, nothing. Take water direct from an aquifer and grow your food and drink only water from there. Eat no food or beverages you would find at a store or restaurant and stop taking medicine of any sort.</p>

<p>Move to a rural area. It really isn&#39;t that difficult...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it is incredibly difficult for some people. It&#39;s not easy to leave friends and family and even if you are okay with that because maybe you are only an hour drive away so you can see them on a regular basis setting up a fully self-sustaining homestead isn&#39;t easy.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need to buy the land and know that there is enough acreage to support your family and have extra for when hard seasons come so you can store extra through the winter in some climates. Not everyone can afford this.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to learn an entirely new set of skills to live off of the land. Ideally, everything from pretty much fixing whatever might go wrong in your home from, plumbing, electrical (<em>if you have that</em>), roofing, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Learning how to grow all of your own food and cultivating it over two or three seasons to ensure that you are doing things right to optimize crop growth, soil health, etc. Adding to the complications of not using fertilizer or pesticides. If you want fresh fruits like apples and grapes to know that it is going to take years for those vines to grow and those trees to produce any fruit you could eat. If you want animal protein you need to learn all about how to raise and care for everything from cows to chickens. This includes taking care of things when they are sick and remember you aren&#39;t using pharmaceuticals or antibiotics because the production process includes flouride. </p></li>
<li><p>You need a stable well to pull all of this water from which can be a difficult endeavor. Then you have to think about how you are transporting that water to your crops and home via plumbing/irrigation or other methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Just like my animal example above you won&#39;t be taking many common medicines anymore since at least 20% of all medicine is produced using flouride as part of the process as well.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While you can add or remove some things from this list depending on how you want to operate many (<em>or all</em>) of these things need to be done <strong>just</strong> to avoide flouride. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q3. Does Zero Water pitcher remove fluoride from water?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: Yes, Zero Water filtration technology does <strong>reduce</strong> the amounts of fluoride (compounds that contain the element fluorine) in the water. But, that means you’d need to brush your teeth more often! (Just kidding!)</p>
