The gentleman in the black shirt is clearly a Freemason and makes a Satanic hand sign just as he is remarking that America needs prayers. This is how the powers that be leave their mark on their operations.</p>

<p>This is why there will be another civil war in America unless we can reestablish the boundaries of the federal government and work to mitigate the influence of the ancient mystery religion from our politics. We must above all maintain our Bill of Rights as they&#39;re all that protects us from the elite wackos who have brainscrambled that pawn ranting in the video. </p>

<p>There is a significant portion of the total population who the media will not talk about with any seriousness. It&#39;s the population of freedom loving human beings who have informed themselves and taken the necessary steps in their daily lives to ensure their freedom and the freedom of their families. And those people will never roll over and allow themselves to be enslaved. There will be a breaking point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would the Vatican allow a church to operate independently?   The Vatican believes it is entitled to rule the world.  This is why the Vatican/Jesuits are so hostile towards the Russian Orthodox Church, and it is why they created and supported the Bolshevik Revolution.  The Vatican/Jesuits do not rule the Russian Orthodox Church.  </p>

<p>&quot;You think the Vatican and Protestants work together??&quot;  Yes, at the top of the control structure they do work together.  Why would an Irishman who is a sheep be aware of this?  If they were aware, then they would not be sheep.  </p>

<p>&quot;If they are working together why is a Catholic excommunicated for becoming a Mason?? Do you hear yourself?&quot;  Can you not see the futility of your own lies?  They have no affect on me, but your lies lead YOU further and further into self delusion.  Why would the Vatican/Jesuits want a Catholic to also be a Freemason?  It is redundant because the Vatican/Jesuits already control Catholics.  You don&#39;t think things through, now do you?  This is why you were duped into joining Freemasonry.   You are a fool!  </p>

<p>&quot;The secrets themselves are inconsequential.&quot;  The secrets are consequential.  By revealing the secrets, it is harder for Freemasonry to deceive the masses.  </p>

<p>&quot;The fact that I am a man of such integrity that I KEEP such a secret is the point.&quot;  You can believe that, if you want, but you worship Lucifer and you are a LIAR.  </p>

<p>&quot;I will not make you change your mind, and I don&#39;t wish to waste my time on you, but I will defend truth when I get encounter it being attacked.&quot;  You took an oath to not reveal the secrets to a non-Freemason.  This is why you LIE.  If you want to believe that a LIAR is a man of integrity, then so be it.  You are accountable for your decision making.  </p>

<p>You are not defending the truth.  It is not necessary to have secrets if you want to defend the truth.  The only reason Freemasonry has secrets is because they hide their evil agenda.  Every secret society has a hidden agenda, which is why they are a secret society.  Don&#39;t forget that.  </p>

<p>You are a Canaanite.  Nimrod was an idiot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? You know nothing of the Troubles?  You should really Educate yourself. </p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to tell me the Vatican doesn&#39;t want a competitive religion?  Wow that&#39;s a shock. You must be a genius. </p>

<p>ME not thinking things through?Listen. The Vatican does NOT want Catholics to be Masons. The excommunicate them if they find out. Basically they you don&#39;t like us. 
We on the other hand don&#39;t care what religion a Mason is. </p>

<p>What do YOU think the secrets of Masonry are?  Guess what. I know... With absolute certainty I know. </p>

<p>YOU have no more power to tell me who I worship as Masons do. So you&#39;re saying magically someone else has the power change who you pray to??  You must be a piss poor worshiper if YOUR faith can be turned so easy. </p>

<p>Here, read my Code that tells ME what is a Secret. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LADxaYF.png">https://i.imgur.com/LADxaYF.png</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not following me.  Why would a Protestant Freemason complain that the Jesuits/Vatican control Freemasonry if the Protestant Freemason does not KNOW?  Freemasonry does not want independent thinkers who will ask these questions and research for themselves.  Freemasonry wants people who will believe what they are told.  </p>

<p>They don&#39;t tell you who the Great Architect of the Universe is until they have already trapped you.  It is Lucifer.  Congratulations!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the whole thing is a psyop. The news station, the interviewer, the cia/mic looking dude with the sunglasses/hat/patriot shirt/flag all to discredit the white gun owning population. Wake the fuck up and realize that they want to take your guns away because they know their time is short. They have all the weapons with their 5G towers, capable to manipulating your body a million different ways plus also scanning/reading your thoughts. Our last line of defense IS THE 2nd AMENDMENT! I don&#39;t even own a gun! Nor do I live in a gun happy state. I am in los angeles and my parents are egyptian. The world is ruled my satanists. Their whole purpose is to fuck with and enslave us non-satanists in various ways. </p>

<p>PS: I also think Patrick Little is psyop. Totally has the CIA man look going on. And his name, paTRICK Little = Little Trick (up their sleeves). He is taking the extreme &quot;anti-semite&quot; position in order to control the narrative and if by off-chance he wins, I can bet you that he will continue to tow the zionist line. I pray i&#39;m wrong but i&#39;m well aware of how these snakes operate.﻿</p>
