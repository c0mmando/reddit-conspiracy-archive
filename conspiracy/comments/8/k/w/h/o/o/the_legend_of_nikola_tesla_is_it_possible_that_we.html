      <p>
       Most r/conspiracy users are familiar with the stories about Nikola Tesla:
      </p>
      <p>
       *He was a great inventor. Brilliant. A genius.
      </p>
      <p>
       *His efforts were stifled, his lab was burned down.
      </p>
      <p>
       *It may even be the case that he had developed some kind of free energy system.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are some things about Tesla which few people seem to mention:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        His books were published posthumously. *Other people
       </em>
       turned Tesla's magazine articles into books and published them under Tesla's name after his death. But Tesla did not write books in his own life.
      </p>
      <p>
       *His articles were published in a hobby magazine, which was run by a science fiction writer (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Gernsback">
        Hugo Gernsback
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       *There is no video footage of Tesla and only three or four photos which are reused over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Tesla has no living relatives -- apart from one man who appears to profit from the popular stories about Tesla.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question is: why hasn't r/conspiracy begun questioning if it is possible that the Tesla narrative is a gigantic deception?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are people here too enamored with Tesla to question the legitimacy of the legendary tales about him? If so, how is this any different to religious worship or idolisation?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can't challenge our preexisting notions then we are no better than the masses who still believe that Osama did 9/11.

       Heard of Tesla for a while but since I listened to that podcast, I started thinking about it. This guy was just a scientist like any other back then and he luckily got his breakthrough and thus started the legacy it is today. Now my crackpot theory is he got electrocuted via his experiment which released tons of DMT and broke through to discover dimensions. He met some interdimensional races, one could be those 'machine elves' who told him future technology information and thus started his legacy. Either way Nikola Tesla is an interesting guy to research.

       Just looked her up and wow. Shes another interesting mystery to look up. There is a lot of mixed information on her which makes me think there is more to her and the links with Tesla. Maybe this is the effect of when the Victors rewriting history and suppressing history like this. I feel with all the info on Tesla we can look up is just a a tip of the iceburg and the real contributions to either Tesla , Maria or any person from back then is just suppressed.

       Not WTF but he actually stated that running electricity through his body had some health benefits that people should look into - talked a lot about frequencies of human organs, organism, and how it could be healed through electricity. He also talked a lot about God.

       Well it seems like a strange idea, in fact its odd someone posted about this because I was thinking alot about mr tesla today. There is no doubt he existed, his hundreds?, thousands? of patents and hundreds of stories and tales written about the man, he was quite famous when he was "in" with the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they take the effort to slander him, write him out of the history books, give edison all the credit and if you ask most people today who nikolai tesla, a good many will say, never heard of him before.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that isnt proof these familys have been planning for at least a hundred years, I dont know what is, they obviously have enough power to rewrite history.

       This is what some people call a 'synchronicity'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which becomes more fascinating when you look at the film
       <em>
        Synchronicity
       </em>
       (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       The protagonist of that film is compared (in the film itself) to none other than Nikola Tesla.

       I’m confused by the point of the video. Yeah I get that media was slipping in these references. But what do you think the point of WHY they put that in the movie? Is it to help wake people up? Or to keep us distracted? I don’t get the point.

       Ok... so let me ask again. Why do you think the media shows this to us? Just like the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/tTzZtxUcncg">
        lone gunman
       </a>
       episode basically telling everybody much more in detail about 9/11 right before it happened. Why does this matter? What’s your point ?

       The word apocalypse simply means 'lifting of the veil'.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you hadn't heard this before, look it up. The etymology stacks up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some say we are living in an apocalypse right now, and the 'truth in plain sight' we see everywhere (such as The Lone Gunmen episode you mention) is evidence that TPTB are trying to encourage us to ask questions.

       The point of that video was to show you how smart john le bon is so you go on his website and pay him $20/ mo to get unlimited access to his genius delivered through a nasally monotone and disjointed blog posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fyi step2thejep is likely John le Bon so he will get a little bit combative if you point out that his video that he surreptitiously injected into this conversation is on the nonsensical side of things...

       While I disagree with the poster completely, you can't honestly think this is a good argument as Mark Twain was a writer of fiction. Not outside the box to assume something could be a lie.

       I get that, but the poster is making the point that hes a mystery, so unless the two of them met... that's all I'm saying. Again I don't agree with the assessment but I understand the thoughts behind it.

       If you're considering a fictionalization like this, you have to ask who would do so, why and to what benefit. I'm having a difficult time coming up with anything. Also, "legend has it" that his work was confiscated after he died, which might have included more pictoral and/or video documentation of him or his work. There's not a hell of a lot of video from that time period anyway, since it had to be film, which deteriorates unless it's transferred or preserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to factor-in that there is a lot of evidence that his work was kept from the masses, that he was reclusive and that perhaps only hobby magazines would be brave enough to publish him.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one worships him; not a great comparison. There are pre-conceived notions that are worth challenging, but I don't think the assumption that he actually existed is one of them. Apply that question to Jesus, then sure... very worth asking.

       You're like : "How do I know I'm talking to a real human and not a bot? Prove it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a logical evidence &gt; Why would anyone go into trouble of making up that Tesla invented (or improved on) alternating electrical current and telephone, modern x-ray, when they could simply attach those inventions to Westinghouse company and Marconi (who got Nobel prize for it) .
      </p>
      <p>
       He was simply a quirky engineer and inventor who was obsessed with his experiments ( I take it you've seen the photos?) and to my knowledge wasn't even attached to powerful groups of people. Read the wikipedia article on him. He was a very inquisitive and smart kid , born in small village in (today's) Croatia , of Serbian parents. It was simply through hard work and lack of any great competition that he got to New York and where he was. I also visited his museum in Belgrade and saw those invetions and his handwriting.
      </p>
      <p>
       *His books were mainly of philosophical nature , which is logical because he was a son of Orthodox Christian priest , and most of his family was well educated. He didn't care that much about leaving a writing legacy, and was also probably cautious that his ideas would be stolen (as they were).
      </p>
      <p>
       *As in books, his articles were mostly speculations on world to come and advances of technology and spirituality, and as such were not scientific enough for sci publications and not understandable enough for regular papers. He was hyped by them as some kind of magician, though.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no "three or four" photos but at least 20 or more, of which 3 are reused again and again. As for videos ?  Remember, that was a time when electricity was just invented. (First ever video - The Horse in Motion. It was filmed in 1878)  and Tesla peaked and started to fall off on financing in 1890. At that time he was about 35 or so. As for later - I reckon FBI has some of the footage.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Tesla has no living relatives. ... He lived in celibate, didn't he ? Besides, there are hundreds of his distant relatives in today's Serbia and Croatia, as my very own wife is bragging of being one (her ancestors came from Lika in Croatia, which was the place where Tesla's are from)

         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And lastly - the whole of Serbia and Balkans are wondering what happened with his legacy from 1900 until 1943 when he died ?? Was it taken away by Trumps uncle of FBI ?  Or was he just disappointed and penyless, pushed to side, deemed to weird for society, or whatever. Or did he just stopped inventing because that's how humans are. They have ups and downs.

       I just lost enough time trying to explain some points why he was real, and giving some proof of that "not everything must be a lie".
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was , we would today know only of Edison and Westinghouse, because who cares about some small time serbian engineer?

       I will not go into any further explaining, if you won't move a notch.

       Why are you obsessed with video as proof? You waive away physical documentation: books, tablets, structures etc saying that they cannot be authenticated but somehow a video, which you constantly claim can be faked, would be proof of his existence?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a video of the astronauts on the moon... yet you don't believe that. But you do believe that based on a youtube upload of a 1989 video the hulk hogan predicted 9/11 and that based on some youtube clips of back to the future that the movie also predicted 9/11...
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not see that your understanding and vetting of sources is random and inconsistent?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla lived when other people today were alive... he is in people's living memory, he met people who lived contemporaneously with us. People described first hand accounts of him but your lack of proof is that there is no video of a man who died in 1946?

       There are an extensive amount of patents to the man's credit, how much detail do you know of Alexander graham bells life? Not much I'd imagine ...much like other scientists and people of the time really, there was no Facebook back then and, privacy was cherished more. Aside from that check out the fbi foia database, there's files on him. Check out cia foia database, there's files on him. Etc...he left some trails

       Those are good questions. The masses can be easily decieved, the masses regularly worship false idols. The conspiracy community CAN be fooled. Many of the greatest conspiracy advocates are in fact government actors who act as gatekeepers / diversions. E.g. conspiracy theorists are getting too close to the truth of 9/11? Have a couple "whistle blowers" come out and confirm the story, but change critical details, look "crazy", act "nutty", etc. Terrence mckenna, a great psychedelic philosopher, notorious for being anti government. ..

       So like yourself I often question historical figures accepted storyline, tesla, as far as what I've seen , is a legitimate suppressed figure, with legitimate suppressed science. Detailed study will reveal the finer aspects of what was hidden and why!

       I mean it's viable but we also have documented evidence of Trump's uncle among others raising his offices after his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he actually did exist and in all honesty I'm pretty sure he's alive right now reincarnated as Elon Musk. Notice how Elon takes an anti-AI approach which is very service to other oriented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless I think he actually did live after personal research looking into him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also he gave a remarkable interview on light and did have some break through technologies that really could have benefitted humanity and still can do this day yet are shelved and hidden.

       he died in '43. its not like photographs were a super common thing in those days, especially for some one as odd as tesla. video would have been even more rare, keep in mind his competitor also was more of the public showman and did everything he could to supress him in the public eye.

       as for living relatives, i mean ffs the man married a pigeon and was an only child iirc.

       almost all of these points are pretty easily dismissed imho. also tesla was obscure as fuck to any non engineer/physics major prior to the 90's and the surge in nerd culture.

       I too was on the thought of Tesla today ban wagon. You’re right to question him, especially in this sub. I personally have no way to know nor does anyone else in this sub. Unless you’re a great investigator or person relative with an hidden away journal or even maybe an ancestor journal who personally knew him and wrote about him. Then to be able to find this info before any of the oil and gas ppl, energy, big Corp, gov. People did then that’s impressive. I just believe in it. It gives hopes to a change, that this earth really needs right now. A free energy system. Listening and tuning into the earths frequency and letting ourselves grow and adapt on a spiritual level would be just what the world needs. I’m going to continue thinking and learning about the earths frequency  432hz, the fibonacci sequence, Tesla and free energy and one day hopefully crack the code. I kinda think it’s the only way to save the world.

       The transmission of information aka the internet, Teslas idea. He first proposed we make something like the world wide web with his world system.  Did you know he made the first working device with an AND logic gate? The first non-mechanical computer. This device was both the first computer &amp; robot. Tesla is the father of robotics but is never credited as such. He said his device was the first of a robotic race that would do the laborious work of humanity.  His goal was to kickstart ideas that would mature over time. He said it was like sowing seeds or laying the ground work for future generations. He even came up with the basic ideas for cathode ray television displays long before TVs existed in 1893.

       You are claiming that your wife is a relative of Nikola Tesla.
Are you providing evidence? No.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Seriously, what can I provide ?  My wife's (ex wife, to be specific) DNA sample ?  You'll have to trust me on this ... Her grand-grandmother was from the same village, that I know. You have to trust me on this one, I guess.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You are claiming that the reason there is no video footage of Tesla is because TV had been invented yet.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As for videos ? Remember, that was a time when electricity was just invented. (First ever video - The Horse in Motion. It was filmed in 1878) and Tesla peaked and started to fall off on financing in 1890. At that time he was about 35 or so.
        <strong>
         As for later - I reckon FBI has some of the footage.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Except Tesla died decades after videography had become an established field.

      <p>
       I wonder if you are too invested in the legends of Tesla to be objective about the topic.

       i'm from Serbia, I
       <strong>
        might
       </strong>
       be "too invested" as you say. But that just means I had massive exposure to his books, inventions and history during my school. It doesn't help your point that I'm an engineer, too.

       Why are you obsessed with video as proof? You waive away physical documentation: books, tablets, structures etc saying that they cannot be authenticated but somehow a video, which you constantly claim can be faked, would be proof of his existence?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a video of the astronauts on the moon... yet you don't believe that. But you do believe that based on a youtube upload of a 1989 video the hulk hogan predicted 9/11 and that based on some youtube clips of back to the future that the movie also predicted 9/11...
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not see that your understanding and vetting of sources is random and inconsistent?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla lived when other people today were alive... he is in people's living memory, he met people who lived contemporaneously with us. People described first hand accounts of him but your lack of proof is that there is no video of a man who died in 1946?
