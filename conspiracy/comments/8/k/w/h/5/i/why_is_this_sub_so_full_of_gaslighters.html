<p>I&#39;ve been told multiple times that I&#39;m a secret Trump supporter just because I don&#39;t believe  the Russia collusion story.

<p>Amen to that my friend. Fuck the downvotes- why give them the satisfaction of your silencing? As long as they are bothering to downvote your opinion- you know you&#39;re pissing someone off enough to want to silence you.
