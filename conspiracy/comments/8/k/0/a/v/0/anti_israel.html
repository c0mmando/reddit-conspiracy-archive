       I haven't been here since it turned away from cool conspiracies and focused on things that don't interest me, but it was never outright anti-israel. ( I know conspiracies of all color rely on jews as part of the shtick)
      </p>
      <p>
       what changed? I mean besides the recent news.. was this news the catalyst that allowed the mods to put that picture on the right side, with the text "The worst enemy of the united states is israel"
      </p>
      <p>
       because it feels super disingenuous by all accounts, like someone is pushing a narrative, which I don't really care about, but I would like some of your input please?
      </p>
      <p>
       and don't bother throwing facts about israel at me, or telling me how terrible they are, I've heard every single argument for and against a Jewish state, I don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want your feedback on what this sub has become, or if I'm misinterpreting something here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't hide my contempt at people claiming israel is the source of all evil and all that. It's a nuanced situation, that in an ideal world has a simple solution, but here we are, and we have to make the best of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm less than happy with our strange marriage to israel that we have, but that, again isn't my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to hear what ya'll think about driving a narrative on this subreddit that is blatantly anti-israel

       Guys and gals of JIDF, this talking point of trying to frame this subreddit as all of a sudden it is anti-Israel therefore it is a result of a concerted effort, is really not a good strategy.   You can do better.

      <p>
       It does have a simple solution.  Israel  can stop being an ethno-state, and an apartheid, and instead guarantee the right of return of Palestinians, making them citizens with equal rights.

       The sequels will be really remakes represented as prequels, because the show is the same, just different faces.

       What changed?
      </p>
      <p>
       The real possibility of war in Iran is what changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has shown that he will support Israel in whatever they want to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has hired the perfect team to do it. John Bolton? Mike Pompeo? Nikki Haley?
      </p>
      <p>
       He just nixed the Iran deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Netanyahu is doing everything he can to push the US into a war with Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       More sanctions on Iran...even though there is no proof whatsoever that they weren't complying with the IAEA..
      </p>
      <p>
       Embassy moved to Jerusalem...despite many saying that it's a horrible idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's policy on Syria, which definitely involves Iran?
      </p>
      <p>
       Latest election results in Iraq? Yeah...see Iran...
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is what has changed....all of it is why many users on this sub are sayin that once again...Israel has way too much influence on US foreign policy in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are sick and tired of US troops dying in the middle east..sick and tired of spending trillions of dollars on the middle east...sick and tired of being outright lied to by their own government as to what it's plans in the middle east actually are, and what their government is actually doing there now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's new policy of keeping much of what is going on in the middle east under a "National security" blanket doesn't help one bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump saying one thing one week...and the exact opposite the next week regarding what he's doing in Syria...yeah..doesn't help...
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh...and Israel..continuously bombing Syria..continuously shooting people...continuously controlling our media. .doesn't help.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's so hard to see here? The actions of the US in conjunction with Israel and Saudi Arabia in the middle east deserve the highest and most scrutinizing criticism we can accomplish.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one wants another 20 years of fighting Iranian/Lebanese terrorists in the middle east...which is exactly what's going to happen if things keep going the way they're going.

       The lack of knowledge. I'm sure none here have been to Israel or Palestine. It's kinda like the new counter culture. Give it some time and every one will be anti-Israel as part of their "due diligence." And I can't hold it against them, they just don't know and you can't accurately judge what you don't know. Don't lose hope though OP. There's a new gathering place for real conspiracy and truth finding. Shoot me a PM for invite and include any military, police, etc experience if any

       Bullshit.  There is a simple solution.  Jews should get the fuck out of Palestine.  It doesn't belong to you, and never did.  The true semites are the Palestinians. If any country will have you, go there, but like has happened so many times throughout history, for some reason the jewish people have so much trouble integrating with any other people on the planet.  Perhaps a persecution complex as well as a simultaneous supremacy complex?  Yes.
