       It seems that it was relatively common for anti-war themes to be prevalent in music in past decades, particularly the 1960's and 1970's.  Does it make sense that the elites took note of the effect of popular music on the masses, and decided to co-opt it, take control of it, and use it as a medium to push themes that support their agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the African American community for example. There was a time where the struggle of the average black person was reflected in the music. Obviously, they can't entirely eradicate all of the independent musicians who continue to expand on those values, but it seems as if they've incrementally phased out that type of hip-hop music, and instead promote themes of violence, aggression, glorification of crime, ect. Also, since hip-hop has become so popular, people of all backgrounds and races are susceptible to this sort of subtle programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, what I'm asking is, is it possible they have infiltrated the music industry, and only allow for the promotion of artists who's music contains themes that encourage and reinforce the status quo?

       Yes, definitely, music is a huge lever of control. Most of the music we love from the 50s and 60s was already in control of the "elites". And hip-hop was definitely infiltrated and weaponized against black Americans in particular.

       we didn't go from Erroll Garner to snoop doggie dog by accident haha... there is also a phenomenon of industrialization of music i think, simpler and reusable processes leading to cloned band (boys bands) and simili music (music = tempo + harmony + melody, nowadays we're served tempo mostly, the rest was too complex to mass produce hehe)... that's popular music mind you, you can still find talent in niches and bars...

       ‘Lorde - Royals’ comes to mind. The bare minimum of what you speak of is included - just enough to get stuck in your head, whether you like the music or not.

       That being said, a good melody is a good melody. And a good harmony is a good harmony.

       If those musicians on those recordings created those parts with the intention of creating a good piece of art, and it sounds great, I take it for what it is.

       I wonder why they did that? Is there alot of royalties in lyrics and melody? Are frontmen prone to be anti establishment, or bands in general? Their character traits?

       I came late to the party, so I'll just give you a short version of the earliest
       <em>
        recorded
       </em>
       music history because most people probably aren't aware of this period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recorded music became popular in the early 1890's. Much of the recordings were patriotic music, but there was one huge exception. An emancipated slave worked directly with Thomas Edison to test vocals and improve the quality of records. Once they went commercial, this black man wrote and copyrighted a song that became a runaway hit. To this day, this former slave's original song poking at the way black people are treated is the most recorded song in music history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone should take a listen. This is the deep history that disappeared down the memory hole -- literally the most famous song of early recording (1890-1910) and the most recorded song ever but nobody today seems to know it. The song is called "The Laughing Song" and there are several versions at archive.org and youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reaction to the love people felt for this song, the establishment decided to pull out its superstars and go for anti-black songs and "black face" stuff. Songs like "If The Man in the Moon Were A Coon" by superstar Ada Jones and "Bake Dat Chicken Pie" by superstar duo Harlan and Collins were big hits in the aughts (1900-1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the 19-teens, there were huge anti-war hits like "I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be A Solder" by Morton Harvey which few know these days, but as the Great World War approached, the biggest star of all, Billy Murray, sang a war song that most everyone knows: Over There. These songs too are readily available online. Billy Murray had been famous for many years, and you'd be surprised how many of his famous recordings you know: ultimate classics like The Yankee Doodle Rag and Take Me Out to the Ballgame.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yes, music has always been used to manipulate emotion and to push an agenda, but it has always been a battle between thoughtful artists and TPTB.

       Of course. TPTB have been manipulating music since it's creation. Singing, is really just a form of casting spells, with harmonics. It puts people in trances, and implants thoughts/feelings. Could be good or bad, all depends on intentions. It's a tool, that the dark priest class has perfected.

       Aye, from Faeries singing to lure people to Pan playing his flute.  Music transcends all languages, and reaches people on a metaphysical level, going deep into the Soul Being. Fascinating topic, really.

       Harmony wasn't created until the times of Gregorian chant.

       It seems weird, but yes, it took humans a really long time to come up with the concept of playing two different notes at the same time.

       The same feeling devout Christians talk about feeling in church is the same feeling felt by metalheads at a show. It’s an entire room vibrating at the same wavelength and frequency. It’s why you feel connected in those rooms to people you may have never met.

       A lot of rap's anger is about revolution and their struggle, and the negative side of it has been around since its inception.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's absolutely been a push towards party/ignorant music, but the average listener isn't trying to listen to conscious music in their car, when they're partying, etc. There's loose and serious in every genre, and the loose is typically what people want to hear. Rap just comes off worse because of its content and presentation.

       Yes, all of our culture that we receive is controlled from the top-down by corporations. These corporations will always resist allowing anti-corporatist  and anticapitalist messages in media, because the corporation's bottom line always relies on those features being in power. This includes not only music, but also TV, Hollywood films, print media, and also new media on the Internet too. Anywhere in life where corporations make money by forcing manufactured culture on us.

       Punk rock was recuperated and switched to Grunge in the early 90s around the same time that metal and rap got taken over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Underground music is street music. Instead of being made by industry people in fancy studios, it's made by people on the ground who just want to make music.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, underground music tends to be subversive, so the industry subverted it themselves by diluting the scene.

       when it first hit the airwaves, I cant recall anyone comparing it to punk.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was being marketed as a new sound back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking back,though, I can see a similarity to the two genres. Especially in how  both genres were used to replace genres that had come to the end of the road as a  gravy train for the record companies.

       I doubt the radio did, especially as punk was never radio friendly. However, again, this is the standard rock criticism description for the formation of this music. Punk and metal scenes in the PNW influenced each other. Punk attitude took on slowed down metal riffs and grunge was born.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also a real scene that became a manufactured genre. So, a lot of things could be said about it. Supposedly "Hype" is the movie to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know the big influences behind grunge music (what they were listening to, but wasn't picked up by the mainstream), check out: (a) Earth -- frontman Dylan Carlson both introduce Kurt to Heroin and bought him the shotgun that was used to kill him. (b) On Youtube google "Butthole Surfers Portland" and you will see the 1990s concert that Kurt and Courtney and veritable who's who and who wasn't of the future grunge scene attended.

       You damn sure werent hearing punk on Top 40 radio back then, but college and alt rock stations were giving it airplay. 
I was a dj at my college radio station from '88-90. Bands like the Cramps, Chili Peppers, and the buttholes were always on the playlists of a lot of college stations in those days.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Portland had a half decent college station then, I could see where it would influence the scene.

       I am telling you the way in which grunge is often discussed in music journalism. I am not arguing my own view on it. I am describing the way in which the mainstream of rock criticism describes it. Often the mainstream is wrong.

       Portland has a legendary long running free-form radio station called KBOO. Portland State University also had a great radio station that went on-line only ~5 years ago. Reed's radio station fell apart in 2002 with a building move and a anti-drug crackdown, but in the mean-time it's legendary music collection inspired Dr. Demento.

       Either way, he's dope as hell (pun intended.) My two personal favorite Earth albums are Phase 3 (early Earth) and Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull (later Earth.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Early Earth is more intense metal drone that inspired Cobain, and made a co-worker look at the ground for awhile after I used it to show that people did in fact rock harder than "Slayer" (a tattoo of whom he had.) Later Period has more instruments and has sort of a Southern Gothic feel. In terms of sound, I'd say Early Earth is to Nirvana as Later Earth is to Mazzy Star.

       Feel free to disagree. This is not my opinion. However, it's pretty much the standard opinion of music criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might not be metal+punk the way you're thinking, but that is the influence. Punk rock aesthetics slowed down with metal rifts transformed into it's own things.

       Gangsta Rap and Grunge came out at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Young blacks were encouraged to sell drugs and commit violence via drive-by's. The survivors went to jail for selling the drugs, profits taken via civil forfeiture (not to mention those made from moving the drugs into the ghettos in the first place.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Young whites were encouraged to do drugs (heroin chic) and mark themselves via tattoos and piercings to prevent moving up in corporate and political structures. This was aimed at lower and middle class youths, and took out their wealth via drugs, gave it to blacks, and then to the structure. Rich white youths were insolated.
      </p>
      <p>
       These forms of music worked hand-in-hand to disenfrancize the youths of both groups in a compatible way. Criminal slack anti-government ideologies that in no way were threats to the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about what I said about Gangsta Rap and Grunge. Beck actually summed up what was going on there in the song Loser. The line "Drive-by Body Pierce" perfectly sums up the connection of these two types of music.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the squares "It's just another manic monday" "Everyone's working for the weekend" "You can work from home" .... listen to pop radio and see how many songs by millionaires about working 9-5 jobs, and then spending all your money as fast as you can as opposed to investing.

       Speaking of, below is a small selection of the lyrics by the band and their song title
      </p>
      <p>
       leftover crack - clear channel(fuck off)
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been waiting far too long
To change the band, to change the song,
Through every day and dusk and dawn
We've been brain washed to sing along.
No difference between the hot new single,
And the Pepsi ads commercial jingle.
The beauty's withered, faded, crinkle,
Just sip the Coke and pop the Pringle.
The boardroom is the dragons lair,
They play us shit 'cause they don't care.
The clearest channel plays unfair,
And we all want you off the air.
Overdose on shoddy culture; mediocre trends,
Auto-tune the bottom line as a means to meet the ends.
Merging corporate empires create the ill conglomerations
And buy up to reprogram major market radio stations.
Fabricate one single voice, broadcast from sea to sea,
What once held notions of change and choice is now being controlled fully.
Deregulation's raised the edge of exploitation's bar,
Politics is replaced by "bling" and clothes and fancy cars.
Trapped imaginations from the video's blinding light,
Bombarded with monotony that captivates the sight.

       Generals gathered in their masses,
just like witches at black masses.
Evil minds that plot destruction,
sorcerer of death's construction.
In the fields the bodies burning,

Death and hatred to mankind,
poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!

Why should they go out to fight?

Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess

       Now in darkness, world stops turning,
ashes where the bodies burning.

hand of god has struck the hour.

on their knees the war pigs crawling.
Begging mercy for their sins,
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings...Oh lord, yeah!

       I read that Darwin had a hypothesis that he never published because he had no way to verify it but he believed that music was invented by man 10,000's of years before verbal communication which would explain why music seems to emotionally move us much more than any speech can.

       A lot of hip-hop suggests that the status quo is undesirable. It’s possible some hip-hop artists have been compromised, however.

       They have know about this and made use of it for a long time now. The entertainment industry is controlled and it is the reason that only certain types of songs, or content, or singers are allowed.

       I love your posts dude. I always read your comments without seeing the username and think "Damn, this guy is on point", only to realise its yet another Zhanli original. 
As for the post, you're 100% on the button. Zero tolerence for politics in Music scene today, although some already established artists do manage to sneak a few gems into their albums occasionally.

       The remake of the crab berries Zombie by bad Wolves is getting a lot of air time. I've seen it played at various bars down here in Destin with a huge military presence due to Eglin AFB. Sometimes I wonder if they know what they are listening to as they dance. Btw the albums are called False Flags Pt.1 and Pt.2.

       In the mainstream commercial world they very well perhaps have. Seeings I can't stomach the nauseatingly meaninglessness of the majority of it, I avoid it as much as possible. IMO it's largely shit, brain dulling, bubblegum pop and so removed from my life and reality. Others may argue otherwise but when media outlets on the whole feed us fast food like meaningless distractions I would be led to believe why would mainstream commercial radio and its similar outlets be any different.

       I do know in the Punk Rock/pop/skate genre there's heaps of bands with an anti war message and all manner of commentary regarding government and corporate influence, capitalism, fascism, racism and everything in between. As an angry, middle class, white male, living in suburbia in his early teens all of now, 25 years ago, once exposed to the genre I never looked back. Bands quickly off the top of my head, for a no where near a comprehensive list for anyone interested from predominately the 90s on wards would include:

       It's not that anti-establishment, revolutionary themes are prohibited from popular music, but that these themes have been successfully recuperated and banalized. Childish Gambino's new song is a perfect example: it appears to be a critique but it's also club and radio-appropriate. A better example, though, is Che Guevara, whose face is reproduced on cheap t-shirts and posters. Once a revolutionary, now just a commodity.

       It seems weird, but yes, it took humans a really long time to come up with the concept of playing two different notes at the same time.

       Feel free to disagree. This is not my opinion. However, it's pretty much the standard opinion of music criticism.

       It might not be metal+punk the way you're thinking, but that is the influence. Punk rock aesthetics slowed down with metal rifts transformed into it's own things.

       Either way, he's dope as hell (pun intended.) My two personal favorite Earth albums are Phase 3 (early Earth) and Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull (later Earth.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Early Earth is more intense metal drone that inspired Cobain, and made a co-worker look at the ground for awhile after I used it to show that people did in fact rock harder than "Slayer" (a tattoo of whom he had.) Later Period has more instruments and has sort of a Southern Gothic feel. In terms of sound, I'd say Early Earth is to Nirvana as Later Earth is to Mazzy Star.
