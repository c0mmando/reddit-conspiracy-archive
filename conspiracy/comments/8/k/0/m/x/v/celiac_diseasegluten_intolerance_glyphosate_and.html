       I cannot eat gluten. Well, I can, but most of the time, it will royally fuck me up. I still have not figured out what exactly is messing with my gut/bowels - but gluten definitely has a strong connection with the bloating/diarrhea/abdominal pain/inflammation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen for several years, stories and studies regarding the link between using glyphosate and gluten intolerance, however everytime the topic comes up I learn a few new things or hear of a book or study I have not seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figured that there are probably quite a few of us on here that suffer from this or have a family member or friend who do and that this would be the perfect atmosphere to discuss and share anything related to it. Anecdotal or not, lets talk about this and see what we can learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal story and how I became a celiac is probably slightly different from most. I live in New Zealand. Around 2001-2004 we had had an invasive 'highly destructive' moth(the painted apple moth) introduced(accidentally/illegally) that showed up in west Auckland - where I lived at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       For months/years - we had hercules aircraft spraying our neighbourhoods with what has been rumoured(or confirmed, not sure) to contain phosphorylate and a bunch of other bad shit. I remember walking to school with it 'raining' this stuff on me and all the other kids stupid enough to not stay home. It was sticky - and I would get sticky, by the time I got to school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around this time, I got a large growth on my testicle. It was benign, but it happened within 6 months of this spraying started. At the same time, I started getting extremely lathargic, and continued to get worse over the next few years. To the point that 14+ hours of sleep a day was still leaving my extremely tired. I fell asleep in class constantly throughout highschool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone just said it was because I am lazy, or a teenager and teenagers sleep lots and all this other shit. By the time I was 17, it got so bad I actually couldn't function as a normal human being. Sleeping or napping was 75% of my life. Dehydration was a constant regardless of water levels consumed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I finally, through the magic of the internet, receievd some advice that I may be a celiac and should try avoiding gluten to see what happens. I did this, and within about 2 days I felt like I had picked up a meth habit. The energy, the life - I could not believe that this was possible. To wake up and literally jump out of bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       From that day on, besides a few occasions every 6-12 months where I would eat some gluten as a double, triple, quadruple etc test to definitely make sure it wasn't all a massive coincidence, I avoided gluten and felt great for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking back, I can only assume my extremely high diet of wheat(for breakfast, lunch and dinner - like a good western slave) mixed with the high amount of glyphosate in the air that I breathed and all over my skin each morning for months on end - is what caused this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will I ever know for sure? No. Probably not. But my suspicion and life experience so far is definitely pointing in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please - share any stories, information, research and studies you guys have seen or know about in regards to this and hopefully we can progress what is starting to become a bit more of a clear picture regarding glyphosate and celiacs. And hey, if you know any other chemicals or reasons why gluten intolerance is becoming more common, share that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks :)

       supposedly wheat can and is dried with glyphosate, some people think that's why people have become gluten intolerant, because some of the bad stuff is still in there... disclaimer, i have not researched that topic whatsoever but stumble upon it at regular intervals

       I think I've recently become gluten-intolerant. I have chronic gas whenever I consume something with gluten. When I don't, my gas levels are normal. It's the weirdest thing, and I wish I knew what was causing this and how to cure it without having to severely alter my diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be from my constant eating out. Restaurants always find the least expensive food to purchase. It's probably riddled with glyphosate, and here I am, now. Would strictly eating at home reverse this? Hard to tell, but It'd be good to make a change to one of my habits.

       Gluten and the other lectins in wheat objectively have inflammatory properties whether you tolerate it or not. You shouldn't eat it (or at least make it a staple in your diet) anyway so the whole thing about modern wheat being worse than traditionally isn't much interesting. In all cases rice has always been a superior, hypoallergenic option.

       Calling yourself celiac without a diagnoses is like telling people you have cancer because of a new mole on your body. I have had diagnosed celiac for ten years. You could have an allergy. Actual celiac means the villi in your small intestine are being destroyed

       Every single symptom I experiencced was in line with me having destroyed my small intestines from 12ish till I was 17. I didn't list every single problem I had, but basically my shit over those years went more and more pale/lighter, more runny and less firm - I experienced worst symptoms when I ate more(I was eating more wheat in turn) and losing weight. Every single symptom stopped as soon as gluten was removed from my diet, and slowly over years, my shit began to turn more and more normal. I could and should get diagnosed properly but its money I don't really need to spend as there isn't any advantage for me to do it.

       Celiac is different than gluten intolerance. Celiac is a genetic condition where your body has an auto immune response to gluten. Gluten intolerance is when you can’t tolerate gluten but don’t have the genetic condition that is celiacs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gluten intolerance = glyphosate poisoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Celiacs = genetic hereditary condition where you can’t eat wheat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the studies all conclude glyphosate is a poison. Actually a derivative of agent orange I believe. I I recall correctly after Vietnam they just had barrels of this stuff sitting around as glyphosate was used to make agent orange. They buried any and all research, rebranded it as a pesticide and started selling it to Americans, farmers, and cities all over the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       This happened around the same time wheat was genetically modified to contain more gluten which is a binder protein. They then started using glyphosate on the gmo crops and the wheat gluten (which there was more of) started binding with it. This means pretty much any good made with wheat also now has various levels of detectable glyphosate in them. This includes: Cereals, pastas, breads, cookies, crackers, and anything breaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The symptoms from glyphosate are much different than celiacs. Celiacs have an actual auto-immune response where their body starts to attack the intestines. Glyphosate has neurological symptoms, as well as GI symptoms, skin conditions, liver issues, kidney problems, and presents similarly to an auto-immune disease but without the immune system attacking your own body.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also seems to leave the body fairly quickly if you stop consuming it. But once you’ve reached a peak sensitivity to glyphosate poisoning you start reacting to the tiniest amounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wheat also contains lectins and are naturally inflammatory and shouldn’t really be consumed by humans anyway. Wheat was a famine food historically for slaves and peasants. The wealthy elite didn’t really eat it and still don’t.

       Agent orange was an herbicide used to clear jungles, comprised of two different herbicides developed in the 40s. Why would you like about something so mundane and trivial? Even the people making agent orange knew the dangers of it and warned the government, but due to wartime manufacturing laws the government was able to force them to produce it.

       There’s plenty of research to indicate ketogenic  diets are perfectly natural and healthy. Many people thrive on them, the same way some people thrive on vegan diets. Everyone is different, and keto is a perfectly natural and healthy diet to explore and see if it’s right for you.

       Low-carbohydrate diets can lead to weight gain and heightened risk of heart disease, according to a new study in Sweden. As part of an effort to reduce heart disease risk in the 1980s, more than 140,000 individuals were encouraged to decrease their fat intake. They did so, and their cholesterol levels fell—for a while. However, in the early 2000s, the low-carbohydrate diet fad led many of these individuals to forgo healthful carbohydrates and eat fattier foods instead. The results were higher cholesterol levels and overall increased heart disease risk.
      </p>

       Remember the Atkins diet? He died of a heart attack for a reason.

       Atkins diet was not the same as keto or paleo, although similar Atkins had a specific routine to his diet and his personal health is not an indicator of an entire diet. People die, it happens.

      <p>
       Unfortunately, you've fallen for good old fashioned American propaganda spread for 50-60 years by the sugar industry and lobbyists. The human body actually does not require carbohydrates, its a short term energy supply. Fat and protein are actually the bodies longterm energy supplies. While we do need to do some research on the longterm effects of keto, the short term effects are profound and have helped heal many people of chronic illnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, you don't even need to eat daily. Go check out r/fasting and see how many people fast regularly or do intermittent fasting. It also has profound health benefits and can actually induce stem cell production and help repair the body. You only need to eat maybe 1-2 times per day, and can sustain fasts regularly up to 48-74 hours regularly, especially if you are healthy and have extra fat to burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have now provided close to a hundred medical research studies proving you wrong. My guess is you're either not going to reply to this or try and insult me in your next reply because of cognitive bias, but I assure you what I am telling you is true. I have been using keto based diets for years now, and recovered from several chronic illnesses as a result and rarely have GI symptoms now thanks to diet modification.

       Even if our bodies were designed by natural selection to eat mostly fruit, greens and seeds for 90% of our evolution, why didn’t we better adapt to meat-eating in the last 10%, during the Paleolithic? We’ve had nearly two million years to get used to all that extra saturated fat and cholesterol. If a lifetime of eating like that clogs up nearly everyone’s arteries, why didn’t the genes of those who got heart attacks die off and get replaced by those who could live to a ripe old age with clean arteries, regardless what they ate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because most didn’t survive into old age; they didn’t live long enough to get heart attacks. When the average life expectancy is 25, then the genes that get passed along are those that can just get us to reproductive age by any means necessary, and that means not dying of starvation. So the higher the calorie foods, the better. So eating lots of bone marrow and brains, human and otherwise, would have a selective advantage, as would discovering a time machine stash of Twinkies, for that matter. If we just have to live long enough to get our kids to puberty to pass along our genes, then we don’t have to evolve any protections against the ravages of chronic disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       To find a population nearly free of chronic disease in old age, we don’t have to go back a million years. In the 20th century, networks of missionary hospitals in rural Africa found coronary artery disease virtually absent–and not just heart disease, but high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, common cancers, and on down the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a sense, these populations in rural China and Africa were eating the type of diet we’ve been eating for 90% of our last 20 or so million years–a diet almost exclusively of plant foods. How do we know it was their diet that protected them, and not something else?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 25-year update to their original Paleo paper, the authors tried to clarify that they did not then, and do not now, propose that people adopt a particular diet just based on what our ancient ancestors ate. Dietary recommendations must be put to the test. That’s why the pioneering research of Pritikin, Ornish, and Esselstyn is so important, showing that plant-based diets can not only stop heart disease, but have been proven to reverse it in the majority of patients. Indeed, it’s the only diet that ever has–perhaps because that’s what we ate through the vast majority of our evolution.

       I did refute your claims. You claimed carbs are necessary, they aren't. You claimed keto based diets cause weight gain, they actually do the opposite. You claimed I didn't have any sources, I provided links to dozens of studies proving you wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then ignored most of those studies, and are continue to spread food pyramid style propaganda. In fact, you're actually now arguing in favor of a vegan diet essentially which is fine. You should have just done that in the first place, I do believe vegan diets and alkaline diets are beneficial for some people and different health conditions. However, the same is try of keto diets.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all come from different genetic backgrounds and handle different foods differently. We all also have different health problems, and in the case of auto-immune issues there is science to support specific carb diets are beneficial for healing the digestive system so that people can eventually eat more carbs again. The intention of the GAPS diet for example is to give your body the nutrition it needs from bone broths to heal the intestinal lining. It's a short term diet for repairing the digestive system. It is not a lifestyle diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree science is true whether you want it to be or not, which is why I provided plenty of science to prove your claims inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is keto is just as viable a diet as veganism, and even if you are a vegan you shouldn't be eating processed wheats and GMOs. What you eat matters, and wheat is not healthy for human consumption.

       Robert Atkins, the inventor of the Atkins diet, did NOT die from a heart attack. You are the liar here. I remember when it happened, I was watching the news that day and there was a segment about it, and a poor-taste quip from the newslady - about how he
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       die from the Atkins diet.

       As for your 'study', you aren't even arguing the point properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As part of an effort to reduce heart disease risk in the 1980s, more than 140,000 individuals were encouraged to decrease their fat intake.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wait, what? Keto is not 'decrease fat intake'. And then it goes on to say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        However, in the early 2000s, the low-carbohydrate diet fad led many of these individuals to forgo healthful carbohydrates and eat fattier foods instead. The results were higher cholesterol levels and overall increased heart disease risk.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wait, what?(again?) So.. did they decrease their CARBS or did they decrease their FAT? Those aren't the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And wait, if they are implying that 140'000 people were doing low-fat, then switched to low-carb, and then in turn they got:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The results were higher cholesterol levels and overall increased heart disease risk.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then that is STILL a moot people. Because 'increase heart disease risk' is not really evidence of anything. Was their an increase in HEART DISEASE? No. There was an increase in 'risk'. Because of 'high cholesterol'. Something that, oh by the way, has not actually been proven to be a direct link to heart disease - that's another food myth perpetuated by big-agri/food pyramid.

       Wow, amazing. I havne't heard of this - glyphosate
       <em>
        poisoning
       </em>
       ? I was under the impression glyphosate was simply altering the gut in some way to create gluten intolerance permanently - not that there was levels of glyphosate in your gut which is poisoning you and that glyphosate leaves over time essentially allowing it to be consumed again later as long as its back down to 'manageable' levels?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been wondering what would be great natural food for gut flora health, and its mushroom season here in NZ - and I've been looking at edible mushrooms over the last few days funnily enough and they are really easy to get so I'll be going and eating some wild mushrooms and see how it helps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers for your post dude.

       Glyphosate likely does alter the microbiome and could cause longterm issues if it is killing off beneficial bacteria but I don't know. That needs to be studied further, but is not outside the realm of possibility to have longterm side effects from glyphosate exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short term glyphosate poisoning is entirely different. This doesn't mean you can just stop eating glyphosate products and then feast on them years later, you will get sick every time you eat anything that contains glyphosate. The thing is a lot of people eat glyphosate and get symptoms such as brain fog and fatigue and don't realize they're experiencing glyphosate poisoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is immune to glyphosate, just some people notice it more than others and once your immune system identifies it as poison and starts reacting to it every time you eat more of it you will get sick. Some people process it quickly and don't notice as many side effects from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If for example you do not have celiacs but have identified you are "gluten sensitive" then were to eat organic wheat you grew at home yourself without glyphosate and from a wheat plant without extreme gluten levels and eat it then you probably wouldn't get sick. If someone with celiacs were to do this they would still get sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for gut flora, yes mushrooms are amazing. Turkeytail I've heard is really good for gut flora, I really like reishi, cordyceps, chaga, shiitake, and a few others. They've made a huge impact on my overall health and digestive issues. Host Defense is an awesome brand.

       Wow thanks! I have seen these growing quite prolifically in my mushroom area I visit. I've only recently starting learning about mushrooms beyond the magic variant, which I've hunted for 10 years now. It's funny how many mushrooms I've looked at year after year thinking they are poisonous etc that are turning out to be either extremely delicious and rare/expensive, or really good for you and unavailable fresh anywhere. Almost makes me want to start my own mushroom business haha.

       Yeah mushrooms are powerful for improving health issues. I’ve tried a lot of supplements, drugs, etc. and non-psycho active mushrooms like lions maine, reishi, cordyceps, chaga, etc. can truly heal a variety of health problems, give you more energy, and improve everything from energy to digestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They’re totally overlooked by most people, but they’re the real deal when it comes to healing.

       Buddy of mine randomly became gluten intolerant after moving to Europe.  It took him about three years to narrow it down to gluten.  He initially thought it was lactose but eventually figured it out.   Doctors thought he was faking it just to get on disability benefits... even though he was basically laying in bed with stomach cramps for 90% of the day.

       Hey I don’t know what it is either but when I eat gluten my arthritis kicks in to overdrive and cripples me. The only thing that helps is cannabis, thank god. Wish I could eat it but just thinking about the pain it will cause is enough to stop that thought. I also eat organic and do the best I can to avoid glyphosate in case that is the problem.
