I&#39;m fine with them hating Trump, to each their own, but it seems to go beyond that.</p>

<p>Anyway... what the fuck is this? I get &#39;priming&#39;, you listen to a song on the radio and mis-understand a lyric, and then someone tells you the right way and you won&#39;t hear the wrong way anymore.</p>

<p>But &quot;yanny and laurel&quot;? Come the fuck on, thats too much... and I put that shit into Audacity to try reducing the pitch and it sounds nothing like the youtube video claims... it sounds EXACTLY LIKE YANNY AND LAUREL... but with lower pitch..</p>

<p>How are we normalizing misinterpretation of sounds now. What is this fucking shit?</p>

<p>Also, what if you say both in the same sentence, do you just hear yanny and yanny, or laurel and laurel..</p>

<p>Please god, destroy this pitiful planet and rid the universe of this stupidity.</p>

<p>Viewing a video that claims you experience senses differently than 50&amp;#37; of the population.... there is some nefarious with that... they are like subliminally breaking down some subconcious processes in people who watch this.. like the RING kills people, this changes your mind state... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only heard about this today from a coworker. I have my somewhat interesting perspective to add- when they first showed it to me, they simply said &quot;listen to this, what do you hear?&quot; and at first, I didn&#39;t hear any word, I just heard a noise, that ended in an &quot;ny&quot; sound. While I was still processing this, they said &quot;is it Yanny or Laurel&quot; and as soon as they said it, I started hearing &quot;Laurel&quot;, because my brain now had a pattern it could recognize and latch on to. </p>

<p>Long in the short of it: This is just a clever trick that utilizes the patterns of the human mind- what you will hear is based entirely on your underlying mental memetic structures. Incredibly interesting, but likely not sinister imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah alright I got it to work in Audacity now.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem anything to do with your 2nd sentence though.</p>

<p>When you get to a low enough pitch, the physical data of the sound changes. If I pitch it up to max it literally changes the structure of the wave. Sounds like a chipmunk taking saying &#39;wawa&#39; now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no handicapped perception mang.</p>

<p>You take this sound, and at high frequencies it has the data to form one sound, at low frequencies another, then you just grab the exact point where it changes, record that, post on the internet, and half the people will say they hear it this way and half the other..</p>

<p>Everyone hears it at the same cutoff. IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything that is pumped through all media outlets (i heard this on a sports radio station even) that does not profit or benefit anyone in anyway is immediately suspiscious in my books. It costs significant amounts of money for airtime.. why waste airtime on a discussion of yanny or laurel.. even weirder is it was played over and over. </p>

<p>I personally think it is some sort of gauge to see if an experiment was successul or not. Perhaps we have been bombarded with different frequencies to change our brain chemestry or something along those lines.. if you do not think frequencies can have this power over you then do some research of resonant frequencies and how they affect objects. Also if you are famliar sound or electrical engineering then you understand the importance and effects of frequencies. </p>

<p>I think that if you hear laurel then you have not been successfully atacked. If you hear yanny.. well you are beyond saving... hhaha jk jk.. can you tell i hear laurel? :P</p>
