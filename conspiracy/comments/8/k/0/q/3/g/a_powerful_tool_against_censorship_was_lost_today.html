<p>One very recent and quite noticeable change was that Reddit has now changed something on their end to stop Github from functioning.</p>

<p>To those not aware, that is where our subs public modlogs were published.</p>

<p>I have not seen anything posted on this sub relating to that.</p>

<p>There is another option currently being looked at by the mods. Hopefully it pans out.</p>

<p>Just posting this to make others aware. Thanks for letting me inconvenience you for a couple minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s about keeping Reddit, and Google, and Netflix from having to pay extra to ISPs for their incredibly high and overbearing level of traffic compared to other sites on the web. <em>That&#39;s</em> why they are pushing for NN so hard, and trying to scare you into thinking it&#39;s YOUR costs that will rise (which they will, but in ways like Netflix raising their prices, not Verizon charging you. They already do that with how much &quot;bandwith&quot; you want).</p>

<p>Not to mention, they are pushing the idea that the only way to stop the big bad ISPs is if you hand over control of the internet to Big Daddy Government (aka the FCC), and let THEM protect you... not just from ISPs, but eventually also from &quot;dangerous radical content&quot;... ya know, like right leaning websites, or anyone that speaks out against the narrative.</p>

<p>It boggles my mind how much I see CONSPIRACY THEORISTS in a subreddit for CONSPIRACIES argue for government control over the internet. It really makes you wonder how &quot;organic&quot; all the support really is, or how much of it is from vote bots searching for keywords.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but small companies will have to pay too. And these days, most startups are already eating losses.

<p>Pay what? Small companies already pay a server to host their content. If an ISP starts overcharging smaller companies, then guess what? Other ISPs will arise in order to fill that market demand. Government regulation is what has caused the incredible lack of independent ISPs in the first place. The reason we have virtually no choices in the market is also the reason they are able to price gouge.</p>

<p>So all we need is a regulation against things like that. Basic antitrust laws. That&#39;s it. We don&#39;t need to hand over control of the entire internet to the FCC. THAT&#39;S the part that the pro-NN people aren&#39;t being told. </p>

<p>Yes, this anti-trust law is called net-neutrality, which means that a ISP cannot prefer traffic on a &quot;company&quot; basis, only on a service basis. </p>

<p>Net Neutrality is a set of principles. Net Neutrality legislation establishes that the government is in charge of enforcing these principles. We do the exact same thing with anti-trust laws. Would you say then that with these anti-trust laws we have handed over control of our economy to the department of justice? No, because that would be an obtuse exaggeration. If you&#39;re specifically upset about the FCC having a role with enforcing anti-trust regulations, then work towards putting together a law which will task some other executive agency with enforcing net neutrality regulations. </p>

Breaking up monopolies is actually one of the few legitimate purposes of government, so I’m not sure where you even got that idea. Taxation is theft, but in our current system it’s really the only way to ensure public goods (roads, fire/police departments... not things like college or healthcare). And the FCC isn’t necessarily “evil”, it’s just a bloated government agency that will always try to increase its reach of power and influence, because that is what government agencies do. I’m against expanding the power of any government program or agency, pretty much of any kind across the board. </p>

<p>Believing in small government doesn’t mean I support complete anarchy and think all government is evil. It’s just inefficient. The closer you get to local government, the more efficiently it runs. The bigger you get (aka the federal government) the less efficient and more power hungry it becomes. Not to mention, sweeping legislation that covers every state at once should only be used for issues like the national guard or military (and a few minor other issues that require a national standard).

<p>I think we can say that the larger a government is, the more room for error there is, and thus the more room for inefficiency.

The globalist multinational corporation can be one of the least empirically efficient things on the planet, only made profitable by leveraging the disparity between international markets.</p>

<p>I generally agree with this sentiment, but net neutrality policies affect everyone that uses internet, in the world, not just America, or Texas, or New York. There is a strong case for having the government enforce legislation which promotes net neutrality principles.</p>

<p>I agree, but NN legislation has nothing to do with increasing or decreasing competition in the IS market. It&#39;s about mitigating vertical competition between tangential industries. Most of these ISPs are divisions of larger media companies that compete with the same companies that are being throttled and held hostage for bribes.</p>

<p>Regulation is only bad if the legislation which designs that regulation is bad. You have to consider the consequences of any policy, regulation or not.

<p>That&#39;s actually very true, but we should get rid of municipal corruption and anti-trust violating regulation which actually keeps independent ISPs out of the market <strong>first</strong>, <em>then</em> get rid of net neutrality (if that is your goal, anyway). 28% of Americans have one choice of ISP, 65% have two choices or less, and 98% of Americans have three choices or less for their internet service. Comcast and Charter together have about 50% of the market (thanks to the Time Warner buyout from Charter), and the next ten biggest ISPs together have 45% of the market. You have to break that shit up like flour in a cake mix before you can even <em>think</em> about getting rid of net neutrality legislation (which I understand is already gone, yes). If your expectation is that deregulation will magically solve the problem of net neutrality abuse, you&#39;re unrealistic. It will take a lot of work to make something that will even resemble a healthy market incapable of violating net neutrality principles, and even then it won&#39;t be guaranteed to last. Net Neutrality legislation is a far better solution. IMO we should do both, deregulate the local markets and put NN legislation in.</p>

<p>Yes, and anti-net neutrality is about keeping Reddit, Google, and Netflix from having to pay extra to ISPs for their competition with Cable services provided by ISPs. Right now you&#39;re thinking, &quot;how does reddit compete with cable services?&quot;. What does reddit provide? A portal to access information. What do cable companies host? News channels. What portal are people accessing their news from now? Reddit, sending them to news outlets&#39; sites (many of which aren&#39;t owned by the same companies that own news channels). Where did people used to access news? From cable television. Who wants a cut of the money being siphoned from cable providers and the channels they hosted? Everyone pushing anti-net neutrality.</p>

<p>Why not both? Everybody just wants money.</p>

<p>I am for net neutrality because I would rather the internet be structured in such a way that all websites and their users paid a standard fee for a standard service that didn&#39;t change according to bandwidth use. I hate the model used by cell service, and I don&#39;t want it to weasel its way into my broadband, too, nevermind the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7ej1nd/fcc_unveils_its_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/dq68mtu/">consequences of hostage taking by ISPs</a>.</p>

<p>Reddit has now changed something on their end to stop Github from functioning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Github is a version control platform and static website host; Reddit hasn&#39;t done anything to stop Github. Snew.github.io is one such static site, that pulls content from the u/publicmodlogs account, and hence from the subs that account mods. Near as I can tell, they&#39;ve suspended the u/publicmodlogs account, so we can&#39;t use public mod logs. </p>

<p>If anyone has suggestions on a work around, please contact me or the mod team. I <em>think</em> I can speak for all of us in saying we want to get something up to replace it if this is going to be permanent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the option was to not make a post addressing the issue until we entirely understood the technicalities, while rumors fly of a conspiracy within the mod community to hide the logs from our users.

<p>Also, there are plenty of people here who saw the initial post, and didn&#39;t get the correction.</p>

<p>Transparency is always good. However, the initial post was very unclear on what it was talking about on a technical level as well as it&#39;s supposed impact. Look at the title of this post. Perhaps something more like &quot;We&#39;re having issues with an important tool we use for this site. It might just be a momentary website issue, we will investigate and provide an update within 48 hours.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First let me say that I appreciate your work as a mod. It can often be a thankless job, and I&#39;m sure the brigaders as well as our own &quot;natural&quot; subscribers can cause a lot of headaches. I&#39;m giving my advice below, in an attempt to explain how I saw things, why, and give advice.</p>

<p>My main issues with the post was that it was no described why it was important, nor an understanding of the issue being faced. The latter would allow us to determine if it was true (as someone working on a github project at the time, I was confused), as well as how to help/workaround the issue.</p>

<p>The phrasing &quot;lost today&quot; also makes it seem like it&#39;s gone and nothing could be done about it.</p>

<p>For me this post would have ideally been something like this:</p>

<p>An unknown issue has just occurred with &quot;X,&quot; which is key to the running of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because of &quot;Y.&quot; We&#39;re currently investigating to find out if this is a passing technical issue or if we are being actively censored. Please standby for further announcements. In the meantime ....</p>

<p>Then I would have made sure that post was stickied until we knew what the issue and it was resolved.</p>

<p>Everything is an ad. Southpark already did a social commentary on this. Time to move on and either accept this, of slowly let it consume you/. I am just waiting till the content becomes unbearable and i too will move. prolly to 4chan or something. Who knows. </p>

<p>as of now, everything should be back to normal except that anyone who was using the old url for rss/json access needs to update to the new key included in that post. snew.github.io AKA ceddit.com has been updated with the new key and should be functioning as normal.</p>

<p>I also learned about modlog.fyi today which is pretty neat, though i do not know if it has the same kind of safeguards against potential tampering since they appear to cache data on their own server for convenience in accessing old entries.</p>

<p>even more interesting is notabug.io, a project by go1dfish to create a resilient decentralized reddit-like link aggregator. Told me about it when he updated the key for snew for me. Sort of feels like a hybrid of anonymous imageboards and reddit.</p>

<p>NN legislation does NOT require FCC regulation, yet everyone just accepts it as if it’s the only choice. And that is absolutely astounding to me.</p>

<p>mitigating vertical competition</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I.e. these ISPs competing with content providers through what can only be described as anti-trust violating business practices of throttling. I made no reference to vertical integration with the exception of those ISPs being owned by content creating media companies, but that isn&#39;t something I address as a problem that needs to be mitigated by NN regulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but does let the government get its foot in the door to regulate the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regulation is only bad if the legislation which designs that regulation is bad. You have to consider the consequences of any policy, regulation or not. There are good policies, and there are bad policies. Regulation is not automatically good or bad, and de-regulation is not automatically bad or good.</p>
