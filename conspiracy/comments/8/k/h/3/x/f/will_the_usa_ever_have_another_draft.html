<p>It’s clear somethings brewing. What exactly I can’t say but I just get this feeling bad times are heading towards the USA. War with Iran would almost guarantee another draft, especially if Russia or Syria gets involved. Yet some people think this will just be another Invasion of Iraq and we’ll walk over everyone. Wrong.</p>

<p>Do you think this could lead to a draft and if not, do you the draft will ever return. I for one can’t wait to be forced to die for one of their WAR$.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Millenial is almost a slur. Like there is something wrong with you because you are a millennial. It is a new stereotype, and unlike most stereotypes, I think it is wrong. I have found millennials to be thoughtful and cautious. I&#39;m gen x, we were kinda the rebel without a cause gen imho. We will do the needful, but to generalize, I feel like we are kind of vapid and uninspired. I think the millennials are a reaction to that. They are thoughtful and creative. I can&#39;t say as I have thought it all the way through, I just think we are in good hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Police</strong> = The Monopoly on violence leading to highest incarceration rate in the history of our species</p>

<p><strong>roads</strong> = A crumbling domestic infrastructure paid for decades ago</p>

<p><strong>TANF</strong> = A grudging temporary pittance for the citizens destitute in this predatory economy</p>

<p><strong>Medicare &amp; Medicaid</strong> =  Socialized medicine, but only for a few because insurance and medical corporations should profit from the citizenry&#39;s health</p>

<p><strong>free k12 education</strong> = an opportunity to indoctrinate the youth to become docile taxpayers who stfu. it is the indoctrinated view of &#39;citizenship&#39; which leads to intelligent people like you staunchly defending a system which only sees you as a source of tax revenue to be harvested. They don&#39;t want you to realize the social contract was broken generations ago and desperately fill your head with bullshit values and hollow nationalism. </p>

<p><strong>subsidized student loans</strong> = are you fucking kidding me....subsidized for the bloodsucking bankers ffs, not the citizens. this &#39;benefit&#39; coupled with only this type of debt being non-dischargeable in bankruptcy has economically stalled a couple of generations and will eventually implode the economy....this is a benefit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn’t mind being drafted. Someone has to fight. I don’t support any of our proxy, oil, faux currency driven wars, but I love my country and no one is going to fight for it but us. </p>

<p>But who am I kidding. People are going to flee the country in the event of a draft, shit they might have to get all of Blackwater and every other mercenary company in that bitch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the event of a draft war you essentially are. If you lose your country is in jeopardy. If you have a child, elderly relatives or child relatives they would be in danger in the event of the war being lost.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about the wars we have under way now. But if a world war broke out you would in fact be fighting for your country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my theory:</p>

<p>There won&#39;t ever be a draft again, it actually works against their interests. During the Vietnam War, almost everyone had at least one friend or relative who got drafted, it affected the whole country deeply. Compare that to the 2nd invasion of Iraq, maintained primarily by heavily-armed contingents of mercenaries or private defense contractors. Very few people knew of anyone sent to Iraq. The war quickly lost national interest, even though international interest remained high for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> you institute a draft, you&#39;re taking soldiers who are being tracked by friends and families at home. The Vietnam War ended because enough people were personally impacted by it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the rise of technology and the change in the way we fight wars, coupled with the sheer amount of distrust and dislike there is for the government; the government would be crazy to enact a draft and doing so would be a sign of disparity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>how can a ‘free country’ condemn it’s citizens to fight in war they have no say it and potentially die in vain.. </p>

<p>also, in the future of warfare, i’d imagine there’d be a lot more drones and technological increases in their autonomy and robots (kill machines) versus having actually live human bodies on the battlefield. </p>
