        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>... and to add insult to injury, they have started a &#39;whispering campaign&#39; about me and are spreading rumors that I was stealing food and that I am a neo-nazi. Nothing could be farther from the truth.</p>

<p>On Monday May 14 at around 1pm I attended a meeting with other workers and volunteers at a soup kitchen in London Ontario Canada called the Ark at Dundas and Lyle streets. We were to open the doors at about 1:30, as we usually did and the director there told us that we should start saying positive things about Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne and how, if it wasn&#39;t for her government and it&#39;s &quot;Community Meals Programs&quot; poor people wouldn&#39;t have enough to eat. He went on for several minutes and when he asked for input, I spoke up, politely, and said that I was non-partisan, didn&#39;t believe in politics and was thus uncomfortable about recommending any political party.</p>

<p>About 1 minute later, and with about 40 or so poor people lined up along the building outside, the 6&#39;6&quot; or so director was screaming at the top of his lungs at me after nearly physically forcing me out the front door.</p>

<p>&quot;GET OUT, GET OUT AND IF YOU COME ON THE PROPERTY AGAIN WE&#39;RE CALLING THE POLICE!!&quot;</p>

<p>After he slammed the door and locked it, I was still standing there in shock and disbelief. Someone asked me what that was all about and I was so shaken that I didn&#39;t answer. I just went around back to get my car and left.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I got out of my car at the Leathorne food bank and was telling a lady I work(ed) with there about this lunatic&#39;s freakout episode, and upon entering the building, I was told by a supervisor that I was not welcome there. When I asked why, he said &quot;Because it&#39;s not acceptable to steal food from food banks and soup kitchens.&quot; and the door was closed in my face.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve now spent the rest of the week asking around and found out that social workers at most of the organizations in the city are being instructed to give extra things like food, money, benefits, services to poor people while stressing that it&#39;s because of Wynn and if she&#39;s not elected these benefits may stop or be &#39;clawed back&#39;.</p>

<p>Folks, I&#39;m at a loss for more words here. I&#39;ve read a lot about this type of thing going on, especially in communist countries, but to see it and have it happen to me in such a visceral in-your-face way has me thoroughly shaken.</p>

<p>I have also had a complete stranger, well groomed late 20&#39;s dude approach me out of the blue and ask me if I&#39;m a neo-nazi because that&#39;s what he heard. What do you think that&#39;s all about? I didn&#39;t take the bait though. I told him to go f**k himself and spread his hatred somewhere else, just to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>And yet your entire post history is bashing the left and talking about politics. You&#39;re either a troll or some iconoclastic kid who had a tough time realizing that things like food kitchens and homeless shelters exist because of the failure of modern politics. They are inherently political because that&#39;s how they originated. And conservative political parties WILL cut their funding, it&#39;s in their doctrine and that&#39;s why people vote for them. </p>

<p>Economic Mobility Based On Merit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AKA The American Dream. In the United States (as an example of a profoundly capitalist nation) around 40% of people born in the top 20% stay in the top 20%. Around 40% of people born in the bottom 20% stay in the bottom 20%. <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/%7E/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/reports/economic_mobility/pursuingamericandreampdf.pdf">Source here</a></p>

<p>It seems to me that either 40% of people in the bottom quintile are making poor voluntary decision, or the decisions they are making are not voluntary at all. Why would they voluntarily choose to remain in the bottom quintile? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>one may leave a company with bad leadership</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A company&#39;s impact goes way beyond how they treat the people they employ. They may damage the environment, poison populations near resource extraction sites, employ literal violence and killings to protect their interests, and create monopolies. As a single consumer, my influence pales in comparison to a monolithic international corporation. One can no more walk away from a state than walk away from a company such as Monsanto. Their products and practices impact the global agriculture industry, and it is incredibly hard to consume food (in North America) that hasn&#39;t been impact by them. </p>

<p>I draw this comparison to show that while we may not see a corporation&#39;s standing troops, that their influence can be incredibly massive, incredibly harmful, and more insidious than a State. </p>

<p>So the majority of people in the top and bottom quintiles have experienced mobility? Damn, that is fluid!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>First of all, I do not think you understand statistics. Try sorting anything without their being a bottom quintile, it has to exist by definition even if every man in America was a billionaire.  But I get what you are saying and it is hard to burst out of dependency, particularly when the Government disincentives it. </p>

<p>And you also have the option not to do other business with them, not just employment.</p>

<p>You claimed earlier that one of the most positive elements of capitalism is that it is merit based. When I present evidence that is not the case, you state that 60% of the population in the top and bottom ends of the spectrum having mobility is actually a success rather than a failure. If it were truly merit based, the distribution of those earn their way into the top 20% would be an equal sample of each quintile of society. Since it is not, and since generation after generation those at the top ensure their offspring stay in the top at least 40% of the time, it&#39;s pretty clear (at least to me) that it isn&#39;t merit based on a macro scale. Of course you can find the individual success stories as well as the individual failure stories. But looking at it as a system, it is not merit based.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I understand how statistics work. What I&#39;m trying to point out is that if you go up to almost anyone and ask them if they wanted $5 million dollars right now, they would not refuse. Those in the bottom do not want to be there. Why would they voluntarily make life choices that ensure they stay there? Is it perhaps, that life has not afforded them the advantages it has given others, and opportunities for upward mobility do not come their way? Is this just the way things will be until the end of time? Or maybe, can we try reforming our society to do something about it? This is a critique of capitalism rather than raging against how statistics work. Any system that parasitically feeds off the backs of those doing the real labour in our society is unethical in my books. Ownership does not require any work, pretty much everything else in business does. Just because it is legal in our current framework does not make it moral nor does it make truly voluntary. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you read what I wrote, or maybe I didn&#39;t communicate my point well. My point was, regardless of whether I do business or not, some companies can do massive harm to people and the planet. When&#39;s the last time a boycott sank or radically altered a multinational? Nestle still has child labour in it&#39;s supply chain. Coca Cola still kills union leaders. Fifa still signing off on using borderline slave labour to build the 2022 world cup stadiums. Do not kid yourself and think the invisible hand will magically take care of these things. It&#39;s effectiveness in spreading ethical actions through the market is predicated on consumers having perfect information on every transaction - something they do not have and will not ever have.</p>

<p>No, the far left wants to dismantle capitalism. A complete revamping of the ownership of private property is at the core of socialism and communism. </p>

<p>In Canada, the popular left wing parties (eg NDP, Liberals, and Greens) do not have this in their platform. They are not far-left and are for the most part Centre Left.</p>
