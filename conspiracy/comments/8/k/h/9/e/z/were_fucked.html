    <div class="md"><p>In older times the ages were younger, but people lived shorter lives, and childbirth was incredibly dangerous. But that doesn&#39;t mean it was <em>good</em> for them.

<p>Now obviously, it&#39;s different if the parties involved are the same age cohort- that&#39;s more a part of growing up, and there&#39;s no emotional imbalance involved. But it&#39;s up to us as individuals to self-police, and to act like civilized human beings and not animals.</p>

<p>Actually, technically, you&#39;re right. While pedophilia is often used as a catch-all, it actually refers specifically to sexual attraction to prepubescent children. In contrast, hebephilia is attraction to pubescent children, while ephebophilia refers to attraction to older teens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people have a skewed mentality about this stuff. You gotta try and explain to them how children don&#39;t possess the experience or mental faculties to understand the ramification of their &quot;consent&quot;.</p>

<p>Also- you should ask her how she would feel if an older man or woman groomed her when she was a child, and made her think it was good and right for her to &quot;consent&quot; to their advances, before she had any real reference point. The psychological damage is the greatest of all in these cases- and many times children of abuse end up <em>defending</em> it, due to the psychological twisting they&#39;ve received- tho many do eventually realize what has been done to them.</p>

<p>No fully grown, completely facultied person should be seeking to persuade a child into these acts- it&#39;s predatory, plain and simple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you say that and be serious about it? Something is wrong with you. Teenagers don’t know how complex relationships can be because they haven’t yet come to understand the intricacies of social interaction that make self-reflection and enhanced decision-making possible. Most people have no idea who they really are when they’re sixteen and are therefore hyper-susceptible to influence from those that they assume are able to be trusted. The reality is that adults dating teenagers are almost always doing it because they realize they can turn the person into whoever they want as a result of that, which is wrong. Humans are selfish, and that’s how abuse begins. Honest intention is almost never found in these situations. It’s super easy to make someone who isn’t fully self-aware eat out of your hand and convince them that they need you, and they’ll never realize that their life belongs to them and them alone before it’s too late and they have a host of mental deficiencies due to their development being tampered with like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reagan/Thatcher/Friedman era was the beginning of shitty NEOliberal corporatism.
He was a shill. Some think he was the last of a good era but
he was the beginning of a bad one. Taxes went down on the super rich,
starting from Reagan. Extreme deregulation of the economy also started.
Rather than a balanced approach between personal freedom and economic freedom.
The guy was an actor man, come on.</p>

<p>Socialism is not one ideology either. Bernie was legit IMO
just sad he was rigged out the primaries and probably threatened to
endorse that shill Clinton. Look at all the signs, the corporate media
shat on him as if he was literally Stalin and even more funny an &quot;anti-semite&quot;
despite being ethnically Jewish himself (although not religious and not full zionist
but two state solution sort of guy which is reasonable).</p>

<p>Trump VS Clinton is a scam IMO. Maybe I won&#39;t change your mind
(Trump is either compromised by the deep state, was a zionist corporate shill from the start or is &quot;playing 3D chess&quot; which I find hard to believe) but the corrupt media was pushing for TRUMP V CLINTON in the early primaries across the world.
My belief is it was manufactured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They get disproportionate amount of tax breaks because they pay a disproportionate amount of taxes. How is this so hard to understand?Before Trumps TAX CUTS, the business owners, you know the jobs, were paying 40% in taxes. 40 fucking percent. Who the fuck wants to give half their money to a corrupt government for politicians to pocket and piss away? You&#39;re argument is ridiculous and can be debunked by middle school children. That&#39;s why all the JOBS, especially the best paying JOBS, left America and opened up in other parts of the world. Let me guess, you advocate for HIGHER WAGES, and HIGHER TAXES. Do you realize these two things contradict themselves?? Lower taxes means the jobs come back, the product are sold cheaper, the wages are higher. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why you so anger? Because I say something that goes against your strict ideology? Chill out man. You have to realize corporations have already moved their jobs to poorer countries, this is called corporate jobs outsourcing. It&#39;s helping globalism. They&#39;re not going to reverse it because those super rich shitbags love the economic slavery they can get away with in poorer countries. </p>

<p>Also realize the corrupt government is corrupt because corporate and banking entities bribe them. This is what money in politics has done.</p>

<p>The income difference is extreme: CEOs should be making not 1,000x their average employee
but maybe something like 100x, is that such a big deal? The higher paid
employees then contribute to the economy.....the money re-circulates WAY faster
compared to a super rich person who sits on 99% of his wealth and re-circulates only a little bit
once in a while (if they&#39;re honest....while the dishonest ones dodge tax).</p>

<p>Also realize 40% taxes for the MOST richest isn&#39;t a big deal, they&#39;re just being greedy. If I had 10 million a year, I wouldn&#39;t care if 40% (OF the amount of money beyond a certain threshold) is used to help fellow Americans via social programs. I&#39;m all for tax reform but giving the super rich the goodies is just not sensible. We&#39;ve tried that shit for 30+ years and the middle class just shrank. Hence people are sick of Dem and Repub shit. They&#39;re both doing it. It&#39;s not the level of taxation alone, it&#39;s also how you use
tax. Our corrupt government uses it badly....black budgets, privatized crony programs like Obamacare, 
bloated military, etc. it&#39;s all deliberate.</p>

<p>Poorer people should pay less, richer people should pay more, but obviously reasonable taxation, nothing crazy. 
When the depression was over and the middle class was created, we weren&#39;t giving super rich unreasonable tax breaks. But that was pre-Reagan. FDR did it.</p>

<p>Another realization is that even if these scum corporations leave for greed (they&#39;ve already moved jobs
because they don&#39;t give a damn, despite their tax dodging loopholes and free corporate subsidies)
small and medium businesses can fill in the gap and expand. They can now compete for top spots.
We should not hold ourselves at ransom to the huge corporations who have a history of screwing the people over.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to entertain other ideologies like centrism, that&#39;s close-mindedness that
often leads to a dead end and often incorrect and rigid world view. That&#39;s up to you. I was just trying to let you know the trickle down ideology is bullshit and it&#39;s here because elites benefit from it. There are way better economics than what we&#39;ve had under Bush/Obama/Trump. This is corporatism and it sucks.</p>

This was in &#39;01-&#39;02 so no reddit and people were rabidly against those who dared disagree, it was the with us or against us period. I have to say it seems that things have come to the surface and people seem to be more open-minded about  certain issues, at the same time there seems to be alot more people trying to profit from people who sincerely just want to figure out what the heck is going on because they can feel something is off.   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I actually agree with this. If you  can&#39;t find a rational explanation for your morals, then they aren&#39;t worth having.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s start with the simplest: child bodies aren&#39;t made to have sex. Even if a child was capable of consenting, their bodies are too small and having sex with an adult can cause permanent damage. For example, it&#39;s not uncommon for girls who are raped as children to be rendered infertile. Similarly, a pubescent child who becomes pregnant would also have serious health risks attached to carrying the  baby to term.</p>

<p>These reasons, I suspect, are why we, as a society, evolved to see pedophilia as immoral. And because we evolved that way, there&#39;s the additional factor of psychological damage caused to the child. And if the child &quot;consents&quot; at the time, there will still be psychological damage because they live in a society that isn&#39;t okay with pedophilia, and have a brain which evolved to not be okay with pedophilia.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the whole power imbalance to deal with. In almost all cases, the adult is the one who initiated the relationship, or grooms the child to, and they&#39;re able to do this because they are in a position of authority over the child, just by being an adult. (And worse, are usually a relative or a teacher who the child is expected to obey.) Using a position of authority to coerce someone into having sex with you is wrong. Especially when their minds aren&#39;t developed enough to understand what they&#39;re agreeing to.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that there are a myriad of reasons why you shouldn&#39;t have sex with children. These are just a few off the top of my head. Interracial relationships don&#39;t have these issues. They don&#39;t have the power imbalance, nor do they cause the same level of psychological damage, and they certainly don&#39;t risk causing bodily harm.</p>

<p>On this note, I disagree with <a href="/u/ApocalypseFatigue">/u/ApocalypseFatigue</a>&#39;s assessment  of your comment. Despite you playing at being an intellectual, your problem isn&#39;t &quot;overthinking&quot; (I truly don&#39;t believe in such a thing), it&#39;s underthinking. If you asked yourself why pedophilia is immoral and shrugged your shoulders unable to think of a single reason, you clearly did something wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Downvotes for logic. What a time to be alive. </p>

<p>U/infinight888 has unpacked the emotional shorthand of pedo-cringe into the nuts and bolts of why it causes that reaction in people of sound mind. It&#39;s correct that overthinking was the wrong word. In my experience on Reddit, there are people who play at being intellectually superior by trying to reframe pedophilia as a valid sexual preference  (while often also claiming it&#39;s not a choice and playing victim when cornered) are just pretending they don&#39;t already know everything outlined above. </p>

<p>Either that, or they&#39;re trolling, which is equally pathetic.</p>
