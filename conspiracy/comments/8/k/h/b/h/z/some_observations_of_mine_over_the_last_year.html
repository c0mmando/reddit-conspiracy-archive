    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       I've noticed a very interesting trend here over the last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a group of people who,  collectively, seem to take the same stance as each other on a particular set of issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally,  that by itself wouldn't raise any red flags,  but,  this special group of people always single themselves out by their strange behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       This group of people, who seem to have all day to spend here, are very consistent in a few special areas.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They only participate in particular discussions.  They'll do their best to interfere in specific topics with "Normie" perspectives,  but won't bother heading into posts which would interest actual conspiracists; they stay within a narrow band of posts, mostly political.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Despite this being a conspiracy sub which they apparently live in,   they seem to support the official version of everything,  from 9/11 to Sandy Hook.  The idea that shootings can be staged or false flag events is never a possibility with these folks,  because this sub is just "paranoid and likes to jump to conclusions". Nothing from this sub rubs off on them.  They refuse to spend any time actually entertaining a genuine conspiracy theory, unless it is one already generally accepted by the public or advocated by the MSM.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Vaccines are undoubtedly a good thing.   They do more harm than good,  so ignore the bad,  completely.  If you've got a problem with vaccines and the wretched ways in which they are manufactured or the revolving door policy of the FDA,  you're probably just an uniformed malcontent.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's no such thing as a Deep State. That shit is ridiculous. The President is the most powerful man in the world, and puppeteers us all with his money and influence.  The idea that there are shadow factions within our intelligence agencies operating above the rule of law is preposterous. No evidence of this is valid,  including Wikileaks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Oh,  don't get them started about Wikileaks.  Their campaign of transparency is treasonous.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump/Russia Collusion.   Oh,  the meddling.   Why won't this sub,  which jumps to erroneous conclusions about everything else, just follow the crowd when it comes to Trump?  I mean,  seriously?!  You'll talk about lizard people but you won't  entertain a smear campaign set in motion by the shadow factions which definitely don't exist?  FFS people,  follow the fucking crowd already!
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       These are my personal observations.   The folks behaving in this manner are outside manipulators. They simply don't belong here. Most of the "opinion" they put forth here is carefully weighed,  scripted,  and coordinated to fit an agenda of confusion,  disinformation,  and dilution of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: No, I didn't vote for The Cheeto. I think he's reprehensible as a person.  I don't worship him unconditionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not,  however,  going to be a useful idiot and follow the scripted manipulative prompts to join an official witch hunt and smear campaign.  I recognize the smell of shit when I encounter it.  I'm not a goddamned puppet of the MSM.

       Is this meant to be sarcasm -- a clever parody of gaslighting perhaps -- or are you really that oblivious? Of course we can quibble about whether any particular action/comment/whatever is the work of shills/spooks/whatever, but their existence itself is uncontroversial fact. Social media shilling companies even publicly advertise their services these days.

       Don't be afraid to make friends with thoughtful users. Learn names and pay attention. We got some amazing minds here. The more we cozy up, the harder these malicious interests lose.

       There are several users I have met on here that I consider friends. When my wife died, I called them for support. I think anything is what you make of it. I chose to make friends here when the massive political shill assault happened. And I have these amazing people in my life now. I dunno, get to know people here. It enriches the experience 100 fold. And everyone that takes that approach increases the quality of the experience here.

       Oh man, i am so sorry. My condolences about your beloved. I had  left my stupid comment earlier thinking it would read as a goof, i originally typed a sincere reply to your comment about making friends and i wish i would've went with my gut and been a little more conscious in choosing my words earlier. I hope i haven't squandered my chance of becoming a friend.

       Man...thanks. I cannot convey how fucked up my life is since she went. I obsess on weird ass shit. I will not wish this on my worst enemy. It was like getting half my body cut off. I was sobbing during deadpool tonight, it's fucking retarded, but my wife was a badass. And I miss her. I wish I had the guts to join her.

       That aside, you are already in my friends list. I don't remember how or why, but when I see thoughtful people I tag them. If we all did this, it would really make the sub pop. We need to maintain our anonymity of course(although there are a few users who know exactly who I am), but we can make friends. The bad guys can't fake good intentions. They can't fake positivity.

       Totally agree with this. Anytime I respond to the Trump/Russia collusion narrative with facts and evidence that contradict it, the same users abuse, ridicule and downvote me, without responding to the substance of my argument, choosing instead to launch vulgar personal attacks. They say some pretty nasty stuff too, very personal. Luckily, words don't hurt me so I just think it's funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I share your opinion on Trump being reprehensible. It's crazy how any deviation from the official narrative automatically makes you a rabid Trump supporter in their eyes.

       You're right, something is definitely rotten in the state of Denmark, in my opinion and experience.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is an excellent question,  sir!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty easy to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "normal" non-conspiracy theorist comes alone and acts alone.   They might say things which mirror the scripted propaganda because they agree with it,  but they aren't regurgitating the phrases and key talking points verbatim, as if they're consulting a fucking sports playbook which has every conversational scenario planned out in advance and each scenario having it's own cookie-cutter "debunking" response which seems to come out the exact same way even though it is being said by many different people. They have a will and way of speaking which is their own; it isn't  defined by the invading group's operational uniformity, nor their playbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might see them engaging with the organized brigaders and taking part in their circle-jerk conversations because they have similar opinions, but they don't travel around the sub WITH the group. They aren't "in on" the group's coordinated actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since they aren't in on the group action,  they aren't beneficiaries of certain obvious vote manipulation quirks.  When a brigader says something in an active but careless brigade, they tend to get upvoted regardless of what they said.  A brigader can be asked an in depth question and respond "ham sandwich", and that nonsensical reply will have 17 upvotes, just like most of the other comments left by brigaders.  This is because the brigade votes based on name,  not the inherent merit of the comment. They give an upvote to every comment left by someone in their group,  and you'll  see the same number,  17 in this example, repeated over and over throughout the comment votes because they all piled into a thread at the same time and did robot-like things which stand out against the backdrop of organic users. A normal non-conspiracist,  however,  will say "ham sandwich" as a response and not magically get 17 upvotes for it,  because he's not on their list of names to upvote indiscriminately regardless of whatever is said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also,  a normal non-conspiracist doesn't want to be associated with this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manipulators here have a hilarious tendency to pretend they are "hardcore into conspiracy since before you were born, dude" yet,  they don't speak our lingo.   They stand out like 26 year-old Narc officers trying to bust high school kids for marijuana while thinking they're "undercover" as seniors in the school. I've had many people throw a list of conspiracy keywords at me as if they think it proves they are knowledgeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Man,  for years I've been all about the Trilateral Commission, Rothschilds, Chemtrails, Rockefellers, Bilderberg, and their wretched plans for humanity,"  they say,  and then they went on to vociferously deny the existence of a Shadow Government in the same goddamned comment.  I mean,  FFS,  they know nothing about the culture here other than what they've been coached on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "normal" non-conspiracist,  however, doesn't engage in this idiocy. They aren't trying to be viewed as an earnest user of r/conspiracy.  They aren't trying to pretend they're one of us, because they aren't trying to infiltrate the sub,  they're just here to poke around out of curiosity or to troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between the organized brigaders and a "normal" non-conspiracist is pretty obvious when you step back as far as you can from the mess on the table and observe where the clumps are.
      </p>

       Is this meant to be sarcasm -- a clever parody of gaslighting perhaps -- or are you really that oblivious? Of course we can quibble about whether any particular action/comment/whatever is the work of shills/spooks/whatever, but their existence itself is uncontroversial fact. Social media shilling companies even publicly advertise their services these days.
