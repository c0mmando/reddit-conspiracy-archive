    <div class="md"><p>Eh- probably not an active list. But I&#39;m sure places like this are monitored in some way, so as to get a handle on the real rabble-rousers. But the serious shit happens off of the surface web and in the darkness of the deep web. Keywords are probably checked for, and particularly incisive posts are brigaded- but that&#39;s the extent of what they need to do. They aren&#39;t to worried about the average person- even if they <em>are</em> right about some crazy sounding conspiracy- because they have no real platform to spread this awareness. </p>

If they were to put us on lists, theyd send our troubling behaviour to institutions like the credit bureau, and employers will find out you are a dissenter and youll be denied a job over the next schmuck with the same qualifications who instead spends his time mindlessly watching basketball.</p>

<p>I hauled that hypothetical straight out of my ass by the way.</p>

<p>That’d make more sense then actually hauling people away. Its like how the next step of warfare after bombs was germ warfare. Attack the livestock of your enemy and starve them out. Something like that anyway.</p>

<p>My preferred endgame would be a decentralized, relatively stateless Anarcho-Socialism, with Social Democracy as a stepping stone to this. That&#39;s far easier said than done, of course. We&#39;re probably gonna need a post-scarcity environment before then, and that is something else that is easier said than done. But this world needs idealism and idealists- we&#39;re nothing without it. </p>

<p>Here is why you are on a list because you are interacting with others on Reddit already on a list. </p>

<p>For example, some of my friends / roommates in college and university ended up on security lists for getting arrested protesting the US and Canadian governments over nuclear testing, Cold Lake cruise missile tests, tying themselves to the anchor chains of US Navy vessels, occupying politicians offices, writing revolutionary communist diatribes, defending Palestine over Israel, etcetera. </p>

<p>Those associations put me on a list and now by being connected to my writing those keywords above, bingo, welcome to the list.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s gotta be a pretty big list. What can they even do with such a list? I do believe that there is a list but it&#39;s well past the time that it&#39;s usable. They are losing and can&#39;t round up all the people that are exposing them. I assume that they had planned on labeling everyone on that list as a radical enemy of the state but they could only do that if most of America trusted the MSM and our government agencies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the good boys and girls list if anything. Arse buried on the couch behind the trance like inducing pixels with a cold drink and bowel of chips. Whilst on the quickest and most capable medium available to bombard, engage and program minds with a litany of contradictions and half truths, that following a few sessions most don&#39;t know left from right let alone what to believe they&#39;re so confused.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the boots on ground, militant activist type individuals and groups that are on lists and commonly infiltrated by spooks. </p>

<p>I find that Spooner&#39;s thought so far seems to fit well with my Anarchist-Syndicalist ideas.</p>

<p>I can kind of see that.  Like I said before, personally, I&#39;m a Voluntaryist. I think that&#39;s the only way for humans to truly be Free and Sovereign.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good read thus far. </p>

<p>Indeed, and glad you&#39;re enjoying it! It completely changed my life, tbh. </p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
