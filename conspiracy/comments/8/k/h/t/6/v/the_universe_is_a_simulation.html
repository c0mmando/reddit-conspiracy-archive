<p>I feel bad for the Sim Theory folk and the transhumanists.  They seem to have the same questions, but way to desperate for an answer.  If they just held firm a little longer they might produce more satisfying answers than &quot;It&#39;s a Simulation.&quot;</p>

Hence, while an actor embraces a new persona, who are they?  Themselves wearing a mask, or have they momentarily become the mask?
Is there a real difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consciousness, Is the best answer I can give you to this.
All the way up too.
If you want to find the bedrock of reality, the realist thing,
We are nothing.  No form, no reason, yet here we are.  Jim Carrey said in an interview &quot;There&#39;s no you, there&#39;s no me, we are a field of energy dancing for itself&quot;  And I think this is a wonderful poem about what we are.
We are Raw unfiltered Consciousness, and to experience all that we are, within our infinite creative mind, we imagine ourselves to be.
 In a great video shared above a wonderful question arises.
If we are a spirit of consciousness, why have a body at all? why not exist as raw spirit? To which the answer came: &quot;What would chocolate taste like to just a spirit?&quot;</p>

<p>When a dear and familiar friend behaves in a new way, perhaps in an emotional state that surprises you, again, you may notice that your own manner has changed, your state has been affected, in essence, you are shown a new side of yourself in response to the sides shown to you by others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, if we are in a sacred geometric nexus, which I think there&#39;s adequate evidence to believe, Then the simulation does not end anywhere near us, we are a TINY part of the recipe.  Earth can be whatever shape she wishes, but I do think we live on a spheroidish shape for now, I also think that naturally occurring supercaverns exist underneath us and under the surface of most planets, these can take a lot of geometric shapes but octagon-cells, like in a bee hive, is what I believe we have on earth.</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t a divine origin still be simulation?
If so, then my conclusion would be that we are that divine origin, or at very least are made of it&#39;s flesh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, this is all some middle school &quot;i just watched The Matrix yo&quot; tier shit. It&#39;s a funny meme, and that&#39;s about it. All you&#39;ve done is run in circles over and over around this idea to make it seem like you&#39;ve developed it further, but really you haven&#39;t. This is about as annoying as all those people who watched one fringe science YouTube video and start telling me &quot;everything is vibrations man&quot;... Okay, a vibration of what?</p>

<p>You have not addressed the implications. Therefore this is nothing more than semantic masturbation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was sceptical until I heard this question, Do you believe we have the technology/capability to create a program that simulates all life (like the matrix) a computer program so we can observe how it unfolds ... Filled with A.I....If the answer is YES which it was for me,  then we are more than likely a simulation ourselves...made for the same reason by someone else...or we believe we are the first...original... Highly unlikely?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say the universe, including Earth, is like a massive quantum computer. I think that&#39;s a better way of putting it than simulation, because it&#39;s all very real, and we have free will. You can dive into the motherboard by smoking DMT, and I encourage everyone to try it. I&#39;d say yes to your question, OP, I dove into the mind of an AI computer in a sense- the computer of our planet. It&#39;s more intense and bizarre than anything you could believe until you do it.</p>
