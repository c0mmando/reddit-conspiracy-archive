       Maybe it's not a simulation, but rather matter encoded on a the 2D surface of the event horizon of a Black Hole, within another universe? Holographic Theory suggests this possibility.

       Here is a video with physicist Tom Campbell, and biologist Bruce Lipton, discussing how and why we are in a simulation, it was easily understandable, and very interesting. I'd like to know what others think.

       [serious] Let's say it is a simulation. Then what? What fucking difference does it make? At all? Should we all become nihilists? Should we stop caring to make life better because it's

       Right!?  LOL at "it narrows the possibilities down within human understanding."  Like everything has to be w/in human understanding.

      <p>
       I feel bad for the Sim Theory folk and the transhumanists.  They seem to have the same questions, but way to desperate for an answer.  If they just held firm a little longer they might produce more satisfying answers than "It's a Simulation."

       Gnostics from 3,000 years ago would be cracking up at today's transhumanists.

       It actually makes me feel better, which makes me care even more, knowing that we are all connected ,if this is true, and even the thought of believing, or not believing in God gets much easier for me, because God could be the programmer of the simulation.

       That’s how I feel about god. It’s some unknown creator on the other side of the screen. We have no way of understanding what it could be like cuz we’ve never seen/ experienced anything like the actual reality on the other side of the screen.

       I'm mulling on the thought that perhaps it's foolish of us to say
       <em>
        Just
       </em>
       a simulation, as I'm considering the idea that simulation is the only medium by which we can experience life through a body.
Hence, while an actor embraces a new persona, who are they?  Themselves wearing a mask, or have they momentarily become the mask?
Is there a real difference?

All the way up too.
If you want to find the bedrock of reality, the realist thing,
We are nothing.  No form, no reason, yet here we are.  Jim Carrey said in an interview "There's no you, there's no me, we are a field of energy dancing for itself"  And I think this is a wonderful poem about what we are.
We are Raw unfiltered Consciousness, and to experience all that we are, within our infinite creative mind, we imagine ourselves to be.
 In a great video shared above a wonderful question arises.
If we are a spirit of consciousness, why have a body at all? why not exist as raw spirit? To which the answer came: "What would chocolate taste like to just a spirit?"

       Tell me friend, When you are with a new person, and their new behaviors that you're not quite used to, but might even enjoy, You may notice you own behavior changes to meet the situation and you may be acting in a way that you never have before.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a dear and familiar friend behaves in a new way, perhaps in an emotional state that surprises you, again, you may notice that your own manner has changed, your state has been affected, in essence, you are shown a new side of yourself in response to the sides shown to you by others.

       If we're in a simulation, maybe there's a way to escape it. If there even is an "out". Does turning off the simulation kill us unconscious instantly (well maybe at least suffering would stop...) 
or would it free our "souls" or something into a real universe/or better simulation? :o

       If earth is a simulation, do you believe in flat earth? It would make a lot more sense for just our local area to be simulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe our reality can be described as a matrix, but I do not believe in simulation theory. Our matrix is the real deal and sacred geometry is one of the proofs we have that it is divinely originated.

       No, if we are in a sacred geometric nexus, which I think there's adequate evidence to believe, Then the simulation does not end anywhere near us, we are a TINY part of the recipe.  Earth can be whatever shape she wishes, but I do think we live on a spheroidish shape for now, I also think that naturally occurring supercaverns exist underneath us and under the surface of most planets, these can take a lot of geometric shapes but octagon-cells, like in a bee hive, is what I believe we have on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couldn't a divine origin still be simulation?
If so, then my conclusion would be that we are that divine origin, or at very least are made of it's flesh.

       Idk why we're getting downvoted? I'm fascinated by the idea of super caverns/caves. I love mammoth cave and wonder how the could play a role in military installations or deep underground military bases.

       Jupiter has storms around it's poles that form an octogan shape. Saturn has hexagon shaped on its poles.

       In a quick duckgoing I found two sources that obviously are not the final say, as this is a matter that will require ongoing research as long as we struggle to dig down into the crust more than a 
single percentage of it's depth we will not be able to conclude anything, But It's a thought worth entertaining, at least in my mind.

       I don’t think there’s beehive cuz that’s not really how caves form/how rock is weathered to form caves. Maybe octagon in the sense that there’s a giant geode like in that movie where they tunnel into the center of the earth.

       Seriously, this is all some middle school "i just watched The Matrix yo" tier shit. It's a funny meme, and that's about it. All you've done is run in circles over and over around this idea to make it seem like you've developed it further, but really you haven't. This is about as annoying as all those people who watched one fringe science YouTube video and start telling me "everything is vibrations man"... Okay, a vibration of what?

       I was sceptical until I heard this question, Do you believe we have the technology/capability to create a program that simulates all life (like the matrix) a computer program so we can observe how it unfolds ... Filled with A.I....If the answer is YES which it was for me,  then we are more than likely a simulation ourselves...made for the same reason by someone else...or we believe we are the first...original... Highly unlikely?!

       I'd say the universe, including Earth, is like a massive quantum computer. I think that's a better way of putting it than simulation, because it's all very real, and we have free will. You can dive into the motherboard by smoking DMT, and I encourage everyone to try it. I'd say yes to your question, OP, I dove into the mind of an AI computer in a sense- the computer of our planet. It's more intense and bizarre than anything you could believe until you do it.

       I don’t think there’s beehive cuz that’s not really how caves form/how rock is weathered to form caves. Maybe octagon in the sense that there’s a giant geode like in that movie where they tunnel into the center of the earth.
