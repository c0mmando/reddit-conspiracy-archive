       I posted yesterday from a different account, but I said this yanny shit was related to mandella (as in a psy op).
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at rpics, mainstream mandella post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at rmandelaeffect... Even they are taken aback by how pics got that shit first and not them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at yt trending, 10 yanny vida, just like 6mo ago when it was floodes with mandella vids.

       This shit is not organic.

       That reminds me of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_Dancer">
        the spinning dancer test
       </a>
       . When that became a thing, I read an article with the image at the top. She was spinning right when I landed on the page. I read the article &amp; scroll up: she's spinning left. At the time, I'd just taken a left/right brain test and scored 50-50, so it was a little interesting to chick the dancing chick out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't really interested in this beyond a cursory listen, but all I heard was 'laurel'. Maybe it's a left/right brain thing? ...even though now they say left-right brain 'orientation' isn't really a thing.

       I'm puzzled by it. Why do I always hear laurel...but that one time I heard yanni clear as all get out. I won't pretend like my brain is an organized place, I did a great deal of drugs when I was younger and it did some damage. Weird ass shit though.

       I dunno, man. I think it may be where the brain starts/picks up the loop/waveform. Are you sure you're making the right face? :)

You seem fine. I can't tell. Are you sure? There's a lot of good that can be said for drugs. You're a better, more aware, and more thoughtful person now, right? [Seems so]

       Oh i'm all for drug exploration. But I mixed alcohol and various hard drugs for the better part of 2 decades. They just make me psychotic now, literally causes psychosis. I'm fine when i'm sober, but I used all the dope I can use, and my memory is like an etch a sketch now. I have near perfect recall of everything prior to 2008, after that i'm lucky if I remember where I put my car keys haha.

       Alcohol was always the main bad guy for me. Just non-addictive naturals for me now, but I could currently pass any &amp; all tests  &lt;- not intentional, just the way it is :( I should rly look into selling my urine.

        recording of the word 'Laurel' on a vocabulary site, it sounds like 'Yanny' to about half the people who hear it.

       Its actually a great way to show people who perception can influence people and truth can be different to different people.

       I could only hear Yanny at first but with focus I found Laurel and now I cannot find Yanny again despite multiple attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear all but rhe highest frequency mosquito sounds so I think my perception of the distortion being higher made me hear Yanny at first until my brain could sort through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read Yanny is just distortion and the real word is Laurel.  So I also see this as an example how our senses and perceptions can lie to us and it takes concentration to see truth through the noise.

       Yes. This. I thought it has to do how you interpret your reality. They're trying to find who is out of

       It feels like living in American culture has become this cheap merrygoround ride in a travelling fair that should probably not be passing safety inspections anymore but nonetheless, it's HERE and so we're all trying to pretend it's both safe and fun. The ride is old, with dry rotting horses and flaking paint, but the lights are bright and the music is loud and it keeps on chugging, round and round. I know I can step off, but I also know I can't be outside looking in at this decaying shitshow too long, or they won't let me back on the only ride in town. It doesn't really matter. It's fake, pointless, unsatisfying. It's all we have.

       Slow or speed up the word Laurel and eventually you here fucking Yanny.  Nothing special about this and im sure there are many other words that can be morphed when you mess with the speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possibly to sow confusion, some youtube videos are playing a Yanny version some the Laurel version and some both.  Most trending videos only play the audio for you once quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trending youtube videos are suggesting that the Laural peoples hearing is flawed.  That is bullshit my hearing is fine.  When someone says Yanni I hear Yanni, when someone says laural I hear laural.  When someone fucks with the speed I can hear both.

       Yeah, I hear "Laurel" and nothing's wrong with my hearing either. At the risk of this sounding strange, I can hear cockroaches because they're very loud to me on certain surfaces. I don't know how common that is, I was actually just chatting with somebody on another thread that hears them. That was a relief that somebody knew what I was talking about instead of think I was full of it.

       I hear both and they switch by themselves playing back the same audio. I can't control which one I hear but it's clear as day.

       it comes from a vocabulary.com audio of "laurel"
      </p>
      <p>
       so it definitely IS laurel.

       Its actually a great way to show people who perception can influence people and truth can be different to different people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could only hear Yanny at first but with focus I found Laurel and now I cannot find Yanny again despite multiple attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear all but rhe highest frequency mosquito sounds so I think my perception of the distortion being higher made me hear Yanny at first until my brain could sort through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read Yanny is just distortion and the real word is Laurel.  So I also see this as an example how our senses and perceptions can lie to us and it takes concentration to see truth through the noise.
