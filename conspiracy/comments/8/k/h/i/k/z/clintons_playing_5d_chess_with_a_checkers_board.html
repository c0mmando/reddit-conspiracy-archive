       You have no idea then. I've seen what has happened to other subs on Reddit. I was in r/sandersforpresident when CTR first appeared, when it was shut down at behest of the Clinton team. I was in r/politics when it changed during the Dem Convention. I saw r/wikileaks mods change overnight and ban all discussion of Assange's whereabouts in October of '16, I saw r/pizzagate get shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw, and was a part, of these waves of users who found their way here- where these things could still be discussed. Sorry this is a
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       sub, where people are allowed to post their thoughts on stuff most consider to be "out there". Sorry not everyone here is a Corporatist.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to preempt the usual attacks from others- No, I'm not a Conservative, I didn't vote for Trump or HRC, and I won't forgive nor forget what the Centrists did to Bernie and to this Country.

       I mean, it's crazy how anti-trump people supposedly exist here, but there's not really much support for trump related conspiracies, which there are literally hundreds of them. Dude has such a history, you think there'd be so much dirt, yet I rarely see it hit the front page if ever.

       If you mean Russia collusions, that's because there's reasons to distrust it from those who support Trump, obviously, but also those of us on the Left who see it as the ultimate distraction from the failures of the DNC and the Corporatists, as an excuse to not change their failed policies, and shift the blame from HRC and her shit campaign to the "Russians".

       No, no I'm not. I criticize Trump for his Oligarchial cabinet picks and his failed Foreign/Domestic Policy...but I'm also not forgiving the Party, because they're gonna try and shove another HRC down our throats with Kamala Harris or Deval Patrick of Joe Kennedy III, and nothing will ever change. We've gotta take over the Party first bud, before we can take over the Country.

       Shows your ignorance. Tom Perez wont the race for Chair, they booted Bernie's picks from the DNC rules commission, and are ignoring the calls to eliminate super-delegates. You are highly uninformed. Also- the Primaries have jack shit to do with the DNC leadership- which is firmly Corporatist. We made some good gains this Tuesday, mostly to to Our Revolution which was founded by Bernie and his former campaign staff, but the battle is just getting started.

       So, were you anti-Bernie and anti-Obama as both their net worth were over a million dollars? It seems to me like you're "anti-corp" spiel doesn't really apply when most of the leadership has been wealthy in America (a capitalist state).

        You're Trump now? Wtf. I'm calling Trump a liar. You said you'd trust the word of a known liar, which was scary in itself. I'm asking you to question that trust.

       No no. See, you said that I can't be anti-Trump because I disbelieve Russia collusion, even tho I

       </em>
       anti-Trump. You also told me you doubt I voted, when I told you that I

       And here you are, painting me as a Trump supporter again, all because I called him a Billionaire. Despite all my other objections to the man, and our entire conversation thus far.

       Transhumanism is curing the human condition. Merging with machine could solve death. Editing DNA could solve death, we really don't know, but transhumanism is about pushing forward and making sure society doesn't try to stand in the way.

       To believe that man and machine must merge, that technology will cure death and be our ultimate savior, is the essence of Transhumanism. You should familiarize yourself with leaders in this field, like Ray Kurzweil, who is currently a member of Google.

       You assume I fear death. You're wrong. If death happens to me, it's not my concern, because I'm dead. I avoid death, I don't actively seek it. Luckily, I don't want death to happen to me, due to how good life actually is.
      </p>

       Technology will probably save me from death, unless I get hit by a bus. But even then, technology probably
       <em>

       save me from death (thanks to the amazing work of people building these machines that save people's lives).

       Hey man, you're the self professed transhumanist who thinks the human condition is Death and is seeking a way for technology to end it. Your words, not mine.

       Good luck with that. If/when that tech is developed, it will be kept for the Rich, while the Plebs continue to die.

       What doesn't interest me? The computer simulation theory is actually somewhat interesting, but hasn't really been 'proven' nor disproven. I scoped out a thread that posted some really strange stuff, linking to some really strange sites that made me question his sources.
