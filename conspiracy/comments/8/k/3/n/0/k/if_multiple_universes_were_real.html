       Hi,
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the time I have come to meet religious people who often says that a way to prove God's existing is by looking around, because according to them, life couldn't have popped up out of nowhere, plus, everything's designed so well and perfect. I once saw a documentary that explained how earth and universe have everything millimetrically set up correctly in a trillion of possibilities resulting in this order and life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with everything, except God's invervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the multiple universes theory, if I'm not mistaken, I remember it says that every universe that exists behaves differently from the rest, because each universe that is born has trillions of posobilities of multiple variables to calibrate itself. So let's say that in the vast creation of billions of multiple universes, one of them comes with the right calibration for the universe to exist in order and a planet with everything right so life could grow up. Is that possible?

       If we knew the answer we would tell you. How did these millions of universes come to existence in the first place? Something cannot be created out of nothing in my opinion. Big Bang doesn't make sense , neither does God. Who created god?
      </p>
      <p>
       Chicken or the egg ?
      </p>
      <p>
       From my limited knowledge, which i still have to add upon, I believe  ultimate consciousness was here first. How? I'm not sure , but I believe God is ultimate consciousness itself, without a body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimate Consciousness has no time and space
      </p>
      <p>
       It just exists and observes, but cannot experience anything due to having no time and space (distance)  concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matter was created by ultimate consciousness which created time and space. Something that is tangible and solid
      </p>
      <p>
       In time and space , evolution took place and created vessels (animals and living bodies) in which consciousness was able to independently roam the time and space and gather all the viewpoints independently to form  back into ultimate consciousness
      </p>
      <p>
       So with all the living beings in this universe, they all project their own consciousness independently , which in turn creates the whole map of ultimate consciousness
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why they say, god is within you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a small part of consciousness and with all the living beings added , it forms ultimate Consciousness god himself.
      </p>

       The chicken came first. The bird that the chicken evolved from layed an egg, that egg led a mutation that produced the first chicken as we know them. It was that animals egg but a chicken was hatched.

       We come from eggs too, like chickens and snakes. Not terribly different just that we gestate in the mother instead of under her, and a wee bit smarter. Which animal laid the chicken egg, which sperm fertilized the first human egg? The answer is obviously all life was created by something/one and the first flora and fauna showed up fully formed, ready to reproduce ad infinitum...

       Well, it's an interesting position as it lacks of evidence as well. I already thought something similar but with atoms, I thought life is a way for atoms to be conscious about its reality. Your posture is weird to me, how did you come up with that idea at first? And before finish, Big Bang does not say that the universe was created out of nowhere. Before it, all the universe was the size of a small atom. Nothing really existed, but energy; energy is the only thing that cannot be created neither destroyed, it can only be transformed. That being said, inside this reality we aren't capable to practically understand something that occurred in a different version of reality, because it would be difficult for our brain to imagine something without no space, or time, you know? Although it doesn't mean could have been that way. We will never know.

       I agree we are trapped by time and space and it's hard to see outside the reality
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like being a computer a.i inside a program. Not realising you are inside a machine , which is on a lower reality than the reality outside of it
      </p>
      <p>
       As for big bang ,  atom must have been created from somewhere too so that's why the big bang to me it doesn't make sense. Also how do you expand energy from such a small atom into what is today a limitless universe . That would imply that there was MORE energy added. Otherwise it implies that all there is today is the same energy as that small atom. In that case , why did this atom transform itself and how, since there was NOTHING ELSE to influence it

       Where did you read we live in a limitless universe?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I know, most scientist believe that universe has, indeed, limits. The universe expands itself as space spreads out in it. The galaxies are separating themselves. Anyway, scientific research have conclude that, at the begging, energy was only what existed and it was all accumulated inside the size of a simple atom. The whole energy of the universe was trapped in a tiny atom, which eventually the energy accumulated lead to an explosion, creating the universe, and everything about it.

       The mapped universe that we know goes further than one can think and contains more energy than one can think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen to what you are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole energy was trapped in this atom which accumulated enough to cause an explosion. So you are saying energy was created because how did it "accumulate " more to cause an explosion
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did it "accumulate "
      </p>
      <p>
       If the atom is the beginning , and there was nothing influencing it, then it would have remained the same forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even then we are talking about this atom that came out of "nowhere"

       My friend you're responding to has not described the situation accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, it wasn't an atom trapping it. Atoms could not form at that high energy. In fact, forces like electromagnetism acted like photons. Electroweak symetry was not broken yet. There is speculation all the forces, possibly including gravity were one. In other words gravity, instead of pulling objects together, might have instead be a giant light bulb giving off light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physics literally was not the same we witness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accumulate is the wrong term. We don't know the origins of the energy, but statistically there is a very very tiny chance a quatum fluxtuation could give rise to a new universe. By small I mean heat death of the universe tineframe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, there was no explosion. Explosions would require pressure. Instead we had expansion. Explosions need a space to explode. Meanwhile expansion either stretched and/or created space.

       Hey buddy, what's up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you tried to say that there's especulation that all forces, including gravity, were already trapped before the expansion along with the energy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the gravity actually giving off light or reflecting it?

       Trapped is not the right terminology. Let me explain electroweak theory(which is accepted and has evidence.) Electromagnetism uses photons as force carriers. Weak forces use the W+, W-, and Z bosons. However, standard theory indicates they should be identical. Enter the Higgs field which gives the Weak force mass, strengthening the force but shortening it's distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is called symetry breaking, as the Weak force bosons would be symetrical to the boson if not for the Higgs field. This only happens under 246 GeV. This means that at the beginning of the Universe there the Weak force acted like photons and nuclear radiation was not possible. Scientists are quite certain of this. The Higgs boson was predicted because a Higgs Field needed to exist for symetry to break.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less concrete, there are theories that above an even greater energy the Strong force combines with the Electroweak force, becoming identical. Additonal theories propose even gravity merges at high enough temperatures, however those are very untested.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used photons as an example, but we don't know which force they would become or if they would become a different force we do not know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has nothing to do with being trapped gravity giving off light instead of attracting was just a possible example. I unified gravity with electroweak and assigned electroweak properties to the unified force.

       Oh, I see your point. Listen, according to the theory, energy existed before everything. Before the explosion, the whole energy in universe was concentrated in one small point. Some researchers have found that energetic forces were accumulating in less and less space as time goes through. Time and space existed tho, but at the scale of one atom. Some pnysicians believe that space reduction could have made energy to accumulate in less space so it came to a point where energy couldn't resist more pressure and bum, everything expanded. After that, energy was all over the universe, but not always in the same form. The explosion along with the energy made all type of reactions, ending up in the creation of matter.

       You still need the first universe unless you have faith in ever more BS like how quantum mechanics allows atoms to pop into existence.

       The bullshit you talking about has been published by theorical physicians. It may be a theory but not necessarily something you would call BS just like that...

       Multi universe theory is just a possibility. It dosen't have evidence to make it an accepted theory, rather it's a speculative that could exist theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, none of that proves or disproves God. God being omnipotent could have created the Universe or multiverse in such a way knowing human life will form. There is no reason to think God crafted each atom rather then set in motion the machinery to build us. You could also think of free will as genetic randomness. Perhaps God purposely used the Universe to not create every detail.

       Yup, but just to remember, God is in the same level as multiple universes in terms of credibility. The universe could have existed with no intelligent intervention, or maybe it may do, but I would rather look as for aliens than a God.

       What plausible evidence of a multiverse there is? You can know there are other houses beyond yours because you know where yours ends. You can see, touch and measure its limits. Our universe? Nowhere near.

       Multiverses are fun in comics, but I see zero reason for them to exist IRL.

       Well, I see your standpoint of view; however, you may know that multiple universes in not only made of out of fiction. It's a real theory, but of course it cannot be proven in anyway. If believing in a single universe matches your beliefs, then do it. Personally I don't like much the idea of only one universe; I like to think that there could be more, coexisting all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, you cannot know there are houses beyond yours. In reality we don't know nothing. Not ever what is obvious.

       For that to be true, you'd have to know that there is something to be known, and you don't know about that something, thus at least this you know, leading to the conclusion that absolute ignorance is a self-refuting statement and an illogical fallacy.

       The simple fact is that we humans do not know how or why we are here. We are simply here.

       You can put any term on the origin that want (Big Bang, God, Multiverse, etc.) but there is no proof that any of them are correct.

       Correct. As long as multiverse traveling isn't real, we never will know for sure if multiple universes are real; in spit of, it wouldn't be right to just cross our arms because we 'can never know'. If everybody had the same mindset, then cars wouldn't have been invented at first..

       Even if science finds a way to prove that there are multiple universes it still doesn't explain why we are here or where the multi-verse came from. You seem to think that proof of a multi-verse is a disproof of God, but it's not. And it' hard to tell whether it's more important for you to be right, or them to be wrong.

       You are mistaken, sir. I never stated that multi verses are a disproof of God. God could have create those universes. All I meant was that if those were real, it probably could have happened what I said and thus we are here. But I never said there is no God. Thank you.

       Basically this. Throw enough shit at the wall and some will stick. Who knows how many billions of universes have been cycled through before one was created that could support us. The universe exists the way it is because we are here to experience it this way. No other reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a more interesting paradox is that of parallel universes, coexisting. This would imply that there are an infinite amount of universes with every possible eventually running course. This would suggest that you don't have free will to some extent, as every eventuality of your free will decision making exists in a different universe. Therefore "changing your mind" could potentially create a duplicate universe, which is impossible under the parallel universes theory.

       Did you tried to say that there's especulation that all forces, including gravity, were already trapped before the expansion along with the energy?
