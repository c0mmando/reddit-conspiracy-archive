       If there were a sex cult controlling the world, what would the machine of that look like?  You'd need people to control the scarcity of sex, right?  How would you do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd create laws and systems in place so that you could have the lever of false accusation.  Checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you decided to not broker the sex out equally then this would be in the statistical record.  For instance you could see how many more times females would procreate over males.  Currently it's 5 to 1.  In times past it was 15:1.  Checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there is inequal access you'd have to convince the providers of sex to give it to who you wanted according to the statistical distribution we see.  And since this cuts along gender lines that means you'd have to incentify women to be very selective.  You'd probably also want to use a bunch of social levers to consolidate this selectivity.  You'd engage in shame tactics against those who eschew playing in your sex game - eg.  MGTOW,  the terms "neckbeard" and "incel".   Checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd need to indoctrinate the kids in this, so you'd have to control education.  Checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd need other mechanisms too that you could game to achieve your control.  All the devices that take choice away from non-compliant citizens.  Eg. Psychiatry.  Checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd need to get people trapped early and convince them that they have no voice.  You'd use things like youth sports.  Notice all the sex claims coming out of youth sports.  Checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd write bigoted policy.  Checks out.

       Yes, I said it further back, not in the one where I stated that you aren't here to discuss conspiracies, and you tacitly agreed.  That's why you used a non-sequitur.

       Funny how you people decry Trump whilst at the same time utilizing propaganda.  Like the Russians.  Glad I had a father in military intelligence that made me wise to all of this ahead of time.  It's pretty laughable to see in action though.

       You'd desensitize society with porn so that by pre-teens they are secretly addicted and by teens they are seeking more and more perverse 'pleasure'.
And yea you'd repurpose victims as crisis actors when they're past their 'pizza' prime. 
Gosh that already sounds heck of a lot like despicable deep state.
