        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You may or may not know your food is subsidized by the USA government. Meaning, the farmer sells corn below the cost to produce and then the government gives farmer money to make up the difference. That corn is then sold cheaply to feed livestock, make sugar, and tons of other stuff. Make the raw product cheaper and all product made from that product becomes cheaper. This works in America. </p>

<p>But then what ppl fail to see is the government took that same concept and started subsidizing people. The government knows no one can live off minimum wage but they want to keep the raw product cheap so they subsidize poor people. The government gives them food, schooling, daycare, housing, medical care all because they know they need these people to stay poor. The government is responsible for ensuring Walmart, McDonald’s and other companies have enough cheap labor to use and if they keep the raw product cheap then you can pay middle class less too and so on. Look at EIC credit as another example. If you make 0$ then you get nothing but if you make $19,000 then you get a lot of money back, because they want working poor. Find a poor person make 19,000k a year and over 30 and tell them “thank you” for your service. That’s why minimum wage doesn’t go up too</p>

<p>People have a hard time picturing what might replace it, because they&#39;ve never been exposed to memetic structures that would allow them to conceptualize the world differently- they&#39;ve only had their own memetic structures reinforced and those of the &quot;enemy&quot; attacked.</p>

<p>So they stay complacently within the shit the system produces because they are honestly convinced it&#39;s the best way there is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just weird how personally you took his claim. You could have just inquired into other reasons beyond fasting that could have caused such a thing to happen (I thought he said his uncle passed out, not died) or agreed to disagree. Then you start going off about bench press and shit; it&#39;s odd. If you&#39;re always this on edge, maybe you&#39;re hungrier than you&#39;re realizing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People just see weird correlations sometimes. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s not a shill for big breakfast cereals or three square meals advocates. You see it all the time, someone tries a new diet or something and gets an illness they would have gotten anyway, and people blame the diet. There are so many examples of that happening throughout everyone&#39;s life. I have heard good things about fasting intermittently by only eating during a short window each day or by going one full day of no eating at all per week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People just see weird correlations sometimes. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s not a shill for big breakfast cereals or three square meals advocates. You see it all the time, someone tries a new diet or something and gets an illness they would have gotten anyway, and people blame the diet. There are so many examples of that happening throughout everyone&#39;s life. I have heard good things about fasting intermittently by only eating during a short window each day or by going one full day of no eating at all per week.</p>
