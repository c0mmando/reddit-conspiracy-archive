       You may or may not know your food is subsidized by the USA government. Meaning, the farmer sells corn below the cost to produce and then the government gives farmer money to make up the difference. That corn is then sold cheaply to feed livestock, make sugar, and tons of other stuff. Make the raw product cheaper and all product made from that product becomes cheaper. This works in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then what ppl fail to see is the government took that same concept and started subsidizing people. The government knows no one can live off minimum wage but they want to keep the raw product cheap so they subsidize poor people. The government gives them food, schooling, daycare, housing, medical care all because they know they need these people to stay poor. The government is responsible for ensuring Walmart, McDonald’s and other companies have enough cheap labor to use and if they keep the raw product cheap then you can pay middle class less too and so on. Look at EIC credit as another example. If you make 0$ then you get nothing but if you make $19,000 then you get a lot of money back, because they want working poor. Find a poor person make 19,000k a year and over 30 and tell them “thank you” for your service. That’s why minimum wage doesn’t go up too

       People have a hard time picturing what might replace it, because they've never been exposed to memetic structures that would allow them to conceptualize the world differently- they've only had their own memetic structures reinforced and those of the "enemy" attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they stay complacently within the shit the system produces because they are honestly convinced it's the best way there is.

       It's just weird how personally you took his claim. You could have just inquired into other reasons beyond fasting that could have caused such a thing to happen (I thought he said his uncle passed out, not died) or agreed to disagree. Then you start going off about bench press and shit; it's odd. If you're always this on edge, maybe you're hungrier than you're realizing?

       lmao actually i live in a state where weed is legal and im usually high and its the internet and idgaf he is using his uncles death (which he very well could be lying about) to downplay the fact that "eating 3 square meals a day" is a conspiracy in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why dont you ask him why he brought him his dead uncle out of fucking nowhere ?? His cause of death was not skipping breakfast...

       People just see weird correlations sometimes. I'm sure he's not a shill for big breakfast cereals or three square meals advocates. You see it all the time, someone tries a new diet or something and gets an illness they would have gotten anyway, and people blame the diet. There are so many examples of that happening throughout everyone's life. I have heard good things about fasting intermittently by only eating during a short window each day or by going one full day of no eating at all per week.

       These are the same kind of people qho deny the farmaggedon. They seriously dont know or want to know how big farm happened and it changed the entire landscape. That old movie trope of companies buying out farmlands and forcing other farmers out of the competition by relying on other means of i come to sustain low pricing until the competition went bankrupt and leans were put out to take the land which was then sold  to the big farms to create what we have now. And if you can get them to admit to the reality of this, theyll act like it was a good thing.

       There isn't enough water, steak and yacht. Doesn't matter if society had a trillion dollar spender to alleviate the poor. There isnt enough damn resources. We dont have a machine that converts carbon into H2O or into anything, we have chemical extraction . Takes energy to synthesize an element.  Same problem as the water problem. We're royally fucked.

       I love how the main global crisis right now is global warming aka climate change..... but if you really read between the lines (and I’ve not once seen anyone speak about this) were literally running out of oxygen...... using it faster than we can replace it because we’ve cut all the damn forests down and burn fossil fuels like a mother-f*****.......what happens when we don’t have enough oxygen on earth to sustain life?

       The reason that 50billion networths exist is because its like the opposite of artificial diamond drought, they need to keep injecting money to deflate everyones buying power.  Well apply this to things like water and oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may be enough resources, the allocation of raw materials is what this is about. They want all the say, they have all the say and we're building a student/slave/soldier economy. Its about the 'right' to banish peasants off a lords land. To starve their wives and kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had money you might figure out a way to be actually sustainable. You think the people holding diamonds back want that? You could get your own diamonds and undercut the artificial drought.
