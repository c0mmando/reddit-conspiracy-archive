<blockquote>
<p>The brother of Seth Rich — the Democratic National Committee staffer whose unsolved murder has fueled far-right conspiracy theories — has sued the Washington Times and individual activists, claiming they exploited the tragedy to “advance” their political agendas.Aaron Rich accuses Ed Butowsky, a wealthy Dallas businessman and a Fox News guest; Internet activist Matt Couch and his media company, America First Media; and the conservative-leaning newspaper the Washington Times of acting with “reckless disregard for the truth,” according to the lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ya thats right I went there. Is he calling it a “reckless disregard for the truth,” or is the DNC? Left Wing Media doesn&#39;t even ask questions. And exactly how is it a reckless disregard for the truth when his murder is still unsolved? Conspiracies exist to find the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most credible explanation for Seth Rich is that he was murdered in a high crime area. Failing that, number two is:</p>

<p>One of Julian Assange&#39;s associates did so to create a conspiracy before the election and blame it on Hillary Clinton. Now that we know Assange has become a Republican operative, this makes the most sense.</p>

<p>It makes no sense at all that Hillary would have Seth Rich killed after the emails already leaked and before the election for the obvious reason that such a murder would be used against her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange will not disclose the source, Wikileaks policy. Seymour Hersh said it was a disgruntled Democrat staffer (with vote suppression, collusion against Sanders happening, wonder why) who collected the files and gave them to the middleman for Wikileaks.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s the rational line (and not the russiagate conspiracy theory). Let&#39;s pretend neither that explanation nor the russia matter: only the facts. Information leaked to Wikileaks showed collusion against Sanders by the DNC, directly opposing the DNC&#39;s charters they swore by stating fairness. Hilary was decided in 2015 by the DNC. Resignations were forced because of these revelations.</p>

<p>DNC was also revealed to have a high-end &quot;pied piper&quot; strategy to get Trump the nomination for the RNC. Essentially, this discloses that the DNC is responsible for Trump... in more ways than just handpicking an unelectable candidate.</p>

<p>If one or both of our duopolistic political system&#39;s parties are not fair and impartial to what the People&#39;s choice is, <strong>if our choices are one of two candidates chosen by those above us,</strong> <strong><em>do we have a democracy?</em></strong></p>
