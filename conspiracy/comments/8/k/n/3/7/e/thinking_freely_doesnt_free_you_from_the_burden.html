       "Easily led to believe something without evidence" Sounds like the media spinning us into the next inevitable war (much less dangerous than believing in a few conspiracy theories of course)! Saddam has WMD's, believe me. Assad gassed those children, believe me. 9/11 was all just a few pissed off muslim super-pilots, now let's invade Afghanistan, Iraq, torture and subvert your freedoms!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I believe in all conspiracy theories, some ring truer than others of course and some logically would be impossible to prove. I think it's
       <em>
        likely
       </em>
       that groups of powerful people have worked in the shadows throughout history to shape it, but I never expect to be given proof-positive on a plate by the very nature of it.

       But you can't actually figure out what happened somewhere without data... that's called making shit up. It's like claiming you know what happened to Malaysian Flight 370. If your extrapolation takes you anywhere besides a wreck in the ocean, you're making shit up.

       Thank you! This has been a problem with the sub for quite some time, and it's only getting worse. More and more do you see posts hit the front page without any kind of substantial evidence, only outlandish claims. Then you ask for proof of these claims, and are either told 1. it's
       <em>
        so obvious
       </em>
       it doesn't require any proof whatsoever, or 2. proof cannot be produced but it sounds logical so it must be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to love how 9/11 conspiracies in the sub's hayday were well researched, with sources, images and videos from different places and crossreferencing analysis. That's mostly non-existant today.

       I wasn't really taking any part in the 9/11 conspiracy debate, just pointing out one topic that used to bring consistent research and information to the sub. Nowadays, conspiracy posts are much flimsier - the other day someone here posted a picture of "chemtrail" lines in the sky without any explanation or fundaments whatsoever. Where has the effort gone?

       Maybe it's because their effort isn't good enough for actual skeptics. Too many conspiracy theorists are like Eddie Bravo or Alex Jones. Although I'd say Eddie Bravo is more genuine than Alex Jones, he's just a charlatan who exploits the stupidity of the masses.

       No doubt. We tore up everything on 9-11. We had facts and claims and arguments. Some were good, some were highly speculative, and some were false, but in the end, as we dug into report after report and brainstormed on them, we all learned a few things.

       It was a controlled demolition of empty, stripped buildings full of ghost companies and fake people made to look like a terrorist attack via co-ordinated media fakery.

       A logically consistent argument can stand on its own. Relying on "evidence" is a fallacy. I could literally find an article in favor of anything and use it as a source. My argument is much stronger if it can be concise and can stand on its own logical consistency.

       No, you believing evidence is unnecessary is a fallacy on its own. All too often people make arguments that sound logical (and whose logic can indeed check out) but that are completely debunked by empirical data. It's literally how every scientific process is run - no evidence of your claims equals worthless claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument is strongest when you can provide real-world backing for it. I could say whatever flammable claim I like, from "Trump has been the worst president for the US economy in recent history" to "the presence of black people in America is a danger to society because they are dangerous" and none of these claims mean shit if I can't back it up with data to show I'm right. That's when other people come and educate you.

       Neither of your examples are arguments, they are statements. An argument is a statement that builds upon something in a logical format. Statements and questions by their nature are not arguments.

       I have never seen such a "fact" and will outright say it is false. While every opinion might have
       <em>
        arguments
       </em>
       in favor or against them, arguments are NOT facts or evidence and should NOT be taken for truths at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8k4kob/monogamous_relationships_are_healthier_for_society/">
        a recent post of yours
       </a>
       as an example of this. You present your views, and certainly make logically sounding arguments in favor of them. Seems like facts, don't it? But when I
       <a href="https://nr.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8k4kob/monogamous_relationships_are_healthier_for_society/dz5f9wi/">
        contrasted your claims with empirical evidence
       </a>
       , it became clear that your propositions weren't correct. How is that possible, when evidence is supposedly hindering the logical process?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is that empirical data doesn't weaken an argument, but makes it stronger. If you can back up your claims and assertions with actual proof, it makes your arguments actually weight something - and in many cases, you find that ideas that sound "logically sound" in your head don't actually correlate with facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every opinion has arguments in favor of it. Doesn't mean the arguments are correct. That's what fact-checking and sourcing is all about, and why sourced posts are so valuable: so people can see for themselves that you're not talking out of your ass.

       I'm basing my comments and assertions on data available to me that supports my statements. You are quite confused to equate partisan politics and scientific research, they are nothing alike. I'm not going to keep discussing this, it's very simple and there's a saying for it: any claim brought without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Easy as 1 2 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Left or right ideologies can never be true because they're ways in which people see and interact with the world, there is no data to be had in opinions. If you think everyone should have guns or everyone should have free access to healthcare - that's a
       <em>
        personal opinion or belief
       </em>
       and is NOT to be confused with facts. You're muddying the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facts are easy. That's why I was able to disprove every claim you made - and why I was right, and you were wrong. There is no discussion to be had, facts are not subjective and data isn't subjective. Subjectiveness plays a role in how we
       <em>
        analyze
       </em>
       data, which is why theories based on facts can ultimately be wrong as well, even if the facts it originated from were correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the accepted model for data analysis and theory proposition in the worldwide scientific community. Evolution, for example, is a theory alright - but it's based on a lot of evidence from different fields that all correlate with each other, and so scientists can say with a minimal margin of error that evolution is indeed the origin of the human race. Quantum theory is also just that, a theory, but it's also backed by multitudes of empirical evidence and theorems that all support it, so it's the accepted model for research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like I'm not the one who needs to do research. Have a good day.

      <p>
       True, however, we can look at positions and set goals and see if the positions support the goals on a case by case basis. If we do this enough, we will find not that "ideologies" are true or false, but that one is better than the other to meet our goals.

       For example, let's assume we want to maximize wealth in the economy. One perspective is that we can maximize wealth by providing tax cuts to the richest people and that wealth will trickle down through the economy. The other perspective is that we can maximize wealth by providing subsidies to the poorest people and that money will be spent in the economy.

       True, but the goals are still subjective to every person. Different people have different ideas of what is best for the country, what is their ideal country, and which measures are best to produce whatever results they deem best. That's why I say they can't be judged as simply as "right" or "wrong", and either side usually believes themselves to be right and the other to be wrong, further muddying the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to argue economic measures really, it's not a discussion I'm vested in having and I'm no expert in the particulars of US partisan politics. I was simply responding to an example they brought up.

       There certainly is room to build goals from zero on up starting with basic things like living beings want to seek pleasure and avoid pain, and species want to survive and cohabit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the example I gave, all parties agreed upon the wealth maximization goal. So I jump to there as a premise. One says one way that can be shown not to work, the other says another way that can be shown to work.

       The funny thing about your comment is, regardless of how right or wrong you factually are, chances are most people would answer in pretty much the same way when asked on their opinions of "what should be done" or what they believe should be done for the country/world - presenting their view as correct, pointing out why the opposite view's plans would not work. I believe it's a part of human nature to defend our convictions, and as we people are fundamentally different from each other in the ways that we think, we will always be fundamentally differing in our approaches to the world and its problems.

       Again, not saying you're right or wrong. Just some food for thought I found interesting.

       Right, and then as critical thinkers we'd look at that source and decide whether it has any merit or not, and by extension, decide on the merit of your argument. Your assertion that evidence is unnecessary in all arguments is ludicrous.

       Yeah, and so? Something being a theory doesn't mean it can just exist without any data to back it up whatsoever. Let's put a clear example so you understand:
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is a theory. To this day, no scientist can prove with 100% certainty that we evolved from monkeys or what have you. Yet, it's the single most widespread and accepted view for the origin of mankind in the scientific community. Why is that? Why aren't scientists coming out into the streets to propose alternate theories to evolution?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because the evolution theory is
       <em>
        backed by objective data
       </em>
       . Darwin himself spent years of his life studying and analysing different species, recording his findings and making different theories before he came up with the rough draft of what is known today as the evolution theory. Over the decades, hundreds of researchers have provided data and discoveries that back up this theory, so it can be said today that beyond any reasonable doubt, evolution is our origin as a species. Most scientists agree on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that something is a theory doesn't make it immune to critical analysis and sourcing. Quite the opposite, in fact.

       No, but it makes it immune in a subreddit where people come to expect theories of varying weight.  And stop being pedantic.  You know what a conspiracy theory is, and you know what to expect in a sub about conspiracy theories.

       I'll stop being pedantic when you stop purposefully missing the point of my comments. Deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can make a post about Obama secretly running McDonald's and infecting the food with pro-liberal substances to brainwash people into opposing Republicans. That's a conspiracy theory. Is it remotely true or backed up by any data besides my conjectures? No. And that's the kind of content this sub doesn't benefit from. If you're gonna make a post on a theory, at least have the decency to research and source it beforehand. It creates a much-needed standard of quality and prevents stupid questions like "where'd you get this claim/number/statistic/info from" while adding veracity to your claims at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you'd argue against basic sourcing on posts. But I disagree wholeheartedly.

       Getting better doesn't prove origin. Single cell bacteria crawling out of an primordial soup is an educated guess, it's not proof of anything. A bearded man who lives in the clouds "could have" snapped his fingers and created life which evolved on its own without all the micromanaging religious zealots believe in (because their ego I suppose). Origin and evolution are 2 different ideas, there's some crossover to try and explain one with the other, but they are different.

       As you said, origin and creation are different ideas entirely. Afaik, the origins part (meaning what sparked the first cellular lifeforms) is still pretty muddy/in educated guesses theory, but evolution has a lot of scientific analysis and backing for it; fossils, different species analysis recordings, bacterial/virus evolution studies... It's an established and accepted theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was just an example to make my point, though, which was that just because something is a theory doesn't mean it's immune to critical analysis and shouldn't be sourced/fact checked.

       This is what the sub is also for. Sure, verifiable evidence is always welcome, but there is value in presenting ideas just to get input from others. Collectively we can all add pieces to the puzzles of conspiracies who by definition are often still ongoing and thus have not been "proven" yet (at least not proven in a mainstream media kind of way).

       Hypothesis are not free of burden of proof. In fact, most hypotheses are required to be backed by empirical, objective, reproducible data in order to be considered. Obviously that's not simple or possible for every conspiracy, but to outright imply conspiracy theories don't need any proof by virtue of their nature is ridiculous and detracts from the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you expect to change people's minds if you can't even show proof of your statement?

       See that's the problem. This is a place of discussion, not r/changemy view . Mainly very political people make that mistake. If their was undeniable proof it would not be a conspiracy unless the authorities denied the undeniable proof like for instance 9/11.

       I'm sorry but you're wrong. While it's true that the sub's intent is not to actively change visitor's views on subjects, the very nature of conspiracy theories involve a new look into what is otherwise believed to be an established narrative. Exactly like 9/11 - where most people believe it to be a terrorist attack, many posts with great amount of research have been made along the years that present numerous pieces of evidence that contradicts the official narrative, thus forcing people to question what they believe to be "reality".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true, you don't
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to change people's minds on this sub. But to push a conspiracy theory is to assume you will be met with people who simply don't believe what you say to be true, and failing to provide any backing whatsoever to your claims only makes you look like a lunatic making stuff up for the fun of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mention the "undeniable proof" on 9/11, yet don't think evidence is necessary to back up conspiracy theories? Contradicting viewpoints. I know I certainly would have never given two glances at certain conspiracy theories had I not been presented with evidence that contradicted my previous worldview, and I'm sure it's  been the case for most users of this sub. No one is  born believing conspiracy theories.

       That's a distinction without a difference. Any theory worth a shit needs to meet minimum criteria to be considered as a contender explanation. These include:
      </p>
      <p>
       *internal coherence: a theory must be able to make sense in its own terms. If the WTC towers experienced a "pancake" collapse, there would be a pile of floors on the ground. Nothing like that was found, therefore that claim is not consistent within its own predictive model.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         falsifiability: the ability to be false, that is, there are conditions that if met, would demonstrate the theory to be wrong. If you say the solar eclipse will allow stars to be photographed which are behind the sun, by virtue of the bending of space around the Sun's gravitational field, and it doesn't happen, your theory is simply wrong.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         explanatory power: simply put, the theory that explains the most phenomena without having to dismiss evidence as unreal or insignificant, is a better theory. Ex. Creationism has to say fossils are a way for God to test your faith. Evolution says those creatures existed on this planet a long time ago, and they look different (in some cases) than modern species because of adaptive changes over time.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These basic principles should inform every theory, from buying groceries to investigating fraud and murder to analyzing government coverups. If you abandon principles of solid theories, then all kinds of bullshit makes it through the gate.

       Why do we have to discuss anything rational here? Why are you trying to censor discussion of irrational subjects? Humans having the ability to fly through the sky sounded irrational in the 1700s. Every fact is irrational until it is later proven.

       Flying has always been in the realm of possibility, but again, there are certain rules that if a theory breaks, we know it's shit. Embrace them. Prove me wrong about them. I'm all for that discussion. Bring up whatever you feel proves your point. No subject is off limits. But you don't get to say 2+2=5 if 4-2=2. That's just irrational.

       It isn't extraordinary to suggest that our military industrial complex is doing it's best to wage perpetual war in the middle east so they can continue to sell weapons. Following the money is always a safe bet. Yet people that are willing to concede that don't see the irony in being pro-gun or pro-NRA.

       Was Syria asked to provoke a US attack? Evidence looks like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Iraq have WMD's? Two UN Weapons Inspectors had found none. Then a third finally said yes, and then they found some binary sarin from US manufacturers from the 1980's. Not exactly the threat that was sold to the public, but ok.

       Gary Webb most definitely pissed off a group of CIA operatives who were getting bankrolled by Danilo Blandon. They either did it themselves or paid a third party to do it. No doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are my conclusions based on the available evidence fitting into coherent theories. It's more extraordinary to believe otherwise, given all the information I have seen.

       That's not my claim. I'm saying sometimes sources (people who claim to have information) actually have good information that can be verified, and hence, can be of great help to a good argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I see your point that people have all kinds of reasons to lie, but that a good reason to think everyone is actually lying. Sources need to be checked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, rational, consistent arguments should be able to stand on their own, but the problem is that much of the time, what one interlocutor considers "uncontroversial" premises, the other does not recognize as an established fact.

       In
       <em>
        formal
       </em>
       logic we can draw conclusions using a set of rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know if those conclusions are correct unless and until we know that both the premises are correct and that we used the rules correctly.

      <p>
       So, before we can even get to logic, we have to test the factual inputs.

       He was much more if you have bother to read his biography by Williams Poundstone.  For instance, as an undergrad he was one of us UFOnuts in his enthusiasm to the extent he went on UFO "watches" and even wrote a letter to the Sec. of Defense (or Sec. of State) asking what the government was going to do about the UFOs.  Then he got tapped by Dr. Condon to work on his whitewash project and flipped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, if you read his works and those of others that worked with him, you will learn that he believed that there was life on Mars.  He lobbied, but failed, to get nighttime lights on the Viking landers because of the possibility that there were nocturnal Mars beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm quite sure that Sagan would have recognized from the Viking images that the mysterious grooves on Phobos were created as it was maneuvered into place.  But he would not be able to utter a word as he was the mouthpiece of the government/science for denying anything about UFOs being alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sagan died too early.  Yes, he had a disease, but knowing that he and many others kept major secrets about our space attempts and the UFOs would have been a heavy weight on his heart.

       Well, prove it. Specifically from whom are you expecting to find acceptance of your claim, approval, absolution. When, where are those judges, the last word, bona fides? Are you? What subject? So, prove it, otherwise stop the masquerade.

       I like also what feynman said, it is better to say 'I don't know" a thousand times than to say 'I know' and be wrong once.

       Evidence is the thing TPTB are really trying to destroy, at least for everyone who is not them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we should hold on to the evidence that much tighter, and always try to develop new ways to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I am xposting a lot to reddit/steemit( @mindhawk) and saidit and also why I am semi-anon, not full anon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until there is a bigger group of people than the CNN/Fox viewing audience who can all agree on something that CNN/Fox says isn't true, their mass of brainwashed functionaries will keep TPTB in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the true importance of 911 Truth and JFK Truth, which I believe TPTB had hoped by now would already have disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       But behold, we have not.  This is because we poor people still have evidence and this is why they want to take all of our evidence away and replace it with shit like neonnettle or thelastamericanvagabond(sic).

       Hypotheses don't require proof, that comes after. We really don't need anyone's permission to make suggestions that might turn out to be true.

       As you said, origin and creation are different ideas entirely. Afaik, the origins part (meaning what sparked the first cellular lifeforms) is still pretty muddy/in educated guesses theory, but evolution has a lot of scientific analysis and backing for it; fossils, different species analysis recordings, bacterial/virus evolution studies... It's an established and accepted theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was just an example to make my point, though, which was that just because something is a theory doesn't mean it's immune to critical analysis and shouldn't be sourced/fact checked.
