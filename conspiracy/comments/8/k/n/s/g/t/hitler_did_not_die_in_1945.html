They essentially did the same thing as the scientist in the 40s did, which was look at a dismembered skull and say it looks kind of like Hitler.  Furthermore, the article talks about Hitler not having meat at all in his mouth, indicating a vegetarian diet. You may have heard that Hitler was vegetarian, but that&#39;s bullshit. Hitler himself has said in books that he loves ham and sausages, and does not necessarily follow a strict vegetarian diet. There is also evidence that Hitler&#39;s daily routine in 1941 included a diet of meat or other non-vegetarian options, even though in 1941 he was a proclaimed &quot;vegetarian&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not too closely, admittedly. I’d say if not physical, it’s definitley psychological torture.  I think, though, when a man has seen as horrible of things as Tim Kennedy surely has, his definition of torture changes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And non lethal weapons that police commonly use everyday cause people to die, making them lethal. I don’t think he meant it in the context of a ethical or logic based debate. Theres torture in the sense of what hitler did to the Jews, and philosophers like Amery who explain not only the personal ramifications but also the societal ones. Then there’s this technique used on people who want to commit mass murder to the west, in order to make them feel so uncomfortable they tell a secret they’d otherwise die not telling. There’s a debate to be had here, but saying ‘torture is torture’ because someone was talking off the cusp and structured their argument incorrectly, is not the point I don’t think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some thought I have been having lately: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Halaucast: was most likely overhyped demonisation of nazi germany. With the wars going on and transition away from old financial and governance systems around the world as automation was being brought in and causing huge social problems for the workers as their lifestyles came under threat. The jews were responcible for much of the banking and financial systems. (Greedy jew stereotype). So much like stalin, hitler when he came into power had to take control of then fascist regieme by removing the opposition in this case the leaders of the system that the people were trying to fight. All this was happening in a time of civil tensions and sivil wars and revolutions pretty mich everywhere. So this style of government control was seen everywhere there were recolutions. Now there were consentration camps, but also germany was plauged with population issues. The gassing of the jews was horrific but most likely a humane way to kill, the at the time prisoners of the regieme that could not be fed or looked after. After all food had becomes a scaresity at time of war, and prison camps were the worst at starving their populations. So hitler and nazis were evil, they did kill jews, but the whole thing was spun out of proportion in the greater good of idealism. Because history gets forgotten, but ideas and themes of horrific events linger on long after those who remember perish. </p></li>
<li><p>As such when the greater evil was done and europe was levelled and everyone had to recover with a fresh start, a young new generation of people was born and taught in schools and industrialised age was ushered in. Cities were rebuilt to cater for cars, and industries and new housing that wasnt just brick and mortar, Soviet union happened. Basically the old fuedal europe was clensed of old type of living, old type of civilasation pre industrialisation where the people werent educated, were highly religious and were fearful of technology as it was seen to take away their lives and their work. (Thats the greater evil, the conspiracy of ww2 to rebuild the world for the industrilised age). </p>

<ul>
<li>Hense I dont think hitler died. After all the richest, the supirior leaders, they are always buddy buddy. Once germany had run out of steam after trying to take over the world. But really it was just one massive population control event where by trench warfare was a thing and millions died trying to cross nomans lands. Tank warfare allowed for easy ground control. Millions of people died from all nations willingly, because they took it upon themselfs to join the fight. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I could be wrong and it is all just a coincidence that the benifits of the war were such that it allowed for all the aformentioned. But also, I suspect that the eluminaty or perhaps world order at the time were smart enough to know how to control the population. And knew the outcomes of such endevour. </p>

<p>I think this because knowing the post ww2 industrialisation of nations the older generations who had to go to school and learn the then new education struggled. They were fuedal work force after all. They struggled to integrate into the industrialising factories, economies and buissnesses of educated younger generation. And taking massive lands to rebuild the world for the age of automobile, housing, factories, infrasturcture, massive redevelopment was needed. Our solution now is to build new cities with future in mind. Emirstes and china are planning cities of the future, where inner city living doesnt require a car, where as atm everyone has to have one. But before the world wasnt developed and industries robust enough to just do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just offering constructive criticism. When you can&#39;t spell a word it suggests you are not well informed on that topic. When it&#39;s a common word and the first one in your first paragraph, it leads to your whole comment being ignored. I wouldn&#39;t pay attention to someone&#39;s opinion on cell biology if they can&#39;t spell &quot;nucleus.&quot; Likewise, I don&#39;t care about someone&#39;s opinion on the Holocaust if they type &quot;Halaucast&quot; and think it looks correct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to agree with you. But since, the spellchecker on my mobile is trash, I cant edit and proof read on it. And if the ideas are good enough and comment gets upvotes i will when getting on pc edit it there. </p>

<p>I understand what youre saying, that nomenclature of the topic and its spelling should be correct to give faith to the statement. As I see it, this pocket terminologies accross domains of schools of though, means having ideas about topics you havent been educated in, is looked down upon. On a level I agree, but life is short tongo to school and having a brain capable of own idea generation shouldnt be restricted just because the universal language uses diff nomenclature for seperate topics. Spelling is ofcoarse a must, but this being the internet, and internet means global reach. I dont feel compelled to spell check every word I dont know the spelling of, coz that would take far longer than making a comment. And using a mobile that isnt doing its job with spellchecking, its just not worth it. Especially for comments in subs on controversial topics. That wont get read as much anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the holocaust, you should definitely read up German accounts of the Einsatzgruppen tasks, orders and operations and Wehrmacht logistical support of their operation. Don’t look for American reports, read the translated wartime German documents.</p>

<p>It won’t be pleasant but it should help increase your personal understanding of the nazi regime’s stance on untermensch of all types and the levels of logistical support it required to maintain.</p>

<p>I’m not going to try and convince you of anything, only by examining the available German evidence on logistics for yourself will you gain any real knowledge.</p>

<p>Regarding Hitler dying post may 1945? Look at Russian and German tactical maps and come up with a way for Hitler to escape.</p>

<p>The chances of Hitler getting through Russian lines are minimal at best in my estimation, which means if Hitler did escape, it would have had to have been after things settled down. That means a secondary bunker he could have hidden for at least eight weeks. </p>

<p>Either it doesn’t exist or it hasn’t been found.</p>

<p>Getting south or north to a coastal uboat is possible. But not by air. The allies had total superiority and sneaking a ju52 would have been impossible. Maybe a Storch could have slipped through, though, which means minimal belongings.</p>

<p>It’s not impossible he and Eva got out, but considering Goebbels killed himself and his entire family after the supposed suicide of Adolph and Eva? Either he wasn’t privy to the escape plan or it wasn’t logistically possible for him to get his wife and five (is it five or six?) children out by air, against suggesting Storch over Ju52.</p>

<p>When it comes to military conspiracies, alway look to logistics first. There will either be a trail you can follow or evidence to support a claim. If there isn’t a logistical trail then the theory is going to be extremely difficult to support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he was the only one who contributed to my mess with constructive comment. On level, I do agree that spelling and grammar is important, but so is the massage. Shutting down discussion because it doesnt conform to the nomenclature of the subject perfectly is restricitng thought. I dont like how every school of thought has its own unique language for essentially the same things. Especially law and economics, since they restrict the avarage human from participating in the system, just because he chose to pursue other interests in life. </p>

<p>I was going to edit and fix the issues that are present with the origional comment i wrote groggy early in the morning on my shitty mobile. But after seeing all the hate and downvotes, i decided to leave it. This has been lost to pages of archive now. And nobody really checks the downvoted comments anyway. Its the negative side of democracy based on +- voting. Group mentality kicks in, and I notice when I post anti US stuff on russia hate news posts, you remember the troll farms, social media adds, skripal case, syrian gas attacks. All those things with calling out the bullshit where it was. I got insta -9 to -12 downvotes by what I assume are bots or shills. Then real people would just join the majoroty opinion. I know they were bots/shills because after 2-3 weeks i would get upvotes back, and by scrolling to those comments the downvotes were less, about the ammount i got in the first minutes after posting. So I have plenty of expirience with this. And i leave the bad comments up as a testiment to my arogance. But also because the first time i really got hate, and called a russian bot, a russian troll, was when i said fake news on a russian troll farm news post in r/worldnews. Usually my comments just get some hate where they go against the narrative, but this was something else. Had many many comments of just purely calling me out and -30 downvotes withing 15 min. Then it got to like over 100 negative, and after a few weeks back to like -70s . My theory all the temo accounts get deleted every two or so weeks. </p>

<p>But as for the holocaust conspiracy theory of mine. I only started thinking about this recently, because of everything happening in the world and how past events unfolded, I just cant deny myself thoughts of organised planning at hand. And how ideas persist in the population eveb after the origional claims were disproven. Large events linguring decades after even (iraq wmds) as recent example. So holocaust to me, is such an events that I cant deny history alteration being used. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find your presentation to be biased on the food front. </p>

<p>Hitler wasn’t regularly proclaimed vegetarian by the nazi party until 1942, and likely only ate liver dumplings after 1937.</p>

<p>Animal based broths would make him sick, probably psychosomatic in nature and not a physical reaction.</p>

<p>This adds up with your pre 1941 claims and him being omnivorous was well known. What is your post 1941 claim based on?</p>

<p>If it’s anything to do with anything Rynn Berry concluded you can discount it. He made claims about Hitler eating meat as a way to disassociate the 70’s vegan movement from Hitler, and who wouldn’t? Having Hitler being prominently associated with anything so progressive and American as his campaign and ideals could be disastrous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for correcting this, here was my comment on the original post:</p>

<p>This article is purely based on observation of the skull and teeth (they weren&#39;t allowed to take a sample). Personally I find DNA evidence a lot more valuable: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/27/adolf-hitler-suicide-skull-fragment">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/27/adolf-hitler-suicide-skull-fragment</a>. If you do your research you&#39;ll find that there were no witnesses to his alleged suicide, or even placing him inside the bunker; soldiers simply burned a wrapped up body that they assumed was Hitler&#39;s.</p>

<p>That aside, why would the US government spend million of dollars, and have thousands of documents on Hitler post WWII? Do you really believe the CIA/FBI is full of crazy conspiracy nuts? Photo of Hitler post WWII courtesy of the CIA: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/HITLER%2C%20ADOLF_0003.pdf">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/HITLER%2C%20ADOLF_0003.pdf</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m still not 100% convinced one way or the other to be honest, but that article is not being honest by ignoring the DNA evidence. It&#39;s possible the DNA evidence was contaminated, or the skull was swapped out at some point, but to not mention it once is dishonest.</p>

<p>Personally I would argue that it doesn&#39;t matter whether Hitler survived or not, because the ideology and war on the US continued in an arguably more dangerous fashion.</p>

<p>If you think logically, Hitler was a crazed and murderous ideologue and he was very successful at rallying people to his cause with unparalleled loyalty and fervor. But it&#39;s near impossible to win an ideological war, especially when it becomes global and nuclear weapons get involved (as we learned in the middle east, vietnam, cold war, etc). What if the Nazi ideology survived the war and continued afterward? It&#39;s a fact that the highest ranking Nazi officers escaped to south america, and there are still pure German communities there today. It&#39;s a fact that the US government employed thousands of Nazi scientists and operatives (operation paperclip). What if the Nazi&#39;s simply changed their rules of war, and focused on infiltrating and subverting america instead of open warfare? Look at our foreign policy post WWII, it appears to have changed drastically; the CIA (est directly after WWII) has been involved in subverting, overthrowing or even war with the majority of countries around the world, even today (Libya, Afghanistan, Iran, etc). Personally I think there has been an ideological/psychological attack on the american people ever since the war ended. Division and fear-mongering have only escalated over the years, and now it&#39;s probably at an all-time high. How do you destroy a country if you can&#39;t do it with weapons? You do it with the media and ideas; you divide the people by groups or ideologies and you quite simply pit them against each-other.</p>

<p>TLDR: There&#39;s DNA evidence that this article doesn&#39;t even address; and it doesn&#39;t really matter if Hitler survived, as the war on the american people has continued ever since the end of WWII.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, the Russians dug up the body that was buried or partially buried, took it to an abandon building and then forced hitlers dentist to write down from memory what his teeth looked like.  Does this sound like credible data?  His real dental records have never been found or never existed.  How can they continue to come out and say the dental records match?  When it comes closer and closer to coming out that he got away, they come out and say they have evidence that he &quot;defiantly&quot; died in Berlin.  They have hitlers sisters DNA, they can test this at any time to confirm this with science.  You can trust the Soviets on this right?  They defiantly are honest and have always told the truth on things (I&#39;m kidding).  Imagine what would have happened if the Soviets did not capture/kill/find hitlers body?  What would have happened?  The Soviets were trying to not continue the war as they had just lost over 20 million people.  They took the body and locked it away.  It has been locked in a vault ever since.  Why not just let science do its thing?  Because it would expose the Soviets as weak and Russian&#39;s do not respond to weakness.  That could have cause an uprise and Stalin was not willing to risk it.  Hitler got away.  If he didn&#39;t, then lets see the DNA proof and shut this shit down once and for all. </p>
