       First off I’ll state that I’m very pro 2nd amendment but come on bud, it’s not a “god given” right. It’s a right given to us by our founding fathers. I highly doubt these school shootings are all happening due to some bullies kids. There is definitely a pattern with a goal in these school shootings and I can decide if it’s to make us scared and buy more guns in fear of a ban or to put right take the 2nd amendment

        allow prayer in schools. The liberal brainwashing is ruining another generation of open thinkers and prayer is the only thing that can end moral degenracy. 2. this country was founded by Christian men and immigrants and liberal politics are trying to exterminate America's organic culture. White Christian men will become a minority within 10 years and our good for nothing politicians are doing nothing but stuffing their pocketbooks. 3. "that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights," Creator, it's right there in the Declaration of Indepedence!

       sooo let me get this straight, you're pro 2nd amendment because it's in our constitution. but you want to mix church and state even though it's explicitly stated that there should be a separation of church and sate?

       It means the Government cannot create law(s) that establish/enforce a certain religion (ie. Church of England - Church of United States). It can endorse whatever it wants, though.

       This country was also founded by immigrants a fact that you ignore in claiming that immigrants are one of the reasons this country is going downhill. Also I might add that Jesus was brown as he was born in the middle east so this whole white men loosing majority status as a fear tactic designed to justify your misogynistic racism is a transparent attempt at best. Furthermore, praying so far that i have seen has an impressively bad success rate to prevent sexual abuse, poverty, feeding the starving, preventing tyranny, etc... Im all for prayer but at the same time pull up your sleeves and get to work changing the world to the benefit of all mankind rather then holding on to a white patriarchal status quo that at this point in history should be an obsolete methodology as it gave several millennia of tyrannical rulers oppressing their people!

       “Among these fundamental natural rights, Locke said, are "life, liberty, and property." Locke believed that the most basic human law of nature is the preservation of mankind. To serve that purpose, he reasoned, individuals have both a right and a duty to preserve their own lives.”

       We were born with natural rights. The founding fathers did not "give" them to us. They are protecting our natural rights from the government. Even if the 2nd amendment didn't exist, we would still have the right to bear arms.

       Do you really think the natural right to bear arms would hold any weight in Congress? We wouldn’t be allowed to even own a black powder rifle if it was explicitly stated we have a right to bear arms. I understand what you’re saying but even the natural rights are being challenged all the time in court and unfortunately some citizens are losing. Looking up the people contesting tickets claiming natural right to fish and life off the land and now they’re in court because of it. It’s a shit deal we have regardless

       Your entire ideology was given away when you said “liberal false flag” in your first scentence. Now I’m not a big conspiracy theorist. I like patterns which many conspiracies involve, and I think JFK was definitely a conspiracy event. But you folks love the deep state around here and we all know that any false flag would either be the deep state (that’s both parties, entrenched Washington politicians) or the party in power to start a war. So listing “liberal false flag” discredits everything. How’s the weather over on T_D?
