       Im at work (I don't work in an office) so havent heard much about what happened yet, but in the spirit of conspiracy lets assume this too is a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way to shut down the, "states with the strictest gun laws have the worst gun crimes" argument than by staging a school shooting in Texas?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the MSM can go on and on about how TX needs stricter gun laws and that this is proof that being "lax" on them results in mass shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, one last thing.  Its way too coincidental that the U.S. has all these school shootings and no where else does.  Canada and Mexico are right here with us geographically and they allow civilians to own guns but we never hear about School shootings there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mexico has more crime and criminal activity but no school shootings?  Canada isnt really all that much different than the U.S. and they have nothing?  The only difference is the governments...really should make one - at the very least - be skeptical.

       You said you literally hadn't even done research, yet you already went and assumed that the dead children were a conspiracy. You don't just "assume" massacred children are a false flag in the "spirit" of conspiracy. Tell me why you think this is a false flag? I'm sure you've done your research now. But I mean FFS the bodies weren't even cold when you turned their deaths into a conspiracy. What new Intel do you have.

       no, i said, "in the spirit of this subs purpose let's talk about this recent event"

      <p>
       also, calling something like this a conspiracy doesn't mean kids didn't die.   ever hear of pearl harbor?
      </p>
      <p>
       another thing, deflecting to "oh the children" is a weak tactic.  just because kids were hurt doesn't mean discussing the topic is off limits

      <p>
       there you go again with the children again as if kids being involved means we have to walk on eggshells.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy has nothing to do with dead kids.  It would be about the shooting being planned or high jacked to push a narrative.

       So?  Why do you think kids being involved means this is a topic that cant be discussed?

       "People like me" lmfao. It's not like I haven't posted extensively about the Parkland conspiracy in the past. Except with that shooting, we actually had a reason to believe it was a conspiracy. What's your reasoning in this case? That's what I'm asking.

       Or actually I'll just ask this, what's your opinion of the Sante Fe shooting. Do you think it was staged by the government, if so why?

       The reason we have more school shootings has nothing to do with guns Rights or controls. It has to do with the mental state of a lot of kids today. Let me also say that I don't think school shootings are FF's to erode our rights. I have said it plenty of times that our abilities to buy higher powered guns and accessories has expanded since this stuff has started, not been eroded. I think the NRA has done an amazing job of using these shootings to do just that too. Hell, silencers were about to become legal last year.

       No, I just recognize patterns.

       After every single mass casualty incident, the MSM immediately starts calling for stricter gun laws, just like after every single mass casualty incident, conspiracy sites, immediately start calling it a false flag or a deepstate op to take away our guns.

       Youre dismissing the problem and getting a snarky little jab in there cuz youre biased. And since you've broadcast that this hypothetical school shooters problems arent real or what he thinks his problems are arent real; youve given said shooter less incentive to look for more options.
      </p>

       I'm biased too so whatever, you're welcome to say that sort of shit. But it isn't helping and it makes me less likely to be empathetic to people like you.

       The problem is you being an asshole about it. You could be right. But you couldn't help the situation if you were given the chance because you'd likely be an asshole to them because of your biases.

       You stand a higher chance of recieving pain in life for your views and biases than I do. Thats all.

       The irony here is that shooter is only 17 years old. It was already illegal for him to have a gun in Texas.
