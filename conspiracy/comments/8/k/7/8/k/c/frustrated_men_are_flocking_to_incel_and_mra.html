        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A recent movement of self-consoling frustrated men have been indoctrinated into an inherently sexist society and acclimate to this being normal, Women play the part of the sex trophy in movies, so obviously when our young buck Life&#39;s been Interesting, eventful(?) (Heroic?) enough, or does enough nice things, they become entitled to a sexprize, or so they think.
 This toxic worldview sold to boys by men affects us all, Men are not the only ones capable of misogyny, but some certain men have been self assembling and are incapable of rationalizing self-improvement and taking responsibility for the energy they create and exude into the world, instead they are forming support groups for themselves where they affirm that, &quot;oh, no it&#39;s not that we&#39;re entitled and one-track-minded, it&#39;s that a wicked sexcabal has tricked women into giving the sexprizes only to, the WORST CHADS, for the purpose of creating an idiocracy, and I know this because I&#39;m so smart and yet still nobody will fuck me!&quot;</p>

<p>What you&#39;re really upset about, boys, is that many women have working social radars, and they can sense the danger pulses off of you a mile away.  Deal with your shit and then come back.

Posting this here because there really is a conspired effort to take advantage and profit off of this gullible and harmful to society worldview.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like that&#39;s not an option?
Is this what people who can&#39;t bear the pain of realizing and accepting having been wrong or that they&#39;ve behaved badly do when they feel social pressure on them to change? just make it someone else&#39;s fault?
  It takes a fool in my mind to go through the american school system, listen to ONLY the thoughts of dead white dudes, and never at any point be like, &quot;But isn&#39;t there like, anyone else we should be learning from?&quot;  Short answer is yes, long answer is a detailed history of the active suppression and theft of women&#39;s accomplishments in the history books, and the accomplishments of anyone who did not fortify the white supremacist narrative favored in our public systems and taught in school as fact and science.
This fires up my blood I&#39;ll stop here for now heh</p>

<p>lol, hold on a second.  i just have to parse this, clearly.</p>

<p>incel means involuntary celibate.  that means it&#39;s not in their control.  and this makes sense.  if nobody wants them, that&#39;s not their choice.  that&#39;s quite literally the choice of the selector.  the term &quot;involuntary&quot; means that they&#39;re not the selectors.  </p>

<p>now that we have that bit of who is the selector cleared up.  you then state that incels think that &quot;others are to blame&quot;.  well, if the incel isn&#39;t the selector they have no role in selection.  the people who are responsible (ie. who are to blame) are by definition the selectors.  ie. not the incel.  oky dokey then.. moving along.</p>

<p>and then you perpetuate the trope that they just have to be more appealing.  and to work on themselves.  well wouldn&#39;t going to a PUA meet that requirement?  going to someone who can make you be more &quot;sellable&quot; by teaching you techniques in being selected, right?  that&#39;s the whole function of that.  you can dislike PUA, but you&#39;re literally complaining about incels doing it while you&#39;re also telling them to do it.  fascinating.  </p>

<p>y&#39;all should work on getting your models to be internally consistent first before presenting them to people.  you look unskilled otherwise.  </p>

<p>Con men who pretend to have insight that will get you the sexprize, or &quot;POA&quot; as you said, with your cool hip new jargons, don&#39;t come anywhere near qualifying as self improvement seeing as how the core of their schtick is usually along the lines of &quot;Try aggressively a lot and take lots of losses, 1/100 will throw you a bone/won&#39;t know any better.</p>

<p>who said I think PUA are agents of positive self-growth?  you have reading comprehension issues.  they simply meet the criteria of helping men get selected more - the very thing you&#39;re telling men to do!  can&#39;t have your crazy and eat it too.  </p>

<p>as to the PUA thing being odious or whatever.  yeah well that&#39;s just another selection criteria right?  so maybe all y&#39;all should figure out what &quot;appropriate&quot; selection criteria are and let everyone else know before you just arbitrary start labelling and shaming people.  mkay?  but of course the problem there is that you&#39;ve now declared yourself arbiter of others.  and that&#39;s where all that falls down, not that you&#39;d be aware of it given the kind mental acrobatics you&#39;re performing.  anyhoo...</p>

<p>Now you can say that the attack didn&#39;t happen, the bodies were faked, the van was CGI, the city is actually under water - FINE. </p>

<p>But what I see is that the allegations that the attack was not as described are slim to nil on evidence, mostly reading like your comment above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It worries me because I listen and care about women in my life and toxic masculinity creates an Actual perceivable threat and antagonism in our lives.
It&#39;s startling to me how we live in a psudo-democratic state with fascism on the rise.  It&#39;s startling to me how many little boys make it to their 20s 30s 40s and on without listening to a voice outside the one in their head enough to learn exactly what the patriarchy is.    Instead baseline emotional reaction makes them reject and put it down.
&quot;NOBODY IS OPPRESSING WOMEN OR POC BECAUSE I AM NOT AND I DON&#39;T SEE IT,  STOP LAZY&quot;  Because that&#39;s the easiest and most primitive ape reaction to have.  It takes real courage to question the world and the people around you.

Dep. of Defense is actually the Engine of human slaughter.  the Medical and Food industries are really the sickness and poison industries.  Education is disinformation and indoctrination.

Because the schools before that point legally could not.  It takes an aawesome and aware teacher in middle or highschool to cue the kids in on everything they are learning about their country is propaganda and bullshit.
This is related because I don&#39;t think it takes a genius to figure out how the game we are handed to play is a garbagefire, and yet these Real smart logical dudes(S)  have decided the problem is the people who face more systemic oppression than they do.

    <div class="md"><p>Keep screaming at the top of your lungs so. And maybe collectively all the incels will hear you and decide... They don&#39;t give a shit. Just as I have. I don&#39;t care how frustrated you are. You&#39;re the one who made it about colour and social standing by choosing to fight a fight nobody gives a shit about on your own against an enemy that isn&#39;t even interested in you. What a pie in the sky bullshit answer. Incels don&#39;t think minorities or those &quot;more systemically oppressed&quot; than them are the source of all their problems. They&#39;re just feeling increasingly marginalised in a society in which PC culture is growing stronger by the day and they&#39;re pissed off about it. And it&#39;s not their fault that society is that way. It&#39;s also not strictly the fault of &quot;dead WHITE men&quot;. Men of all races can be pricks. Newsflash: some women are cunts too. Second newsflash: Every living being on this planet tumbled out of a pussy so just because you grew up with a few extra Fannie&#39;s in your house doesn&#39;t make you special or more empathic towards women. Your whole white knight saviour complex it&#39;s a fucked up system thread is bullsgit. By the way it&#39;s 2018 and &quot;systemically oppressed&quot; is rapidly becoming &quot;your parents didn&#39;t pay enough attention in school&quot;. The bullshit victim mentality isn&#39;t going to fly for much longer. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t tell me what to do with my mental models, especially if, in your model, Pick up douchebags constitute some kind of a positive self-growth.</p>

<p>who said I think PUA are agents of positive self-growth?  you have reading comprehension issues.  they simply meet the criteria of helping men get selected more - the very thing you&#39;re telling men to do!  can&#39;t have your crazy and eat it too.  </p>

<p>as to the PUA thing being odious or whatever.  yeah well that&#39;s just another selection criteria right?  so maybe all y&#39;all should figure out what &quot;appropriate&quot; selection criteria are and let everyone else know before you just arbitrary start labelling and shaming people.  mkay?  but of course the problem there is that you&#39;ve now declared yourself arbiter of others.  and that&#39;s where all that falls down, not that you&#39;d be aware of it given the kind mental acrobatics you&#39;re performing.  anyhoo...</p>
