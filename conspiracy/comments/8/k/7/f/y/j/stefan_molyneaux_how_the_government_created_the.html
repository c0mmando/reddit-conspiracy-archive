        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-05-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Jobposting1.html">Jobposting1</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaFEt3c9Wvk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaFEt3c9Wvk</a> - Starts around 45 minutes in til the end.</p>

<p>Here are the shorthand notes of how the government created inequality in money, and how used they used the  women/illegals/poor people to create division.</p>

<p><strong>The Poor</strong></p>

<p>The Govt provokes anxiety. If you truly care about the poor, give to charities. Charities do this better than the government. Government says if you don&#39;t give us money, you are racist/biased against the poor. Charities will not overfund poor by choice(lazy, want to be musician over having a real job, etc) but will overfund people who are poor by bad luck(tragic accident, death, surgery, relief from natural disaster.)</p>

<p>Solve poverty = Free market &gt; Accumulate Resources of the Smartest people then multiply them. Wealth lifts all, but some people don&#39;t want to escape poverty(ie people who spend all their time writing a book, being a monk, personal choices over better life decisions). </p>

<p>Govt offers to fix poverty = Raises Taxes. People say to redistribute wealth to fix poverty = Charities already do this, governments charge 3x to do this and do worse. Govt knows you will pick charity if faced with a choice between the two to solve poverty.. </p>

<p>Govt increased welfare in the 1900&#39;s, which meant..</p>

<p>Central Banking which gives the state the power to print money and they print as much money as they want, because they pay them at their old value before inflation.  As the money spreads, the people on the end of the line of receiving it(the poor people who actually need it), receive less money as it devalues due to inflation.</p>

<p>Central banking = more tax revenue</p>

<p><strong>Government tricks women into working to increase tax revenue and destabilizes male/female relationships</strong></p>

<p>The government needed more tax revenue in the 1960&#39;s due to costs of expensive LBJ social programs/policies but cant raise taxes any higher because they are too high. So they spread feminism to make women work and to convince people to have less kids</p>

<p>How to get women to have less kids? Tell them they are being oppressed and being a housewife is beneath them, while urging them to work is the solution. Suppress natural gender differences(Men have 4+ IQ, No Women at highest IQ levels).</p>

<p>Fewer kids = fewer expensive government services(healthcare/school), and less incentive for women not to work, because they don&#39;t have kids/husband to come home to</p>

<p>Say women get paid less due to oppression and patriarchy, not because of IQ and because women usually want to have kids, which means they can&#39;t work, making them more risky choices who are less valuable. Men cant have babies, so men get chosen and are less of a risk.</p>

<p>Women working doubled the supply of workers. More workers = lesser wages. When it wasn&#39;t enough, the government allowed Immigration, which further increases the supply of workers and decreases wagers.</p>

<p>Women choose to have less kids, if any, because child care costs and the costs of a child in general eat up all of the profit they made working. </p>

<p>What the govt also does is say there is a wage gap, even though there is none. There is a productivity gap because men have to work harder so they will make more money and be more attractive for women to pick them.</p>

<p>The government then creates the myth of wage gap &gt; pass laws to artificially raise female wages &gt; subsidize daycare</p>

<p>Fewer kids = lowers govt cost, unionizes women</p>

<p>To ensure there are less kids, the govt increase destabilized marriages, which they do by making women want to work more. They also make women fear dependence on men and make them fear men, even though men depend on women for kids. This makes women hate men more and creates more trouble in marriage.</p>

<p>Grow govt to hire women who are less productive due to kids. This increases the power of the state.</p>

<p>Oh here we go.  More right wing nonsense to continue chipping away at Obamacare, medicaid/medicare, SS...then in the next breadth they&#39;ll talk about how tax cuts and deregulation will put more money in the pocket of main street America.</p>

<p>Same trick, different decade folks.  Conservative ideology has gotten its chance since Reagan and look at the debt, look at the income inequality and look at the boom bust cycles we never actually address the problem.</p>
