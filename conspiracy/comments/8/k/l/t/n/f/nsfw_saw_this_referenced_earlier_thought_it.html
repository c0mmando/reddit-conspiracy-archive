        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;tl;dr: Anthony has more skeletons in his closet than the Catacombs of Paris. </p>

<p>This centers around the SelfCuttingGirl catfish story, in which a 40 year old man fooled Anthony, and many others, into believing he was a 14 year old girl. Read that post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504231056/https://pastebin.com/FJanjC70">here</a>. Also, keep in mind that <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Pa1ZT">this</a> is who these people thought they were communicating with. </p>

<p>&quot;The Hunter&quot; is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/X49RRSC4ls/">Jordan Hembrough</a> and the other girl-friend mentioned is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107130132/https:/twitter.com/shelbys__tweets/status/341393377616605185">shelbys__tweets</a>; who claims to have turned 18 in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107130321/https:/twitter.com/shelbys__tweets/status/790995708723748864">late 2016</a>, which would have made her around 13 or 14 when all of this was going down. I find it hard to believe that this is a real person, but that doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s worth mentioning that this is one of the &quot;real girls&quot; Anthony brings up when discussing the reveal on the show. Anthony still follows this girl on twitter, btw, or at least he did before he was banned.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll start at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235813/https:/twitter.com/shelbys__tweets/status/326358630372872192">the end</a> and then <a href="http://imgur.com/a/zYz4L">double back</a> to when Jordan Hembrough, a TV show host in his 40&#39;s, decided it was appropriate to contact what he believed to be a 14 year old girl, make inappropriate comments, take her on as a pseudo employee, and make even more inappropriate jokes that would make even Chip cringe (It&#39;s like an Army joke). Oof. You probably noticed a reference to Penn Jilette in there, too. Apart from Anthony and Jordan, Penn was one of the most <a href="http://imgur.com/a/9MHxV">publicly engaging</a> celebrities.  </p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the old O&amp;A gang discussing the fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqPeHmg_uSA">they&#39;d been had</a>. The more I listen to this the more I notice how panicked everyone sounds. High-pitch Jimmy denies knowing anything about her while also claiming that he knew she was really a he all along, Opie kinda knows something, but not as much as everyone else, and Anthony tries to frame the conversation in a way that emphasizes how much of a creep this guy is for pretending to be an underage girl, despite the fact that he had been grooming &quot;her&quot; for well over a year. </p>

<p>Yeah, about that: Here&#39;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107130733/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/36i444/anthony_cumia_hunter_was_host_of_tv_show_the_toy/">an old thread</a> full of information. Linked threads: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131048/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3669l6/2_years_ago_anthony_got_catfished_by_1415_year/">first</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/36b40p/anthony_cumia_responds_to_selfcuttinggirlgate/">second</a>. Here&#39;s Anthony <a href="http://imgur.com/cfdeesM">denying</a> that he&#39;d ever been catfished in the first place &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131320/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/2sbni4/anthony_talking_about_reddit_speculations/cno2np8/">the thread</a>. Remember ApologyGirl21? <a href="http://imgur.com/5JEGuCE">This is her</a>. It&#39;s possible that this girl is one of the &quot;real friends&quot; that Ant was complaining about opening up to SelfCuttingGirl, too. Here&#39;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131506/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3zjwxv/ant_deleted_his_reddit_post_denying_self_cutting/?st=j2b0lsfe&amp;amp;sh=191fc079">the thread</a> where Ant deletes his denial. Here&#39;s Anthony claiming that he bought SelfCuttingGirl a macbook because he&#39;s a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/95wzmAG.png">charitable fellow</a>. Here&#39;s Ant&#39;s 17 year old girlfriend, ApologyGirl21, being used to lure in more strays and Ant offering SelfCuttingGirl <a href="http://imgur.com/W5a7hsp">room and board</a>. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a section of a blog post by Melissa Statten, one of Anthony&#39;s ex&#39;s, entitled: <a href="http://imgur.com/u5f4Bld">Trophy Wife aka My Life With A Shock Jock</a> &amp; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504231925/https://pastebin.com/m2yQ5ZDm">full version</a>, which discusses her finding out that he had saved this 14 year old girl&#39;s Amazon wishlist &quot;because she&#39;s a fan of the show and she&#39;s cute&quot;. Here&#39;s Anthony publicly <a href="http://imgur.com/8rYmdFT">thumbing his nose</a> at his ex for getting upset that he&#39;s purchasing gifts for what he believed to be a 14 year old girl. Here&#39;s a bonus clip of Melissa Statten exposing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MhfFYL6Lvg">Tranthony Cumio</a> as a ladyboy lover and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131632/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/48jyu4/the_transsexual_sue_lightning_anthony_is_accused/">the thread</a>. I should probably clarify why the Sue Lightning/tranny stuff is relevant...<a href="http://imgur.com/aLsqyCK">This is why</a>. </p>

<p>The reason I haven&#39;t posted any direct communications between Anthony and this &quot;girl&quot; is because at some point during the whole hullabaloo of Ant admitting that he was catfished, then claiming that the catfished story never happened, him saying she was just a girl who the guys on the show retweeted, then claiming that he bought her things because he&#39;s a charitable guy, and even going so far as to pretend that SelfCuttingGirl was his <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Xt1ip">niece</a> at one point...he decided to <a href="http://imgur.com/a/HRgsJ">wipe his entire twitter account</a> the same way he wiped his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131748/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3zqly0/oh_anthony_how_long_before_you_delete_this/">Vine account</a>. Bonus: His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131837/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3zspzq/anthony_addresses_the_vine_favorites_social_media/">reaction</a> to the Vine likes. The only problem with wiping your account clean is that all of the @ mentions <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;q=%40selfcuttinggirl%20niece&amp;amp;src=typd">are still there</a>. There are <a href="http://imgur.com/a/4aTFc">some speculative things</a>. I&#39;m not sure what to make of that. I don&#39;t know who that message was sent to, but there&#39;s enough left over to paint a picture of what was really going on. Plus, you&#39;d be a fool to not <a href="https://youtu.be/yPoC4j1W82s?t=7640">take the man at his word</a>. </p>

Taken from TACS 537 1:12:00. He filed a copyright claim on the latter for obvious reasons, but the thread is still up. Edit: A <a href="https://youtu.be/sp1GazysnEk">little snippet</a> of the kinds of things he was saying.</p></li>
<li><p>He referred to Roman Polanski as <a href="https://youtu.be/iAZ9I98JMpI?t=1958">a hero</a> for anally raping a 13 year old girl.</p></li>
<li><p>E-Rock and Opie lied to Olympic gymnast Mikayla Mirony, then 17, for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in_S3wIjCMU">disturbing bit</a> on the show. What makes this even more egregious on their part is that it took place after Anthony had caused a Twitter shit storm by Tweeting about breaking Mikayla&#39;s hymen. Some of the Tweets, which were all sent before this bit, are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180205072904/http://foreverunfocused.com/2017/07/sick-talk-show-host-tweets-about-breaking-mckayla-maroneys-hymen/">saved in this article</a>.  </p></li>
<li><p>Here&#39;s Anthony saying that he would only watch ICarly to <a href="https://youtu.be/hKGvS5gXODA?t=1033">jerk off</a>. Jimmy seriously asks what&#39;s wrong with him. There&#39;s no joke there. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAQfFE2T8o#t=4m40s">Another instance</a> of him commenting on how hot he finds a teenage girl.</p></li>
<li><p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/22eUasOYC-A?t=635">this clip</a> Anthony insinuates that if he had become a carnival worker  he would have statutory rape charges all across America for sleeping with 14 year olds.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s the whole &#39;Ant goes to prom&#39; bit, too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb7JcB50u3I">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZQFbSNnsdA">Part 2</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Here&#39;s a clip of him saying that a 14 year old prostitute on Maury is &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/bTjWNaNag4U?t=7024">completely, legitimately fuckable</a>&quot;. </p></li>
<li><p>Bill Burr says that Anthony has The Neverland Ranch for someone who doesn&#39;t molest kids and Anthony replies with, &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/ZX6IO7GDH20?t=679">...Little do you know.</a>&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Here he is admitted to finding the <a href="https://youtu.be/losgUuZPKgs?t=314">sexual abuse of women</a> arousing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/AvEk-NqMY8Y?t=119">Here</a> he is flat out admitting that he slept with a 14 year old when he was 21...or 18? Either way, it&#39;s illegal. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m no Colombo, but I&#39;m starting to see a pattern emerge here. Am I forgetting anything else? Probably.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey guys! Regular r/opieandanthony poster here. We&#39;ve brigaded a few threads around reddit, trying to pass off inside jokes as legitimate, but I assure you this right here is no joke. </p>

<p>Anthony Cumia is a pedophile who preys on preteen girls, who hid in plain sight for years but more and more evidence keeps piling up that shows a pattern of sexual abuse. He has enough money to pay off the right sources - such as the police (his executive producer is a former NYPD Lieutenant) and his victims. </p>

<p>Bobo - a mentally retarded man that Anthony who he once <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/49ijfs/anthony_berates_and_assaults_bobo_for_throwing_up/">assaulted live on camera</a> lives a lower-class life in Queens. Had to open a gofundme to pay for his mother&#39;s medical bills. Despite this, his sister (the one Anthony is accused of statutory raping years ago) is vacationing all over the world, managing to fly to 10 countries in 2017 with nobody mentioning how she got the money to afford all that travel.</p>

<p>Anthony blocks you on twitter for saying anything remotely negative towards him and accuses our sub of libel despite hard evidence to the contrary. He&#39;s getting away with it, and has surrounded himself with so many yes men and loyalists that it&#39;s starting to come across as a cult. There was even a brief time where he was &quot;making jokes&quot; about sleeping with his brother&#39;s stepdaughter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to explain, in polite and informative detail, the conspiracy to a sub called r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>Your attempts to silence &amp; erase the case against Anthony Cumia for being a pedophile is extremely suspicious. Seeing as though Mr. Cumia has an open $5000 bounty for anyone who can shut down our sub, we become extremely on guard when people like you attempt to discredit us. Anthony has his supporters that will do everything possible to keep us from talking. </p>

<p>Examine the evidence in OP - a lot of it is pictures, audio, video. Not hyperbole or theories. </p>

<p>It seems to me like a hardcore right-leaning poster such as yourself wants to silence legit criticisms against a right-leaning media personality. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got some news for you kiddo that might blow your mind: both democrats and republicans can be pedophiles. You didn&#39;t join the magical political party where everyone is good and pure. </p>

<p>A brigade is one sub attacking another. Not one sub, who has compiled strenuous information accusing a millionaire radio host of pedophila, bringing it to the attention of another sub. If you don&#39;t like the information, attack it. Don&#39;t just scream &quot;BRIGADE! BRIGADE!&quot; until you get your way: that is sympathizing with a pedophile and trying to make it easier for him to continue to molest children.</p>

<p>But hey, who cares about that when you agree with him on conservative talking points! Might have to get this video removed from the internet as well. You&#39;re such a good little abusive pedophile enabler, aren&#39;t you? </p>

There is video of a knee walking drunk girl periscoping a drunken rant making all kinds of claims of abuse but making zero effort to remove herself from the &quot;abusive&quot; situation.  </p>

<p>There is nothing but a bunch of hyperbolic claims, no evidence of anything and a brigade of users who clearly stated their purpose to troll Anthony but you&#39;re mad at me for pointing it out.  You&#39;re a sick individual if you knowingly support this artificial witch Hunt against some dude because he is employees by infowars.</p>

<p>You know exactly what you&#39;re doing and you should be ashamed of yourself.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what we have here, a shocking statement by a shock jockey taken out of context.  A fake Twitter user who isn&#39;t an underage girl (is actually a 40 year old man trying to entrap Anthony) &lt;--- you&#39;re going to believe anything claimed by this guy?  And a periscope video from a clearly intoxicated girlfriend who is putting on a show to win a drunken argument.</p>

<p>Pretty much everything that is wrong with the world today, sponsored by feminists and SJWs looking to take someone&#39;s career out.</p>

<p>Fuck you man.  And you&#39;re insinuating that I&#39;m a pedophile defender because I caught these fuckers and you doing it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have 100% undeniable proof that this whole shenanigan was a brigade, most of the so called evidence they have presented about this Anthony character is easily debunked.
