<p>It&#39;s pretty simple. There has to be proof and evidence of extraordinary claims, like that of a school shooting.  I will make one of these threads over and over again every time a shooting happens as long as people continue to skip right past the part where we require evidence for the claims of mainstream cable news.</p>

<p>Why downvote this post? Fill it to the brim with ineluctable evidence of a real shooting and sticky it to the front page! You can send doubters like myself there if they express any misgivings about a real shooting taking place!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand, guys. If there&#39;s so much evidence for a real shooting, where is it? How can a mass shooting happen and leave <em>no evidence of anything being shot?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have suspicions about the timing of this shooting, right after the Illuminati-promoted &quot;This is America&quot; bullshit music video comes out about shooting people that skyrockets to extraordinary popularity. Right after that guy wore the all-seeing eye to the Met Gala.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s NYT/all mass media glorifying the shooter as usual, telling us what we need to know.... he was an introvert, he was quiet...</p>

<p>This stuff is so utterly disturbing not because there was a &#39;school shooting&#39; but because it is so easy to see the agendas at play but there is not enough proof of anything... we just have to go along with what Big Brother media tells us. This shit follows the same patterns, and you just *know* something fishy is going on.</p>

<p>I also wonder how he was able to kill 10 people... with a shotgun and revolver... he had to stop and take time to reload, were people just waiting for him to shoot them? </p>

<p>10 killed, 10 wounded... 1 1 snake eyes. &quot;<strong><em>In Texas School Shooting, 10 Dead, 10 Hurt and Many Unsurprised&quot;</em></strong>  nice headline NYT. Yes, school shooting are very normal when it is on your agenda to have them every few months and you either mind control the victim to do it or outright make the event up in your media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great thread and great way to attack the idea that this was real.  We need more threads like this (compilation evidence threads and requests for compiled evidence), because in the 5+ years I&#39;ve been studying these things, I haven&#39;t found a single school shooting that I believe was genuine and happened the way it was reported.  Most of them I doubt that real bullets were even fired.  And yet this perspective remains effectively censored.  Thanks for posting.</p>

<p>Also, the shooter was stopped before he hurt anyone by a school cop.  This obviously doesn&#39;t fit the &quot;there&#39;s nothing we can do but ban guns&quot; narrative national media wants to push currently.  It&#39;s obvious that only one type of story is going to run on CNN these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;prepared testimony of a credible witness&quot; just makes you lose whatever impartiality you had. It&#39;s clear you have an agenda here. There&#39;s thousands of legal cases where a witness&#39; recounting of the events alone are enough circumstantial proof to lock someone up for years, yet a video or photos are instantly discarded simply because a news crew took them?      </p>

<p>Nobody is going to whip out their camera and start filming a gunman shooting a gun at them - most rational people actually get the instinct to <em>run the fuck away</em> from there. It&#39;s like saying &quot;Hitler never killed any jews! Where&#39;s the photos of him personally shooting a jew in the head? There&#39;s none so he is innocent&quot;. Circumstantial evidence is in most cases the only available evidence, and claiming the shooting is fake simply because there isn&#39;t a student&#39;s snapchat video of the shooter taking the gun out and personally shooting another student doesn&#39;t make it fake. Talk about moving the goalpost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who is moving the goalposts here?  OP is just asking for ANY credible evidence at all.</p>

<p>If the claim is outlandish - i.e., that a child shot up a school, then it requires evidence.  Any type of hard evidence would do - but all we get are people get angry at the people asking for evidence.</p>

<p>All we&#39;re asking for is reasonable discussion and hard evidence.  I just said courtroom testimony is different from news crew footage and you blatantly attack me, saying I have an agenda etc.  Where&#39;s the proof?  Why get so upset?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple: ask for proof which cannot be reasonably provided, then dismiss the whole shooting as fake because there isn&#39;t &quot;enough hard evidence&quot; to prove it&#39;s real. I said it before - unless the school had cameras that picked up video of him shooting students, there&#39;s likely no footage available of the shooting.     </p>

<p>There is, however, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/us/texas-santa-fe-school-shooting.html">numerous student&#39;s detailed descriptions of thee events</a>; there&#39;s also a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-school-resource-officer-john-barnes-shot-update-today-2018-05-18/">police officer who was shot</a> and is currently in the hospital (so there were indeed shots fired). We also know that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/05/19/texas-shooting-santa-fe-authorities-look-motive-after-10-killed/625672002/">he had explosives placed and with him, along with social media pictures of guns</a>.    </p>

<p>So, I ask again - what proof would you need on top of this for the shooting to be &quot;believable&quot;? Almost every single historic event can be &quot;reasonably doubted&quot; by your logic, there&#39;s hardly concrete proof of events and even less when we go back to pre-security cameras time. If you say &quot;any type of hard evidence would do&quot;, but won&#39;t believe people who provide statements or were in the shooting as it happened, you&#39;re intentionally sealioning. What do you want, pictures of the bodies spread out across every news outlet? you know they can&#39;t do that.     </p>

<p>So, OP is asking for &quot;credible evidence&quot;, but in fact isn&#39;t - he&#39;s asking for pictures of either dead bodies or a dead gunman, as that&#39;s the only irrefutable proof I can think of, and knows both of these cannot be provided. You also complain about me calling you out on an agenda - yet immediately assume the shooting to be false until proven otherwise? That&#39;s completely backwards and thankfully not how things work, ever.     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just said courtroom testimony is different from news crew footage     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, they&#39;re different, everyone can go to a courtroom and <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/this-day-in-politics-aug-17-1998-226998">blatantly lie about things</a>, whereas footage recording is at the very least impartial (unless it&#39;s been tampered with, but again, you cannot assume something to be false until proven otherwise without any serious basis on it).     </p>

<p>I remain civil, I engage your rethoric, I provide you with the only available proof at this time and that probably will ever be. Where&#39;s your source for claiming the shooting is fake? Where&#39;s your reasonable doubt? Or are you just outright saying &quot;because one shooting is fake, they&#39;re all fake&quot;? There&#39;s a difference between conspiracy theories and blatantly making up things/denying evidence just for the sake of building a narrative, and the sub is blurring the line more and more with each passing day. I await your response civilly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a report of a policeman in the hospital does not mean a policeman has been shot - we still don&#39;t have any evidence any guns were involved or fired as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

<p>Any kind of proof - I would accept anything that would prove that real guns were used, real danger was present, etc.  This all seems like a huge play to me, and no one has presented any evidence to the contrary :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your justification for claiming the shooting didn&#39;t happen is basically &quot;I don&#39;t have any evidence that it did, so I&#39;ll just believe what I want&quot;? Ok.    </p>

<p>I&#39;m all too familiar with MSM lies, and as I am, I&#39;m also familiar with people pushing distortive narratives for their agenda. You say the reasons you don&#39;t believe the shooting is real are too many to count - yet are any of them actually verifiable? Or is it unproved theory after theory?    </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a dumbed-down example so you get my point: &quot;I don&#39;t believe lions are real. I&#39;ve never been to a zoo, and the only pictures I ever saw of lions come from TV and news. We know TV lies, and nobody can provide me any evidence that lions do exist (I&#39;m definitely taking lion skin or teeth mailed to me as proof that they&#39;re real), so they don&#39;t. Why are people so stupid to believe such a bizarre animal exists when it&#39;s obviously fabricated?&quot;         </p>

<p>How is this argument different from yours? Also, I should note that there have been shootings recorded on camera or where victims have been photographed being injured. I&#39;d go through the trouble of looking them up, but at this point don&#39;t really think you&#39;ll believe anything I have to say.    </p>

<p>Lastly, don&#39;t say that bullshit &quot;I would accept any kind of proof&quot; because you wouldn&#39;t, and you know it. You would only accept evidence you deem furthering to your points and dismiss everything else, as you have. Confirmation bias at its finest.</p>

<p>However, this thread isn&#39;t about my perspective, this entire thread is dedicated to the request of actual information.

    <div class="md"><p>OP isn&#39;t pointing anything out, at the most he&#39;s asking for proof and nothing else. Also, there&#39;s a difference between certain events or things not adding up, and entire shootings being faked. Would you say the Vegas shooting never took place? Or the Pulse nightclub shooting? Or the Charlottesvile church shooting? Afaik there were photos of injured people for all of these. There is a difference.     </p>

<p>We&#39;ll have to wait and see more evidence pointing to either side - whether it was real or a hoax. Right now, all evidence available points to the shooting having taken place, but I&#39;m willing to suspend my belief until further proof is issued.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct - Pulse, Vegas, Charleston - no one was injured during any of these &quot;attacks.&quot;  They were media stunts that terrorized the public.  Pulse night club had been closed for weeks before the shooting, and there&#39;s no way anyone can smuggle an AR15 past a pat-down doorman.</p>

<p>Vegas we have tons of conflicting reports re:multiple shooters, and we also have gunfire being played over loudspeakers at the event itself - I also doubt there were any real casualties there.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t done as much research into the Charleston shooting, but it did appear that almost the entire identity of the &quot;shooter&quot; was falsified.  If the shooter wasn&#39;t real, how could the events have possibly transpired in the way they told us?</p>

<p>I understand that it&#39;s difficult to accept and you certainly shouldn&#39;t take my word on it, but as I said before, all of these &quot;mass shooting&quot; events of the past two decades appear to be terrorism not through violence, but through media lies and suggestion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll entertain your theory and double down with a theory of my own. Let&#39;s say the shootings were indeed staged -all of them- by a superior group with evil intentions. Why not simply matke the shootings happen? I mean, it&#39;s easy enough to give someone a gun and tell them to go shoot up x church or street, right? Why go through the whole ordeal of faking &quot;victims&quot; (which would necessary have to be relocated and disappear from the public eye forever, lest they are seen alive and the whole shooting comes crashing down), fake witnesses (which would have to be paid large sums of money for a long period of time, lest they talk about the operation 10 years down the line), fake news reports and media which would almost accrue to a Hollywood-esque production, when you can just drug someone into doing your bidding, and have them shoot up the places for real?      </p>

<p>The theory you propose is interesting but way overly complicated, imo, when it&#39;d be so much more easy to simply pay/force people to carry out the shootings for real. Now, if you say the shootings <em>did</em> take place, but were politically motivated/had some ulterior connected motive behind them, that seems to me like a much more likely (and plausible) theory. I&#39;d be interested in knowing your thoughts on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that still creates lots of circumstancial actors and persons involved, way too many variables (people in the lockdown seeing stuff they weren&#39;t supposed to see, one of the actors turning around on them, someone eventually discovering incriminating evidence) and is still fairly more complicated than simply coercing/drugging someone into shooting up whatever place you wish to. With such big players in the field, surely they would be able to &quot;afford&quot; the human cost of a few dozen deaths at most, and this way they get the public&#39;s sympathy but don&#39;t have to be covering their asses at every turn in such a complicated conspiracy.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll repeat myself: there is simply no proof that can be provided to you which will &quot;convince&quot; you. No shots of the bodies are allowed, afaik, so unless one of the Santa Fe students themselves hops into the sub and posts pics of their friends&#39; bodies online, we&#39;re not getting them.     </p>

<p>I can point out the opposite, though: how do you know the shooting <em>didn&#39;t</em> happen? You made this post when news of the shooting had baerly started being spread, so there&#39;s little possibility that the fakeness of the shooting had already been &quot;exposed&quot;. Therefore, you must&#39;ve blindly assumed the shooting to be false without any proof to back this claim either. Am I wrong?</p>

Nothing has been presented to this point that would prove the accusations beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty as there have been no statements given under oath and no witnesses have been cross-examined.

    <div class="md"><p>No dude see you’re still saying generic things. “Whatever you think is good evidence” translates to “if I don’t like it I can ignore it” I’m asking SPECIFICALLY!!:</p>

<p>Would you like eyewitness testimony? We both know that can be confusing and misleading in the initial aftermath, though I’m sure you’d accept someone saying “nothing happened” and reject someone saying “I saw my friend get shot in the face” as an actor</p>

<p>Would you like the fact that there are 10 funerals being planned? I’m sure that you’ll say there’s no proof of that (FYI NFL star JJ Watt has volunteered to pay for every funueral of the victims, but I’m sure that now the NFL is in on the false flag too huh?)</p>

<p>Would you like photos of dead kids? I’m sure if they would ever release those you’d screw “photoshop!!!! Look at that cellphone on the side it doesn’t look right it’s all fake!!!” And that’s ignoring the fact that we both know the OBVIOUS reason those photos won’t be released (not some grand conspiracy, but you know, that thing called basic fucking human decency when a parent has just buried their kid after they took a 12 gauge round of shot to their chest)</p>

<p>Would you like security camera footage? Great, likely not to be released for months because releasing crime scene videos isn’t something that happens LESS THAN 48 HOURS AFTER KIDS WERE MURDERED</p>

<p>SO I ask again, what SPECIFICALLY would convince you. And what of that evidence that would convince you would you expect to be released in LESS than 48 hours? Your post is WAY to soon if you want video proof but you know that. But I also have a feeling you wouldn’t accept video proof either. So please please please. Tell me what specifically would convince you other than “whatever you think” (this ain’t about what I think is good evidence. I think having 20ish parents not sending their kid to school on Monday is good evidence). I need you to say whatever YOU think is good evidence sir. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here I’ll make this easy for you my man. Tell me SPECIFICALLY what would convince you. If I cannot find it within a reasonable amount of time (considering this happened less than 48 hours ago this will take time) then I’ll go ahead and suck your correct cock and walk away with my tail between my legs.

<p>This is an email from the director of YES’ incoming program explaining that the Pakistani girl was killed in the shooting. Now YES is a national program so if you’re still insistent that no shooting happened that would require that for some random reason they decided to include the entire YES program, as well as the Pakistani officials who confirmed her death, in to this hoax as you claim it is. This director, you can look her up, is a legitimate director of a legitimate program that exhcanges students with over 40 countries</p>

<p>Now I’m sure you’ll say this isn’t any form of proof whatsoever, but you asked what I consider good proof. And this comes back to the entire reason I’ve been repeatedly asking you for what YOU would consider proof. So I’ll ask again</p>

<p>What would YOU consider legitimate proof? Is this good enough for you or will you dismiss this entirely? At this early stage this is by far the most convincing proof I have come across and I believe it. So tell me if this isn’t good enough for you and please explain why in addition to explaining what you would consider actual proof. </p>

<p>I have seen you make these threads after every shooting and I have never once seen you accept any evidence at all. (because I assume, you don&#39;t take witness statements as evidence. Which is fair enough tbh)</p>

<p>The only thing that would ever make you believe in a mass shooting would be if you were there yourself <strong>and</strong> took a bullet. But let&#39;s face it you wouldn&#39;t post about it.</p>

<p>Sorry if you think I am sliding, I guess I was OT. If you would like to answer my question in PM though and have a conversation about how you only need evidence to confirm certain beliefs I would up for that conversation. I&#39;ll leave your thread be now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was raised in the church, became a nonbeliever in college, called myself an atheist for a couple years, then got into conspiracy theories and my research in those areas has actually led me back into belief in a Creator. Though I&#39;m not deeply religious myself, I go to church to be with my family, specifically my widowed mother, and no longer have the antipathy for religious people I once did.</p>

<p>What helped me away from atheism is finding many problems with the current scientific (actually Scientistic) environment and worldview, where I have now come to see Science as its own religion, most of its followers blindly accepting whatever the authorities say. Specifically, we have been lied to about missions to space, in what I can only conclude is an attempt to lead the population away from the belief that they were intelligently designed.</p>

<p>But enough about me.. you make the straw man argument that no evidence will convince me other than being there myself and seeing a dead body. That&#39;s simply not true. If any of these events looked or felt like a real shooting I would have to admit that the evidence is convincing and even overwhelming. But we don&#39;t see this do we? We just see a bunch of people making excuses on the internet for why they don&#39;t have any evidence and personally attacking the people like me who think that we are being lied to about these events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So literally 100s of witnesses (spread over all these shootings) Any person that was ever &quot;killed&quot; has to be relocated away from their family. Literally, 100s of personnel to makeup spread and then control the story and everyone that was apparently there. </p>

<p>We are talking about entire schools and their faculty and student body in on this with nothing ever leaking <strong>ever.</strong></p>

<p>I am open to them being false flags because let&#39;s face it, it would be a million times easier to just shoot up the school and then blame it on a patsy. </p>

<p>This whole it&#39;s all a fake story just makes no sense to me. I think it is far more likely that lack of affordable and decent mental health care coupled with hordes of school kids now on fuck tons of medication when a large portion of them probably don&#39;t even need it a far more likely culprit than the whole thing is fabricated. </p>

<p>And my argument wasn&#39;t in any way a strawman. How many of these threads have you made now? I remember at least three. And when people have asked you &quot;what would you consider acceptable&quot; evidence the only thing I remember you saying is what you just said to me</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If any of these events looked or felt like a real shooting I would have to admit that the evidence is convincing and even overwhelming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What would <strong>you</strong> consider evidence enough?</p>

<p>Not any eyewitness statements.</p>

<p>Not any LEO statements.</p>

<p>Not statements from the families.</p>

<p>So what would be good enough? Short of being inside a school when it happens what would you consider enough evidence?</p>

<p>Before I go a quick aside into the religion thing again. So because you don&#39;t agree with the way the government uses science sometimes(stuff taken out of context, numbers massaged etc etc) and the way some people will listen to anything as long as a &quot;scientist&quot; says it your answer to that was to decide to believe in the Almighty instead? </p>

<p>And if the space missions were all bullshit what is more likely?</p>

<p>They were fabricated to keep ahead in the space race against the Russians.</p>

<p>They wanted to cover up intelligent design.</p>

<p>I know which one I would find much more likely.</p>

<p>Organised religion is the biggest conspiracy the world has ever or will ever know. It is nothing but a tool for controlling people and empowering those at the top.</p>

<p>Without religions holding us back as a species for close to a thousand years I wonder where we would be now. When you look at how far we have come in the last 100 years, hell 50 years I can&#39;t imagine what we lost while being kept in the dark ages.</p>

<p>I have no problem with people that wish to believe that is up to them but I do like to talk about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s a lot easier than you think to invent fake personas and convince people they are real using emotional appeals and repetitive reinforcement. It also requires the co-operation of far fewer people than you may realise. </p>

<p>Nobody double-checks anything, and most people won’t even question the narrative. You can’t rely on anyone else to do that for you, certainly not the media itself — they only disseminate propaganda.</p>

<p>Every past victim I’ve personally researched has had connections or a background that brought their story into serious doubt. The majority appear to be completely fake, with an online presence that abruptly ends, while the few who <em>might</em> be real having some government connection in their immediate family.</p>

Then you have the police department, EMS and fire department that responded, which ones called this event fake?  This doesn&#39;t even mention the family members of all the students there, or staff within the school.  Does it seem logical to you that an event like this could be faked without a large number of people talking to reporters and saying that it is fake?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now I&#39;m gonna highjack this thread because I think it&#39;ll be controversial enough to get more views:</p>

<p>On a serious note please don&#39;t let my actions take away from the very real trauma that the very real victims went through. If you look hard enough through my profile you&#39;ll see that I really am from Texas (by way of Houston) and I have family in Santa Fe. My cousin&#39;s best friend was shot and killed yesterday. Please don&#39;t let these people claim nonsense like it didn&#39;t happen, it very much did and we could use all the thoughts love and prayers right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good heavens man I’m starting to think you’ll never define what you consider eveidence. Here I’ll post a single thing, you can tell me how it’s not evidence, I can tell you that’s exactly why I’m asking for you to define what evidence you would consider, and we can go from there. How about that? Sound like a deal? Now I’ll need your help here I’m on mobile and I’m not sure how to post a photo. If you can explain that to me I’ll post a photo for you</p>
