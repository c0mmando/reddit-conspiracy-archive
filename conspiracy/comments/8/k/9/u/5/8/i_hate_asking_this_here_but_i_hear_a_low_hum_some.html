And it changes my whole &quot;vibe&quot; when it happens. If you know what I mean. It just stops my train of thought. Ive found similar claims on the internet, but cant find an answer. When It happens I just feel that my neighbours are aware of it too, and it just stops everyones flow and makes them pay attention to this weird hum. (vibration).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How long have you been hearing this hum? When did it start? Does it happen before you go to sleep? Can you recall being around any loud sound that may have damaged your eardrums? It could be as simple as a damaged eardrum to an excess of wax. It could also be a mild form of tinitus or legionares. Ask the people around you if they hear it. It could also have something to do with your proximity to the sea. Perhaps there is a seabreeze blowing against something creating a hum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said Legionarres disease in the above commemt but I meant to say Menieres disease. I got them confused. Menieres affects the level of fluid in your ears. Also I was just that going on a plane with that much congestion in your sinuses and ears could have caused permenant damage that is resulting in this auditory issue.

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few things like this around the world. Unexplained low frequency hums. There&#39;s even a Wikipedia article about the phenomena. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hum</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not aware of any specific conspiracy explanations for them. Probably mundane industry in most cases. Or maybe even mass hallucination. The Wikipedia article says that &quot;there is skepticism as to whether it exists as a physical sound&quot; and goes on to describe efforts to confirm the sound exists. Sounds like maybe stress may trigger a negative response like you&#39;re describing? </p>

<p>If you do a web search for the name of your city followed by &quot;hum&quot; you might find more local information. That seems to be what these things are generally referred to as. Don&#39;t expect any clear-cut, definitive answers though. </p>

<p>Chapter 29: HUM JOBS AND BALLS OF FIRE </p>

<p>Evidence that electromagnetic weapons are currently being 
directed at civilian populations include strange sounds 
described all over the world as &quot;the Hum,&quot; &quot;the Sound,&quot; or just 
&quot;It,&quot; a low, rumbling noise at the very edge of audibility. The 
sound is described as persistent and maddening, as irritating as 
the screech of fingernails on a blackboard. 
In Taos, New Mexico, &quot;the Hum&quot; has been going on since 
1991. &quot;It sounds like a great, big American car engine that&#39;s on 
idle,&quot; said Steven Walters. &quot;When I first heard it, I thought I 
was going crazy.&quot; </p>

<p>Laboratories were formed to investigate the phenomenon in Taos, 
New Mexico, but predictably they found nothing. Their 
speculations tend towards the sounds originating in the ear 
itself, and the motion of Earth&#39;s tectonic plates. My guess is 
they know exactly what is causing the sound. </p>

<p>The once-skeptical Rep. Bill Richardson, of the House 
Intelligence Committee, knows that &quot;the Hum&quot; is not delusion. 
He told a meeting in Taos that the sound is &quot;defense related&quot; 
and requested that the Pentagon &quot;shut it down.&quot; 
Another investigator, Bob Saltzman, talks about a scientist on 
the House Science, Space and Technology Committee losing his 
job over his claims that the Department of Defense was 
responsible for the hum. He also reports that Rep. Richardson 
has since backed off of his investigation and won&#39;t return his 
phone calls.</p>

<p>Other incidents suggesting the testing of advanced 
electromagnetic or other weapons are the literally hundreds of 
unusual fireballs — usually green or orange -red — and other strange
aerial phenomena that have been observed worldwide in recent 
years.</p>

<p>Since the May, 1993 fireball and earthquakes, there have 
been more than 1,000 reports in Australia of fireballs and 
strange light phenomena, as well as large numbers of similar 
events worldwide. Many of the fireballs are reported to have 
made the same &quot;freight train&quot; sounds as they passed. 
It is significant to note that residents who witnessed the Tom 
Price fireballs noted that they had come from the direction of an 
American &quot;Very Low Frequency submarine communication base&quot; 
at Exmouth Peninsula, a location supposedly turned over to the 
Australian Navy by the U.S., but where there are still a number of 
American technicians resident. </p>

<p>The Exmouth Peninsula site consists of a power station and 
&quot;Tower Zero,&quot; a high box-like aerial tower on a hilltop with 11 
equally spaced smaller towers — each about 1,000 feel 
tall — arrayed around it. The towers are connected by wire 
forming three concentric circles. Inside of Tower Zero is an 
elevator that runs to the top of the tower. </p>

<p>Entering the tunnel that goes into the hillside at Tower Zero 
one finds an at least three-story underground base, with a 50 
foot high by 15 -foot diameter copper coil. The cover story is 
that the Exmouth site is transmitting very low frequency (VLF) 
or extremely low frequency (ELF) radio messages to submarines, 
but an examination of the facility reveals that it is a Tesla 
Magnifying Energy Transmitter, that is, a Tesla electromagnetic 
weapons system. </p>

<p>Another aspect of these events are huge blue-white light 
flashes of the type seen at Rocky Gully, Western Australia, in 
1996. According to Australian researcher Harry Mason, &quot;blue- 
white streamers of arcing electricity issued from the forest floor 
into the atmosphere, creating an intense, violent, blue-white 
glow (and an attendant &#39;electrical noise&#39;) that was visible for 
miles — &#39;like someone with a giant arc welder&#39;. This event 
persisted for at least several minutes. The observers fled the 
area in fear for their lives, phased out by the apparently 
enormous energy involved in the event.&quot; </p>

<p>According to Mason, &quot;These massive energy bursts of high- 
altitude, blue-white and/or ground level electrical arcs are 
reasonably common and I have about 100 such documented 
events&quot; listed in his database. </p>

<p>These may be the same high energy bursts that have been 
seen by pilots in clear skies, and detected by the Compton 
Gamma Ray Observatory satellite, launched in 1991 by the space 
shuttle, and the ALEXIS spy satellite. These satellites have 
detected radio and gamma ray bursts about 100,000 feet above 
the Earth, seen most frequently over Africa and South America. 
The scientists running these programs have not said much about 
the phenomena, &quot;the likes of which are not described in the 
scientific literature.&quot; [7] </p>

<p>Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Tom Bearden talked 
about similar phenomena in 1985. He said, &quot;There have been a 
series of tests of these kinds of [electromagnetic] weapons, 
apparently for a number of years. For example, airliners from 
Iran, before the fall of the Shah, saw deep within the Soviet 
Union very large, glowing spherical balls of light which started 
out small and then expanded to very large size, which are 
apparently these kind of weapons for use in an anti-ballistic 
missile defense role.&quot; </p>

<p>Bearden also stated, &quot;...You can create, for example, either an 
electromagnetic explosion at a distance, or you can create an 
electromagnetic implosion at a distance... This would look like a 
cold explosion, so to speak, and I believe the thing on April the 
9th, 1984, off the coast of Japan that involved several 747 jet 
airliners [is an example of this].&quot; </p>

<p>Another frequently observed aerial display is of orange-red 
vertical beams, reported since about 1985, with at least 100 
events reported since that time. </p>

<p>Mason reports that, &quot;One 1996 Brisbane beam event report 
was very significant as the observers saw very high-voltage, blue- 
white discharge streamers issuing from their house wall- 
mounted main power box as an orange beam hovered nearby in 
the sky. Members of another household reported their power 
box hummed violently as the orange beam hovered some 
distance in the sky. </p>

<p>&quot;This data confirms the probability that Tesla-style 
longitudinal scalar EM potentials were involve in this Brisbane 
event (and therefore were possibly present during the other 
beam events), probably created by a remote Tesla EM 
transmitter...&quot; [9] </p>

<p>The following radio interview provides additional insight on 
the current state of electromagnetic weaponry, and information 
on the sorts of advanced weaponry that may have been used to 
generate the Perth fireball and other events of this nature. It is 
excerpted from the Moscow broadcast of The Voice of Russia: 
&quot;Science and Engineering,&quot; that aired December 12, 1996. The<br/>
excerpt begins: </p>

<p>&quot;Our next question is from Ross Dowe in Victoria, Australia. 
He&#39;s interested in science in general, but was particularly 
intrigued by a program last April, in which you, Boris, spoke of 
microwave generator development in Russia. He&#39;d like you to 
return to the subject... First of all, could you explain why there 
is an interest in such generators&quot;... </p>

<p>BORIS BELITSKY: Powerful microwave generators are of 
interest, for one thing, because of their possible military 
applications. They can be used to fire a plasmoid, that is, a blob 
of plasma... </p>

<p>YEKIMENKO: Remind us, Boris, just what is meant by 
plasma... </p>

<p>BELITZKY: Plasma is a mixture of electrons and ions. We 
have all seen it, for example, in electric arc discharges and in 
sparks. It is also a prime factor in thermonuclear reactions, as 
in the sun. Space scientists in this country have a long record of 
experimenting with it. For example, plasma engines were 
tested in some of the early Soviet Mars probes, a quarter of a 
century ago. Very extensive studies of plasma have been carried 
out under the program of research into controlled nuclear 
fusion. Research into the military applications has been 
conducted at some of the leading research institutes of the 
military-industrial complex, for example at the Research 
Institute of Radio Instruments. </p>

<p>YEKIMENKO: How would a microwave generator be used 
in war, Boris? </p>

<p>BELITZKY: It would be used to fire a plasmoid, that is, a 
blob of plasma into the path of an incoming missile, its warhead, 
or an aircraft. The plasmoid would effectively ionize that region 
of space and, in this way, disturb the aerodynamics of the flight 
of the missile, warhead, or aircraft, terminate their flight, 
making such a generator and its plasmoid a practically 
invulnerable weapon, providing protection against attack via 
space or the atmosphere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;d want to investigate further: it would be good if you could pinpoint the frequency of this hum. I suggest using the following method;</p>

<p>Do a search for &quot;50 Hz wave&quot; or &quot;50 Hz tone&quot;. You&#39;ll find one or more youtube vids. Play it when the hum is present; turn it off. See if you can tell if the hum is higher, lower, or matching in frequency.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you find it&#39;s higher: now search for &quot;60 Hz wave&quot;. Compare again.</p>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p>Try to find a (near) matching tone, and thus pinpoint the exact frequency of the hum. Report back please!</p>
