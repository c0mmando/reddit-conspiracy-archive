       It's clear he doesn't want to work at it, example: he wants us to provide him data for his book but thinks so little of us he won't capitalize or punctuate. I wonder if this turd picks his nose in his car because he doesn't know anybody who can see him.

       The Catholic Churches connection to Pedophillia ( I believe the leadership of the Church has been corrupted by satanists who use molestation as an occultic ritual

       There is a retarded amount of evidence about this and its been happening for basically all of history of the church but only recently orld wide connectivity has allowed victims to come forward without being harrassed, but even within the past few years there was a case of a 10 year old girl having her arm broken by a nun for coming forward

       A good start is the netflix doc, "The Keepers" basically a priest molested a kid and the parents flipped their shit at the Catholic equivalent of a superintendent, and what did that Catholic official do?
      </p>
      <p>
       They transferred the child rapist to another Catholic school where he raped like 100 more kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example the current Pope came in on a platform of stopping this shit, he formed the "council for the protection of children"
      </p>
      <p>
       annnnddd the entire council resigned because he blatantly ignored them and actively promoted known pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, the church has outposts in nearly every medium-sized city on earth, they transcend national borders and never have to pay taxes, they collect obscene amounts of money purely off of reciting from a book for an hour at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freud believed that Molestation at a certain age caused specific traits to arise in the victims well into adulthood and remain for that individual's entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Current psychology doesn't put it so bluntly but it is known that abuse at different ages has different long term effects, and that the stress of molestation changes a humans dna to the point that a parents sexual trauma can actually be passed down to their child through genetics, this hasnt been researched that much publicly but,
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It is fact molestation causes life long trauma
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Intense stress and Trauma causes DNA changes which are based down to offspring.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So its a pretty easy conclusion
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that some shadow group is commiting molestation on a massice scale and slowly "infecting" the world with some kind of altered mindset induced by trauma that they have deemed valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could be occuring for 2 reasons.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Sterotypical evil illuminati shit, they figure if a high enough of the population is permanently traumatized or an offspring of a permanently traumatized person, that it will work in their favor, we will be easily controlled cattle, yada yada yada.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I actually dont buy that, I find it hard to believe so many people are so unjustifiably evil, so power hungry and recklessly ambitious that they literally have given in to evil completely, I mean maybe, i am not discounting it which is why i listed it. But this brings me to number 2.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        They actually think they are doing "the right thing", I used to grow plants, if you let a plant grow untouched in a safe enviorment giving it everything it needs you end up with a decent plant, but if you specifically "stress" the plant in planned ways through various methods you end up with 2x the fruit, and a stronger more resilient plant, but if you overstress the plant in goes into shock and it ends up weaker than it woulld have been if you had just left it alone.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       My point is this tranlates to humans fairly well, I think the occultic molesters believe they are furthering evolution and creating a smarter more resilient species, they figure that if humanity is left to live easy lives we will eventually devolve into docile and unintelligent beasts guided by desire for pleasure and gratification.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes more sense to me as it would be alot easier to amass a secret society with a goal thats more of a "we do what no else will because it needs to be done for the good of all humanity and humanities future"  compared to "lets absolutely fuck over the peasants so we can have docile sheep and bigger mansions and 10 Lambos instead of 6"
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant, this is just a personal theory of mine combined with a lot of publicly available info that makes alot of sense to me.

       i have often considered this myself. - that they are doing it for the longterm good of humanity... but looking at the distress of the bottom 80% of society for the last few hundred years(at the very least). makes me realeyes thats its just wishful thinking. they are parasites and they feed of us.  in fact they farm us.. everything they do is to raise productivity.

       We are on the cusp of the singularity though, human productivity will become nearly inrrelevant within 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self-Driving cars will kill the trucking and taxi industry and eventually commerical piloting, soon factory and warehouse work will be completely automated, soon cashiering will be completely automated (see amazon grocery stores).
      </p>
      <p>
       These examples are not comprehensive and many many other fields will be completely automated through a combination of advanced robotics and AI but even just these few examples coming to fruition (i give it 10ish years) will completely collapse the labor market as jobs that have been a staple of the lower class and even the middle class will just completely disappear and 100 employees will be replaced by 3 technicians, atleast until they create technician bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is the plan from there, when 10s of millions of low skill workers have no where to turn to?

       Reports started hitting the Mainstream in like the 60s and its been a consistent factor ever since with massive scandals with dozens or even hundreds of victims being semi-common.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about this, in our modern age, a 10 year old girl was raped by a priest, and a female nun violently beat her for "heresy"
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine trying to come forward as a victim of a "respected member of the community" pre 60s.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all the church would ruin your life and slander you as a drug using, harlot. Second, just about no one would believe you. Third, the framework was not in place for a victim to be able to go to the media or authorities for help and even if they did once again they would likely be called liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also heard of cases where priests describe their semen as "holy" and a "gift from god" as a way to confuse their victim and maintain silence. Not to mention the regular old dynamic of fear, you are a kid being raped by an adult, you are going to be scared and embarrassed and want to just forget it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is 10s of thousands of children minimum have been raped by catholic officials, and the entire leadership refuses to do anything about it and arguably approves of and enables this behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is pretty logical to assume this epidemic of abuse didnt just pop into existence the second the first report was on the news, and in the past (especially in pre industrial era) it would have been laughably easy to get away with it, as in probably every single priest who did it got away with it because their victims either stayed silent, or came forward and were deemed liars and often violently beaten and slandered.

       The British government is purposely under-funding the NHS so that it will fail and there will be an increase in calls for it to be totally privatized.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The report concludes that, given the dramatic differences between Britain and other countries: “A general picture emerges that suggests the NHS is under-resourced.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The thinktank’s research found that the UK has the third-lowest number of doctors among the 21 nations, with just 2.8 per 1,000 people, barely half the number in Austria, which has 5.1 doctors per 1,000 of population.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, the UK has the sixth-smallest number of nurses for its population: just 7.9 per 1,000 people – way behind Switzerland, which has the most: 18 nurses, more than twice as many.
       </p>
       <p>
        With hospital beds, the UK has just 2.6 for every 1,000 people, just over a third of the number in Germany, which has the most – 8.1 beds – and which places the UK 18th overall out of the 21 countries which the OECD gathered figures for. The number of hospital beds in England has halved over the last 30 years and now stands at about 100,000, though the NHS added about 4,000 more as an emergency measure in December, January and February to help it cope with the spike in patient numbers caused by the long, cold winter.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Despite the desire to protect health spending, the English NHS continues to face huge financial and operational pressures. Hospitals and other providers of health care services now routinely report significant annual financial deficits, and cuts to social care services have increased demands and pressures on health care services.

        not be why doesn’t the NHS perform better compared to other health systems, but how does it manage to perform so well compared to other countries on delivering accessible and equitable care when it is so clearly under-resourced
       </em>
       ."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all backed up by a Public Accounts Committee on
       <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/sustainability-transformation-nhs-17-19/">
        Sustainability and Transformation in the NHS inquiry
       </a>
       , which said that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The NHS is still very much in survival mode, with budgets unable to keep pace with demand. The Department of Health and Social Care (the Department), NHS England and NHS Improvement are too focused on propping up the system and balancing the books in the short term and have not paid enough attention on transforming and improving patient services in the long term.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and a House of Commons Library briefing on
       <a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN00724">
        NHS Funding and Expenditure
       </a>
       , said pretty much the same thing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Around £6 billion of additional health funding up to 2019/20 was announced in the Autumn Budget 2017. Even with these additional funds, concerns remain that the NHS will continue to face considerable pressures. A joint statement in response to the Autumn Budget by the King’s Fund, Health Foundation and Nuffield Trust13 argued that with NHS funding growth slowing to just 0.4%, planned expenditure is not enough to maintain standards of care and meet the rising demand for health services. They estimate that NHS spending requires a 4.3% average annual increase to keep pace with demographic and cost pressures.

       Mystery Babylon is a series by William “Bill” Cooper, a man who warned Americans to be prepared for a major attack not from Osama bin Laden but rather from those behind the New World Order before it happened.  He was killed in a shootout with police later that year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The series explains the mystery religion veiled in symbolism originating from at least ancient Babylon and its different variations up until the mid 90s.  By being initiated into the mystery schools, the initiate is revealed its secrets and becomes “illuminated”.  The mystery schools exist today in the form of secret societies.  The mystery religions worship Lucifer, “the light bearer”.  The priesthood has ruled over mankind for thousands of years.  Babylon.  Egypt.  Rome, which became the Roman Catholic Church.  And so on.  Their age old dream is bringing about the New World Order.  A one world socialist totalitarian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mystery Babylon series will educate you on this providing sources like some of the most prolific Masonic authors in history.  To an extent, it is as if you took a course in a mystery school; except without the blood oaths and worship of something representing Lucifer.

       The fascist plot to overthrow the American government. The government intentionally poisoning alcohol during prohibition-- thousands and thousands died. Planned obsolescence is fun. The Tuskegee "Experiment." LSD poisoning of a French town by the US government. The Manhattan Project. The radio records of transmissions from a cosmonaut who would have been the first human in space, she burned alive (USSR). GMO patents on seeds...once a farmer loses their organic seed stock, they must buy the right to use those patented seeds, in perpetuity. How milk formula was introduced in Africa very cheaply and then prices were hiked drastically, leading to thousands of dead babies. Twilight birth. Eugenics, in America, has a looooong history and was often coercive, systematic, and sometimes covert. Continued breach of treaties between the colonists/US government and multiple native nations/tribes. Pitting different native groups against eachother to make the subjugation of all by colonists so much easier in the wake of tribal warfare--a tactic reiterated over and over across continents (Americas, Africa, India). We had advanced knowledge of Pearl Harbor attack and it was used to get America into the European theater, in addition to the Pacific theater, as well as justify the new navy fleet. America's wars since 1945....many have subterfuge....they're possibly part of a strategy to bankrupt the USSR in addition to securing resources for the greater Western Empire. Check out the Iran/Contra scandal, which is so wicked it's almost beautiful. Vietnam, the French colony, was a major drug producer. As is Afghanistan. Heroin epidemic? What? How did THAT happen right after we entered Afghanistan? Yellow cake and Saddam Hussein was a lie. Banana Republic. Google it.  The DeBeers' diamond ad campaign created the diamond market. Switzerland is not neutral. Lol. Why do both sides of Congress stand, immediately, to applaud Israel during the state of the union address? What is AIPAC? (Tread carefully. Do not discuss this in public.) What are petrodollars and why was the Wikipedia page whitewashed? Where do most of the weapons in global conflicts originate? Why is America always, always at war (all but 2 years since 1945) and what is the military industrial complex (don't mention this in mixed company either!), slavery continued in other forms after the civil war, The federal reserve...Why does it exist?, what is "the company store?" and how might an entire society function as a debt colony, or "company store?", predatory lending to third world nations is particularly disgusting, cash crops were forced upon colonized people through violence means and this may be why hunger became a catastrophic problem in the third world, why are NASA video feeds so fucking weird and what is layering in videography, why did we see radioactivity and molten material in the pits below the twin towers and why were there seismic readings just PRECEEDING the collapses, why did the US government take so long to respond to the AIDS plague (hint: the thinking beneath eugenics is still with us), how do Rhodes scholars function in our society and who funds them, how did the automotive and gas industry sabotage trolleys and railroads, sorry, I'll stop....

       I don't have time to go through the comments so I apologize if this has been said already, but the Phoenix lights is pretty cool. Especially when you look at the Heaven's Gate cult. They believed an extraterrestrial spacecraft would be following the Hale-bopp comet. And then the Phoenix lights happened within a few days of the comet.
