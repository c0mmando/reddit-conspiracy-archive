        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>9/11 ultimately served many purposes but it was primarily a mass ritual to create an enormous amount of loosh energy to be harvested by the Archons (parasites). The towers were specifically built to be destroyed in this ritual and they have a lot of symbolism surrounding them. They represent Boaz and Jachin, the two pillars of entrance to the Temple of Solomon. They also represent the number 11, which is an important number to them. I’m not exactly certain what the significance of 11 is but it may have to do with the 1-1 duality that generates conflict and destruction.</p>

<p>The fact that this tragedy was a ritual is just disgusting. What’s even worse is that these entities have manipulated humanity so that they’ve done it to themselves.</p>

<p>WW2 went from 1939 - 1945. <strong>6 years</strong> - <strong>60 million deaths</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I´d say we´re in unseen territory here, science fiction territory, not even generally systemically dysfunctional (read: lawless) countries behave like this (e.g. mass school shootings are still largely unheard of in Mexico, Central America, etc..–not even Boko Haram massacres the victims of the high schools it terrorizes). In the U.S., the states have generally all but literally abandoned their child citizens at the sacrificial altar of the Second Amendment. These are pyres of underage dead in whose preparation is complicit a political culture in thrall to the gods of a capitalist economy, the internal economic and ideological face of which is the domestic assault weapons industry. This is a form of jihad, of domestic terrorism, whose army is the coalesced force of an evident epidemic of adolescent mental illness in the U.S.</p>

<p>Yes, the catalyst/standard was set by Columbine, to be sure, but I would also submit that it was set by 9/11 as well. For that is when, in my impression, a metaphysical Schrödinger’s cat/uncertainty principle-like ontology (in the colloquial or popular sense of the terms) took hold of the imagination of significant sectors and cultures within the U.S. In short, what has done more to destroy a belief in a commonly humanly shared notion of reality was not the left, through its ¨deconstructivist¨ jargon, et., but rather the phenomenal/symbolic repercussions and effects of the surrealistic and ¨unrealistic¨ reality of the 9/11 events per se.</p>

<p>One possible effect of a vitiated/debilitated phenomenological/ontological experience of reality following the aforesaid terrorist events in New York might even be a more generalized sense, especially among youth (where this psychology is already inherent and latent), that since reality is ¨not really real,¨ because they are already living in a post 9/11 Matrix as it were, then the deaths they might be insanely tempted to cause are somehow not really real either. These attackers would then be beyond flat earthers in their denial of modern axioms of what constitutes reality. Phenomenologically and ontologically (via the continuing facilitation of life lived largely in the alternate dimensions of online space) they may come to intuitively view offline reality as a patchwork of idiosyncratic, essentially unbridgable dimensions between potentially other existent individuals, thus there is not one reality to them, but rather each individual exists in their ontological dimension, and thus the Other´s existence is already a priori in doubt, and so by extension the value of the Other´s life as well, because it is intrinsically less real than the in itself potentially unreal reality of the perpetrators themselves, per the strange physical/cosmological laws of the ontology they have come to psychology and socially (Orwellianly and Borgesianly) inhabit in late capitalist-stage American society.</p>

<p>Indeed, and in short, perhaps, for the above speculated reasons, the subliminal temptation for the mass murder of their companions and contemporaries lies, perversely and in a phenomenon which was ironically quite inversely lived by Dostoevsky, in an affinity with so-called the Schrodinger’s cat phenomenon (alternatingly and almost literally exemplifying the mystical paradoxical assertion of being alternatively within the span of microseconds dead in life/living in death, with the very foundations of quotidian, lived reality itself being somehow inexorably, necessarily and materially, not just metaphysically, undermined once the implications of such a phenomenon are sufficiently understood).</p>

<p>Dostoevsky´s description of his Schrodingerian reprieve, of his unspairing experience of Death-in-Life and Life-in-Death in the span of a seconds: ´”As to life in a prison, of course there may be two opinions,” said the prince. “I once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a prison–I heard it from the man himself. He was one of the persons under treatment with my professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy, then he would weep, and once he tried to commit suicide. His life in prison was sad enough; his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree that grew outside his grating…There was a very strange feature in this case, strange because of its extremely rare occurrence. This man had once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some political crime. Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some other punishment substituted; but the interval between the two sentences, twenty minutes, or at least a quarter of an hour, had been passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die. I was very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful time, and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and felt. He remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary distinctness, and declared that he would never forget a single iota of the experience.</p>

<p>“About twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the sentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the criminals (of whom there were several). The first three criminals were taken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them. Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. My friend was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been among the third lot to go up. A priest went about among them with a cross: and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live.</p>

<p>“He said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable period, an enormous wealth of time; he seemed to be living, in these minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that last moment, so that he made several arrangements, dividing up the time into portions–one for saying farewell to his companions, two minutes for that; then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career and all about himself; and another minute for a last look around. He remembered having divided his time like this quite well. While saying good- bye to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very usual everyday question, and being much interested in the answer. Then having bade farewell, he embarked upon those two minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself; he knew beforehand what he was going to think about. He wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible, that here was he, a living, thinking man, and that in three minutes he would be nobody; or if somebody or something, then what and where? He thought he would decide this question once for all in these last three minutes. A little way off there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the sun. He remembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at the rays of light sparkling from it. He could not tear his eyes from these rays of light; he got the idea that these rays were his new nature, and that in three minutes he would become one of them, amalgamated somehow with them.</p>

<p>“The repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately, and the uncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of all was the idea, ‘What should I do if I were not to die now? What if I were to return to life again? What an eternity of days, and all mine! How I should grudge and count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!’ He said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it, and wished they would shoot him quickly and have done with it.”´* (The Idiot, Dostoevsky)</p>

<p>Is this the intuitively ¨Schrödingerian¨ experience being pursued by not a few of the recent mass school shooters in America, the liminal/violent psychedelic mysticism of Death-In-Life acutely accompanied and even seemingly coupled or blurred with Life-In-Death, from which the untimely and all too fleeting, but nevertheless uniquely obtainable realization of the real and actual conditions of and dynamics in one´s tormented existence are, even if perhaps also inevitably maddeningly and dehumanizingly, finally and ultimately manifested and revealed?</p>

This account derives from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn&#39;s view of Genesis,[7] in which Da&#39;ath represents the fall of man from a unified consciousness into a duality between ego and divine nature.&quot;</p>

Some were just &#39;snotty brags&#39;, as seen in movies &amp; TV shows, but others were straight up weaponized neuro-linguistic mind bombs, such as implanting the numbers &#39;9-11&#39; deep into the collective-unconscious (via the national &#39;emergency&#39; phone #) &amp; connect them to the emotions &amp; memetics of <em>emergency</em> <em>problem</em> <em>&quot;help me&quot;</em> <em>terror</em> <em>death</em>, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 1980s America was in a secret tit for tat war with Libya, gaddafi was funding terrorist activities around the world bombing airlines and nightclubs he Evan had terrorist training camps.
In 1986 america bombed Libya in operation el dorado canyon killing Gaddafi&#39;s family members and almost killing him he had to scramble to survive.
He was deeply pissed by this and orders the Lockerbie bombing killing over 200 people.
Gaddafi was a man with a plan and a true hatred for all things American. He had the money the power and the terrorists to pull of the 911 attack and planes were his forte.
Thats why he had to die, gadafi was a bad guy.
Bin laden was a cave man that didn&#39;t own socks or a bathroom or perfume and his donkey may have been borrowed from a friend.</p>

Because of my childish mind I couldn&#39;t comprehend what was going on.
I woke up dad and told him that my cartoons were not on tv, in fact I remember saying nothing is on.
He hoped up went to the TV and stood there staring, after a few minutes he said in a sturn dad voice &quot; next time the two biggest buildings in the world get knocked down, don&#39;t wake me up and say nothing is on TV&quot; that&#39;s my first memory of terrorism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>
