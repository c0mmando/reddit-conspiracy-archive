    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve studied active shooters and even had to write some doctrine for use on my last duty station. They come in groups. They&#39;re actually inspired by each other.  A study the MSM will never reference came out from the APA done by UNM psychologists. Their conclusion after a long, in-depth analysis was that active shooters have little to do with the availability of firearms but their motivation comes from the fame previous shooters achieved. They also pretty much straight up said the media is complicit in this because the ratings surrounding these events are cash cows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever read about the absolutely insane amount of serial killers we had in the 60s through the 80s? Funny when the public got tired of them and the shock value was gone the media stopped reporting on them constantly, always looking out for the new, hip serial killer and then their numbers declined dramatically. The first few paragraphs of this article have the raw numbers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2011/01/blood_loss.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2011/01/blood_loss.html</a></p>

<p>Basically, before the 60s we barely had any true serial killers. </p>

<p>I believe what we are seeing now is the same phenomenon all over again and it&#39;s being done on purpose. They don&#39;t need to do all of this fancy MKUltra stuff to get active shooters. They profit while making them famous, it inspires copycats, and they profit more while also advancing their gun control agenda. </p>

<p>All of the shooters have a few things in common but mostly they are socially ostracized young men with low or no empathy. They see these other guys similar to them in many aspects who went from being the local loser to a national villian, spoken about as if they were some super skilled killer, a real badass monster of a man. </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s some shady stuff about Sandy Hook and Parkland for sure but the thing to realize is that there doesn&#39;t need to be. They can just bait the hook and wait. </p>
