       - When you read the bible in it's original language Hebrew, it's clear that the Lord God did not create man. The word "god" and "Lord God" have
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/B35AO">
        two different definitions
       </a>
       . This means that

       <em>
        all
       </em>
       teach that a single Lord God created man, which is not true. Religious or not, you should understand this. The worlds most powerful "people" are hiding this fact from you.

       You know outside of this subreddit people are talking about how there is a propaganda being posted here?
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is it.  It's a massive accumulated list of made up nonsense based on pre existing stereotypes and clever half-truths. You read it critically, it'll take you days to refute. It's gish gollop. You try to pick it apart,  you get called a shill.  It's really powerful propaganda, as so many are willing to believe any negative story about the rich and powerful.

       I Didn't have time to read all of your stuff, but the many of the things with the Vatican are pure conjecture.  You could very easily draw more lines to make a completely different picture.  The Vatican and Catholics do not worship Mary.  That's a common misconception.  God is the only thing that should be worshiped.   The video of the Vatican declaring Lucifer as God is entirely misleading.  Firstly the Vatican is not declaring anything.  It mentioned Lucifer in the chant and then talked about Jesus and then said Jesus is God.

       Yes sir. But remember it’s not about you and I. It’s from keeping the snowball rolling down the hill. It’s done to present what looks like a consensus.  They don’t want new users thinking outside of the box. Best way to do that is ridicule users and downvote comments that push new users to keep digging. By all accounts this is a great thread by OP and it is being brigaded because it’s clear there is more than meets the eye when it comes to the Vatican. Once you recognize the patterns you can fight back. I know you recognize. The rules of the game are laid out, fight back and let your sincerity guide new users towards a more open mind to the manipulation present here on reddit and throughout our society.

       They read them. In the long run we need brigades like this. It’s what first tipped me to things when I first started using Reddit. All the snarky bullshit getting upvotes made me say “who the fuck likes being a total dick and who supports total dicks”. So I started paying attention and quickly figured out why they are being dicks and why they get so many upvotes. PG, FE, that Vatican, NASA, etc all topics that come with snarky ass bullshit responses from accounts I’ve either never seen or the exact same accounts I see in every thread. At some point it’s just too obvious. Let them do their thing, just swing back at them when you can with downvotes. Oh and support fellow users like JJW and bradok who are quite obviously legit. Be well!

       Then you were raised wrong.  They respect and pray to Mary to ask her intercession since, basically, she's constantly sitting at the feet of Jesus, and kind of has an "in", being his mother and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The quote you have, is not a worship OF Mary.  It's literally (in the literal sense) asking for her intercession.

       Lol go ask a Priest how they feel about her if you don't believe me. She is 100% worshipped by Catholics. She is the closest thing to Divine anything can reach, one step below Jesus/God/Holy Spirit. She is without original sin ffs.

       In latin it is Ave Maria. Ave is a Latin word, used by the Romans as a salutation and greeting, meaning "hail". It is the singular imperative form of the verb avēre, which meant "to be well"; thus one could translate it literally as "be well" or "farewell"

       You're not going to win this argument, and from a certain perspective, probably shouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right that official, canonical dogma of the Roman Catholic Church makes Mary a special saint, which is different from an angel, or from God.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're wrong, too, because in practice, especially among less-educated and non-western Roman Catholics, Mary is clearly worshipped.

       I appreciate your reply - I think you are very much correct in your thoughts.  I feel like, most definitely some people worship Mary because they have always done so - the family unit has, they wear rosaries as necklaces, tattoos, et al.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were never really brought up to speed on what the words and routines
       <em>
        mean
       </em>
       .  (Mostly because, very clearly, what things mean is indeed up to each person.  However, also I am thinking from the standpoint of canonical dogma.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't raised Catholic, I learned and joined as an adult.  I spent a little different amount of time looking at history, dogma, reasons for the whole stand/kneel/sit/stand/kneel/shake-hands/gossip/stand/kneel thing, etc.  I'm not "more learned" in the subject, by far, but I do think that my initial response to "Catholics worship Mary" is from a dogma standpoint with a little bit of "defense" in the line of "hey, we're not
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       like that..."

       There's a difference between worship and prayer. You can pray to Mary without it being worship. Our language isn't amazing at distinguishing between these things. You see someone kneeling, saying Mary's name, holding a rosary, and you figure "Well, that's stuff you do when you worship something." But that's a mistake, it's stuff you do when you pray, and prayer can involve anything from worship, to praise, to communing with, to asking for help, etc. If your point is that some people who weren't well-catechized may not understand the intellectual difference between asking for intercession and worship, that's certainly possible, but the Church doesn't teach this.

       Jesus Christ did not consider Mary his mother, nor his fleshly bothers his brethren:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 3:31  There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 3:32  And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 3:33  And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 3:34  And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ even had the Apostle John replace his human flesh as Mary's son since he is the risen savor and God almighty:
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh 19:25  Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh 19:26  When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh 19:27  Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are praying to Mary (or the  "Saints") you are praying to a devil.  Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and men.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Ti 2:5  For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

       Nope.  The Mary that gave birth to Jesus Christ was a sinner just like every other person who wasn't also God.  Jesus Christ is the only human who had fallen flesh but did not once sin in it.  That's why he's the spotless Lamb of God who shed his blood to wash our sins away forever.

       The whole point of the Catechism is to deceive people into a works based system of trying to attain salvation by one's own efforts.  This is sending people to the eternal lake of fire.  I would highly recommend simply reading the King James Bible for yourself.  It's clear that every single human that has ever existed save Jesus Christ has sinned and deserves the lake of fire.  That's why Jesus Christ became our Passover lamb and took our punishment for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom 5:12  Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 
Rom 5:13  (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 
Rom 5:14  Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. 
Rom 5:15  But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. 
Rom 5:16  And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. 
Rom 5:17  For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
      </p>
      <p>
       All you need to do is repent and believe the gospel which means Jesus Christ did all the work for you.  There is nothing your flesh can do to save you.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       Eph 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Eph 2:9  Not of works, lest any man should boast.

That half the time the Catholic Church didn't even stick with what they were doing and so you can't really be raised "correctly" or "incorrectly."

       Yes. I've actually had this conversation with older catholics as well - Mary is only a step down from Jesus in terms of divinity in many Catholics eyes. She is the above angels. Basically the highest any mortal/saint could rise to.

       They also killed people for trying to translate so the people could read it, like William Tindale.
And Martin Luther, they literally made a movie about this. He translated the Bible from Hebrew Greek. And mass murdered people who would not follow their new pegan additions.
Praying to a saint or bowing before any graven image is idolitry. When they first set in, they painted over idols of Isis and her son Tammuz with Mary and Jesus...they were literally praying to idols. Even today, you worship and pray to saints and Mary, which is forbidden..the bible says specifically not to do this. Also, a priest can not intercede on your behalf...only Christ. The incense and things you use in "ceremonies" was the exact way pagans did it. Many of the symbols the priests use or even in the Vatican or pegan or honor pegan Babylonian Gods. Repeating prayers (and agian to Mary) The Bible also teaches against.

       The Catholic Church has always had pegan roots, they literally persecuted and burned Christians at the stake. They are evil, at their roots.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Christians were persecuted not so much for their profession of faith in Christ, but because they would not include pagan deities in their faith as well. Then, with Constantine's emphasis on making his new-found Christianity palatable to the heathen in the Empire, the "Christianization" of these pagan deities was facilitated. For example, pagan rituals and idols gradually took on Christian meanings and names and were incorporated into "Christian" worship (e.g., "saints" replaced the cult of pagan gods in both worship and as patrons of cities; mother/son statues were renamed Mary and Jesus; etc.), pagan holidays were reclassified as Christian holy days (e.g., the Roman Lupercalia and the feast of purification of Isis became the Feast of the Nativity; the Saturnalia celebrations were replaced by Christmas celebrations; an ancient festival of the dead was replaced by All Souls Day, rededicated to Christian heroes [now Halloween]; etc.). A transition had occurred -- instead of being persecuted for failure to worship pagan deities, Christians who did not agree with the particular orthodoxy backed by the Emperor were now persecuted in the name of Christ."
"Early believers kept Saturday as the Sabbath until March 7, 321 CE when Pope Constantine passed a law requiring believers to worship on Sunday, the day the pagans worshipped the sun-god. Believers still kept Saturday as the Sabbath until another law was passed eleven years later. This law signed into decree by Pope Constantine forbid believers to worship on the Sabbath (Saturday) and it was punishable by death by the Catholic Church. Many believers were burned to death by the Catholic Church for keeping the Sabbath. "
From wikipeadia
"Those who refused were charged with impiety and punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture, and/or executions."
Some Pagan ceremonies were brought in and the festivals became modern holidays as pagans joined the early church.[1] The Pagan vernal equinoxcelebration was 'Christianized'[1] and then referred to as the Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary or Annunciation of the Lord and celebrated as the Feast of the Annunciation. The Germanic Pagan solstice celebrations (Midsummer festivals) are also sometimes referred to by Neopagans and others as Litha, stemming from Bede's De temporum rationeand the fire festival or Litha was a tradition for many pagans. This pagan holiday was basically brought in and given a name change, and in Christianity was then associated with the nativity of John the Baptist, which now is observed on the same day, June 24, in the Catholic, Orthodox and some Protestant churches. It is six months before Christmasbecause Luke 1:26 and Luke 1.36 imply that John the Baptist was born six months earlier than Jesus, although the Bible does not say at which time of the year this happened.

       pope:
'...Pope is a shortened title for Pontifex Maximus. In Greek it means father. The Pontifex Maximus (meaning king of sacrifices or servant to the triads, as well as the "greatest bridge-maker between the gods and men") was the high priest of the College of Pontiffs (Collegium Pontificum) in ancient Rome. It's a pagan title that was incorporated from the Etruscan-Latin polytheistic culture (700 BC) who lived before the Romans.
       <strong>
        The early Catholics said that the Pontifex Maximus was the "King of Heathendom," the evil high priest of the pagan mystery religion of Rome
       </strong>
       He was then urged by the Catholic bishops to renounce the cultic Roman title, and instead grant it to their exalted leading bishop over Rome. Pontifex Maximus is a name that's being used by the Roman Catholic Church clergy today. Though it may be abbreviated into Pope or Papa, yet it's clearly a title incorporated directly from paganism.
       <strong>
        Pope Gregory I (601 AD) said in so many words literally, "We must compromise with the pagans in order to further Christianity
       </strong>
       ."

       The Popes of Rome proclaim that they are the Vicar of Christ, which means “in place of Christ.”  The word antichrist doesn’t just mean “against Christ“, it means “in place of Christ.”
       <strong>
        Pope Boniface VIII said “We declare, assert, define and pronounce to be subject to the Roman Pontiff is to every creature altogether necessary for salvation… I have the authority of the King of Kings. I am all in all, and above all, so that God Himself and I, the Vicar of Christ, have but one consistory, and I am able to do almost all that God can do. What therefore, can you make of me but God?” Pope Pius IX said, “I alone… am the successor of the apostles, the vicar of Jesus Christ. I am the way, the truth, and the life…” Pope Pius X declared, “The Pope is not simply the representative of Jesus Christ
       </strong>
       . On the contrary, he is Jesus Christ Himself, under the veil of the flesh. Does the Pope speak? It is Jesus Christ who is speaking, hence, when anyone speaks of the Pope, it is not necessary to examine but to obey.” Pope Pius XII said, “…recognize the Holy, Catholic, Roman Church to be the only true Church of Jesus Christ, outside of which neither sanctity nor salvation can be found. Call them to the unity of the one fold, granting them the grace to believe every truth of our holy faith and to submit themselves to the Supreme Roman Pontiff, the Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth.” The power of the Roman Catholic Church reached a pinnacle in the 12th through 15th centuries, as they attained: independent sovereignty, absolute supremacy over the Christian Church, and full control of the princes of Europe. Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) said “We may according to the fullness of our power, dispose of the law and dispense above the law. Those whom the Pope of Rome doth separate, it is not a man that separates them but God. For the Pope holdeth place on earth, not simply of a man but of the true God.” (Source: “Decretals of Greogory IX,” Book 1, chapter 3.)

       That's an interesting read.  From what you have shown it looks like the Pope's claim to be God himself.   I'm by no means an apologist, I haven't been around the fiath for very long.  I read everything in the link you posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to accepting certain pagan tradtitions and practices into the Catholic Church I don't necessarily see a wrong there.  I've always kind of thought of it as taking the good and leaving the evil.  Culture and tradtitions are important so take what is goodor neutral and incorporate it.  By incorporating certain aspects of the pagan religion you can convert more people to Christianity.  If it's not bad, why lose souls over it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I encourage you to look at what some people say about the pope's lack of "divinity"  in this link.

       The explanation and rebuttal is probably better than I can make.   In essence, no the pope is not divine, but acts in the place of Christ (explained better in the link).  The Pope or any priest for that matter are not gods, but act through God.

       Except it is wrong if your coming at it from a Christian faith, as Catholics claim. The Bible forbids this stuff many times, so not only is praying to a graven image or idol wrong, it's one that was actually a pegan false God. And the popes have claimed more then to by a vessel but have literally said in the past in place of and that the have the same power, which they don't. Also God forbid the whole idea of "popes" they are not the father, he is and they can not stand in place of Christ that's blasphemy.

       What kind of stuff does the Bible forbid?  Catholics do not worship idols, statues, pictures or anything of that sort.   The Catholic Church does not claim that the Pope's are Gods.  If Popes claim to be Gods they wrong.  Pope's can obviously be wrong. They are people and don't always speak the truth.  Where does Jesus forbid the "whole idea of Popes?  It seems to me that the Bible affirms the idea of Pope's.

       For much of history there's been corruption in the church.  At some points it's been rampant and at other times not so bad.  Just like any instution with lots of power there will be corruption.  I think the poster has really gone out on a limb.

       Totally this! Sure, there's a lot of speculation and some loose connections, but take a step back from that and you can see that there does exist a general overarching occult/symbolic operation going on. And if you take the time to dig through it all you'll find there's a good few diamonds in the rough.

       TPTB aren't using symbols to fucking rob you, rape you, and murder. They're doing it openly. Look at the legislation they've passed. Look at our healthcare, schools, and military. They don't need to be cryptic. Se gave them everything by bickering over nonsense.

       Lmao, they're bringing the old kind of sexism back before it barely reached its grave. Next thing you know, they'll want to drill holes in your heads to let the demons out or put you on the ol' vibrator treatment for your "hysteria". Watch out ladies.

       . They have different origins and don't mean the same thing at all.
       <br/>
       Just based on a quick google search, the origin of "wood" as a term for an erection originates in the 1950s. This may not be true, but if it is, that's a full 60 years after Hollywood was named.
       <br/>
       By the way, here's the supposed origin of the name of Hollywood:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to the diary of H. J. Whitley, also known as the "Father of Hollywood", on his honeymoon in 1886 he stood at the top of the hill looking out over the valley. Along came a Chinese man in a wagon carrying wood. The man got out of the wagon and bowed. The Chinese man was asked what he was doing and replied, "I holly-wood," meaning 'hauling wood.' H. J. Whitley had an epiphany and decided to name his new town Hollywood. "Holly" would represent England and "wood" would represent his Scottish heritage. Whitley had already started over 100 towns across the western United States.

       It's undeniable that Warner / Manson - whose father served in the Air Commando Squadron in Vietnam and (he claims) was

       It's interesting you mention Neil Young.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marilyn Manson recorded "Holy Wood" in Laurel Canyon, a hotbed of witchcraft and satanism. Neil Young was one of the (many) musicians who mysteriously gravitated there in the early sixties.
       <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=yrd20PZoLFYC&amp;amp;lpg=PT218&amp;amp;ots=dQXXEYMQT6&amp;amp;dq=%22going%20like%20lemmings%22%20%22laurel%20canyon%22&amp;amp;pg=PT218#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22going%20like%20lemmings%22%20%22laurel%20canyon%22&amp;amp;f=false">
        Young himself said
       </a>
       : "When I went, I didn't have any intention of anything. I didn't know what the fuck I was doin'. We were just going - like lemmings."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some glowing compliments Young made about another musician moving in the circles of Laurel Canyon during that period:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         "He was great, he was unreal – really, really good."
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         "He had this kind of music that nobody else was doing. I thought he really had something crazy, something great. He was like a living poet."
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know who he was talking about?

       I'm not going through all those links. Do I think there is fuckery involved with the Vatican? Of course. I just saw that line and saw it as absurd from the beginning because I knew that "wood" as a word for erection was probably a more recent thing.

       I don't remember exactly, but I've read that Holly is a certain tree which has occult magik significance, thus holly wood is the wood of this tree used to conjure spells, in practice these spells are mind control or trend setting tactics used in all mediums that comes from this capital city of jewish run entertainment.

       But it wasn't a city known for Jews until much later, after it was founded. It wasn't until after the 1920s that Hollywood's population picked up and that it became a film center that it was known for Jews.

       It's obvious it's knowledge that is hidden. That's what occult means. It's very significant for those in the know and it's successful use either for good or for bad is not compatible with the slightest ignorance. The elites give a fuck about it and don't want everyone knowing it all.

      <p>
       You seem jumpy, why? I didn't actually state anything pejorative, and didn't break any code, just something I've read from someone else which connects the very purpose of many entertainment media that comes from Hollywood with a theory of its etymology (which makes far more sense than some guy just having a random epiphany), showing the fairy tale in practice.. If it's wrong then show it instead of downvoting which doesn't really count as disproving.

       Jordan Maxwell had an interesting theory on the origin. Druids were basically the elite of ancient Celtic culture &amp; were the overseers of society. And they would use a wand to conduct things, much like a conductor's baton. Not so much as hocus pocus but it was more a symbol or tool of their status as Druids. Anyway, they would make it out of wood from a holly tree... Holly - wood! After moving pictures started evolving Hollywood was organized as a tool to train people &amp; their emotions. Much of how we act on our emotions is learned behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't personally believe in much of this. I just think it's damned interesting. It's certainly better than angel cocks.

       Jordan Maxwell didn't say this. I added that in out of assumption. I never knew that!
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't see a problem in affecting the theory. If Hollywood existed before film then maybe they decided that would be their wand. Maybe Maxwell expands on it. I'm just familiar with the basic concept.

       Names go down different routes and can end up at places just like words. Both can be traced.

       Speaking frankly a person probably isn't saying or posting anything of real value if they receive 100% upvotes, but this is a little ridiculous.

       Are you advocating the idea that "the Jews" are the ones who are

       I don't think there's anything I can say that will convince you that you're wrong, but I would be making a mistake by not trying. Jewish people are, first and foremost, people, with all of the individuality and diversity that that entails. The idea that Jewish people work together as a nefarious collective mass, pulling the strings that make the world twitch, is nothing but a modern take on ancient antisemitism. You may have seen Jewish people engaging in nepotism, but I've seen people of all religions and ethnicities doing the same -- this isn't some trait that's unique to, or especially present among, Jewish people. The Jewish people have been scapegoated for thousands of years. Individuals should be held accountable for their own actions, but to be prejudiced against an entire group of people is wrong.

       That was done with the horror movie The Witch. A lot of horror/film nerds insist on typing it out this way but official print is always a W. It's only 2 Vs for the poster. It's a stylized thing. The director said as much. But they take it as an integral part of how deep the movie is.

       He's not worshiping her.  It's just a common misconception.  It seems really popular with Protestants who try to delegitimize the church.  It's fine and good to question and defend a position, but at least know what the opposing side believes.

        What about this one ?

      <p>
       hundreds of pics of celebrities all showing the same gesture with the hand : the index and the thumb forming a round over the eye, and together with the 3 other fingers, forming the number 666. It would be a couple of them, it could be assimilated to some silly pose for the photo. It's like, all of them celebrities doing this : actors, singers, Americans, Europeans, Asians. There is a good chance your idol is in the list in this video. Even that Korean dude, gangnam style, does this. WTH!
      </p>
      <p>
       What the hell does this mean ? It cannot be coincidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNSdCDYhUM8">
        And what about this one?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of celebrities, sometimes the same who do the 666 gesture, do the following gesture : cover one eye with the hand open, fingers altogether, hand straight up. The video in the link shows a few celebrities doing this. However, I have seeing some pictures compilations with lots more celebrities doing the same gesture with the hand covering one eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, again, it cannot be coincidental. It has to have a meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do they know, what have they seen that we have not ? And is that symbol related to the previous one with the 666 ? If I do this at home now, can I be a multi-millionaire superstar tomorrow too ?

       Or perhaps just a small number of occultist photographers requesting that pose from every celebrity they shoot. The celebs might have no idea what it means.

       While the Roman State most definitely manipulated later Christianity beginning in the 4th century, I don't think the ERE had much of a connection to the Quran.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons the muslims kicked ass were multifold- The Romans had just finished an exhaustive, 26 year war with the Sassanids- the centuries old blood enemy of the Romans. For more than 2 decades many of the provinces from Antioch to Egypt had slipped Imperial control, and had been retaken for less than a decade when Muhammad burst out of the Arabian wastes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war had devastated both Empires- but the Sassanids were ruined. Finally, for the first time since the mess began, when Crassus and several legions were utterly destroyed by the Parthians, 600 years later the Romans had ended the feud- but at great cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the Roman communities that were conquered by the Muslims welcomed their new overlords- because of a massive Church schism that had been occurring over Iconoclasm- which saw the capital, Constantinople, adhering to different beliefs concerning Images and pictures, due to the influence of the Imperial Family, than other parts of the Empire- like Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch. The muslims let the Christians remain if they paid the tax most of us are familiar with- and to many, this was preferable than living under an Emperor who pretended to be Christian, in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long in the short of it- if the Romans helped create the Quran, they fucked up
       <em>
        big time
       </em>
       .

       Why would this comment get downvoted? Mods can we do something about this brigade? We know which accounts are brigading. Let’s take this sub back from accounts that are used to obfuscate and kill discussion. Anyway, good come to brother. Make notes of these accounts and downvote the fuck out of them

       I'm not brigading from anywhere (where the hell would I brigade from? The XCOM subreddit? Gotta watch out for those strategy gamers). I'm downvoting because I'm rolling my eyes at the sheer ridiculousness of this post, and the people eagerly nodding their heads at it.

       The bible specifically refutes what you say. In revelations 3 it says that those who call themselves jews yet are liers, are the synogogue of satan. So no.

       I don't think it should be taken literally as some kind of alien reptilian species who can read through your mind coming to Earth. What I think she refers to is the NWO. The NWO is about clearing all boundaries : social, physical, mental, etc... boundaries. No more nations, no more gender distinctions, no more rich vs poors, no more religions, no more traditions, no more blacks vs whites vs asians etc... that's their ultimate plan, and they have been working on it for over 2000 years. They believe when that day comes, universal peace will come, and their messiah will come.

       So the NWO just wants to get rid of labels? Wow, and here I thought the conspiracies around a NWO included massive genocide against poor people or something. Maybe they aren't all that bad after all.

       You just downvote &amp; move on, my friend. Whenever I get caught up in an argument, start typing too much, researching my points just to be sure, spending too much time... I stop &amp; think how much it will matter later on. How much I personally even care &amp; how much this argument directly matters to my life. And it doesn't. So I'll express argument with a downvote or just 'hide' a post if it bugs me for any reason outside of ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And BTW, did you know you can set reddit to hide things that you downvote? This is a supremely helpful thing for me in just digesting content. Click &amp; forget, don't waste the thought energy.

       That's disturbing. This is the kind of post that gets put here to discredit the subreddit. It's nothing but a massive list of random things with no direction or coherent points. There are absolutely idiotic connections and conjectures mixed in with legitimate truth just to take the gish gallop to the next level. The post is bordering on spam. It is perhaps the lowest of the low for this community. And this is what you come here for? I'm not sure I can even take you seriously. I've been here for 10 years and I've never seen the community embrace this level of schizophrenic meth-fueled insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying everything in there is crazy. But I am saying that some of the stuff in there is definitely crazy. The person who put the list together doesn't even know exactly what point they were trying to make.

       But this isn't even a good example of the off-the-wall stuff. This is totally incoherent and disjointed. It's more like an "artist's recreation" of a stereotypical conspiracy theorist "lunatic". Really smells like part of the well-known CIA psyop to dissuade average people from looking into conspiracy theories.

       Holy fuck this thread is brigaded hard. Look at the upvotes for bullshit comments. In the last hour non of this is organic. Authentic users of this sub, ask yourself why a great post like this is met with a brigade. There are things we are not allowed to talk about, this is one of them.

       I am, and have been for a while, an "authentic user of this sub", as you so put it.  I hate to break it to you but your use of terms like "bullshit comments" imply you have some bias.

       The links? I’m fairly familiar with the Vatican’s fuckery. My interest was peaked long ago when I learned what they named their telescope. Then I learned what that name really means. From there the whole Vatican nonsense unraveled pretty quickly for me. It’s a criminal organization , nothing more.

       For the most part these are propaganda spread by judeo-christian because they want to destroy catholisism. The pegans rites of europe has been merge with the christian beliefs in order to survive. When the christian began to understood that paganisme has been incorporated in the catholic iconography so they split.
      </p>
      <p>
       One church (protestant) has no symbolism and only follow the word of christ, the other (catholic) has all these saints, mystical representation and imagery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "words of christ" are a misinterpretation of ancient pagan lore.
      </p>
      <p>
       In America there was aholy war between the two groups. During the 19 century the anglo in Canada also caused a genocide because they do not want to live among the "heretic catholic".
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, if you fear those symbols, you are indeed being played. Having said that, the world is not what most people think. We live in an illusion created by usurpators most likely a kabal of psychopaths has you said.

       W never was a letter itself. It's literally two V's. It's well known. It has masonic significance, Freeman Fly talked about it. V has satanic significance as well.

       Authentic users, a good idea would be to save this post and re post it periodically. I save all post that are heavily brigaded like this so that I can refer back to accounts and  tactics used. Helps work through the gate keeping and helps with pattern recognition. I started doing this with PG threads and again with NASA threads. Save this post!!!

       All organized religion exists to manipulate people into serving the king. The king of the world has control of all the money, energy and media. He, she or they have convinced humanity that we are servants to higher powers. Nature or the universe as it exists is the only power we answer to and we have no alternative but to cooperate or perish. Our king who we cannot even name with certainty is concerned with maintaining control and power regardless of poverty death and suffering. The only answer is to observe nature and cooperate with it and each other. All other truths are of less priority.

       <em>
        Supernaturalism
       </em>
       is only a matter of definition. What might seem supernatural is really only phenomenon unknown to the observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our five senses limit our observation. A rational mind would see throwing away "supernaturalism" as meaningless if we have yet to understand the true scope of our "natural" world.

       Ah, you're being disingenuous. You know full well that I mean the cosmogonic schemes that involve magic sky fairies and omnipotent beings who are all powerful yet do nothing. These same
       <em>
        supernatural
       </em>
       entities also have a habit of changing their stance in line with the fluctuating moods and themes of human political and social development. In a lot of ways it's as if the 'godhead' is nothing other than a useful tool to concentrate power over people into the hands of a select few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course we don't know all there is to know, but evidence that we have a wide variety of deities, who all claim to be the one true deity, is curiously (although not unsurprisingly) lacking. All we have are ancient books
       <em>
        written by people
       </em>
       who claim they are the word of "god". There is no difference between the major religions and the belief in say ghosts. It's all bunkum.

       I do want to raise the point that many of these symbols and observances are very important natural phenomenon. For example, the VW symbol is the

        "Fingerprint of God"

       , which describes the pulse or rhythm of the universe. Same could be said for astrology, the swastika, equinoxes, etc. We can't let them steal this knowledge from us by smearing it with evil.

       Accounts, not likely authentic users. At some point you have to realize what Reddit is used for. Remember when spez got caught editing comments? This place is for the hivemind, it’s essentially nothing more than a propaganda tool for big brother. Be weary of the fucked up vote counts for some of the top comments in this thread. If you are new, start recognizing the patterns now. Goodluck brother, OP should not be getting roasted, it’s not an authentic reaction to a well sourced post. Be well

       The similarity between human skin and reptile scales is not superficial, correct. They likely adapted from a common ancestor which originally bore a proto-placode of some kind. Feathered creatures also have placodes. Skin, feathers, and scales. Many images of the skin of other mammals also look similar to reptile scales. Other images of human skin look nothing like reptile scales. Look at bird feathers under a microscope, they look like little twigs. Birds aren't plants, though. It's kind of a silly comparison, and it certainly isn't evidence of anything.

       While the Roman State most definitely manipulated later Christianity beginning in the 4th century, I don't think the ERE had much of a connection to the Quran.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons the muslims kicked ass were multifold- The Romans had just finished an exhaustive, 26 year war with the Sassanids- the centuries old blood enemy of the Romans. For more than 2 decades many of the provinces from Antioch to Egypt had slipped Imperial control, and had been retaken for less than a decade when Muhammad burst out of the Arabian wastes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war had devastated both Empires- but the Sassanids were ruined. Finally, for the first time since the mess began, when Crassus and several legions were utterly destroyed by the Parthians, 600 years later the Romans had ended the feud- but at great cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the Roman communities that were conquered by the Muslims welcomed their new overlords- because of a massive Church schism that had been occurring over Iconoclasm- which saw the capital, Constantinople, adhering to different beliefs concerning Images and pictures, due to the influence of the Imperial Family, than other parts of the Empire- like Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch. The muslims let the Christians remain if they paid the tax most of us are familiar with- and to many, this was preferable than living under an Emperor who pretended to be Christian, in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long in the short of it- if the Romans helped create the Quran, they fucked up

       The links? I’m fairly familiar with the Vatican’s fuckery. My interest was peaked long ago when I learned what they named their telescope. Then I learned what that name really means. From there the whole Vatican nonsense unraveled pretty quickly for me. It’s a criminal organization , nothing more.

       That's actually sad. To downvote me because you didn't like my questions. Isn't that just really childish? You're supposed to downvote things that don't add to the discussion, it's not a passive aggresive "I don't like you" button.

       What kind of stuff does the Bible forbid?  Catholics do not worship idols, statues, pictures or anything of that sort.   The Catholic Church does not claim that the Pope's are Gods.  If Popes claim to be Gods they wrong.  Pope's can obviously be wrong. They are people and don't always speak the truth.  Where does Jesus forbid the "whole idea of Popes?  It seems to me that the Bible affirms the idea of Pope's.
