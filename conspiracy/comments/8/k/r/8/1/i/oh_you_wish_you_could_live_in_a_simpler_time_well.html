<p>You need to make it clear in your original post that you don&#39;t want discussion, just agreement. If I had known this thread was for total agreement only I would not have posted.</p>

<p>Hey you know what might work really well? Post your &quot;agreement only&quot; thread. Then instead of re-stating what everyone agrees with people can simply reply with &quot;Ditto&quot;. </p>

<p>You are delusional. You are imagining things I supposedly think and  then getting all worked up over them. That&#39;s not my fault. And it&#39;s not trolling to have a different opinion and express it. Again if you only want opinions that agree with you say so.</p>

<p>And if you think medicine and dentistry worked better in some &quot;simpler time&quot;, simply adopt those methods to solve your issues. Certainly they are low tech and low cost, and thus easy to implement. The lack of anesthesia alone should save a bundle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my god you are so fucking cliche.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a case of multiple people telling me I have a tail.  This is a case of going to see a dentist, and ending up with a swollen face and a great deal of pain and then realizing that no other doctor or dentist would even admit my face was swollen when it was OBVIOUSLY swollen.</p>

<p>But yeah that&#39;s my problem because that is the easy way out isn&#39;t it.  Too scary to think that all that needs to happen is one of those medical professionals, who you think is looking out for you, fucks up and suddenly the whole field treats you like an enemy.

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a debate.  You just wanna do some tit for tat shit all the while you know you are wrong.  You know this society is fucked, you know the medical industry is fucked, you know America and probably the rest of the world is headed for the shits and will probably destroy itself... and yet you sit here arguing as if I&#39;m a jackass to suggest that the entire medical industry will turn on you if they see you as a liability.</p>

<p>You are now trying to change the argument which started off with you basically calling me a liar and implying that because you have never had this experience, I must be wrong.  But now you are trying to morph the argument into something else because you know damn fuck well the medical industry is corrupt and slimy as fuck and their is absolutely a &quot;brothers in arms&quot; mentality when it comes to that profession because of the amount of lawsuits they incur.  Many of the lawsuits <em>are</em> frivolous... but that means when someone <em>actually</em> has a real issue they get treated like a scam artist.  The massive amount of lawsuits against the medical industry are another a symptom of our sick society and it&#39;s a bit of a chicken and egg conundrum.</p>

<p>You need to make it clear in your original post that you don&#39;t want discussion, just agreement. If I had known this thread was for total agreement only I would not have posted.</p>

<p>Hey you know what might work really well? Post your &quot;agreement only&quot; thread. Then instead of re-stating what everyone agrees with people can simply reply with &quot;Ditto&quot;. </p>
