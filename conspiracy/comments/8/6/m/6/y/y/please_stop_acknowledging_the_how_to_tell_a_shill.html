        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes, there are shills on reddit. But there&#39;s no &#39;set&#39; way on how to handle them. The best thing to do is maintain civil discussion, do not mention users in threads, and do not assume people are bots and shills simply because of the &#39;supposed&#39; rule book on how to spot them.</p>

<p>In reality, shills are people and they will adjust their strategies accordingly. Making a &#39;set&#39; way to identify them just makes it easier for them to outsmart you into thinking they&#39;re real users.</p>

<p>Bots are easy to spot because certain keywords allow you to see brigading patterns and automated responses. That being said, we shouldn&#39;t label or assume users are that because it goes against the very thing that is this subreddit.</p>

<p>People are waking up. People are becoming aware of the truth. Keep presenting good, valid arguments, with evidence to sway lurkers to the truth.</p>

<p>That is the most important thing. And please...please</p>

<p>Be open to a variety of facts and opinions. We really don&#39;t know everything and it&#39;s important to realize that. That&#39;s what is at the heart of conspiracy, the desire to know more than what is presented.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a dangerous path to take because we can never really know who is a shill and who isn&#39;t. What if someone new enters this subreddit and gets treated like that? We should be able to discern information on our own and identify patterns on our own and act accordingly. The whole point of conspiracy is to further YOUR perspective not force someone to act and behave according to your perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think I&#39;ve not been dealing with shills? I improved my own ability to discern information and while I&#39;m not an &#39;expert&#39; I can certainly handle my shit when a suspected shill comes at me with bullshit. You can inform people of the existence of shills and that there is evidence of shill behavior being legalized, but imo, it&#39;s not a good idea to project an image of what a shill is because there are some covert shills that are long-time posters that we would never guess are shills.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how sophisticated some of their tactics are. The best way to protect against this is to produce a better argument than them. Because in the real world, no one gives a shit if someone is paid to promote a perspective. All they care about is how good you are at presenting your side of the argument/debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright well I think of it like the real world. There are people at the bottom level paid to just promote an agenda. They&#39;ll make statements in support or opposition to an issue. Usually they only talk about that and aren&#39;t really all that active unless it&#39;s pertaining to that issue.</p>

<p>Then there are shills that are employed to get deep into a subreddit. These people spend months, even years gaining enough trust to infiltrate the subreddit as a &#39;regular&#39;. They can persuade people based on bonding with them.</p>

<p>Then there are mod shills. </p>

<p>BUT the problem is, it&#39;s almost impossible to truly be certain someone is a shill enough to confidently state that person is a shill. It&#39;s like slandering a celebrity. You need to have proof or else you can get in trouble.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what some people don&#39;t understand. This kind of behavior is dangerous and in a way, can be a manipulation brought on by shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. One thing this sub tried was submission statements. I think a big problem here is users getting dozens of upvotes for skeptical comments though. We should maybe have flair that indicates which conspiracies each person believes in so if people are getting highly upvoted but don&#39;t self-report as believing in any conspiracies, that would be a red flag. I know it&#39;s not a perfect system but it could be a step in the right direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, with the latest bill and the crackdown on reddit, people are looking for any excuse to get rid of conspiracy related areas of discussion. If we allow people to single out users, to promote a &#39;bullying&#39; kind of atmosphere based on assumptions from incomplete information, the whole subreddit will be gone.</p>

<p>This subreddit is first and foremost a place for discussion not for witch hunts. When we begin to change just to &#39;somewhat&#39; rid the subreddit of shills, we&#39;re actually bringing about the end of the subreddit and missing out on great opportunities to convince people of the truth the right way, through facts, persuasion, and keen ability to present logical arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve learned from experience is that people fall for shilling tactics easily (after all they&#39;re designed that way). I myself fell for them a few times <em>while knowing them</em>. That being said, every single shilling tactic i read on &quot;handbooks&quot; (i just recently started looking them up) i had already learned them from experience. I can&#39;t speak for everybody, but in my case, your statement about learning from experience being better than a handbook is accurate. </p>

<p>What i didn&#39;t consider is your point about a [shill]hunting atmosphere. It&#39;s unproductive and <em>especially</em> scary if you consider it may become an actual shilling tactic in the near future, in the sense that they use shilling accusations for censorship purposes. On second thought, after reading your post, i must admit you convinced me that shill-spotting guides and their related threads/posts are borderline dangerous for this subreddit. </p>

<p>What i didn&#39;t consider is your point about a [shill]hunting atmosphere. It&#39;s unproductive and especially scary if you consider it may become an actual shilling tactic in the near future</p>

<p>Exactly. Thanks for understanding. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad I could persuade you to look at it from a different perspective. It&#39;s cool if people want to discuss ways to spot shills, but when it&#39;s displayed in a public forum, that&#39;s when it produces problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those shill lists are completely useless considering arguing tactics can be applied to anybody. Lots of people use whataboutism to defend their side. Lots of people leave snarky comments that are meant to make the other guy feel dumb. This is reddit and that&#39;s what people do on Reddit.</p>

<p>I try to present an argument as to why agree or disagree with something. But I still made that super secret conclave list of persona non grata. And I&#39;m guessing that most of it really boils down to Trump Russia stuff. Certain people get mad at people for disagreeing with some conspiracies and trying to &quot;debunk&quot; them in the comments. Yet every post about a Trump-Russia connection has a bunch of comments trying to debunk it. These folks posting the shill tactics guides never get mad at those people. And that&#39;s simply because they agree with those people. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, there&#39;s absolutely no point in complaining about shills. You might as well just present a good argument that&#39;s better than the one being presented to you. This is an anonymous internet forum so there&#39;s no point in accusing people of something you cant prove anyway. </p>

<p>How right you are.. Look at when that account you&#39;re responding to started posting and when this account, <a href="/u/PepperoniSizedNips">/u/PepperoniSizedNips</a>, was banned from this sub and stopped posting.</p>

<p>Notice the similarities in vote patterns, words, sentence structures and posting to a Pokemon sub. You can do the same comparison of those two accounts to these other accounts that were banned from here: </p>

<p><a href="/u/LongSaggyBalls">/u/LongSaggyBalls</a> 
<a href="/u/Guess_Who_Bitch">/u/Guess_Who_Bitch</a>
<a href="/u/Guess_Who_Bitch">/u/Guess_Who_Bitch</a>
<a href="/u/HereWeGoAgainDude">/u/HereWeGoAgainDude</a>
<a href="/u/ForRealThisTimePlaya">/u/ForRealThisTimePlaya</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not so sure all those downvotes are from shills. I’d bet a lot of the influx of users pushing the msm narrative are r/politics users. They came here to discuss the trump Russia conspiracy just like when TD came here in droves to discuss the dnc email leaks.</p>

<p>Just my two cents, I personally believe shills exist but I doubt it’s hundreds of shills</p>

<p>Not when it becomes a source of disinformation. Yes we should discuss the existence of shills, but we can&#39;t label what is shill behavior as they are human and inevitably will adapt. We should discuss everything concerning deep state and the propaganda effects of the constant persuasion war, but in an informative tone, not accusatory one.</p>

<p>I saw people posting threads with mentions of users in them. That&#39;s accusatory. How is that informational?

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, you and I aren&#39;t capable of <em>doing something</em> about it, because we cannot issue bans, and we really don&#39;t have the tools to determine if whatever user we suspect of being SMPR is in fact SMPR.

<p>Your point about them being human is unprovable; they may very well be AI. Although i think these PR organizations are still employing actual people, and that is what makes the strategy of noting behaviors effective. They have to be trained. They have procedures. People have to meet, documents must be typed, new strategies must be approved by committee in order for these behaviors and procedures to be adapted. </p>

<p>As an example, your post.  It is not your job to kettle discussion in this sub, which has seen more shills since the election than any other time in the past 10 yrs.  As such, it is only natural that real users seek to mitigate the effects of those who wish only to disrupt, deny and dissuade.  Personally I appreciate those how to spot a shill posts, not for me...because I have a phd in it, but for those who do not...or may not even be aware of the breadth of the problem.  Those uninterested in that topic are free to bypass it...and if that&#39;s you, I would encourage you to follow suit....but suggesting others shouldn&#39;t do what they feel is right...in the face of the plethora of shills which infest this sub, is not something I am going to agree with....but notice, I did not suggest you stop doing it.</p>

<p>Okay that statement and everything else you said is loaded with a lot of assumptions. First you assume people are stupid and can&#39;t tell in this subreddit what a shill is and how to spot them. Second you assume you&#39;re an expert on it. Third, you assume what feels right is essentially a potential &#39;witch hunt&#39;.</p>

<p>What you are doing is no different than what you THINK I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m not breaking any rules (to my knowledge, I could be wrong) by posting this thread. However, threads highlighting &#39;shill&#39; behavior by posting usernames and such is rule breaking. </p>

<p>I care about this subreddit. I care about its users. This kind of thinking leads to people accusing people left and right without much to go off of. Someone can dislike an opinion and claim: &#39;Shill&quot; and that automatically can discredit a user.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not appropriate in my opinion and truly distracts from thoughtful discussion.</p>

<p>I made this post because these shill guides, if you have not noticed, are giving people the idea, that it&#39;s okay to call people out for being shills because a suspected shill appears to match the behavior seen in the guide. That could lead imo, to the downfall of this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the guide posted here in the subreddit side bar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technique #6 - &#39;GAINING FULL CONTROL&#39;</p>

<p>It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the &#39;ultimate victory&#39; as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a &#39;honey pot&#39; gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.</p>

<p>Not when it becomes a source of disinformation. Yes we should discuss the existence of shills, but we can&#39;t label what is shill behavior as they are human and inevitably will adapt. We should discuss everything concerning deep state and the propaganda effects of the constant persuasion war, but in an informative tone, not accusatory one.</p>

<p>I saw people posting threads with mentions of users in them. That&#39;s accusatory. How is that informational?

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I have a differing approach and bam I&#39;m using shill tactics! It&#39;s so funny to me. Now I understand why TMOR discuss some of the posts here. Tbh, I would have made a good contributor there, but I don&#39;t condone harassing and bullying people. Had they not relentlessly pursued people they would have made a great discourse subreddit. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I see users on conspiracy adopting &#39;hive minds&#39; and becoming the very thing they hate. I hope my post at least reminds people that we all should think for ourselves even if it was said in a commanding tone. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an intj. I just don&#39;t know how else to speak. Probably why I anger people more than other types I guess. I myself am trying very hard to not generalize and use blanket statements. It&#39;s very hard as this is part of my core personality.</p>
