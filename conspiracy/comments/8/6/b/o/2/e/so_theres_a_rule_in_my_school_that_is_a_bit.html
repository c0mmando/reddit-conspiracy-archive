       In the event of a lock down, no students are allowed to use cell phones for any reason. So, in the event of a school shooting, you're not allowed to call the police, you're not allowed to call your parents, and possibly most important, you're not allowed to
       <em>
        record
       </em>
       anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about you, but I would definitely want to record a school shooter in the event that it actually happened. Why would they not allow this?

       ..... Well it is. Where else in the world are schools teaching kids what to do in the event of a mass shooting? I grew up in New Zealand and live in Australia and not a single kid here is taught about "what to do" if someone shoots up the school... Because it doesn't happen.

       It's so obviously America. Why so defensive?

       That's the sole reason stereotypes exist. They came from somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's the stereotype that black people steal stuff because, statistically,
       <em>
        they're more likely to steal stuff
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Asians are stereotypically really smart because in China,
       <em>
        they significantly value their education system
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you picking up what I'm putting down? Ya catch my drift?
      </p>
      <p>
       The American stereotype is that there are a lot of school shootings because, statistically, we've had a lot of school shootings. (Though I have my own suspicions)

       Maybe it's for when cops do arrive they don't mistake you for having a gun. But then again when clearing the room they ask people to drop their phones etc regardless.

       No, we're students, and minors, so we don't have rights. We don't have the right to ask about anything, and the teachers have the power to
       <em>

       I'd imagine its so kids don't go around trying to actively film a shooter, making themselves a target. My friend is a teacher; any rules they have are for the benefit of the students so they don't make themselves even more of a target they are. It's not some conspiracy to say you have no rights, it's to prevent idiots from getting their asses shot trying to 'gram.

       If you have instagram, that has a live feature that automatically saves your live video to your story as well (I think). The thing about live streaming anywhere is, it's already out there. it can be deleted off your phone.

       yeah, sure, let me just check my social media real fast in between clips. Actually, you know what, let's see what hashtags are trending on Twitter right now, maybe one of them has a video stream from inside the school, and I can use it to locate more victims that I could've shot already if I wasn't standing here fucking around on Twitter in between clips. Makes sense to me

       So stream to aclu or whatever your own private stream is.  It's not like a shooter is going to know that.  Even if you streamed to a youtube live, would a shooter really be scanning for all possible live youtube streams, just to find the one that possibly has info that he needs?  It's really so much of a stretch, I wouldn't worry about it compared to the desire to live stream.

       Are you serious? You really think the "shooter" is going to be scouring Instagram or facebook and even the news for locations to shoot? Damn. The "shooter" is going to shoot what ever shooter sees in front of him. No time to roam the internet looking for targets that are all around him.

       I know you’re playing to the other side of the sword to get people to see why this rule even exists in the first place but do you really think a shooter is going to be going through all the trouble of what you just mentioned?

       It’s basically just unrealistic.

       But then again, at this parkland shooting cops weren’t allowed to go inside the damn place anyways so you could say a shooter has the time to do whatever

       Just FYI but the teachers probably know about as much as you do in regards to the motivations for such a policy. While there are exceptions, few if any teachers are involved in the planning of such policies. They're simply the enforcers.

       Chances are a school shooting would never happen at your school, but if it did, fuck the rules man, call the cops and record it. Schools have these stupid ass zero tolerance policies and are acting like fascist-esque rules and control mongers.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a free and sovereign human being with rights and freedoms that transcend the dumb fucks who make the rules at a school. Don't listen to them. When I was in high school, I used to break so many rules. Someone who isn't me even put some weed in the assistant principal's gas tank lid on the day they brought drug sniffing dogs to checks the school and parking lot, flooded the bathrooms, broke shit all the time on purpose, and this group of guys used to literally sabotage everything and everyone with glue, face, motor oil, all types of shenanigans

       I remember at my high school a few years back, they started taking your phone if you were caught on it and would require you to pay a $15 fee to get it back. You'd think something like that would be against the law, but no. I simply refused to give mine up and was sentenced 2 weeks in school suspension. I dropped out after that.

       What about parents? Ask your dad/mom to call the school and ask them what's up. Also, all parents of kids in that school should call and ask the same question: WTF?

       If the school will treat him as a person with no rights during an emergency situation and make him unable to contact anyone then that school is sketchy as hell. I also highly doubt OP would drop out because a random Reddit user told them to.

       P.S. The Supreme Court decided in 1969 that students don't shed their rights at the schoolhouse door. That was the last year that Democratic appointees were in the majority at the Supreme Court. Since then, the Republican appointed majority of the Court has not been so kind.

       if they allowed students to call/text, everyone would be calling at once
and overload the cell tower, making it harder for police and school officials to get cell service in the area.

       Well then I've been unlawfully punished, and my constitutional rights have been directly violated. I drew a swastika and wrote 'Heil Hitler' on a paper (I get it, it was stupid) as a joke, but I should not have been suspended because of the first amendment. I have the freedom of speech, and there are no 'hate speech' laws in place because hate speech doesn't legally exist.

       Probably no one questions it because it's not a hill worth metaphorically dying on. You and everyone else are at school to get an education, not provide school shooting footage in the event it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it makes sense to drill a hard and fast rule into kids heads regarding not using a cell phone during a shooting. The police know what's going on, most likely. Your parents, while worried, would rather you stay quiet and keep your head down than talk to them. You shouldn't be posting live updates to Twitter as it attracts attention from media (who might call you if they get hold of your number). An attempt to film the shooter requires you be near the shooter. And finally, police don't want to see you with small black objects in your hands when they're securing a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's very few reasons to have to use your phone other than a desire to catch the MSM up in a lie, and you should probably just think about your personal safety and that of those around you first.

       Think about it. How are they going to enforce such a rule? And if they do manage to locate the person who recorded something during a shooting, do you think they would dare expel that person while the media scrutiny of the whole world is on them? Fuck them, don't give another thought to that stupid rule.

       I imagine its so that you are silent and a) can hear instructions given by a rescue worker, and b) aren't heard by the shooter.

       It would get pretty loud with a bunch of kids in a room calling their parents hysterical, or their ringers going off when their parents call them after news breaks.  It would draw attention to that location.

       If someone is systematically going through the school hunting their peers then your best bet is to silently get out or hide.

       You might think you don't have rights, but they also have no way of realistically punishing you as a minor, so you're sort of legally invincible in this situation. Schools and public officials will endlessly try to convince you that as a minor, you have no rights, when the reality is that you have far more rights than every other adult around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cartels and gangs actually exploit this by getting people under 18 years old to do really, really morally objectionable things with very little consequence. I'm certainly not advising illegal action, but you have A LOT more legal leniency than just about everyone else.

       Lol wait till you go to college. All your professors are going to tell you to question everything. Then you graduate, get a job, go to work, go home and sleep, go to work, go home and sleep, go to work, go home and sleep, go to work, go home and sleep, go to work, go home and sleep, then you get two days to yourself before repeating it again. Also you get 10 to 20 extra days off each year that you get to choose yourself, but you sort of have to beg to have them off.

       Yeah, the reasoning is when they make a drill go live and turn it into a hoax you don't have a bunch of the students that aren't part of the hoax posting their cell phone videos showing how ridiculous it all is.

       Phone goes off with an active shooter outside the classroom. Shooter hears it and knows there are people barricading inside. It could easily blow everyone's cover. That's my best guess.

       So it would probably be best for everyone to silence their phones if they know there is an active shooter. How shitty would it be to get killed because you got a text while hiding?

       I suspect that they want you to keep quiet and lay low to avoid attracting any attention to yourself and being targeted if there's a shooter nearby. What you might do or say when you're panic stricken in a situation like that could give you away and easily get you killed in. Does that make any sense to you?

       The reason is that when the rounds are going off in the hallway outside your classroom door, two things are going to play out. A massive adrenaline dump is going to trick the fight or flight response in nearly everyone in the room. Do you want the 100's of students in the school fucking with their phones, or trying to get them into either running, hiding, or dying (because this is a school and there is no fighting). The phones are just a distraction.

       I feel pretty confident that this rule is put in place solely to keep kids from playing on their phones during the drill. The school can’t very well say “this is a drill-only policy,” but the reality is that the rule is designed to keep kids paying attention during the drill and not taking a mid-day Snapchat/instagram/candy crush break.

       Too much cell traffic at once in a small area can interfere and make calls difficult, they probably have staff who are assigned to making calls, my school had the same rule but for fires and other emergencies for that reason.

       Im from Canada and graduated like  3 years ago, but their reasoning then was so the internet and cell towers didn't get overwhelmed (?) by a huge increase in traffic, and no cellphones because they don't want any sound or anyone distracted.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Using phones can distract people from the actions they need to be taking in the moment, such as running, hiding and listening to directions from first responders.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The sound of the phone, whether ringing or on vibrate, could alert an assailant to a hiding place.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The shooter could be monitoring the event themselves on social media and find more victims or elude capture that way.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Victims and worried family members trying to get through can jam communications, interfering with first responders.

         “It’s atrocious,” a law enforcement source who was on the scene after the shooting told Fox News. “If deputies were staging it could have cost lives.”

*The law enforcement source said responding deputies and officers were called to an active shooter scene in which they are trained to immediately “go, go, go” toward the direction of the shooter. “Every second is another life,” the source said.

       If they go to the school I imagine they are online friends [Facebook/Instagram etc] with atleast some people at the school. Would take a second to look at the most recent posts.

       Teacher here. I try to give my kids reasons for every rule. These are the reasons I give them for not using their phones during a lockdown. Now, my kids are good kids and don’t do stupid things, but many of them have been in other rooms during lockdowns that we didn’t know ahead of time were drills, and other kids were posting locations to social media, letting their phones go off, etc. Anyway, I’ve given my kids the reasons for not using their phones and because they’re pretty responsible kids I trust them to not do anything stupid. I’ve told them to at least have the brains to make their phones completely silent (not even vibrating), because in a real lockdown scenario I’ll do what I have to do to keep them safe, and that includes forcibly silencing phones.

       If you could guarantee that all their phones went to silent, I'd probably be of the thinking that they're safer with them, than without.

       It really was the point that stood out to me as the most legit worry.

       Yeah, like I said I really don’t mind as long as they’re not endangering anyone’s safety. I’m lucky to teach a bunch of nerdy, responsible kids so I think they’ll be smart enough not to post locations on social media or things like that-and if I did get one or two stinkers who would I’m confident the rest of the class would notice and take their phone away. And they’ve all heard the “do you want to be responsible for your mom running into the building during an active shooter situation?” speech plenty of times, too.

       Censoring video is endangering the truth. It's a lot easier to fabricate facts if there are no videos to disprove otherwise. I hope all your srudents display you in the event ypur facility is involved in an active shooter event.

       My bad I misunderstood. I personally believe we are not given the accurate narrative in many of these shootings.

       Body cams on kids that remotely record through a VPN tunnel to a parents dvr is the solution.

       It’s a decent idea but it would be a huge FERPA violation. I might catch some flak for this, being a public school teacher, but I fully support parents who want their kids to be educated at home (provided they know what they’re doing) or in a private or charter school.

       Yeah I work for the health authority in my state so I understand laws like FERPA and HIPA however our tax dollars pay for public education and therefore I think parents should have full access to classroom video. I think body cams would keep the kids safe and less likely to commit crime inside school premises at the same time.

       THEY want to be the only source of information.. Can't have people recording evidence that contradicts the msm version of events...On the other hand, the teachers probably want everyone to remain hidden and quiet.. If the shooter hears you talking on the phone, you'll give away your hiding place and could get more people killed.. Same with recording video.. If you can see the shooter, he can see you. It's open to interpretation I suppose

       There isn't anything nefarious here. It's about them legally covering their ass. Best case scenario, you capture evidence leading to the identification and arrest of the shooter. Worst Case, you capture evidence that the school was negligent or deceitful in their actions during the responce and it opens the school and county to massive legal liability.

       I understand your concern but there is a good reason for this rule.

       If your entire school is calling 911 at the same time it can tie up phone lines for emergency services. That is why they don't want you using phones.

       And they are. But after the 10th person calls telling them to send the police they are well en route. But the fire across town and the heart attack a mile away also need to be handled and if a few thousand people are calling about the school the lines are tied

       That is absolutely outrageous. You should make as much noise and commotion as possible about this. Get parents involved and outrageoud. It's so obvious that this is coming out of politicians pressuring school officials so they protect their future CIA 'school shooters'. I'd even start a counter campaign encouraging students to ignore the rule and doing guerilla type stunts secretly hanging flyers in the hallways telling students that 'sometimes refusing authority is the right thing to do' etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also be careful, your school might be getting its totally legit school shooting soon.

       Same in Canada, but the teachers explained that it's so people don't make noise, you'd be surprised how often a person puts is phone on mute and it isn't actually mute.

       That does make some sense actually. Filming would make you a prime target. This year marked a much different approach to lock down at my kids schools. The kids are now taught to run like hell versus hiding in a classroom. They’re teaching them to run in a zig zag pattern. In addition, all teachers are being taught self defense and are required to defend the students.  Finally, there is a bill in our states legislature to allow teachers to be deputized by the Sherrif’s department, undergo firearm training, and be allowed to carry in the classroom....personally I feel it’s about time.

       Possibly so if the shooter is a classmate he can't check people's social media if they're filming the events and find their location. I seriously doubt a student would actually be punished for their phone being out if they just had their classmates murdered

       It's a stupid rule, and one that will almost certainly never be enforced. Can you imagine a school trying to punish traumatized students for using their phone while the school is getting shot up? Ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       And anyway, you can just tell them you were trying to set your phone to silent mode so that the shooter won't hear your phone making any noises. The DHS and any other "active shooter" training video will tell you to do exactly that - set your phone to silent. You're covered.

       I learned that adults were just people far too late.  Fuck them-- Their rules mean nothing.  Film surreptiously if you have to, but film.   If you're still in High School, it's going to be your world soon enough.  Start taking it now--Please take it from the people who are 45 and above who don't believe in the future.

       Presumable because making a sound can be bad. A cell phone ringing can give away where you are. And recording it may leave you exposed. To be honest I understand the rule.

       Unless the penalty is that they will shoot you, then I don't think that it matters much.  There would be a public backlash for a child witnessing a school shooting being punished afterward for using a cellphone.

      <p>
       1) You’re focuses on your safety and possible escape, not getting video.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) police won’t confuse your phone for a weapon, cause we know they’ve fucked that up before
      </p>
      <p>
       3) avoiding the shitty media. Wasn’t a kid on the phone recently with a news station
       <em>
        during
       </em>
       a shooting? The greedy ass media can wait for their blood story.

       Those things feel like absolutely common sense, I don't get that this is a conspiracy. You're in a tense and life threatening situation, there should be absolutely no distractions or compromises to your safety or the safety of others. If it was just you and you decided you want to film it, fine. But it's not. You'll be in a room with a bunch of other kids, and if you make a dumb mistake then they all might pay for it with their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       People, especially young people, are unreliable in situations as dangerous as a school-shooting. It's better to just say 'no phones' rather than 'okay you can use your phone but only if you reallly think it's a good idea'.

       They probably just don’t won’t noise coming from the classroom, in the event of a shooter if they hear a phone call or some type of sound they’ll probably go for that room since there’s targets in their... that being said it’s a dumb rule, revise it to where if the shooter is close don’t be an idiot, if the shooter is on the other side of the building go for it... also if a wild David hoggs appears as a transfer student stay home for a week.

       I would still film and makes call if I felt like the situation called for it, no one should be able to stop you from calling loved ones if you feel something terrible is gonna happen. If they have a problem with this I would reach out to your local ACLU, the rule given context might not be constitutional.

       Phones are our lifeline in today's world. Very powerful with almost no penalty except for taking attention away while being used and requiring somewhat delicate carry. Those are the only Con/Trap/Negative. Be aware of that and you are golden.

       Yea I'm sure it's partially about making sure they're asses don't have proof if they do something wrong but I also think it'd definitely just about being careful that the shooter isn't watching everything that's happening in rooms making what he/she/they are trying to accomplish much easier.

       Wtf? I'm sure your school isn't the only one imposing this highly suspicious rule. This needs a lot more public attention. Most parents probably don't even know about this. If they won't validate their reasoning to their own students, they will have to explain their reasoning to a lot of pissed off parents.

       So it would probably be best for everyone to silence their phones if they know there is an active shooter. How shitty would it be to get killed because you got a text while hiding?

       I think the idea is that kids do stupid shit, especially when the concept of going viral is involved. So they don't want kids popping up or holding their phone over their desk to get a better shot (no pun intended.) They don't want cells to go down from being overloaded, so they don't want several hundred students all calling 911 saying the same thing, or calling their parents and the area becoming overloaded with parents that are merely getting in the way and making more targets for the shooter/s.

       So lemme get this straight? The TERRIFIED teacher is going to,in the least little bit, be more concerned about your using your phone for any reason,than saving their own skin? Yeah ,I'm not thinking! By the time all is said and done that vid is on social media(which,for anyone who cares, I DO NOT HAVE ONE FUCKING BIT OF INFO ON.NEVER havew, NEVER will!) or youtube. Fuck if the TV sations had half a bit of sense they'd encourage the "victim's" to send vid and save themselves from paying reporters....But then the TRUTH might get out to the general public..and we couldn't have that!
Back to the "rule" Do you mean to tell me the powers that beare going to physically detain EVERY student to check their phones for use and info...sorry "INVASION OF PRIVACY"  amongst othe PERSONAL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS of state and federal protections.
THE REAL PROBLEM HERE: Parents and children of
 THE SNOWFLAKE GENERATION ! These pussy whipped pantywaste pieces of "Ill give my rights up for everyone" idiots,do just that. If someone ANYONE tries to take your device you politely tell them tyo FUCK OFF and if they dont you BEAT THEM INTO SUBMISSION WITH IT! Those who give shit up freely are DOOMED and will be led to slaughter like the good SHEEPLE they are...So kid learn that NO is an acceptable answer and teach those that dont believe so.. it is
Learn to defend yourself in all ways and you'll keep thos important to you around a lot longer

       It seems that all of the people that damn me for wanting to record use this point. I'm not going to use Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc. I'm going to use the camera app that is on my phone
       <em>

       I'm saying that if I'm in the school that's being shot up, I'm going to justify the people that are curious like me, with hard evidence.

       They don't want you texting or calling the shooter warning them. At my school we had a threat one day and the student was still on the bus. The students texted and warned him. If he had a weapon everyone on the bus would have died.

       There was a student at my school who made a threat last year. People texted him and warned him. He was on the bus. If he had a weapon he would have just killed everyone on that bus knowing he was going to get caught.

       Most phone rules are to make people pay attention - cell phones are distraction devices at their hearts.  I hear what you're saying, but would follow the rules on this one.  They're trying to minimize deth and injury in the event of a terrible event.

       Your not allowed to call the police because everyone is going to call the police anyway. Dispatch will get overwhelmed taking in call after call. It will back up the lines and make information get out slower. You can call your parents fuck what they say about that but maybe they are saying it because they want you to get to a safe place first then call them. And they don't want you to record because people are idiots and will go out with a phone and a dream to be viral and end up getting shot. Those rules are mostly for the idiots. The school is also covering there asses in the event one breaks out and there were no rules regarding the subject.

       Bullshit rules are meant to be broken.  Imagine a school which decides to expel a student who had the temerity to text his parents that his was under a lockdown because of a potential shooter.  That would go over like the Hindenburg.

       Is your objective to survive or film something?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is to film something, go for it but you sure as shit better stay out of everyone else’s way.
      </p>
      <p>
       That rule is not just for your safety, but for everyone else’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physiologically, what will happen during an active shooter situation is your heart rate will increase to the 120+ BPM range.  Additionally, Your blood will start rushing to your vital organs and away from your limbs.  Ever get shaky hands or struggle to hold something when nervous?  This is likely the cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason this is noteworthy:  you will be trying to hold your phone and have an EXTREMELY high probability of dropping it.  Your trained muscle memory when the phone is dropped is to pick it up.  Your muscle memory is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       trained for an active shooter situation and your head will not be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       This creates a likely scenario where your group is moving to safety and you drop your phone.  Your instinct will be to grab it.  You will lean over and slow down the people behind you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may get shot, they may get shot.  Is your Snapchat video worth living the rest of your life either incapacitated or knowing that your actions caused the death of a friend?  HIGHLY UNLIKELY.
      </p>
      <p>
       This rule is not to prevent filming.  It is because you and the others around you lack the stress inoculation training required to create muscle memory which uses macro motions rather than fine motor skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you like it if your classmate ignored the procedure and caused you to get shot?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your phone away.  Focus on surviving.

       Ask about it in a public forum, like a school board meeting/board of ed.  Write a letter to your school administration.  If you are not satisfied with those answers, write a letter to the editor or op-ed in your local paper.  You could also raise it at a student council meeting or write an article in your school paper, but those seem like the least effective methods toward getting a comprehensive answer.

       Let's imagine that a future potential shooter records a school's tactics and then he/she can later be analyse the video.

       Maybe a little far-fetched but like I said... it seems like the only logical reason behind this rule.

       I can think of two reasons.  If you're so engrossed in recording, you might put yourself into a dangerous situation.  And if there are recordings, they lose control of the narrative.  This isn't just bad for conspiratorial events.  Even something small like a teacher making a little mistake in a stressful situation could turn into a lawsuit for millions of dollars.

       It's probably to save lives. There is absolutely no reason for you to be calling the police, call your parents or record anything. Doing those things might reveal your location. Also there is absolutely no way the police wouldn't be notified by the school's higher ups instantly. They probably have a procedure on how to handle a shooting..

       Why would recording video with your phone "reveal your location" any more than physically being where you are.  If you're being hunted, get away or hide.  If you can or feel the need to call the police with info or call a loved one, do so.  Don't pretend that your life is immediately forfeit and give up.  Rules go out the window in life and death situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       To save lives.....thats ridiculous.  Like you would walk around recording and calling out to the shooter that there are a bunch of people here or there.  You should call the police if you have information though.  Don't hold back and think with your head.  Don't call and just start blabbing if you're trying to stay hidden, duh.  You could be in a critical place and be able to get information as some eyes on the inside.  Don't not try and get away and play school reporter or anything but don't outright not do something just because they made a rule.

       That is control, that is ridiculous.

       I got mixed reception on what your stance was, but if you are focused on running up to the shooter and record him (kids will do anything for likes or followers and what not) then your life might be at risk. Also as others pointed out, your focus should be getting out alive/surviving, not being on social media. Additionally the phone might be confused for a gun and phones make noises so if you are hiding in a closet and your phone goes off the shooter might hear you and attack you. I don't see any other reason to record than to provide content for

       Its probably an artifact of the general no cell phones in school policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In event of a real crisis ignore that crap and just use the phone obviously.
      </p>

       I'm betting the rule is there more for kids that try to claim lame excuses if they get caught texting during class.

       If they don't give you a legitimate reason why you can't then the rule isn't for your benefit or it exists just as a way for whoever made the rule to cover themselves. Hopefully you never have to break it.

       I got kicked out of class years ago when i was in high school for wearing a dying fetus death metal shirt that showed osama bin laden with a target on his head. I tried telling them that the shirt was AGAINST terrorism, not for it. Schools are just another building to babysit kids so they dont get out of hand. You do you and fuck the rules. What is a teacher really gonna do in the heat of the moment? I mean really? “ oh hey before you blow my head off, JIMMY put that phone away!”

       They probably made that rule for a combination of reasons.  The probability that you'll ever be in that position is about 0.000001%. 
 It's not gonna happen to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my first advice is just ask them why that have that rule.  If there's a good reason, then they should be able to answer it no problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       My 2nd advice is, whatever situation you are in, always do what you think is good and/or safe in the moment.

       The only reason I could possibly imagine that being a rule is so nobody accidentally thinks someone holding their phone is actually holding a gun, but that seems so unlikely to be beneficial compared to the ways it could be harmful. Definitely a horrible rule coming from my current perspective. I have to admit though, I'm skeptical of the legitimacy of this post

       Listen my friend... they don't want you exposing the TRUTH. They don't want you accidently recording the REAL shooterS. They don't want you exposing the crisis actors covered in fake blood. They MUST control the narrative and that narrative does not include you and your rights. They cant have you recording the "patsy" doing nothing. That is why they ALWAYS remove the video surveillance camera before the false flag. So much shit went wrong in the Florida false flag scam they cant afford your rouge video exposing the truth to make it out to the masses. That is the answer to your question.  Plain and simple.

       That's because it might not be a wild shooter, but the government pushing for gun legislation...

       Yeah there's no reason to follow this rule 1 bit. Uber has a rule in which you're not allowed to carry a gun but the only time you would ever be checked is if you needed to use one in the first place. I'd rather exchange my uber privilege for my life. Some rules just don't make sense to follow and this is one of them. The punishment is easily worth the "crime" in this instance.
