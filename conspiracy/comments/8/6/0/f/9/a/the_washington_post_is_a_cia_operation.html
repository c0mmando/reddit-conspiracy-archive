        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I turned an earlier comment into a post, because I guess this is news to some people:</p>

<p>WaPo was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/05/washington-post-sold-jeff-bezos-amazon">bought by Jeff Bezos</a> (Amazon founder) in 2013. Mid 2014, Amazon landed a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-washington-post-changed-after-jeff-bezos-acquisition-2016-5">$600 million contract</a> with the CIA for a cloud computing system to share info between US intelligence and investigative agencies.</p>

<p>All of that is pretty incestuous, but the shenanigans continue. In 2013 Obama signed into law a modified version of the yearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2013">NDAA bill</a> that removed restrictions on state-sponsored propaganda. Many will remember this as the era where terms like &quot;alt-right&quot; and &quot;fake news&quot; were first used in the media. Interesting timing, considering the first draft of the bill was made available within days of Bezos&#39; announcement that he planned to acquire WaPo.</p>

<p>(That&#39;s the same law where the US legalized indefinite detention of US citizens under nothing more than &quot;suspicion of terrorist activity,&quot; but that&#39;s a story for another day. Just keep in mind that a dumb comment on the internet is full legal justification to get you &quot;disappeared&quot; in today&#39;s world.)</p>

<p>Which leads me to this piece of journalism, by NPR. Its too complicated to accurately summarize, but I urge everyone to read it. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs">NPR article</a></p>

<p>In essence: NPR wanted to track down the author of a completely fabricated news story, used an IT pro to do some digging, and found a common username between several sites. Quoting NPR:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sites include NationalReport.net, USAToday.com.co, WashingtonPost.com.co. All the addresses linked to a single rented server inside Amazon Web Services. That meant they were all very likely owned by the same company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This story is utterly strange because it mirrors on a civilian level, right down to the names, exactly what the CIA, Amazon, and WaPo were doing, at the exact same time they were doing it.</p>

<p>Make of that what you will, but I think it was a &quot;keyword smokescreen,&quot; basically an avalanche of red herrings injected into the news-sphere that makes a story disappear from search engines without actually censoring it. Another example of this was the Black Lives Matter movement (BLM) materializing in the weeks leading up to the Bundy conflict with the Bureau of Land Management (also BLM). Basic searches for &quot;BLM occupation&quot; resulted in stories about hood-rats blocking traffic. &quot;Oregon wildlife refuge occupation&quot; would get you all the info you could possibly need on careers with the Oregon forestry services. And so on.</p>

<p>TL;DR: WaPo is CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about Watergate. It&#39;s about the Pentagon Papers. Now, it&#39;s an okay movie, nothing great. But the implication that it wasn&#39;t risky for the WP to fight against Nixon is absolutely absurd. It was absolutely heroic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To assert otherwise is nothing but asinine. They went against the second most corrupt administration ever to hold office, took on legitimate conspiracies, and risked everything for people to know the truth. Whatever they are now doesn&#39;t matter, what they were then were heroes. As cheesy as it is to say, that line &quot;either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.&quot; is reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much wrong with this comment. For one thing, the &quot;either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain,&quot; is literally a fucking comic book line. Grow up. There are many heroes who died good men and women, still.</p>

<p>As for The Washington Post and the Pentagon papers, it was the NYTimes who first published them. And whether the Post was somewhat secondarily heroic or not is still bullshit propaganda at this point, because they&#39;re trying to use the so-called &quot;heroics&quot; of the 1970s to prop up their shitty, lying &quot;reporting&quot; now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the propaganda is trying to marginalize what they did then because of what they did now. I think it&#39;s being done because of Podesta&#39;s involvement with the Post. </p>

<p>Who cares where the line came from? I said it&#39;s cheesy, we all know what it&#39;s from, doesn&#39;t make it not true. Look at Alex Jones, this place sucked his dick and swallowed the load until he became it&#39;s villain by retracting PG. Now everyone wants to retcon it like they always knew he was a CIA plant. Happened to Assange as well. Probably happen to Snowden eventually. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enjoyed your post a lot.  </p>

<p>Many decades before Amazon was even a company, the <em>Washington Post</em> was the CIA&#39;s &quot;house organ,&quot; as Lew Rockwell calls it. </p>

<p>Everyone in D.C. knows <em>The Washington Post</em> newspaper is a CIA rag, and has been controlled by the CIA since the early 1950s when Phil Graham bought the paper with his wife&#39;s money :-)</p>

<p>See Deborah Davis&#39; great book, originally published in 1979, called <em>&quot;Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and the Washington Post Empire.&quot;</em> The late Katharine Graham was the Post&#39;s publisher; she sometimes played tennis with war criminal Henry Kissinger, by the way. </p>

<p>The late Ben Bradlee, the <em>Washington Post&#39;s</em> Executive Editor for decades, worked for the CIA in Europe in the 1950s. </p>

<p><em>The Washington Post</em> is nothing more than a CIA rag -- a propaganda sheet. You can&#39;t believe a thing in it (it should be called American Pravda), yet the <em>Post</em> gets lots and lots of coverage on CIAstream media from CNN to ABC to MSNBC. Just one example: <em>Post</em> reporters like David Ignatius are often invited on MSNBC&#39;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; program.  You see <em>Post</em> &quot;reporters&quot; everywhere on TV.</p>

<p>Deborah Davis&#39; book had been nominated for an American Book Award when it came out in 1979. Now for the first time, the third edition, circa 1991, is 
available digitally as a kindle and ePub as of a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Folks might also want to check out Carl Bernstein&#39;s famous article called &quot;The CIA and The Media.&quot;  This is Bernstein of &quot;Woodward and Bernstein&quot; fame.  Carl Berstein used to work for the <em>Post</em>:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, Time-Life (now Time-Warner) and most other &quot;mainstream&quot; media companies are held firmly within the CIA&#39;s orbit.  The CIA exerts enormous influence on all their &quot;journalistic&quot; coverage.  Check out this related thread from yesterday that mentions a little about Time-Life:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85u326/gordon_wasson_promoter_of_magic/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85u326/gordon_wasson_promoter_of_magic/</a></p>

<p>I remember journalist Jack Germond say years ago on national TV (in PBS&#39;s weekly televised &quot;McClaughlin Report,&quot; of all things) that he was a &quot;serious person,&quot; so he doesn&#39;t read Time Magazine.</p>

<p>All of that is pretty incestuous, but the shenanigans continue. In 2013 Obama signed into law a modified version of the yearly NDAA bill that removed restrictions on state-sponsored propaganda. Many will remember this as the era where terms like &quot;alt-right&quot; and &quot;fake news&quot; were first used in the media. Interesting timing, considering the first draft of the bill was made available within days of Bezos&#39; announcement that he planned to acquire WaPo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a lot wrong with this assertion. First off, the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr5736ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr5736ih.pdf">amendment that legalized the use of propaganda</a> was put forth in 2012 in the House and added to the 2013 NDAA bill, but this happened in May 2012, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/05/bezos-in-2012-people-wont-pay-for-news-on-the-web-print-will-be-dead-in-20-years/">Bezos purchased WaPo in Aug 2013</a>. There were no &#39;plans&#39; to purchase WaPo prior to that announcement, unless you have a source for that?</p>

<p>As for &#39;Fake News&#39; and &#39;alt-right&#39;, these terms <em>did not</em> start hitting media sources (especially MSM) until the rise of Trump in 2016. If it&#39;s in MSM, it gets Google&#39;d:</p>

<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=fake%20news">https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=fake%20news</a></p>

<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=alt-right">https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=alt-right</a></p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re using old terms for what &#39;alt-right&#39; have been previously called, such as neo-nazi, white supremacists, etc. As a comparison, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=neo%20nazi">here&#39;s the trend for &#39;neo nazi&#39;</a>, which <em>has</em> been around since the 90s, similar goes for white supremacist. </p>

<p>Generally this seems to be the intent of the NPR article, the company that rented those servers is called &#39;Disinfomedia&#39; and a quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coler is a soft-spoken 40-year-old with a wife and two kids. He says he got into fake news around 2013 to highlight the extremism of the white nationalist alt-right.</p>

<p>&quot;The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly or fictional stories and then be able to publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction,&quot; Coler says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Capitalism at it&#39;s finest. Found a way to make money where noone else had before. But it would be a great stretch to think either he&#39;s CIA or the CIA left enough fingerprints to be tracked back to spreading this fake news. <em>That doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t behind a domestic disinformation campaign</em>, just this isn&#39;t the MO of the CIA. Leaving traces back to a person or company? Why not just go through shells until you&#39;re offshore and untraceable? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basic searches for &quot;BLM occupation&quot; resulted in stories about hood-rats blocking traffic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Really? Need to call names? Also, did you actually search <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGRV_enCA760CA760&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=949&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;ei=62OyWqDeOtHijwPTy7PwBw&amp;amp;q=blm+occupation&amp;amp;oq=blm+occupation&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...4875.6438.0.6607.10.9.0.0.0.0.65.525.9.9.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.0.0....0.jue5yIbfpBU">&#39;BLM occupation&#39;</a>? 2 of the top 3 results are on the Bundy incident. </p>

<p>As an asside, I&#39;m using Google in a lot of my links because that is OP&#39;s assertion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Terms hitting the media, Google is part of the MSM machine, so if it were true results would show up there</li>
<li>Google search for &#39;BLM Operation&#39; because OP is asserting Black Lives Matters was getting more press than the Bundy incident, which isn&#39;t true (again, Google being part of the MSM machine)</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>TL:DR- This is way too long, sorry, I was ranting.  All media outlets are infiltrated with or influenced by the CIA and many others.  All.  And this has been the case since at least the 1940&#39;s.  Follow good journalists regardless of where they work. Taking a media outlet as fact without regard for the journalist is a bad plan.   </p>

<p>I dont think the Washington Post is unique in this way.  I live in Chicago and I have seen local politicians and the police basically take over community newspapers.  I think the way the CIA, other 3 letter agencies  down to local politicians do it, is critical to understanding how it is possible and why it is absolutely likely.   </p>

<p>Their methodlogy is simple; play to the ego and the importance of the editors, and have other agents and actors play to the beat reporters and investigative journalists.  They feed small true stories with details to reporters over time, making the reporter&#39;s job easier, and keeping them off of other stories they don&#39;t want covered.  When something comes up they don&#39;t want printed, or they want to change the narrative, they trade on their history with an ego stroke, &quot;you are a great reporter and an even better American (or Chicagoan&quot; then onto a &quot;remember when I gave you&quot; or in the case of my Chicago example &quot;remember that DUI when you hit those parked cars&quot; and then they move in for the kill.  They offer total access, info no one else would know, in exchange for 24 or 48 hours of silence.  </p>

<p>During that brief emargo period that follows fall guys are found, narratives changed, other witnesses or informers discredited and threatened, and the problem is in check. </p>

<p>During the Iraq has WMD scam all of the major media outlets were offered similar deals.  The ego stroke was great, &quot;you alone may be responsible for saving thousands of children from the deadly Sarin gas, while at the same time helping America defend these poor kids.&quot;  This leaves egomaniac journalists feeling far more important than they would ever feel under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>Lew Rockland called out WaPo years ago.  Christopher Hitchens more recently.  And again, not just WaPo but every media outlet from small mommy blogs to the three major networks have essentially been groomed by everyone with an interest in passing off bullshit as news.  </p>

<p>The entire news-sphere is a smoke screen long before the avalance of red herrings.  It is forum sliding on a mass media scale.  Hunter Thompson&#39;s &quot;fictional&quot; accounts of the 1972 presidential campaign found in Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail are far more credible than mass media reports on the same campaign.  </p>

<p>It would be a far more beneficial exercise to find out which media source was not CIA than to identify one that is.  I find that even in the mass media there are some skilled investigative journalists whoe work for some shitty media outlets.  Find the ones you trust and follow them.  Trust the author, fuck the brand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WaPo was always an appendage and a mouthpiece for the CIA, DOD, and NATO propaganda long before Bezos ever bought it and there hasn&#39;t been a war or an incursion since WWII that it didn&#39;t fully approve of or always attempt to justify the use of US military force, whether it was contrary to International Law and the will of a majority of Americans, (which they generally were), or not.</p>

<p>They along with countless other members of the MSM who have steadily peddled exactly that kind of propaganda is one of major reasons why the US now spends more on it&#39;s own so-called defence than everyone else, friend or foe all put together on the entire planet, and it certainly didn&#39;t get that way overnight and they have cajoled a great number of Americans into believing that having such an overwhelming and inordinately large military capability of that size and expense isn&#39;t precisely what leads to it&#39;s preferential use rather than ever being any very last resort after everything else that can possibly be done, including any form of reasonable and sincere compromise on BOTH sides has been duly tried in order to avoid any unnecessary conflict and bloodshed. </p>

<p>The US doesn&#39;t compromise because it doesn&#39;t have to, because it always has that military threat which it holds over the head of other and smaller nations that it wants anything from to further it&#39;s own economic advantage and dominance and if it doesn&#39;t get it will proceed to use that military option in order to have it&#39;s uncompromising demands met one way or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think black lives matter was either equal or more important of a struggle then the bundy thing.   Who are you to call a segment of the population that has been historically oppressed, tortured, and killed.. who got sick of being oppressed, tortured, and killed by a government funded gang of armed criminal police, and stepped into the streets.. peacefully .. to fight back... after multiple public lynchings..   and were met by highly sophisticated military equipment, snipers, stormtrooper type riot police, MRAPS, etc..  who are you to call them fucking hood rats?   And saying these were just “hoodrats blocking traffic”????!</p>

<p>Does the right realize why people call them racist?</p>

<p>I mean what the fuck is wrong with you?</p>

<p>The bundy thing was cool because people armed themselves and took on the government and were KINDA sorta maybe ready to really shoot it out..</p>

<p>But for what cause?  To help a criminal (despite the pretty ridiculous law he broke) evade justice? </p>

<p>I mean on one hand we have a historically violently oppressed underclass standing up for their rights peacefully, pleading with low life police to stop LITERALLY MURDERING THEM. Totally justifiable and heroic.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have a bunch of misguided mostly racist barely educated borderline imbeciles using their fucking toy guns to help a 100% racist imbecile cheapskate not pay his legally accrued fines</p>

<p>Which one of these is more important for civil rights, the struggle against tyranny and oppression, and for bettering the world?</p>

<p>For you to say what you just said..  calling desperate, broken, poor, tired, struggling human beings “hoodrats”... truly shows what caliber person you are and where Your mind is at. </p>

<p>Damn dude.  I feel sorry for you</p>

<p>On a side note, I highly doubt the “hoodrats blocking traffic” was created, set up with a name that  was lettered the same, for the reason of stopping people from being able to google the awesome historical event known as the bundy standoff.</p>

<p>I really hope people are with me on this. My god what is happening to peoples minds and outlooks on their fellow strugglers.</p>

<p>What a joke.    </p>
