       Now we hear every one an a while of another 'scandal' of social media. Whether it be the twitter silencing controversial figures or the 'adpocalypse' on youtube (making it themtube), these all seem to have a deeper meaning than just some one-off thing. But none of these get reported on by the media, or all the reporting is such that "Huzzah, a win for xx group" (insert race, religious, or otherwise 'minorty' in xx)
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the Adpocalpyse as people call it on youtube. While this one may be a bit more obvious, it is in all respects a way of silencing the non-globalist, non-intersectional crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twitter has recently tried to take the 'Verified' status away from some of the users that the company disagrees with. Ok, this, as with youtube, is trying to purify the platform of those dirty non-globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take what reddit did yesterday. Banning DNM reddits, Cigar, beer, gun trade reddits, along with some other 'impure' subreddits. These seems to be a ideological motivation behind these actions. These also seem to be actions that Reddit is taking to undermine the freedom of speech present here that is not present on facebook or twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm not trying to say all these organizations are pushing the same agenda together, but it seems all of them are pushing it nonetheless. And its quite concerning because I think it limits the public talk about these subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hold 1984 to be a gold standard in a handbook to tyranny, along with some others, but one of the few things I've remembered from it that was quite important, is that there was a moral purity that each party member must have. And even leaving the works of fiction, each totalitarian rule requires a moral purity to the party (see communism or theocracy). In communism, the purity is that everyone is completely equal, and that no one can be unequal. In Theocratic states, the purity is that of the religion they worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of the social justice movement we've seen over the last few years has levereged power by creating a new purity - one where ANYTHING CONSIDERED anti (insert race/religion/gender here) is something that is off limits. For example, look at the stuff that has happened with Count Dankula the other day, where the dude quite literally got convicted of making a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the fundamental standards of democracy and the west really is that we oppose this purity, saying that for each his own. So why the hell are these organizations stripping away the POSSIBILITY of becoming impure. Why the hell are people BEGGING for it (just look at
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or (god why do i have to use this)
       <a href="/r/LateStageCapitalism">
        /r/LateStageCapitalism
       </a>
       ). Why the hell are people so content while their right to freely think is being stripped to the bone?
      </p>
      <p>
       But it seems that somehow, instead of people being worried that these sites are banning dissenters, they say that it is a WIN. A WIN FOR HUMAN KIND. Doesn't that seem a bit concerning though? Should we not be more inclined to benefit the individual first then the human kind second? Why are we prioritizing the goodness of a group, the protection of a group, rather than the goodness of each individual? I'd love to hear you guys' thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when the hell did corporations become the rulers of what we can and cannot say, what is morally right and what is taboo?

       Hmm you seem to be employing shill tactics that love to accuse others of
      </p>
      <p>
       Technique #3 – ‘TOPIC DILUTION’
      </p>
      <p>
       Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a ‘RESOURCE BURN.’ By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity.

       I don't know that subreddit so I can't say. Israel doesn't
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be ethnonationalist, it could be reformed as a nation to provide full rights and dignity to Arabs. Thus I wouldn't support banning it simply for being "r/israel"
      </p>
      <p>
       If the users there actively and near-unanimously promote an ethnonationalist conception of Israel, however, then no, I would not shed a tear if it was banned.

       You changed the subject and accused the top commenter of being contradictory, why? Is it ever possible to talk about ethno nationalism in North America (it usually tends to be white nationalist) without switching the subject to a completely different country or people?

       Hmm never really heard of that how can a monarch rule over an anarchy? Or am I missing the point entirely? I have a buddy that keeps trying to sell me on something like socialism + monarchy but he sounds stupid when he talks about it

       I like what we got in north America, if people do play by the rules it is the best system and it has the checks and balances to mitigate a tyranny... Or at least makes it take a lot longer to destablish the current system

       I'm not really talking about conspiracy theorists like you or me. In talking about the manufactured perspective delivered by the media.  That white or Catalonain "zoinism" is labelled hate speech but the media holds up Jewish Zionism as a undeniable fact of progress.

       Ah, so you think it is okay for a private entity to "censor" I.e. remove the content of people based off of their beliefs and ideology. Thanks for clearing that up.

       As I said in the thread yesterday, I don't think you're a shill, just a bad conversationalist who makes ample use of the tactics
