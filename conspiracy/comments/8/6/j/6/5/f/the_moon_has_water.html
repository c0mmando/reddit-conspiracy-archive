<p>The dead and lifeless moon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/on-second-thought-the-moons-water-may-be-widespread-and-immobile">https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/on-second-thought-the-moons-water-may-be-widespread-and-immobile</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A new analysis of data from two lunar missions finds evidence that the Moon’s water is widely distributed across the surface and is not confined to a particular region or type of terrain.</p>

<p>The results contradict some earlier studies, which had suggested that more water was detected at the Moon’s polar latitudes and that the strength of the water signal waxes and wanes according to the lunar day (29.5 Earth days).</p>

<p>The debates continue because of the subtleties of how the detection has been achieved so far. The main evidence has come from remote-sensing instruments that measured the strength of sunlight reflected off the lunar surface. When water is present, instruments like these pick up a spectral fingerprint at wavelengths near 3 micrometers, which lies beyond visible light and in the realm of infrared radiation.</p>

<p>But the surface of the Moon also can get hot enough to “glow,” or emit its own light, in the infrared region of the spectrum. The challenge is to disentangle this mixture of reflected and emitted light. To tease the two apart, researchers need to have very accurate temperature information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wait, what...?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the surface of the Moon also can get hot enough to “glow,” or emit its own light, in the infrared region of the spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so not only does NASA report that there is water on the moon, it also emits it&#39;s own light. And sure, it&#39;s in the infra-red spectrum, but what if some of it were close enough to red to be visible, like the &#39;blood moon&#39;. Perhaps that is the moon&#39;s own light.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m suggestion is that what they are detecting could be ground water, just below the surface, perhaps special &#39;moon water&#39;, with strange properties, like heavy water or tonic water (tonic water glows under UV light).</p>

<p>But it could also be some sort of moon based colony in a hollowed out moon shell type craft, possibly a joint NAZI-CIA venture, and that the purpose of the moon landings was to confirm that the moon is a hollow object, like a space station, and they discovered that, wow, it is, and that water signal we are detecting is from the people, or beings (aliens), who live just below the surface.</p>

<p>But how cool is that though, water on the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most things emit light or more accurately - black body radiation. </p>

<p>You are emitting infrared light right now. It is simply emitted energy in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

<p>Water on the moon doesn&#39;t exist as h2o but as OH, hydroxyl trapped in rocks.</p>

<p>A blood moon is caused when the moon is in eclipse of the earths shadow and the only sunlight reaching it is from the diffracted light passing through earth&#39;s atmosphere. </p>

If it were a sphere, during a full moon, the brightest spot should be in the center while the gradient darkens as you move toward the outer edges. This is not what anyone observes. Instead, we see a fully lit moon all the way across, making it appear more like a flat disc than a sphere. It&#39;s not a sphere because the shadows that fall on the moon are not warped in a way that a sphere would cause them to be warped. It&#39;s just a flat shadow covering a flat disc.</p>
