        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you guys don&#39;t know, in England a couple of years ago. 2 children whistleblew on their father. They were telling their mother how he is the head of a Satanic cult involving teachers, doctors, police officers &amp; Church clergy. Hundreds of Names were exposed, including amazing testimonials from the children. One child said one of the teachers who abused them had a Baphomet Satanic Tattoo just above her vagina. Also Ricky (the dad) was hacked and the hacker matched his IP with a CP site which was distributing videos of his children. This was all covered up and people need to wake up. So please good fellows of /conspiracy please post as much information as you can.</p>

<p>Also, there is a website Named the hoaxtead or something that is a bunch of shills that go troll youtube comments and try their hardest to debunk, this has been exposed to be Ricky and His friends. Wake up sheep! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup, I&#39;m surprised they were able to get this cat back into the bag.  The testimony of the kids, is stunning, and too detailed to be contrived.  Down to exactly where they take the Fetus skin to have it made into shoes, and who (of the shoemakers) makes the better of the shoes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup, the children told of how the babies were killed, organs were eaten, and the skin/carcasses were brought to a local shoe cobbler (pablo, or something sounding similar) down by the train station, because he made the best shoes out of what materials they brought.  Everyone involved in the rituAls, at the school, had their own pair of these shoes, which they wore during ceremonies.  I believe they also mentioned that they wore the bones and or babies skulls, as necklaces and belts.  I listened to the whole testimony, and it was chilling, and definitely far beyond what a child could be coached into retelling.  These kids lived this.  These kids were damaged by what they lived.  There is no doubt in my mind, whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you say, in England we have a place called speakers corner where everyone can go and speak freely about anything. I seen one guy on YouTube going there just to give out leaflets informing. People about this cover up. I want everyone to know, this is what they&#39;re doing still today. If they have nothing to hide why are the police covering this up? I&#39;ll tell you why, because high ranking police officers are also masons. This is diabolical that the average Joe doesn&#39;t know even this about this stuff. They get their news from Msm and facebook. Wake up sheep</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the kids even talk about the multiple officers that were involved.  The story they told was mind blowing.  How you could doubt a child&#39;s retelling, wherein they gave absolute specifics, such as the tattoo you mentioned, etc, etc, just blows me away.  I&#39;ve been to speakers corner a few times, and heard they recently made an arrest of someone, there, for speaking on something that the powers that were deemed to volatile, pity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So some might say it&#39;s a narrative or false but the police had confirmed the mother&#39;s boyfriend was hitting/abusing the kids (dumping cold water down their pants) to coerce them into saying all the horrible shit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been awhile but the kids say their was a secret satanic ritual room in the school/Church but police/investigators could not locate any such room even when they were told about it by the children.  </p>

<p>Other&#39;s believe it was a whole cover up and the police, politicians, the church are all in on it.  Not trying to be rude but I feel its way more plausible that some asshole coerced these kids into saying this terrible shit then a 50+ pedo ring.</p>
