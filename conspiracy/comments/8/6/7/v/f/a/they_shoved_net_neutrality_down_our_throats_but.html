    <div class="md"><p>Everything.  The reassignment of internet sites from &quot;common carriers&quot; to &quot;media&quot; by the Net Neutrality repeal is what made Reddit liable for users&#39; posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it sounds like you don&#39;t understand the purpose of net neutrality repeal.</p>

<p>It was established, by case law, in the 1990s that providers of content on the Internet (in that case, SMTP email and Usenet) were &quot;common carriers&quot; under the law.  This meant that they couldn&#39;t be held criminally or civilly liable for content posted by users.  They were defined to be like a phone company, a carrier of communications and not an editor or curator.</p>

<p>What was called &quot;net neutrality repeal&quot; also redefined Internet content as media content, and makes sites like Reddit liable for user-created content,</p>

<p>You were told the FCC rule making was about fast lanes, surcharges, and Burger King.  In reality, it was a legislative reversal of 1990s case law that protected free speech on the Internet.</p>

<p>And now you&#39;re telling me that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, because you think you do, because you don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, that&#39;s completely wrong.  The repeal of net neutrality explicitly took away the &quot;common carrier&quot; protection for internet sites.  Nobody understood at the time, everybody believed it was about fast lanes and surcharges.  Even now, most of you still don&#39;t understand what happened.</p>
