       Reddit is pro-censorship as long as it fits their narrative. That thread about the Scot who got sentenced for his pug video was a perfect example. The comments were full of "what a shithole" and "thank god for the first amendment", all highly upvoted. Yet when it comes to things that goes against the grain, they can't wait to ban entire subs. The irony just doesn't get through.

       Net neutrality is pretty important so I actually support site-wide campaigns that might inform people of a change to something like the internet which affects millions of people, but might go unnoticed if people didn't raise concerns. My issue is they Reddit advocates for an open internet, but still wants censorship when it doesn't go with their view. Can that baker deny making the gay wedding cake or can't they? There is a lot of gray area of course so maybe the example I'm citing isn't the best, I don't know, but Reddit is full of hypocrisy on the subject.

       Look through the top posts of all time for smaller subs. They bought votes on dozens of posts in small subs with nothing to do with technology or government policy. They did this to fill up r/all with unmarked ads, but you can still see the obvious manipulation of you compare top rated posts of all time in these smaller subs.

       for not being man enough to make the announcement from his own account like he has made all of the others. Every update has come from his account but this one came from some alt account so he didn't get the downvotes he knew were coming. His ego couldn't handle it maybe. I'm not sure. All I know is it was a huge cop-out and handled poorly. You can set up blowjobs from strangers but cant help strangers save money because a few people misused a few tools? Go fuck yourself spez.

       Everything.  The reassignment of internet sites from "common carriers" to "media" by the Net Neutrality repeal is what made Reddit liable for users' posts.

       It was established, by case law, in the 1990s that providers of content on the Internet (in that case, SMTP email and Usenet) were "common carriers" under the law.  This meant that they couldn't be held criminally or civilly liable for content posted by users.  They were defined to be like a phone company, a carrier of communications and not an editor or curator.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was called "net neutrality repeal" also redefined Internet content as media content, and makes sites like Reddit liable for user-created content,
      </p>
      <p>
       You were told the FCC rule making was about fast lanes, surcharges, and Burger King.  In reality, it was a legislative reversal of 1990s case law that protected free speech on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now you're telling me that I don't know what I'm talking about, because you think you do, because you don't.

       Sorry, that's completely wrong.  The repeal of net neutrality explicitly took away the "common carrier" protection for internet sites.  Nobody understood at the time, everybody believed it was about fast lanes and surcharges.  Even now, most of you still don't understand what happened.
