    <div class="md"><p>There is no &quot;alien take over&quot;.  &quot;Aliens&quot; - as in off world intelligent beings - have <em>been</em> here.  They&#39;ve been here longer than Earth humans have.  We&#39;re here because of <em>them</em>, as a matter of fact - and by &quot;them&quot; I don&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;all aliens&quot;, which, of course, is an utterly ridiculous notion.  There are countless off-world species in existence.  By &quot;them&quot; I mean &quot;various different species of off world beings&quot;.  Earth humans are said to be a hybrid mixture of a <em>lot</em> of different off-world species - all of which came in here throughout the millennia and dipped their hands in the human genetic cookie jar.</p>

<p>We&#39;re said to have been genetically tinkered with no less than 23 three times by 23 different off-planet species throughout the ages.</p>

<p>So no.  There is no &quot;alien take over&quot; that is going to be happen that hasn&#39;t actually already happened.  There are elite figures on this planet (as in&quot;far above the president&quot; elite) that are said to answer to forces that are not from this planet at all.  In that sense, there won&#39;t be any &quot;alien take over&quot; because there&#39;s already <em>been</em> an alien take over.  Shit happened long ago already.</p>

<p>Part of the very reason open disclosure hasn&#39;t happened on this planet yet is because this planet has been quarantined by certain forces here (who aren&#39;t strictly <em>from</em> here) who have been living off of the Earth human population as a parasite does a host, and those beings would lose a <em>lot</em> of power and influence when the truth is let out that we are most definitely NOT alone in the universe...or galaxy...or solar system...or even on this very planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unlike the shit names you just pulled out of your ass and made up that lead to exactly zero, nothing, zilch, however, the sources I referenced actually lead to real information and data specifically relating to the subject at hand and supporting the statements I made.

<p>Oh...what was that you say?  You would prefer to be spoon-fed someone saying word-for-word the exact same things I said before your brain can grasp that what I said is valid?</p>

<p>Well, sorry, little one.  On this planet, you actually have to do at least <em>some</em> leg work on your own before your brain can acquire any information.  That&#39;s just the way things work here.</p>

<p>I mean, we were taught how to think for ourselves and reach our own conclusions during our education and formative years.  Unless you suddenly forgot how to do any of these things, all the cookie crumbs are there for your taking.</p>

It started off SOS Danger...then said something about not trusting them, they aren’t human.  So, then that all led to the aliens taking over next month.  There’s a new sub for it, r/solving41818</p>

I am all about sources. 
However, when it comes to many conspiracy type sensitive issues. We can not find sources in a controlled world such as ours. 
I jumped in, not because I believe this posts declaration. 
I just get hung up when people say. Source it. 
Sourcing is paramount in the indoctrinated education, political,  legal, medical and/or any stratification type systems.  </p>

<p>Reliable Sources can not be found when these stratification system are designed to take down anyone who does not share the narrative on the global agendas set forth for us.  </p>

<p>Question everything! </p>

<p>Sources can be manipulated by who funds the data or research points. </p>

<p>Also, when researching the Unknown one must embark their own personal knowledge journey. May not be right for you or I, but to them it makes sense. </p>
