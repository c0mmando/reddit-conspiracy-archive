       Earlier today,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/">
        reddit moved to censor 100s of communities related to "transactions for certain goods and services"
       </a>
       from the platform, as the SESTA/FOSTA bill passed today means that reddit can be held liable for content posted by its users.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the EFF notes, the groups behind this draconian censorship see this only as a first step;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some of these groups behind #SESTA / #FOSTA seem to see the bill as a mere stepping stone to banning pornography from the Internet.-
        <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170929/01242638309/campaigners-sesta-see-it-as-first-step-to-stomping-out-porn.shtml">
         https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170929/01242638309/campaigners-sesta-see-it-as-first-step-to-stomping-out-porn.shtml
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As a result of the bills which passed today, and the subsequent response by sites such as reddit, today could do down as the beginning of the end for the free and open internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent judicial intervention to overturn the laws in question, we may be on the verge of a brave new internet; an internet vastly different than the open and free platform which has defined online life for nearly 20 years.

       To those who didn't read, basically people are using the blockchain's 'note' function, which passes a note along the chain, such as 'money for game' is being abused to send links to thinks like CP. Or at least that's my understanding.

       yeah, old school pedos would have magazines and serials being sent out, and they would also have them available at adult stores under the counter (think you had to know someone or some keyword to get access, but i read on a great website (that i have lost now) about this process. it was a website with an all yellow background with articles on nude beaches, predators, and other articles analyzing and researching the nature of pedophiles and child molesters).

       No, you can actually store an entire binary file there, not just a link. At least with bitcoin. The method was pioneered early on by Assange and Wikileaks. It's actually quite interesting.

       to have a truly free and open internet, all censorship must be banned. censorship is a very slippery slope, as we are seeing. start with snuff, and child pornography things most people agree on, and then this week, all adult consensual sex work disappears, and then...craigslist personals.
      </p>
      <p>
       to fight for freedom of speech is to understand that yes, the underbelly of humanity does exist. its not pretty, or moral, but it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       if we were to create a free and decentralized and uncensored internet....which I firmly believe we NEED, we need to understand that all will be allowed. this is uncomfortable for some and unconventional conventional thinking it seems. But it is necessary. On a psychic level, the light shines upon the dark. Human behavior is what it is. In all its gory and glory. I envision a free decentralized internet that is 100% uncensored. this will shine a light on the underbelly of humanity but it also will ensure our right to freedom of speech, whatever our perspectives are, no matter how different they are from our neighbor
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, please, those that are capable and working in tech, we need this.

       Actually it isn't bullshit. The article doesn't address the core issue. They say that there's a low probability that you'd stumble upon it (duh), that is is very little of it in the blockchain (duh), and it is old news so it doesn't mean anything. That doesn't actually address the issue at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The initial story said
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The team found that 99 percent of the files consisted of either text or an image and a relatively small number of files contained sexual content—only eight. But one of those files was identified as a pornographic image of a subject who was likely underage. Two other files contained a total of 274 links to child abuse, 142 of those links directed to the dark web.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That isn't a lot and no one ever said it was infested with with CP and whatnot. And yes, possessing encrypted/obfuscated CP is still against the law. Is anybody going to be prosecuted for it? Probably not. Should people just blow it off? Probably not.

       It's bullshit as far as being a non-story, the convoluted means to put an image on the blockchain in 80 byte chunks means you may as well be talking about the ability to encode porn in a twitter or youtube comment.  Actually the cost to do so these days make it even less of an issue and 99.9% of bitcoin users don't even hold a copy of the blockchain, they don't need to.

       If you want to know why anonymity is a good thing for people, just ask the fathers of the revolutionary war. Anonymity and privacy is necessary to combat oppressive governments. Before the revolutionary war, the british would be able to just barge into anyones home and take anyone or anything without cause or justification. The U.S. constitution was written very carefully with the intent of giving the people a way to fight their own governments should the government stop working for the people. Thats why our system works

       Man.. this is cool stuff. I'm a ham operator for about 10 years now and this is very enticing. I just watched a few vids on youtube and it l'd like to mess around a bit with it. Quick question... so once the mesh net is set up, if you wanted to use it like the "internet", I'm assuming the users would have to run their own web servers on their nodes, right? And then someone would need to somehow index the servers and the sites, like a DNS service? And then someone would have to create a crawler that would index the sites, etc? So essentially, if I understand correctly, it would be like the www being re-created but in a de-centralized network?

       Whatever the bill's real intentions are, this bill is ripe for abuse. The reason the free world is dogmatic about freedom of speech is because censorship is a slippery slope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe has many "hate speech" laws. Most of them time they are used for their intended purpose; sometimes, they used to silence critics. The nature of language is that it can be interpreted many ways by many different people. This presents a problem because either the interpretation of the legal language, or interpretation of the speech in question can be manipulated to violate a speech censorship law.
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/08/29/in-europe-hate-speech-laws-are-often-used-to-suppress-and-punish-left-wing-viewpoints/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the intentions of this bill are totally respectable, it can be abused. This bill represents a "chic in the armor" for free speech, and a toe in the door for people who want to censor dissent.

       Exactly. And things are starting to move quite fast now as well. Won't be long now before free speech on the internet is a blissful dream of the past.

       They need to retake control over the internet, not only through shills and bots and vote-manipulation, but also through suppressing alternatives that do not fall in line with the narrative they need to maintain their power structure.

       You can read the actual text of the amendment and a summary here. That'd answer all your questions without any spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short answer is that it is about sex trafficking, shifting more culpability to the service providers that enabled online trafficking activities.

       I read through that and though I only understand the main gist of it, it does seem to be specific to prostitution and sex trafficking.  The only part I'm able to see that may apply to broader online transactions is this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify that section 230 of such Act does not prohibit the enforcement against providers and users of interactive computer services of Federal and State criminal and civil law relating to sexual exploitation of children or sex trafficking,
        <strong>
         and for other purposes.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How broad can that wording apply to?  Can they really extend that part to other controlled substances?

       weird that with republicans in control of all areas of government they'd be increasing censorship massively... oh wai- no it's not, they only pretend to be for freedom of speech because it helps them trick idiots into voting against their own interests and supporting the corrupt plutocrat party.

       Right. That's why they had to reach back to the early 90s for a reference an entire generation of voters whom she doesn't represent, and has never represented, probably wouldn't even understand. She was a joke to the party even back then. I'd be willing to bet even Tipper regrets that.

       They can try this, but it can never happen. If they were to ban it from the internet, you can bet your ass that thousands of companies would get their ass in gear to create a new type of marketplace for this stuff. Decentralized seems to be the big thing.Porn helped VHS beat Betamax and helped the internet become as big as it is so maybe that's what it's going to take for someone to create the "next internet".

       Many countries are passing similar laws. And prosecuting people for violating them internationally whenever they can get a hold of the operators or extradite them. So you need to live in a non-extradition country, with freedom compatible laws, and host your site there or in a similar freedom loving country. Good luck working those odds.

       Here is a link to the actual text of the bill everyone.

       It only specifies sex trafficking and prostitution nothing else so these other subs getting shut down is merely coincidence. It basically says if you host a website that promotes illegal sex trafficking or prostitution your ass can get 10 years in jail. There is nothing in the text about any other kind of websites or forums and it is mostly aimed at child sex trafficking which is a huge problem.

       Can you clarify on what exactly is being undermined by the amendment? The new language only applies to sex trafficking offenses. Not "types of speech." The language is very specific. Little room for interpretation or abuse imo.

       Craigslist already shut down their personals section because they don't have the resources to find and remove every single ad for escort services. They already had community moderating for it, but that's not good enough under the new standard and they aren't willing to take the risk. This will affect all social media and dating sites. It probably means the end of free dating sites, as current dating sites will need to invest millions in moderating infrastructure and approve every post individually before it can be approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sites like Facebook have the resources and money to deal with harsher moderation and occasional lawsuits, but smaller players will have to shut down.

       And they did that to further the aims of their competing and abhorrent ideologies, as any nation or society will do to protect its own. Unfortunately their ideologies weren't conducive with the rest of the modern progressive world, so guess what, they lost. They didn't lose because they burned books, they lost because their ideologies were rotten and the rest of the world got together and said "fuck that".
      </p>
      <p>
       "Free-speech" has never been the issue - not all ideologies deserve an audience or equal platform, especially in a democratic society where we decide as people whether those things have any merit. Have you actually read 1984? It's a commentary on individualism in a totalitarian state, not necessarily the individual tools the state employs to hold its power, and if all you focused on was one or two things like censorship (especially if you're trying to apply that out of context of the book) then you completely missed the point of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing droves of Nazis and idiots to spout their ideologies into group-think echo-chambers and meme themselves into false narratives which don't reflect the real world is EXACTLY how individualism dies.

       Since when is the first amendment without limitation? You realize censorship is allowed in privately hosted forums such as this, which is what the root of this thread is about, right? I didn't say we need to pass laws prohibiting Nazi ideology - it's on us as a society to shut down those threats which aren't conducive with our society - so it sounds like you agree with me there. Hence, Reddit is taking action in accordance with their ideals and the ideals they feel best reflect that of the society they're participating in. What's the gripe then?
      </p>
      <p>
       And really - I have history wrong with respect to the Nazis? Are you familiar with
       <em>
        Lebensraum
       </em>
       ? Are you familiar at all with the racial ideology driving the expansionist policy and why it eventually came to a head where everyone said, "Uh no. You're done."? Doesn't surprise me since if you're not, since Putin basically did the same shit with Crimea and no one batted an eye.

       I'm happy to say that my company's experiments in a few rather large companies (think 100+ employees) have paid off with an adaptation of this technology. There are some problems with the tech, but it's nothing that can't be fixed. All I can say is we're creating decentralized management systems that work under high load. Can't describe the details for obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope people will take this as a signal to rapidly develop wireless capabilities and offer people a plug and play solution to become a node in the network other people connect to. This would work perfectly with cryptocurrencies where you get paid based on the usage of your node. As with all new tech, it would be expensive at first but the costs would drop rapidly with each new attack on your internet freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the PR point, I'd provoke more attacks that can be spun as an attack on tech investors so that there's more justification and greater abundance of money to develop it asap.

       Yes. But there is a huge difference between a private company moderating their forums and the government  essentially mandating that they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless there is no moderation exemption in this law. If someone, somewhere, uses Reddit to facilitate prostitution, the site could be in a world of hurt.

       I'd bet
       <a href="/r/dirtyr4r">
        /r/dirtyr4r
       </a>
       and all the r4r sites will be taken down. The law reads pretty cleanly that a fine, a prison term of up to 10 years, or both—on a person who, owns, manages, or operates an interactive computer service (or attempts or conspires to do so) to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can Reddit state that 100% of all R4R type posts don't promote prostitution? I would bet they'll be like CraigsList who writes... US Congress just passed HR 1865, "FOSTA", seeking to subject websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties (users) misuse online personals unlawfully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any tool or service can be misused. We can't take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through craigslist, we wish you every happiness!
