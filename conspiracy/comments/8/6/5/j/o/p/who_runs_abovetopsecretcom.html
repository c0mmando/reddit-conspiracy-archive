<p>Now recently in the last couple of years it has been taken over by right wing politics. Any time this is brought up, anytime their is a attempt to discuss this further on the site the mods shut it down. </p>

<p>I have seen a thread on a far-right forum that states they were plotting some kind of take-over of the site. </p>

<p>I now believe that AboveTopSecret.com is under the control of a alt-right group and the only question remains is who is running it?</p>

<p>SkepticOverLord no longer posts, Springer does not seem to have much interest either so who owns it and who is running it.</p>

<p>I wanted to post this to see if anyone has any information on this because every time I try to post it on ATS it gets blocked or gets me banned. </p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>I am getting hit with a pay wall. </p>

<p>William Irvine is SkepticOverLord he has not posted on his own website in months I done some digging and it seems like he has moved on. </p>

<p>It appears like he still logs on every now and then but the general day to today running of the site seems to have been taken over. </p>

<p>I am concerned because I done some research into the extreme far right and their relationship with the site after I noticed a massive influx in far right posts. I found a link to a far right site which discussed how they some plot to take over ATS. </p>

<p>This is the link: <a href="https://www.stormfront.org/forum/t502670/">https://www.stormfront.org/forum/t502670/</a> </p>

<p>Any time I tried to discuss this on ATS I was banned or it was trashed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The site was politically polarized by left-wing politics in 2008. It never recovered. It&#39;s not really a right/left thing. You are feeding the same thing that led it to where it is. If unknowingly... there&#39;s a lack of awareness on your part.</p>

<p>Pre-2008 the most political post was &quot;Bush did 9/11&quot; vs. &quot;Military is in a tight place. We follow orders.&quot; </p>

<p>During the (pre) election onward there was noticeable astroturfing that never really died down. Today is a different landscape. It&#39;s rare to find any sites with active readership that isn&#39;t being controlled top down (e.g. reddit mods being bought out, sub creation) or large scale astroturfing by bots or paid accounts.</p>

<p>Twitter et al are the worst places where political messages are posted on repeat for consensus cracking.</p>

As soon as i see this &quot;alt-right/right wing takeover!&quot; bullshit, I know I prolly have an 80% chance it is just more of the same whiny astroturf.</p>

<p>Soros and Co. overplayed their hand, and reasonable people just point and laugh at it now. The real problem here is that we won&#39;t be able to tell if there is a real move by actual dangerous right wing groups.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit ridiculous to hold such strong views now that Cambridge Analytica has been outed. For all you know they were spamming as snowflakes while simultaneously meme&#39;n to ridicule them. Thus creating the narrative you hold true. </p>

<p>For what purpose? How is the data useful to those using it as a &#39;honeypot&#39;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I frequented both ATS and Godlike Productions when they first came on the scene but began to see changes that eventually made me lose interest in them a few years back. The more control that is exerted over what can be discussed the less spontaneous and insightful the comments tend to be. </p>

<p>In a word there&#39;s an obvious bit of &quot;gatekeeping&quot; going on that leads one to question who&#39;s really behind it and what is about certain topics and events that they really don&#39;t want being discussed in any depth?</p>
