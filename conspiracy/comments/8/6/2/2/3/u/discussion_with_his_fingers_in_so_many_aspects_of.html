       I've been puzzled why he's so lionized in the media and internet space. The amount of moves the man has made in recent years is nothing short of massive and completely unchecked it seems. Now he's entering spaces that have nothing to do with business, but global halls of power and influence.

       He's the executive of a public company and is under constant scrutiny. He built his business by himself. he's likely a monopoly but you can't name an industry that he leads in if he leads them all competitively. Amazon's scale can't be matched so like Microsoft, they think they can take it down via big government. Seems odd that the tenor of this post would call for the government (trump) to step in when it's his newspaper that is calling the president out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, maybe OP doesn't think Amazon is a monopoly and that the government (trump, for now) should not step in and control his company against its shareholders and American capitalists wishes. Maybe that's not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just what is the conspiracy or the point? That Bezos controls everything and the government must stop him, but not Exxon or say the NRA? Yet Americans are forbidden to see any president's tax returns?

       Bezos is on the Pentagon Defense Advisory Board, and has several contracts with the DoD, CIA. Thus, Bezos IS a Big Government oligarch. We live in a corporatist system where money buys political power and influence. My argument is not that the Government needs to "control or coerce or compel" him to do anything. And the fact that the government refuses to use Antitrust laws currently on the books against Amazon just furthers my point, which is that Bezos IS part of Big Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument is that people need to wake up and take the power back from the corporate oligarchs that have bought off our government through their armies of K-street lobbyists. To me, the first two ways to do this are to boycott Amazon, and pressure the DoJ to enforce Antitrust laws against Amazon.

       Why do they have to be mutually exclusive? Trump should be held accountable for his actions, and so should Bezos. It's not an either/or proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, Bezos is more dangerous because his empire is far more vast and influential than Trump's cheesy hotel and failing casino holdings.

       Do we know if they are doing user-based dynamic pricing? Sometimes I swear the price of an item check changes depending on which account I'm logged into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I know they change prices on the fly using automated software, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm wondering if there is any truth to the rumor that Amazon charges different prices for different customers for the same item bein purchased at theach same time. Their automatic price adjustment software that reacts on the fly as supply/demand changes is a really great way to hide user price discrimination, if that's what they're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I've heard Subscribe &amp; Save prices can go up as soon as you subscribe (for recurring purchases, like having paper towels shipped to your house every month). That kind of shit pisses me off.

       They do dynamically change prices on Subscribe and Save.  Sometimes up to 100% more than the price you had originally subscribed at.  If you dont watch it like a hawk you can get taken for months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ended my subscribe and save with them because of this.  They also block video content you've paid for if you use a VPN citing rights/license and region restrictions.  Clearly that's a bullshit answer because you purchased the rights and license to view that material so it shouldnt matter where the hell your reported location is.  Those two issues made me leave Amazon.  I'll never go back.

       Bezos / Amazon and like people / companies shouldn't be your main focus. Look at companies like Blackrock who have major investments in hundreds of companies with their own people sitting on multiple boards. Who has more power Bezos who owns 17% of Amazon or companies with these kinds of holdings?

       Wouldnt be a surprise. Bezos wants us to buy absolutely everything from him. Food through wholefoods, consumer goods/more food/clothes through brick and mortar target locations, everything else through the super attractive convenience of 1 day shipping prime. Very scary to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even further than that, he wants us to watch all of our content through prime, and get our news through washington post, and organize our lives with an Alexa. Shit is terrifying.

       Hmm, well people have great guns focusing on wrong targets. Bezos owns 17%, holding companies own the rest and make the real decisions. Do you guys even realize who owns reddit?

      <p>
       its owned by Conde Nast, who is owned by AVP a private equity holding company based at One World Trade Center, 43rd Floor... One of the largest companies in the US not publicly traded.

       As for the "holding cities hostage" part, I don't see how he is holding them hostage. Every corporation in the US does this when moving operations as large as this. Most of them promise jobs for tax cuts, then after a short period of time, cut jobs and give their officer's a huge bonus. It isn't anything new

       With limited supply (corporate locations) and great demand (states/localities wanting local corporate jobs), comes great negotiation leverage for the supplier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar to your example. Limited supply of jobs, employer threatens to relocate/rehire for your position. If your skillset is not unique enough to be “competitive” in the job market, then your employer has the leverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s simply a function of supply/demand in a competitive marketplace. Leverage is consolidated at the top/corporate level, too many locations and workers competing with one another out of necessity.

       We (Americans in general) love a winner and success.  Public perception can turn south though pretty quickly, however.  As of now most of the public aren't aware of Amazon's government dealings and stuff, nor yet understand why it is not necessarily a good thing.  Alexa is scary as hell to me, but some people actually think its cute!

       Hahaha, if you think that any company, especially major corporations, out there didn't get help from the Govt to get started, to continue running or just because, you are crazy. Also, if you think that most of them pay a fair tax is also, crazy. Maybe you should get a clue. Obviously, based off of your username, I think you have some bias that they are just worse than the others.

       Isn't it obvious? He's become the richest human alive in a matter of years, no matter how much we all want to hate him for all his shady and terrible business practices the guy knows his shit. If the media had
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       shred of dignity the reporting on billionaires and corporations and the shady shit they do would be 100x more prevalent than it is today. But spoiler alert: billionaires and massive corporations control the media. Someone as powerful and influential as Bezos has the media completely under his control. Oil companies have no problem brushing off scrutiny from the minority of informed people, military contractors and "war pigs" have no issue at all brushing off public attention from their crimes and greed, what on Earth makes you think the guy who became the wealthiest human being alive in a matter of years has any issue what so ever brushing off any negative attention towards him. The media will
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       touch him because the media is owned by billionaires who have every intention of sharing the pie with him. And the internet
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       hate him for the most part, just most people get over all the horrible stories and facts they hear because Amazon makes things convenient for them so out of sight out of mind.

       "Troubling" is rather subjective, but what about Amazon is monopolistic? Every industry they operate in is jam packed full of competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, Bezos is wiping the floor with the competition in many categories, and maybe there's some shady things going on under the surface; there usually are. But (I'll get ready for the shill accusations) Amazon is dominating by delivering better products, better customer experiences, and implementing the operations necessary to deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple of your points need to be addressed. He is not the exclusive supplier to the US government. You need to be more specific. And, I disagree he's holding any city hostage. The cities have all decided to offer incentives for him to establish there because of the size of the operation; that's on the city.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that, what negative attention
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       he be getting? I have yet to see an editorial/review on the proposed in-home delivery that did not point out how creepy that is. Same goes for the fashion camera thing. But, should we put a stop to things for some reason? Which part, and what reason would that be?

       Example: low paid warehouse packers walking on concrete all day. They also have a mandatory security screen they
       <em>
        are not paid for

       because Bozos argued that standing in an Amazon facility being groped was "part of the commute."

       The reason is he’s smart enough to know he has to pay the US government rather than snub them. Microsoft back in the 90’s wasn’t this smart and didn’t “pay to play” with the Clintons and came very close to getting broken up. Enzo’s has learned from Bill’s mistakes.

       Bezos mostly stays out of the spotlight.  He's generally not out in front of crowds and cameras saying obviously evil things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Amazon has basically flown under the general public's radar in a way that Facebook and Google haven't, despite being objectively worse.

       This sub cracks me up. Bezos is a turd and Amazon is huge, but the simple answer as to why he doesn't get more attention for monopoly, is that he doesn't own enough of any single market for anyone to have a valid claim that he has a monopoly. E-commerce only makes up about 15% of all retail sales and Amazon only accounts for about 4% of that. Yes, Amazon has other business's besides retail sales, but again, they don't have anywhere close to a monopoly in any of those business's either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you down vote me, you should not view my reply as an endorsement of Amazon (or Bezos), it's just a simple explanation of why no one attacks him for monopoly. As for his business practices, they are troubling, but no more so than many other (probably most) business and the media is silent on such things in general.
      </p>

       If it were left up to me, we'd revive Main Street and get the mom and pop stores rolling again.

      <p>
       Well, of course. Republicans hate government and they outsource everything. There are good business reasons to move to cloud services. Even massive Fortune 50 companies are putting their networks into clouds owned by other companies, e.g., Microsoft. There is nothing inherently wrong with the government doing the same. But if you want the government to own and control that infrastructure itself, you'll need to vote for people who aren't Republicans.

Mass media is on corporatists stide and he is the biggest one out there, who uses questionable practices to get where he is now, media is his/partnered with him. So much money and investment that he probably owns a sizable parlament voting majoroty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, company so large, that instead of allowing discussion on medicare for all, these rich elite that are a part of his club will try to merge a few large healthcare and insurance companies together to make one large 4 profit healthcare conglomerate, thats like medicare, but still going to run away with insurance and medical costs.
      </p>

       For the most part, Amazon's growth has been transparent since the beginning. It was just a freakin online book store and I was one of its first customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bezos has expanded and acquired just like other companies have done. And yes, CEOs can be monopolistic and get gov contracts. It's normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazon actually offers tangible products unlike Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, et al. Alphabet would be bleeding money without Android. Most of the tech companies which came after Amazon are shady and have inflated stock value. These companies are hyped and used by techies and most Reddit users. But Amazon has steadily grown leaps and bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no conspiracy here.

       Do we know if they are doing user-based dynamic pricing? Sometimes I swear the price of an item check changes depending on which account I'm logged into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I know they change prices on the fly using automated software, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm wondering if there is any truth to the rumor that Amazon charges different prices for different customers for the same item bein purchased at theach same time. Their automatic price adjustment software that reacts on the fly as supply/demand changes is a really great way to hide user price discrimination, if that's what they're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I've heard Subscribe &amp; Save prices can go up as soon as you subscribe (for recurring purchases, like having paper towels shipped to your house every month). That kind of shit pisses me off.
