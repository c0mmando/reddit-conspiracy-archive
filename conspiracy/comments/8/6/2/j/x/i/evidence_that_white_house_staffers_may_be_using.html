       A user on RussiaLago has brought forth some evidence that white house staffers may be using encrypted and self destructing emails via a service out of Switzerland. If this is true, it raises both ethical and legal questions, as well as questions as to why they should even be needing such a service to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was identified after Cambridge Analytica acknowleded to have used the service and why they were using it.

       so what do you propose, you're just going to continue waving the trump flag and attacking anyone that opposes him regardless of the now very clearly proven fact his campaign was massively AstroTurf? all while using the argument that you can't support anyone else because they might also be using AstroTurf to a lesser degree? makes no sense.

       right.... i'll just sit right here and believe that then. Interested to hear what makes you think shareblue are so prominent on here, but to save you some time just say yes if boils down to 'people on this notoriously left leaning website tend to support left leaning things'

       who are you going to discus policies with?! i guess maybe you're not to familiar with how democracy happens in America but you vote for parties and people not policies. Seems to me you're either trying to deflect the argument or lead people into apathetic time wasting. If we want to start fixing things we need to vote in people who aren't actively working against our best interests to enrich their friends and start a plutocratic oligarchy.

       I didn't even hear about GWB's emails until years after he was out of office, so no.  I'm no fan of GWB though.  He was a globalist neocon.  I suspect that you don't really care about my answer to your question, you are just trying to discredit me because you can't argue against my previous post.

       I'm not, but missing such a huge event does suggest that maybe you're not experienced in discussing this type of corruption or its respective nuances.

       It happened in the summer of 2007.  Bush was a lame duck, nothing ever came of it, and eventually all 22 million emails were found.  It wasn't a huge event, although I'm sure the media at the time tried to make it seem that way it was probably still drowned out by the 2008 election cycle that would have been starting right around the same time.  The only reason it's relevant now is because people can say, "but what about George Bush" whenever someone criticizes Hillary.

       That's a very uninformed opinion on this side topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something did come of it, and it was considered a pretty big deal, though not proportionally to Clinton's.  An undisclosed amount were recovered, but, as his administration admitted, not all of them were recovered (neither the presidents, his aides, chief of staff, etc) from being deleted from their private servers, and the percentage of how much was recovered was never released.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a huge event at the time (one of the first major email server scandals for the government, which lead to Clinton's), and it violated the Presidential Records Act, and possibly the Hatch Act.  Bush's aides were found in Contempt of Congress, though their punishment was subsequently waved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its relevant now because people are accusing Hillary Clinton of a crime that they ignored or belittle (see your post) despite GWB doing the same thing at a scale of 700% greater.  You're purposefully phrasing it so that the illegality of one (GWB's) is lesser, while exemplifying the illegality of another (Clinton's) despite the identical crimes and much larger scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is my point from the start.  You're more interested in sticking it to a Clinton then you are about the nature and rules about private servers.

       You made me look up all this stuff again, and now I know why I didn't care about it when it happened.  It was all related to the Dems being pissed off about Bush firing 7 US attorneys.  Clinton fired 93.

       And you are purposely trying to conflate GWB and Hillary's scandals as if they are the same.  They are not.  If it was just about deleted emails and a private server it would be like GWB's situation, but Hillary had classified emails on her server, including SAP's.  Her IT guy was also caught on reddit asking how to delete "very VIP's" info from the database.  The situation in which these scandals came about is also entirely different.  GWB fired US attorneys and the dems got pissed and started and investigation and found that emails had been deleted.  In Hillary's case, she was SoS when an embassy was attacked, a US ambassador died, multiple US and foreign personnel died, and when subpoenaed, Hillary deleted 33,000 emails saying they were about "weddings and yoga" or some shit.

      <p>
       No.  If you want GWB in prison for using a private server, fine.  Throw him in a cell right next to Hillary.  I won't complain.  But the use of the private server is not my concern with Hillary.  It's the classified info that was on the server.  18 USC 793 says that whoever "through gross negligence permits" classified info "to be removed from its proper place of custody" etc. is guilty of a crime.  Comey's original draft of his findings in Hillarys case was that she was "grossly negligent."  That's the exact definition used to define a criminal act.  Then Strzok changed it to "extremely careless."  Hmmm...  And just who was this "very VIP" that Combetta was trying to strip from the database?  I guess we'll never know because Comey gave him immunity and when he testified he took the 5th anyway.  That's not how it works usually, but I guess if you're Hillary Clinton, the normal rules don't apply.

       There is context. You saw the video with CA right? One of the first things they told their prospective client to do was get a ProtonMail account set up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump campaign hired CA. There is no reason not to believe Protonmail accounts were set up at that time as it is clearly CA's standard operating procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the reason to believe they stopped using those email accounts?

       People cared, but the government didn't. They shrugged over and over through pointless investigations/theatrical events. You have half the country screaming how emails don't matter for seven years-ish, and now the reaction is an even bigger shrug. We can't make things suddenly matter. We're all full of shit in this country.

       You answered my point exactly how I wanted. Our President used the slogan "Lock Her Up" during his campaign showing how corrupt she is. Trump supporters were/are foaming at the mouth over that slogan, yet now that his own staff are doing the same thing, it won't be a big deal, justified, or branded as fake news, etc...

       Protomail is going to be blocked from most Government computers. However, the real deal is that everyone in town uses the
       <a href="https://signal.org/">
        Signal app
       </a>
       though. It's been normalized to the extent that it's literally the first app I've put on my phone because I needed to communicate with someone and it wasn't going to happen otherwise. It's why devices were banned from the White House (though they have never been permitted in any area with classified information).
      </p>

       It doesn't matter what you're political leanings, it's just what everyone is using right now across the board.

       With enough time you can decrypt anything, you dont have to get the data from google. If you know your target you can isolate it watching their isps traffic.   Beyond that, signal is end to end encrypted. If they get the data they still have to decrypt it.

       That’s definitely not true in any practical sense of the term “enough time”. Properly used modern encryption would take millions of years to brute force or more.

       It's extremely superficial, no data is passed. Google Messaging Services are just used to alert the receiver's phone to connect to Signal's servers to retrieve the message.

       "no data is passed?"  Then how does Google know which phone number you are connecting to?

       Sounds like Google knows you are messaging the Suicide Hotline but doesn't know the content of your message.  Google knows you message a drug dealer, but doesn't know the content of the message.   You see a problem?

       Assuming your are correct, if Google receives no information, and can do nothing with the encrypted data it receives, then why send it to Google?

       It might help if rather than explain what Google can't do with the  data, you explain what Google does with the data.

       They claim end to end encryption, nobody has any means of auditing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure someone can put a packet sniffer onto the wire and see that the communications appear encrypted but we have no real way of knowing if the key used to encrypt is generated from a limited number of roots or with a predictable PRNG.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, for all that we know there may be marker bytes in the middle of the encrypted text ( using xml for framing communications would be an amazing way to do this ) meaning even if someone was going to audit the source code to both the apps and the servers it would pass with flying colours, but..... Someone can then figure out a unknown encryption key simply by brute forcing the known bytes back to their known values, this would actually be brilliantly subversive since it would only be discovered by a very small handful of people  and the math required to prove it would be so complicated that anybody could simply plead ignorance so you could drop 5000 developers all onto that code base and nobody would be able to point this out. ( except for the person who made the implicit design decision to use that teqnique in the first place )
      </p>
      <p>
       For all that we know there are 255 potential encryption keys shared by all the users of this app and anyone with access to the encrypted communications can run the message through a trivial process to get the plaintext.

       You're 100% correct. Unless they are FIPS 140-2 validated there's no external verification and even then that doesn't guarantee a perfect implementation or safety from a protocol flaw found later.

       Fips validation itself is completely useless in this context since that only validates the encryption library/module.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I seed my PRNG to either 1 or 2 every time I call the library then I can still be fips compliant though my messages can be brute forced with pen, paper a calculator , and a spare afternoon

       You know that, and I qualified that with a "that doesn't guarantee a perfect implementation", but for the rest of the folks, they may not have realized that the US Government tries to avoid the encryption problem you stated by forcing vendors to validate their crypto implementation in a lab.
      </p>
      <p>
       They break down each piece of the code into separate pieces and run what are called KAT tests. They put some bits in each piece and make sure the bits that come out are what they expect each step along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without this process the Government customer, or anyone at all, has no external verification that the vendor is doing what they claim. At least with FIPS you know some folks spent a year of their time at least thinking about the problem.

       The point that I'm trying to get across is that what's happening now is orders of magnitude worse that what HRC did or could have done as president  to the point where asking the question is simply unfair. Didn't your grade school teacher tell you not to make fun of the special needs kid :P

       Well, after Clinton got derailed by leaked emails, it would only make sense to ensure that anyone else afterwards would not get so easily exposed.  Regardless of your opinion of their malicious intent or not, the logic checks out.

       This is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Do you really think this is as basic as it seems? Do you really think this White House staffer created this ProtonMail account under his real name, wrote the address and password on White House letterhead, and then JUST HAPPENED to lose it at the bus stop? And then here's the kicker - someone finds the slip of paper and leaks it to the The Intercept! Not Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, Washington Post, NY Times, Wall St Journal or any other large, mainstream news source. They leak it to The Intercept which is led and staffed by activist journalists most of whom were involved with Edward Snowden.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think so. Maybe someone created the account under his name and leaked information in it. Maybe it was the democrats to cause more damage to the administration? Maybe it was the republicans in order to get increased scrutiny about encryption technologies. After all, the FBI has been broadcasting the message every week now about how they can't break encryption and need tech companies to give them access. What it is, I can tell you this story on its face is not true. Something is not right.

       Assuming your are correct, if Google receives no information, and can do nothing with the encrypted data it receives, then why send it to Google?

       It might help if rather than explain what Google can't do with the  data, you explain what Google does with the data.
