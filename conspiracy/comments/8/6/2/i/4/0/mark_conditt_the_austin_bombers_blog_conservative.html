I’m not defender of those viewpoints by any means, but I don’t think those views are reason someone sets off bombs.  It’s also fair to note those comments and profile were made 6 years ago when he was 17.  They may not be his opinion now, or they may be. We don’t know  </p>

<p>With that said, I already saw people on Twitter try to claim he was some Antifa registered democrat.  Sharing this at least should help stop those fake screenshots and posts that claim some political motive was at play.  It’s simply too soon to tell </p>

<p>As for anti-Islam, it&#39;s true that more lefties are oblivious, but plenty have bee getting educated on the subject.  After Omar Mateen murdered 49 in the gay nightclub in Florida plenty of guys really started realizing that Islam is incompatible with western civilization.</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>Because I&#39;m pretty sure the left has a major campaign going to root out sex offenders in hollywood and politics right now. </p>

<p>On the other hand, it&#39;s the (r)eprehensibles that constantly vote to not implement things like bestiality laws and the actual sexual assaults by conservative politicians have become public knowledge these last few years. </p>

<p>Who has more to hide?</p>

<p>Well except for the three million or so muslims that live in the U.S.A. and <em>don&#39;t</em> shoot up night clubs...</p>

<p>By that definition, Christianity is incompatible with western civilization because it condemns homosexuals to stoning. </p>

<p>And I say this as a practicing Born Again Christian. </p>

I view myself as a conservative, but I don&#39;t think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended.

    <div class="md"><p>By sex scandals do you mean activities that currently get you jailed and put on a sex offender registry or distasteful stuff adults do with each other that they shouldn&#39;t because they are married and stuff like that?</p>

<p>I think sex offenders and those who want to be would benefit the most. As far as who that is in the population, I would defer to statistics on that. I don&#39;t want to get in an argument about it but there are statistics that indicate what population groups tend to commit what types of various sex crimes to a greater extent than their percentage of the population. You can read about that. A couple groups in particular stands out to me and it isn&#39;t conservatives. I would be interested in any statistics you find. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  Very interesting - I&#39;m glad you clarified.  I also agree that &quot;guns don&#39;t kill people&quot;, but I think we need to be somewhat worried about pissed off young people in general, and hold them accountable for their actions.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re no worse than the left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not really right or left (depends on the issue), but I&#39;m not sure I totally agree with that.  I think that some of the ideas supported by the right are down right evil.  For instance: preventing women from getting adequate healthcare for religious reasons, racial/ethnic discrimination (&quot;build the wall&quot;, war on terror only focuses on muslims, war on drugs only focuses on minorities, etc.), discriminating against gays, and so on.  I know that for the most part they don&#39;t come out and say, for instance, &quot;the war on drugs is a war on young black men&quot; but that is the ultimate effect (without actually reducing the flow of drugs), but no one is trying to adjust or change it.  </p>

<p>I think the left has a lot of detrimental faults too (rampant corruption, loose fiscal policies, over regulation of business/trade, etc.) - but they aren&#39;t as down-right evil on a human-rights level as some of the things the right supports.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antifa is not a Russian creation. They have a long history in the united states and europe. </p>

<p>The original antifa groups emerged in 1930s germany and organized against the Nazi party, but  were crushed when the nazis took over. After the defeat of fascism anti fascist groups died out in the 1940s.  Contemporary antifa as we know it today reemerged in continental europe and the UK in the 80s and 90s as a response to the increasing popularity of far right political parties. Militant antifascism took hold in left wing groups in the united states around the same time, but Americans generally preferred to organize under the label anti-racist because organizers believed that fascism wasn’t as familiar to Americans as it was to Europeans. 
Confrontations between anti fascists and the far right in the US did not receive much media attention until the 2005 protest in Toledo, Ohio, where anti-racists and local protesters got into a confrontation with police protecting a Nazi rally which escalated into a full blown riot. After 2016, the term antifa became more common in the united states as a reaction to the increasing visibility of the Alt-Right.</p>

<p>Sure.  But their actual power is minimal.  There might be a couple thousand of them, and the FBI likely has tabs on nearly all of them.  Their influence in a country of greater than 300 million people is extremely limited.</p>

<p>I once read an interesting book &#39;The man who mistook his wife for a hat&#39; which was a psychological case examination of several agnosia sufferers. </p>

<p>One type was verbal-agnosia, meaning they heard sounds but they just couldn&#39;t interpret the meaning of verbal words. Writing was fine, as well as singing in some cases. </p>

<p>And a lot of these specific agnosia types would watch political tv and just laugh and laugh, even though they couldn&#39;t understand the words. </p>

<p>When questioned, they all answered &#39;because they&#39;re obviously lying&#39;, even though they couldn&#39;t understand what was being said. </p>

<p>Their disability forced them to hone their body language and tone understanding just so they could sort of function in a verbal society. </p>

<p>I’m fine if a company offers a “free” service in exchange for having access to the data you put into that service. Because then, people can opt to not use it or just use a competitor who won’t mine their data (usually for a fee). I’m not fine with a company having all that data at the ready for anyone to use for political reasons without the user’s knowledge or approval.

    <div class="md"><p>Traditionally terrorism has been defined as violence directed against civilians in order to advance an ideology or influence the public.  The unabomber clearly had an ideology and used violence to try and advance his agenda.  The Weather Underground had political goals.  We don&#39;t know yet that these bombings were meant to change anything politically.  Not all violence that terrifies the public should be deemed terrorism.  Here in San Diego we had a schizophrenic serial killer targeting the homeless.  He used a railroad spike on his victims and in a couple cases lit their bodies on fire.  So that horrified plenty of people, but it wasn&#39;t a campaign against the public, simply the intersection of madness and evil.</p>

<p>What makes him a terrorist is the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. </p>

<p>What political aims you say? (because I have been asked this question several times so far and I&#39;m going to save us both a lot of time and just fast forward your arguments through their patterned conclusion)</p>

<p>And I say: That&#39;s why I posted his blog so you can see his extremist political positions. </p>

<p>And then you say: But his blog didn&#39;t say that he was going to blow up people to forward his political agenda!</p>

<p>And then I say: The blog was from five years ago, when he was a teenager. I doubt he was planning this terrorism that long ago. </p>

<p>And then you say: See! He&#39;s not a terrorist! We have no proof that blowing up minorities was a political act even though we know clearly from his blog his extremist positions!</p>

<p>The way you talk about Austin makes it sound like you don’t really know what you’re talking about. It’s more liberal relative to the rest of Texas, but that doesn’t mean it’s like 90% or anything, nor does it mean whatever % is there are all assholes.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just claim that then tell me to Google it. Can you show me mass murders committed by the alt right in which the victims were called pedo chucks? </p>

<p>The gun stats are available. The only way to get numbers you like is to alter the criteria. Like some of the NRA memes trying to say X kills more than guns, the input criteria is always modified- such as &quot;guns&quot; means only bolt action long arms, excluding all other deaths by gun to get a lower number.</p>

<p>Did you just accidentally misspell recursion?</p>

<p>Re. “binary calculator”: you must have meant </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I see while you may be knowledgeable about machine learning systems, you have a good bit to learn about English and sarcasm.</p>

<p>A binary calculator takes a binary number value and converts it to a value in an arbitrary number system, yes?</p>

<p>So, the phrase &#39;basically breaks down to&#39; was a sarcastic glossing over of pretty much all computer advancements since boolean algebra was created. </p>

<p>If you followed the thread you&#39;d see that each example pushed back the timeline of the metaphor referenced, from Markov Chains (which I did not explicitly reference, as a markov bot is not just a chain running on hardware) at 15 years, SMTP at 30 years, to the mic drop fundamentals of the forerunners of digital computing (1870&#39;s-ish?). </p>

<p>But then I understand how literal-mindedness would completely gut you of any sense of comedic framing...</p>

<p>I got an idea, how about we just go our separate ways because trying to drag you along with the joke is starting to tire me out...</p>

<p>Are they?  </p>

<p>On the left we have a single gunman that shot at members of Congress.

This is also the only recent event that wasn&#39;t immediately declared a false flag or hoax around here.  </p>

<p>On the right you have pretty much every other recent act of domestic terrorism.  </p>

<p>Still, it&#39;s a shitty tactic, and I hate it when people imply that &quot;this guy was an X so all Xs are bad.&quot;  I just don&#39;t care for that kind of argument:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds to me you want to quarantine those with mental illness. remember your looking at probably close half of the U.S. population. Dsm has what 450 different forms of mental illnesses? Drug abusers, alcoholics, transgenders, and many many other things you might not conceder a metal illness are classified as one. Only times I think a Mandetory psych evaluation is needed are when buying a gun (your first purchase of the year)  or running for any political possession (and all government employees). Insurance companies can give discounts for people that volunteer for an evaluation but shouldn&#39;t be mandatory for having a driver&#39;s license. Your giving way to much power to the government. We do have a massive mental health issues but starting a hunt for everyone with a disorder is just wrong and will make those with mental issues freak the fuck out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. I agree with you here. I believe our biggest problem is that we are largely afraid of mental illness because we still don’t fully understand them and don’t have precise treatments for every patient’s needs. Many modern medications are extremely effective, while others are effective in the same sense that using a flamethrower is an effective way to clear your home of a rat infestation. Many mental health patients stop taking their medications not because it doesn’t eliminate their symptoms, but because they can’t cope with the side effects.</p>

<p>Decades ago, the answer was a faster track to institutionalization of mental health patients. This was largely effective, but systemic abuses and lack of oversight led to unfavorable public opinion, and institutionalization was scaled back to what it is today. </p>

<p>Another problem is the stigma caused by the minority of mental illness sufferers who commit atrocities like the Austin bomber, and the ensuing media coverage. It encourages those with mental illnesses who desperately need help to conceal their condition from the world.</p>

<p>I don’t think this a problem that can ever be “solved”, only dealt with in the most effective way possible. And we are currently doing a very poor job of that.</p>

<p>What makes him a terrorist is the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. </p>

<p>What political aims you say? (because I have been asked this question several times so far and I&#39;m going to save us both a lot of time and just fast forward your arguments through their patterned conclusion)</p>

<p>And I say: That&#39;s why I posted his blog so you can see his extremist political positions. </p>

<p>And then you say: But his blog didn&#39;t say that he was going to blow up people to forward his political agenda!</p>

<p>And then I say: The blog was from five years ago, when he was a teenager. I doubt he was planning this terrorism that long ago. </p>

<p>And then you say: See! He&#39;s not a terrorist! We have no proof that blowing up minorities was a political act even though we know clearly from his blog his extremist positions!</p>

<p>And I facepalm, and block you, and get on with my life because there is no curing stupid. </p>
