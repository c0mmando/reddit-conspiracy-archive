      <p>
       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm currently coming out of a bizarre breakdown/depressed/unemployed period of my life. During this time, I've had three obsessions. Conspiracy theories, true crime, and surprisingly for a vegetarian, fried chicken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not spend too much time on fried chicken, cos the better in myself I feel, the more I'm weaning myself off it. Let's not dwell on true crime either, cos I was obsessed with that shit before everything went wrong in my life, and anyway, I'm not sure I even want to live a life that doesn't involve the Missing Maura Murray podcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       But conspiracy theories. Man, I fell hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a lot of people who've been hugely into conspiracy theories, who have been deeply unhappy. Some of my best friends have been obsessed with them over the years, then a huge and decimating life event has happened, and then with hindsight they've all said 'yeah, I wasn't very well and I got far too into it'. I don't think I've ever met anyone I'd describe as happy that's into them. I'm happy to be proved wrong. Maybe that's the payoff for living in the bubble &lt;starts shouting like Alex Jones on the Andrew Neill show&gt;.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think depression leads people to conspiracy theories? Why do people (and I include myself in this) who work as plumbers or in warehouses or whatever, think that, 'yeah, actually, I know what really happened on 9/11...' Psychologically, why is this stuff catnip for lonely, sad, isolated people?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what conspiracy theories do you believe? Obviously beware that big brother is watching, but I completely believe JFK was murdered by his own (everyone does, right? And it's amazing that western culture still exists in the wake of that), I'm pretty sure Kurt Cobain was murdered, I believe some horrible stuff about a an ageing pop singer and Jill Dando and there's some stuff about 9/11 that doesn't make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm interested in, is people who feel like their interest in this stuff took over their life, in detriment to their mental health, etc. I think I could find some solidarity with these people.
      </p>

       Sorry but anyone still on the "empirical blah blah" evidence is still missing the point.

       For me, its that i dont trust people in general, especially those with money and power. My view of human nature is that it is innately selfish, and power corrupts. So as long as power structures exist and money is an incentive, people will be lied to, people will die. the reason i look into conspiracies is probably to validate my cynical worldview. Im more surprised when there ISNT a conspiracy, because i expect people to be shitty.

       I have a few thoughts on this, but in a nutshell yes, I think a lot (not all!!!!) conspiracy theorizing is based on certain coping mechanisms:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The world is very complex and complicated, and that makes people feel small and powerless. Believing that you can attach a simple explanation like "bad people are conspiring to do all of this" makes it easier to understand this world and so less intimidating.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         For someone in a lower station in life, it can be hard to feel accomplished or intelligent. Coming up with "the REAL story" helps to get on top of this, it makes you feel less like a shlub and more like an underappreciated genius. I think this is why whenever ANYTHING happens (a shooting, for instance) people trip over themselves to come up with the one true theory that cracks it all wide open.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We look up to certain figures like Hunter S Thompson, Alex Jones, or fictional ones like Jim Garrison in JFK, and have other "archetypes" for the persecuted truth-seeker who seem empowered and intelligent and rebellious. Acting out this role makes people feel less insignificant and hopeless.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Similarly, the eagerness to dismiss "experts" as being "in on it" helps with insecurity about intelligence and accomplishments. If the "experts" are part of the conspiracy, then
         <em>
          that's
         </em>
         why I'm not doing better in life, it's because
         <em>
          they
         </em>
         are keeping me out of their "sham" institutions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Being angry, outraged, etc, feels good and empowering and righteous. See
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGIY5Vyj4YM">
          this clip
         </a>
         for an example of this feeling personified. Even if your critique is ultimately shallow (like in Network) it feels good to be the "one" person crying out their window that the world is corrupt.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sometimes we feel guilty about things we've done, or things we're currently doing, and it alleviates that guilt to fixate on bigger, more obvious villains. I think this is behind some of the obsession of conspiracy theorists with pedophiles and child abusers, the most obviously awful people we can think of. Sometimes I wonder if some of the most ardent pizzagators might be pedophiles themselves overcompensating.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       I think that’s a gross generalization. Many people know about conspiracy’s but keep it at bay and don’t get to obsessed over them. The real question you should be asking yourself is, is worrying about conspiracies that may or may not be true really worth all your time? Just manage it bro. I know it’s hard I struggle with it from time to time. Maybe regulate the conspiracy shit to a certain time of the day. Now there are some people who are depressed when they find out conspiracies. Why is that? It’s pretty simple. You see all these horrible things happening while everyone around u worries about the kardashians. Also, you may be depressed due to a sense of helplessness. Meaning u feel u wanna stop all these bad things but then reality sets in and u realize there’s nothing u can do about it. That can make a person crazy. Just manage your time better. If you think and talk about conspiracy nonstop you will never be able to live a normal life.

       Conspiracy is what you became obsessed with.  I have a brother who is absolutely obsessed with figuring out how to create one unifying figure to encompass all of the variables that go into thoroughbred horse racing handicapping.  He has squandered his life looking for a number.  It isn't a gambling problem, he pretend bets to solve for this question, it is an obsession he can't shake.  I think the root of the obsession may be depression, I don't know though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think my brother is an idiot for spending so much time on that, but as a footnote he thinks I am an idiot for trying to prove anyone trying to fight off the coming New World Order is 30 years too late. The difference, and I think it is a key one, is that I have a job, a wife, two awesome kids, and I don't let my interest in conspiracy rule my life.  Also, I take long breaks when I start to feel I am in too deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if depression leads to conspiracy research.  I like to think in my case it was anger.  I was ten, camping at Cape Croker Park in Ontario Canada, and saw three bizarre lights over Georgian Bay while out hiking one afternoon.  I told my parents and they laughed, so out of spite I started researching UFO's.  That was 40 years ago, so maybe if there was an internet and unlimited resources I may have gone overboard.  The lack of info may have been a positive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do yourself a favor.  Take a breather.  If you live in Northern Hemisphere spring is right around the corner, if you don't fall is awesome.  Go for a hike, get in touch with nature a little bit.  I find it extremely beneficial to take long walks.  There are trees in the forest preserves near me that are hundreds of years old.  They have survived floods, tornadoes, 40 below zero winters, 120 degree summer days, droughts, and the encroachment of humans.  If they can make it hundreds of years I can certainly get past the murder of JFK and Kurt Cobain.  Trees make a small but long lasting contribution to the environment.  You may not be able to solve JFK of any other conspiracy but you are working towards preventing the next fiasco by exposing truth. Hang in there.

       The OP may not have realized it but he sort of answers his own question by correlating mental illness/disorder (obsessiveness and obsessive compulsion, depression and paranoia) with conspiracy theorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       That one’s life may be ruined by being a conspiracy theorist is more about the underlying causes (depression, mental illness, or just being an asshole). Being a CT is more the symptom than the cause.

       Newly red pilled people usually trip and fall in the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step back,  learn to accept that your day to day life will go on. The CT's are interesting, but rarely can you do something to counteract what you know.  If you do want to get involved,  find a productive way to help (ie donate to a reputable group that is working on your topic of interest. )
      </p>

       If you run around trying to red pill everyone you talk to you will definitely have trouble functioning in society.

       Many people who do not fit your description believe in these things and have normal lives. Maybe they are not obsessed with them, but when something like Vegas happens and there is just so much bullshit, I actually question the people who don't question it. And often when you look into one thing, it lifts a vail and you realize just how many lies people have been fed and that is accepted. It's a normal response to anyone with an inquisitive mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, about the part of bad thing she happening to people who "get to much into it"... that's fear. Fear has a massive effect on anyone's life. Not just people who are into CT, but a newfound massive fear of anything. It's a huge negative energy, and that will draw in negative things into your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of happy people question stuff, they just don't let it consume them and do not become fearful.
