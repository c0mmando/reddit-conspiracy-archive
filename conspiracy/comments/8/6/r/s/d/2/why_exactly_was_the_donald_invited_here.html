<p>I was banned from the Donald...a long time ago. For making a comment about 9/11. And it happened way before the invite you speak of.</p>

<p>My personal migration to r/conspiracy was just that...personal. I found someplace I could discuss conspiracy theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure an apology is necessary.</p>

<p>Depending on the how anyone&#39;s day went...hahahaha...we have all had our shining moments.</p>

<p>This sub will always have problems imo. It&#39;s the nature of the sub.</p>

<p>Take the latest hot potato here - Cambridge Analytica...I voted for Trump...I don&#39;t support what CA did. I hope they go down. I hope all of those types of organizations go down. I hope the investigation leads to halls of power that have knowingly involved themselves with these organizations for quite some time. </p>

<p>The actual governments..the intelligence agencies...the communication corporations, the social media platform companies and many others I&#39;m sure I&#39;m leaving out.</p>

<p>The issue of harvesting of our data to manipulate us could actually be a great unifier for many. But do you think it will? I don&#39;t...I think they will find ways to manipulate many during the investigation and cause even further divides. I think that&#39;s evil.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my opinion..and also why I like this sub...because I can say that here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing there will be many subs on reddit that will only allow the whole debacle to be specifically about Cambridge Analytica...a &quot;steered narrative&quot; if you will. No whataboutism on this one..no sirree...it will be sad to watch.</p>

<p>Nope. Plenty of subs are devoted to political figures and will ban you for being overly critical (theyre for damn sure being critical today, just check it out.)</p>

<p>The real problem are subs like r/politics who portend to be open grounds for discussing politics, but completely cater to a very narrow, mainstream (some would say deep-state driven) brand of politicking.</p>

<p>T_D is “a campaign rally for Donald Trump” or whatever they have in their sidebar. It’s literally a propaganda / shilling for Trump sub, which is fine but it is what it is and that behavior doesn’t belong here.

<p>They are an open ground for discussing politics. Open grounds doesn&#39;t mean &quot;Every single viewpoint is represented equally, from Fascists to Communists&quot;. It means &quot;you won&#39;t get banned for posting a dissenting viewpoint&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was here during the migration, and T_D&#39;ers were literally seeing conspiracies come true right before their eyes. DNC stealing it from Bernie, the Polls lying, MSM lying, Operation Mockingbird, Clinton Death list, and all these other things that they were realizing that r/conspiracy is right a lot og the times. I saw some users from here, showing them there, how many Conspiracies have actually come true, so many of them started coming here.</p>

<p>Even if the old mod didn&#39;t invite some here, they were still coming here because of the conspiracies coming true.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it sucks for this sub because I want less politics here, but on the other hand, 1 half of the divide is questioning everything and literally helped meme CNN is Fake News into existence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  I was using their own meme to grab their attention.  And AATA is only quoting two words of the title I used.</p>

<p>What the title actually said was something like</p>

<p>&quot;Attention refugees, you&#39;re welcome to immigrate here but you have to do it LEGALLY&quot;</p>

<p>The body of the post then warned them that we will ban them for breaking the rules.  I have no idea why AATA is pretending like it was anything else.  It&#39;s pretty underhanded.</p>

<p>This is a TMOR-style canard. When <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> when private, the modteam here realised there would probably be a heavy influx of &quot;refugees&quot; who wanted to know why the T_D was shut, and who wanted an alternative that wasn&#39;t overtly hostile to them.</p>

<p>We decided the best way to manage the situation was to sticky a post saying these refugees were welcome to participate in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but explicity warning them that it would have to be on our terms, and that our sub&#39;s purpose and rules were different to theirs.</p>

<p>Check this out. I didn&#39;t create this graph, I found it in one of the many posts complaining about T_D users brigading, but it actually shows the opposite. In the plot of T_D vs non-T_D, you will see that future T_D users were here, getting upvoted, before Trump ever decided to run for President, and before T_D was even created. You will also see that T_D users were not in here downvoting everyone. There is no divergence. T_D users scores spike, and non-T_D user scores also spike. There&#39;s a big increase in activity prior to the election around when wikileaks was dropping emails and PG was hot, but the voting behavior stays the same. That changes after the election. T_D users scores drop significantly while non-T_D user scores rise. This is evidence of significant vote brigading. The index line makes it even more obvious. After the election there is a massive drop in average comment scores. Non-stop brigading in the comments. It is blatantly obvious in any political thread.  Anything not pushing the correct narrative is downvoted below the threshold, and it&#39;s only gotten worse since this graph was created.</p>

<p>And you come here gaslighting people and acting like T_D came here because of a mod post.  We were already here.  You, on the other hand, and a lot of others like you, were not.  You guys showed up after Hillary shit the bed and constantly try to gaslight everyone in an attempt to take over this sub.</p>

<p>I watched that fire burn you know? A lot of people did. I&#39;m not trying to undermine flytapes contribution to this sub, or deny the fact they have been a part of this community for some time. I genuinely understand the sentiment. </p>

<p>But you have to at least admit, from the point of view from the sidelines, its really, really suspicious that y&#39;all had that going on. even more so with said user involved. And who knows how long, and where else these talks are occurring. The substance of these talks however, is a discussion for another day. </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to be as constructive as I can without being a dick, but y&#39;all really dropped the ball with this modcave you had going on especially after the admitted &quot;some issues&quot; issue.</p>

<hr/>

<p>What is the difference between how you characterize conspiracy researchers here, with the oversimplified thinking and broad generalizations, and a racist stereotype?</p>

<p>People in this sub are interested in many different areas of conspiracy research. People are of all different political persuasions and beliefs, of both sexes and all races. People do believe some conspiracy theories and do not believe others. Some people are here for hidden and suppressed history, some are here for UFO study, some are here for current political. conspiracies and some are here for past political conspiracies, and many are here because they are interested in may different areas of research.</p>

<p>In the end, for those people who come to this subreddit and participate in good faith, it is just a bunch of different people searching for the truth, in one way or another.</p>

<p>tldr; Don&#39;t be a douche.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let it go man, it&#39;s over. There is no way that that singular invitation is still related to the political bickering going on here. Whether you invite them or not, people that are pro-Trump, pro-Hillary, pro-left, pro-right.....as well as everything in-between and beyond are bound to come up here. This is a fairly popular sub after all.</p>

<p>The political bickering and brigading has been present on Reddit throughout the election (in insane amounts) and this sub was no exception. Others subs were chosen for left-wing propaganda, this one was chosen for right-wing propaganda.</p>

<p>One single thread by a mod here perhaps made some difference then, but time has passed, users have come and gone. Let us focus instead on making this subreddit a place where both left and right-wing politicians can be fairly criticized. I see plenty of criticism of Trump appointing Bolton on this sub and that&#39;s good. There have been plenty of posts criticizing left-wing politics as well in the past and that&#39;s good too.</p>

<p>But ultimately I&#39;d still say we need to move beyond the two political parties that have been pre-chosen to rule, while secretly holding hands behind the curtains.</p>

<p>True change needs to come from the ground up, not from the top down. Small communities, people becoming more aware, more compassionate, more involved, more knowledgable about what&#39;s going on locally and globally. People just need to wake up and  see beyond their differences, move into unity with each-other. That is the only way to &quot;win&quot; in this game, while hopefully saving humanity, our society and the planet as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I understand, but I wanted to point out that the invitation that was sent out months ago didn&#39;t make that much of a difference in the long run. By now, whoever wants to be here, is here and whoever wanted to find this sub could have easily found it, invitation or no invitation.</p>

<p>There have been plenty of thread criticizing Trump here recently, so I honestly don&#39;t think this sub is even remotely as pro-Trump as it was during the election or even a few months ago.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this sub will likely remain a battleground of shilling, brigading...etc. from both the left and the right. I&#39;m not a huge Alex Jones fan, but he definitely has one thing right - &quot;there is a war on for your mind&quot; and that war is being waged on every public discourse platform on the Internet that you can imagine. Subs like this are a prime target. On r/conspiracy you could in many cases (not in all, some posts are organicaly upvoted for the most part) say that the votes don&#39;t really matter at all, because the brigading is pretty severe from all parties, political leanings, including places like TMOR....etc.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is to post your own content that is of high quality, upvote what you find valuable and participate in the conversation, adding valuuable thoughts to the discussion. You can make a difference by doing so. However it&#39;s unlikely this sub can ever truly win a war against provocateurs, trolls, brigading....it&#39;s just too much of a battleground for some many parties of conflicting interest.</p>

<p>Most subs on reddit will ban you for saying something positive about Trump, having one sub supporting Trump makes the whole site less biased. </p>

<p>Also, shilling is pretending to be regular people online when you infact are paid to say the things you do, not regular people saying what&#39;s on their mind - that&#39;s freedom of speech and democracy. </p>

<p>Propaganda is when governments use taxes and state power to campaign/market themselves. Again, people saying their opinions online is not propaganda, that&#39;s free speech and democracy.</p>

<p>And now we all have to deal with this shit. If you ever wonder about the anti-Trump posts here, well shit maybe it’s because you invited an actual shill sub here and real conspiracy theorists got tired of seeing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> plastered over with propaganda.</p>

<p>Honestly wtf were you thinking, whoever’s decision this was? Whether or not you support Trump, and I can understand why some would, why would you invite an actual codified shill sub here?</p>
