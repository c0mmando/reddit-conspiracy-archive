        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like there are many new voters here in the last month or so and that one of their goals is use as many votes as necessary to keep certain posts around the 45% to 50% range--even if when that requires hundreds of votes spread out over hours. In other words, they could easily take such posts down to 10%, but that would be too obvious; whereas, 45-50% looks more natural, and is thus even more effective.</p>

<p>I have seen several posts (mine and others) that seem like they should be popular and which do indeed start off immediately getting all upvotes and then get taken down to the 45-50% range and stay there. In some cases it seems like many up votes are happening but  are being countered shortly after they happen. <strong>It would sure help to expose (and thus prevent)  such a phenomenon if we could see the total number of votes, or better yet, a graph of the votes over time.</strong></p>

<p>Edit: Notice how this (and other posts) are often only held in the 45-50% range for the first few hours, and then allowed to break out a little once they have been neutralized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, basically. </p>

<p>You have to browse &quot;2 ways&quot; - first quickly scan backwards from the Hot frontpage, but realize the posts that get promoted to the top nearly always are <strong>totally vote-controlled</strong>. That means very little un-gamed, un-mucked-up content or discussion will have slipped through. </p>

<p>Next, you <strong>must scan the New posts</strong> for the early discussions on topics that interest you. Early discussions tend to be much more productive for individuals who want to engage and trade info. Concentrate on having productive, reasonable exchanges with inidividuals, rather than &quot;broadcasting&quot; ideas or info. </p>

<p>But do not expect the best posts and info to move to the top of the sub - it just does not happen organically any more. </p>

<p>Of course, a few exceptions to that rule happen. But essentially this is indeed closely watched and manipulated territory.</p>

I notice when I land in Hot I see posts I know I should have caught on new that I never saw.  I am going to add the scan of Hot from bottom up and maybe that will help, thanks for that suggestion. </p>

<p>The lowest vote totals tend to occur on the posts that are actual conspiracies taht do not involve politics.  An actual alien could post an AMA in here and two hours later there would be 2 points. two comments, the archive is. and SS,  and a 67% score, but post that there is a new Q drop or that Mueller has pictures of Jared fellating Netanyahu and they are lit up like Christmas trees. </p>

<p>Because these users are generally transparent, they can be identified and exposed with much greater efficiency in /New than when everyone descends on a 300-comment post on /Hot front, scrambling at the last minute to sculpt the vote-sequence of a 50-comment post before the surge that will take it to 300.</p>

<p>That means they still win in /Hot, but they are at least a match for us in /New. imho.</p>

<p>This here is the issue. You are using reddit to push your opinion on others. When this fails you post a complain.</p>

<p>Reddit is best used to discuss and share. Using it to push will just make you frustrated as it was not designed as a soapbox.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of it&#39;s how the queue system works. Posts begin life on the new queue,  but only some people go there. If a post isn&#39;t above 50% after a couple hours, it probably will never make it to the hot queue,  where most users browse. </p>

<p>So it doesn&#39;t even need to be active voting after a few hours,  because if the post isn&#39;t on hot by then,  it probably won&#39;t be getting many votes in either direction. That&#39;s how easy it is to bury a lot of posts,  though some I imagine are actively manipulated for longer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started sorting by /new early on after I burned through all of /hot a number of times. It was about six years before I made an account because of the burgeoning trend of having great posts buried with down votes after a dismissive comment was so heavily upvoted. I thought I was missing something about the articles or posts at first, because <em>&#39;surely they can&#39;t be correct if so many people down vote them!&#39;</em> but alas over time the tactic became that much more apparent.  </p>

<p>I loved this place because of power players like SovereignMan and 911bodysnatchers and felt compelled to speak up, as their non-participation created something of a void here. I love to make posts, and have <em>absolutely</em> no shortage of content both digital and print, but still I find the most rewarding part of this page to be in the exchanges with other users, and the ability to speak with a true <em>&#39;resolute voice&#39;</em> in defense of the free exchange of ideas and the right to the critical examination of the systems in which we live our lives. </p>

<p>For sure, but that&#39;s against Reddit, Inc.&#39;s monetization strategy. Like it or not, we&#39;re on a site that&#39;s trying to make money for shareholder first. Providing an open platform for unmanipulated content is only a means to that end, and they will absolutely sacrifice the user experience, especially on sub like this, if it means they think it will make them more money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What - if there is such a war on - are the plans for peace? Anybody?</p>

<p>Possibly because I am truly half-way on the political spectrum, it occurs to me that these range wars must come to a close, or the sub will.</p>

<p>I do not think the actual population is divided on the conspiracy status of an event like 9/11. I think 50% suspect foul play and will say it, and 50% suspect foul play but won&#39;t say it openly until an authority figure lets them. We are the gateway for both sides of the spectrum!</p>

<p>And that&#39;s very likely why we get this much attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there are numerous reasons why we experience the problems we do. Which in turn means there are various groups behind the unrest.</p>

<p>I honestly have no idea what the plan for peace is. It&#39;s obviously complicated. Sometimes I feel like r/conspiracy is the digital equivalent of Syria. </p>

<p>Not trying to make a joke about Syria, not downplaying the devastation of Syria...just an analogy.</p>

<p>I guess the most realistic plan would be to uncomplicate things to start with. Once again..my opinion only.</p>

<p>In order to do that one would have to accurately define/assess the situation as it stands currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m considering doing a post on the ramifications of Eric Schmidt running in 2020 partnered with Amazon&#39;s Bezos and others.</p>

<p>I see Oprah and Clooney being heavily involved. They were the main financial backers of the March today...</p>

<p>Been seeing recent statements regarding collaboration between Google and mainstream media to correct the record so to speak..</p>

<p>Combine that with Wikipedia posting &quot;truth&quot; on YouTube in the near future..</p>

<p>It&#39;s a adding up to be one humdinger of a Brave New World.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking Schmidt&#39;s campaign slogan will run alongside lines of something like this -</p>

<p>2020 - Using Hindsight to Create The Future</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could see Schmidt backing someone heavily, or being a shadow partner of sorts, but I think he has way too much baggage for both the Republicans and Bernie Sanders Democrat voters. I think Oprah or Clooney (who&#39;s almost certainly CIA) would be more likely, maybe as the VP on the ticket. </p>

<p>What&#39;s this? First I&#39;m hearing of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2020 - Using Hindsight to Create The Future</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could see this or something like it happening. This whole CA thing seems to be normalizing the idea of using &quot;big data&quot; and psychographics to influence elections. I can really see the narrative in 2020 developing into &quot;We can&#39;t stop this, so we have to fight it by using these technologies ourselves.&quot; And who better to run that than Alphabet (agencies)?</p>

<p>I definitely see the VP slot as Clooney or Oprah..Schmidt like you said no matter what will be one of the heaviest players.</p>

<p>But I still see him as a possibility...no matter what..they&#39;re already setting the stage for full collaboration by the media on any platform.</p>
