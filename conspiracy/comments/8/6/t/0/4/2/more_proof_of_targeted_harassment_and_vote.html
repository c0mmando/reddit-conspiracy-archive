        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">88</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/axolotl_peyotl.html">axolotl_peyotl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The level of harassment from TMOR is reaching unprecedented levels.</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86l6jn/more_proof_of_tmor_brigading_and_attempting_to/">I made this post</a> detailing proof that several my threads from the previous day had been targeted by TMOR and buried, along with the comments.</p>

<p>The post hit the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> temporarily...until <a href="https://reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/86lj77/top_mod_continues_to_cry_about_his_russian/">this was posted</a> at TMOR.</p>

<p>What happened next is extremely predictable. The TMOR post proceeded to accrue almost 1,000 upvotes (at 94% upvoted), and my post was quickly buried to 0 points. Despite being buried to 0 (at 34% upvoted), it&#39;s been seen <em>almost 9,000 times!</em></p>

<p>This amount of views is practically <em>unheard</em> of for a post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that&#39;s sitting at 0 points.</p>

<p>For more proof that this activity and these views originated from TMOR, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86l6jn/more_proof_of_tmor_brigading_and_attempting_to/dw64fnx/">the top commenter in that thread</a> is a TMOR regular. You&#39;ll notice their MO: the comment attacks OP, doesn&#39;t <em>actually</em> address the substance of the post, and yet somehow manages to get <em>over 300 comment karma</em> on a post with 0 points. Right.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86l6jn/more_proof_of_tmor_brigading_and_attempting_to/dw62vtu/">another attack</a> from another TMOR user that got nearly 100 points.</p>

<p>Many of the other comments (which have been removed for rule violations) are also from TMOR regulars, and they similarly amassed dozens or hundreds of upvotes.</p>

<p>The incredible part about this whole saga is that they&#39;re so brazen about it, all the while <em>denying</em> it&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>They literally spout the same talking points: &quot;OP you&#39;re crazy for claiming harassment!&quot; as they harass and brigade indiscriminately.</p>

<p>For those who claim that they&#39;ll &quot;stop&quot; this behavior if we stop pointing it out...I&#39;m afraid to say that this approach is naive at best. </p>

<p>The more we call out their bullshit, the more they are emboldened and the more they increase these unconscionable activities. </p>

<p>At some point the blatancy of this destructive behavior will compel the admins to actually do something about it.</p>

<p>To the genuine <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> contributors: keep documenting their abuse! </p>

<p>We are on the right side of history, and this <em>pisses</em> them off. </p>

<p>Much love!</p>

They regularly brigade threads of anyone who delves to entertain discussion of ideas outside of the bubble of right-think. Because AP is an objective thinker that does not particularly prescribe to one narrative or another he has become a prime target, because he helps others to stray from the accepted/pushed narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A fair, point, and one I&#39;ve echoed in the past, being you shouldn&#39;t care about their antics or take anything said there personally or literally. Occasionally, though not often, I can actually agree with them on some points, when pointing out legitimate racism (excl. false accusations or hyperbole) and how they tend to perceive certain fringe theories (i.e. flat earth or reptillians) but do not agree by any means with their approach in addressing such content, by resorting to ridicule or harassment. It is, for the most part, pointless, dickish and unnecessary. On the other hand, it can be amusing at times, and another reason I just can&#39;t take any of it seriously, let alone personally or literally. Surprisingly, I&#39;ve actually been able to get along with a handful of their regular users relatively well in spite of it, when not discussing certain conspiracies or dwelling on topics of disagreement of course.</p>

<p>That said, any form of brigading and vote manipulation, any violation of reddit&#39;s sitewide rules which we ourselves are expected to abide by, is where I personally draw the line, as it can have a suppressing effect on the content and commentary posted here and in the other subreddits they have chosen to target. </p>

Yeah they&#39;re funny, and there is some legitimately ridiculous stuff on reddit worth linking to, but let&#39;s be honest, meta subs are just &quot;point and laugh&quot; subs.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no question this sub&#39;s politics changes every now and then.</p>

<p>In the run up to the election, a large portion of the sub supported Donald Trump. That changed practically overnight in January 2017.</p>

<p>One way to see that is to look at average comment scores over time. Awhile ago, I did a comparison of the overlap between r/conspiracy and the_donald. I&#39;ve seen lots of people say this is &quot;TD 2.0&quot; so I thought it would be interesting to compare.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Here&#39;s a chart showing the average submissions scores over time: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gmEpN1q.png">https://i.imgur.com/gmEpN1q.png</a></p>

<p>The Index is the TD average minus the non-TD average.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not much that stands out. After the Republican primary, the average submission score of a &quot;TD user&quot; increased more than a &quot;non-TD user&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Here&#39;s the same thing but for comment scores: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/K16aXLL.png">https://i.imgur.com/K16aXLL.png</a></p>

<p>Average comment scores for Non-TD posters went up significantly after January 2017. Comments flipped from having a slight TD bias to having a slight Non-TD bias.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I did the same thing for TMOR vs conspiracy. Here&#39;s the comment averages: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rC3OJ3K.png">https://i.imgur.com/rC3OJ3K.png</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>There&#39;s a handful of theories I think could explain why there has been a shift in the userbase, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;TD users&quot; have left. Banned or just not interested anymore, I don&#39;t know why but the percent of TD users is now back to pre-2016 levels</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s an influx of new users who want to discuss conspiracies surrounding Russia and President Trump. That includes temporary surges like when a link is cross posted from r/politics.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase in links from meta subreddits like TMOR and their growing userbase. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xB0EoGk.png">https://i.imgur.com/xB0EoGk.png</a> </p></li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in how I defined &quot;TD users&quot; and the (spaghetti) code I used, I have a post with more details <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/f_k_a_g_n/comments/76se4n/meta_analysis_of_overlap_between_rthe_donald_and/">here</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a combination of these three theories. The sub continues to grow and attract &quot;average&quot; users from other parts of reddit (average being younger age, left leaning politics) Some are blatantly astroturfing and some are genuinely interested in the &quot;conspiracies&quot; surrounding trump since the election. T_d users and trump supporters may find they have an easier time making their points here than they would other popular subs for obvious reasons hence the right leaning presence here. Some of that may be shilling and honestly if that&#39;s the case then they&#39;re doing a terrible job. </p>

<p><em>Most</em> of the users who were here before the election are not on either side and get drowned in the chaos. The heavy astroturfing from TMOR is very obvious when the obsessive debunking and mockery takes over threads. It used to be easier to find a middle ground in conversation, and above all that is not allowed anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine analysis. I agree its obvious, like stated earlier they&#39;ll be hitting you and while their hitting you they&#39;ll deny it. Ignoring it doesnt work because its been like a year, and its just getting worse as the core group of users gets fed up and leaves, you know - the ones that made this sub popular with intersting posts and viewpoints about things other than politics? Sorry, not preaching to you fenmanisc...hopefully new folks can see that normal methods of ignoring, or turning a cheek do not work. Those replying that are sick of these posts can ignore these threads...I mean how hard is it not to click in, if you feel that way?</p>

<p>Their goal is the chaos, and they are immune to anything but agreeing with their standard current assigned groupthink. Obsessive is not tio strong a word anout the astroturfing being talked about.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think this is pretty evident and is the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>I think t_d users are beginning to wake up to the reality that their hopes for what trump would be was all a lie.  I think you are beginning to see his &quot;base&quot; become apathetic and disillusioned to what trump has become.  With that, you are seeing less engagement of those that are left, because their overall numbers are dwindling.</p>

<p>Couple that with your second point.  The trump/Russia conspiracy is HUGE.  I started posting her a few weeks ago because I was curious as to what this community thought about the topic.  On top of that, the mods are not insane, so you have a good opportunity to debate with many different types of people.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty refreshing.  </p>

<p>This trump/Russia thing has alot of different layers so it&#39;s a good topic to discuss on almost a daily basis.  Now you have the new wrinke with Cambridge Analytica, which is just a shell organization for a foreign defense contractor with ties to Russia.  I mean, you can&#39;t make this shit up!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First graph: No doubt TD users have been pushing their God Emperor in here for a long time and they still are, as submission votes make clear. It is also interesting how erratic submission scores are for TD users versus everyone else. It&#39;s almost like they are being triggered to come here at certain times while the regular users are steadier. Also, the increase really took off in the spring of 2016 and has never dropped significantly.</p>

<p>Second graph: this one is comment scores, not submissions, so right out of the gate, this one better reflects this sub than the above graph. At all times, consistently, despite the wild swings in submission votes, those who would engage enough to offer comments have been majority not TD users. However, both groups have increased. As TD users increased, those who would oppose them increased <em>afterward</em>. Clearly, this shows who started it.</p>

It&#39;s kind of like bio-feedback for the &quot;hive mind.&quot;</p>

<p>And I&#39;d agree with RMFN, this should be its own post. </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a lot of interesting things you can find even with just public data.</p>

<p>For example, I plotted the number of accounts commenting for the last time (ever) per day in /politics in 2016 and split it by account status: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/z8DA71z.png">https://i.imgur.com/z8DA71z.png</a></p>

<p>For some reason, in 2016, there was a surge of moderately-active users deleting their accounts at the end of each month. October had a big spike in the middle too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty interesting. The number of last-ever commenters there at after the election is somewhat interesting. Did your data separate out &quot;last-ever commenter on r/politics, but active elsewhere&quot; from &quot;last-ever comment on r/politics, account still active, but no activity&quot;?  Or are these both grouped in &quot;active.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, regarding the end of the month deleted accounts, I have two hypotheses, and both involve your dataset itself. Your using pushshift data, no? Pushshift ingests every public comment within a few seconds of creation, and then at the end of every month, it goes back and updates this data. It&#39;s too late for me to reason exactly why that would show the spikes, but I think it might be an artifact of that process. </p>

<p>The other hypothesis along those lines is that there are people using accounts that are aware of pushshift&#39;s practice, and are deleting accounts at the end of the period so that those comments are not maintained after the monthly update. In this theory, the people running the accounts may have had them longer (either genuine or purchased), yet are only actively using them for whatever purpose for a month at most. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was just looking at /politics data not all user data but that could probably be done on BigQuery. &quot;active&quot; just means the account is not deleted, suspended, shadow banned.</p>

<p>I did fetch user data for the deleted accounts and that was indeed their last day commenting anywhere before deleting their accounts. Although, not all final comments were on /politics.</p>

<hr/>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting theory that the anomaly could be from the data collection process. I&#39;m half-asleep though so I&#39;ll have to think about that tomorrow.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this and I think you&#39;re right.</p>

<p>If a user deleted their account in February, the end-of-month pushshift update would change the <code>author</code> for their comments to &quot;[deleted]&quot; as if they never made a comment in February. </p>

<p>However, all their January posts would still be intact, and if they posted near the end of January, it would look like that&#39;s when they deleted their account.</p>

<p>That was a really good catch you made, thanks for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you&#39;re playing down the submission data and playing up the comment data.</p>

<p>You say that &quot;There&#39;s not much that stands out&quot; about the first graph, but it clearly shows that submissions from the_donald users score almost twice as high on average that submissions from non the_donald users, which is huge and is evidence towards a significant bias towards Trump here. It also seems to directly contradict your conclusion that this subreddit stopped supporting Trump &quot;practically overnight in January 2017&quot; because the positive difference between the_donald and non the_donalds has stayed fairly consistent over the last year.</p>

<p>The comments on the other hand, show little significant difference. As the index shows, the difference between the average score of the_donald users and non the_donald users is within a single point. I personally think it&#39;s a stretch to see a change of +1 to -1 in the average and conclude that a big flip in Trump support has occurred, especially when you take into account the severe bias towards pro Trump posts has stayed the same as evidenced above.</p>

<p>I think this data does show that the_donald is slowly losing it&#39;s grip on this subreddit compared to it&#39;s peak around the election, but that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is still on the Trump train for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s definitely a potential outcome. The ideal situation would be that the admins ban the sub for breaking site rules and so then the harassment would likely stop, but since that hasn&#39;t happened it appears as though the harassment has increased, or at least continued. And it&#39;s also possible that an artificial feud could be being set up, but I&#39;m less inclined to believe that than I am to believe it&#39;s genuine mainly because I&#39;ve also been on the receiving end of tmor harassment more than once. I haven&#39;t in a while, but mainly because I&#39;ve learned to generally stay away from the topics they harass over (you know, if you don&#39;t actively seek out something you&#39;re less likely to get the side-effects and all that), but it is a thing that happens nonetheless, both to those actively getting involved by trying to stop it, and to those who aren&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I read that 9 days ago. Since then at least two major stories have broken (the two I listed). I believe you think this is a serious concern. I also think you are intentionally feeding the trolls to create a bigger conflict so the admins will have to step in. The result though is you spamming this sub almost daily calling out TMOR, and in many ways you are fueling this vicious cycle almost as much as they are with your obsession and victim complex. People down vote you because they are tired of seeing these threads every day, but you always claim it’s TMOR. Not saying TMOR doesn’t brigade sometimes, but some people are just tired of the whining. </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t addressing any of the <em>actual</em> evidence I&#39;ve listed in the last few threads on this subject though.</p>

<p>The point is that these bad actors are making discussion on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> unmanageable, and this disruptive behavior has been increasing dramatically over the last few months.</p>

<p>Stickies are mostly reserved for original content. If you want to see a story featured on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, <em>you</em> have the ability to put it together and make a formal request. If it&#39;s high quality content, it&#39;ll be featured, no fuss no muss!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Just lately you’ve been obsessed with your own personal flame war and so we are seeing more and more of these posts rather than your usually pretty solid content. I have no problem with you and TMOR going round and round, but you spamming this sub with that content and using sticky powers to elevate your cause over general conspiracy discussion is getting real old.

    <div class="md"><p>So are you now trying to make conspiracy a sub who&#39;s only goal is to be contrarian regardless on evidence. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not <em>open mindedness</em>, that forcing a narrative on your own users. It just ends up being the narrative that goes against the general consensus (or hell just the consensus the mods disagree with). </p>

<p>I originally came to this sub to read and occasionally take part in open minded discussion about conspiracy topics. Blind belief in every conspiracy is not how to actually push the conspiracies that truly matter to the forefront. Are none of you actually trying to effect positive change?</p>

<p>The way I see it conspiracies exist as a method of highlighting important issues others might want hidden, using evidence that is hard to come by or hard to connect unless you are paying attentions. However as a result of this conspiracies are very liable to be wrong or pushed by those with an agenda or unfounded hated/bias against a particular group. Encouraging a sub that is unable to critically asses the conspiracies that come through their door simply encourages others to control your narrative. All in the name of wanking off our own ego and sense of intelligence for one upping the &quot;mainstream.&quot; </p>

<p>Just about 20 minutes ago I wanted to submit a new link to r/worldnews, I tried 3 times but every time I clicked on the submit link I got in return a message saying &quot;reddit: tihs page does not exist&quot;. Three times!</p>

<p>I then sent a message to the worldnews mods explaining this. Waited a few minutes more, then tried again, and it worked. However, immediately my thread appeared it was downvoted to 0!</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s a coincidence and I should forget about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty obvious what&#39;s going on here. I&#39;ve seen it happen here over the years, along with the other subreddits they target. Whenever I suspect a brigade due to unusual activity, such as organic voting ITT until a sudden unusual spike in downvotes, I search the URL of post and sure enough will consistently find it has been posted to TMOR. </p>

<p>Another detailed example, from a related subreddit:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracyundone/comments/82uscu/smoking_gun_proof_of_topmindsofreddit_users/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracyundone/comments/82uscu/smoking_gun_proof_of_topmindsofreddit_users/</a> </p>

<p>As I said, I&#39;ve witnessed identical behavior over the years, in recent weeks in fact. For example, I recently responded to a comment in a relatively obscure post in that sub. After a few days I was going back and forth with OP and the comment score remained neutral. Days later, all of our comments were suddenly downvoted into oblivion, about a week or so after that post was made to its original sub and no longer visible on its front or even second or third page, and sure enough the exact day it was posted to TMOR.</p>

<p>I feel like astroturfing is one of the most interesting conspiracy subjects of our time. Why wouldn’t this sub be interested in it? It’s an extensive propaganada method used by TBTB, there’s plenty of interesting data about it, and it even effects us directly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actual Astroturfing yes. Poking a hive of trolls repeatedly is different. And again my main issue is this topic being stickyied to the top of this sub again, rather than a discussion about current conspiracies that down involve AP merely getting down voted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A fair, point, and one I&#39;ve echoed in the past, being you shouldn&#39;t care about their antics or take anything said there personally or literally. Occasionally, though not often, I can actually agree with them on some points, when pointing out legitimate racism (excl. false accusations or hyperbole) and how they tend to perceive certain fringe theories (i.e. flat earth or reptillians) but do not agree by any means with their approach in addressing such content, by resorting to ridicule or harassment. It is, for the most part, pointless, dickish and unnecessary. On the other hand, it can be amusing at times, and another reason I just can&#39;t take any of it seriously, let alone personally or literally. Surprisingly, I&#39;ve actually been able to get along with a handful of their regular users relatively well in spite of it, when not discussing certain conspiracies or dwelling on topics of disagreement of course.</p>

<p>That said, any form of brigading and vote manipulation, any violation of reddit&#39;s sitewide rules which we ourselves are expected to abide by, is where I personally draw the line, as it can have a suppressing effect on the content and commentary posted here and in the other subreddits they have chosen to target. </p>
