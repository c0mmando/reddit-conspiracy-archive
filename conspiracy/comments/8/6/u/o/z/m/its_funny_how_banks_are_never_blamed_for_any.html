<p>I get that the blame of crimes committed by bad people have been spread around. Police departments have been blamed for not following protocol. Gun makers have been blamed for crimes committed. Hell, even automobile makers have faced criticism for allowing ISIS to use their vehicles.</p>

<p>But no one has ever pointed a finger at the banks. The banks are supposed to &quot;Know their Customers&quot;. This means looking out for suspicious activities. With all the crimes being committed, I&#39;m sure the banks have A LOT of blame to inherit. Unfortunately, no one is pointing a finger at them. People would rather blame everyone else. </p>

<p>Its sad, but true.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you&#39;re getting at here and a pathological level you almost had me. All these people/organizations catching the blame for the actions of others, why don&#39;t we blame the organization that has the ability to stop these things?</p>

<h2>Full. Stop.</h2>

<p>Why would you want the banks to take the blame for the actions of others? The banks didn&#39;t commit the crimes and it shouldn&#39;t be their responsibility to police the purchases of their account holders. Just like the gun stores shouldn&#39;t be blamed for legally selling guns as prescribed by law when the person then chooses, as an individual, to commit heinous crimes of their own accord. </p>

<p>The <strong>LAST</strong> thing I want is for the bank to actively &quot;Know their Customers&quot;, and acting like it&#39;s sad that they haven&#39;t been blamed enough for commiting someone else crime is just playing into the same fallacious login that is being used to place the blame on anyone besides the individual who commited a crime.</p>

<p>We already have Credit, which banks will look into when trying to open new accounts. Imagine if you tried to open a credit card with your bank and they decided you&#39;ve been wastefully spending too much in the last 2-3 months based off of your statement? What about when the Bank who &quot;Knows their Customers&quot; decides to not allow a 3rd charge to a fast food establishment in a single week because your statement indicates you&#39;ve already had enough. What about when you override that block and then the bank informs you health insurance and your rates go up?</p>

<p>The last thing that should be put under a microscope are the individual spending habits of everyday ordinary citizens.</p>
