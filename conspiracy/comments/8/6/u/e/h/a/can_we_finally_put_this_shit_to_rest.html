       NY Times released videos of the Las Vegas shooter walking around the casino, tipping bartenders and other workers, gambling, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the biggest piece of “evidence” for a conspiracy has been the lack of video graphic evidence, can we finally put this shit to rest? Seems pretty cut and dry to me. Let’s focus on legitimate theories from now on please.

       It certainly answered the most glaring ones. Again, the lack of video footage was one of the biggest missing pieces of evidence that was feeding into many conspiracy theories on the event. I just think it’s funny that, when presented with evidence to support the conventional narrative, this sub just moves on and ignores the evidence even though the
       <em>
        lack
       </em>
       of evidence fueled months of discussion.

       Lack of motive is still there.

      <p>
       The odd Jesus Campos story is still there.
      </p>
      <p>
       His house being broken into after the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are three weird things that I can think of that are still unresolved to anyone's satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think most are happy to see the videos, but that doesn't answer everything. It doesn't even solve whether he had and accomplice or whether he was an arms dealer. But it does show that the guns came from the floor up rather than the roof down. What else do you think they show us?

       A video of a known gambler walking around a casino? Damn case closed, wrap this one up boys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're confusing 'lack of video' and 'them not releasing the video'. I don't think that many people doubted their being actual video of him walking around a casino, the bigger part was why they didn't release the video in a timely manner.

       He was found dead in a room with AK’s, pretty obvious he was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What circumstances leading up to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The most prevalent theory on this board was that he was a gun runner, likely for a gov agency at some point. Deal went bad and Paddock was taken out before the shooting on pedestrians.

       Videos of him eating and gambling dispel none of that.

       Its actually not clear if that was the body of the guy in the videos and pictures.

       None of the story about campos, schuck, marilou danley, makes sense and is full of inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The doors in between the rooms.

       The lack of bullet holes in the door.

       Campos going to mexico.

      <p>
       Weird private security guarding campos' house while in mexico.

      <p>
       Body had a rifle OVER the foot. "Suicide" weapon in wrong position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two handgun rounds fired before "suicide". He also appeared to have been dead longer.

       "If it's on video, it must be true" is the new version of "if it's on the internet, it must be true." Deepfakes and CGI are getting so good, you can't trust anything you see anymore. When you get right down to it, how do we know any of it's real.

       <li>
        No timestamps on videos of Paddock moving luggage.  Took 6 months to release footage.
       </li>
       <li>
        Multiple reports of multiple shooters.
       </li>
       <li>
        Police scanner reporting multiple shooters.
       </li>
       <li>
        About a dozen eyewitnesses who reported multiple shooters die in strange circumstances the next week.
       </li>
       <li>
        Changing and contradictory narratives by LVPD and FBI
       </li>
       <li>
        Paddock's window still intact minutes after shooting started.
       </li>
       <li>
        Jesus Campos crisis actor and his handler were just bizarre
       </li>
       <li>
        Hints of ties to ISIS, ISIS claims responsibility
       </li>
       <li>
        Paddock and brother are pedos.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Both have ties to intelligence services
       </li>
       <li>
        No evidence of actual injuries or deaths
       </li>
       <li>
        No evidence in plaza of impact from a single round.  Nobody has found so much as a single divot caused by a bullet after hundreds of rounds fired

       <li>
        Bizarre media response, started pushing gun control again, then squashed the whole story asap

       I was saying even before the footage released and right after it happened that the footage they are asking for is just going to be him using the bellhop to bring weapons. Lo and behold I was right. Now they are just doing their best to drag the mexican into it and make Paddock into a democrat.

       You'll go the usual routes. Well, if someone disproves me on THIS issue well that that just means THIS happened to reach my same conclusion I had before because I'm never wrong.

       Why are there no holes on the doors/walls if there was a shootout
The footage is very edited and took forever to come out
He said the goverment was messing with his mind, maybe they were
The police on air whispered "don't mention the car" why?
What was his motive 
Saudis rented the floors above him the month before
They said there was a block aid on the stairwell going on up, why?
People said shots from opposite directions, on the ground
Several witness dies after
Where is Jesse campos/and the valet guy
Why did the poloce give conflicting stories
Are we really to believe there was not a camera in the hall?

       The biggest part of this was the weapons used. It was pushed off on the ar-15 platform rifle with bump stocks and high cap mags. However audio sound investigation showed that the rate of fire was not consistent with the ar-15 with a bump stock. The audio csi found that the rate of fire was closest to the militarys m240 bravo, a belt fed full auto 308 machine gun. The point in the video that stuck out like a sore thumb is at the end of the video where it pans across the crime scene and points to specific pieces of evedance. At the end where it pans to the body,  they label a shooting stick by paddocks feet. The stick is actually a military tripod.
