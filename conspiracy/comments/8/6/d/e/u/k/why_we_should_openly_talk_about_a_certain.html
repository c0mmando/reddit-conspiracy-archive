<p>Carl Jung tried desperately to bring tie his metaphysical ideas into reality through psychological terminology. I personally feel as if Jung was a mystic and hardly a scientist or even a good philosopher. In short his ideas are as useless to me as they hold no merit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Negative ghost Rider. Scientific empiricism has allowed us to come to concensus on many facets of reality, even coming to a conclusion on many concepts previously thought to be here theory (ex. Higg&#39;s Boson). Through the establishment of mathematical relationships, reality can be defined enough, to agree at least in part, on it&#39;s nature (the nature of reality).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you personally understand all this math and can vouche for it’s authenticity?</p>

<p>Or are you asking me to ‘trust’ someone I don’t know and never met and will never meet to explain to me something that only a handful of people in the world can ‘understand’.</p>

<p>Nikola Tesla laughed at quantum theorists because they often lacked a connection to the real world, real science.</p>

<p>Nikola was passionate about testing the real world, not some ‘imaginary place’ where Higgs Boson particles sound like they could be a real thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know some of the math and can vouche for the authenticity of certain basic scientific observations. For instance I can tell you that I&#39;ve personally conducted tests to confirm the acceleration caused by gravity on-or-near-to earth&#39;s surface. I also can tell you that thousands of studies have been done on the density of water alone, and I have seen a chart showing the results of all studies beside each other. It turns out they are all in near perfect agreement with each other. This is why I agree with the use of a formula which includes the density of water. By using the Ideal Gas Laws agreed upon hundreds of years ago, I can run experiments today and use formulae which achieves results similar to those theoretically envisioned. This is all thanks to the accuracy of the math that science has provided through much trial and error.</p>

<p>Coming along and spending no real time doing any real thinking, or acting, to determine the truth on the subject, shall in my opinion never trump the truths uncovered by science. Our greatest fault is when we read into science more than it actually provides. However to be clear, science is the only way to find the truth. All else falls short of even trying very hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing is for sure, we can agree on what time it SHOULD BE but can anyone tell me why nobody is ever ON TIME?</p>

<p>We agree as humans on certain truths, or facts, or physical laws, but I’ve found that over time and more data, more evidence, we learn those previously held truths sometimes erode away and get replaced with new truths, laws, etc...</p>

<p>It’s all very fluid over the long long term, perception and consciousness aren’t as uniform as our human brains want them to be.</p>

<p>So what can we prove? So far, we can only prove we exist and at times can agree on shared truths that may likely evolve over time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes previously held beliefs erode with new evidence, yes, but often with science the new evidence only sharpens what we previously thought. Often concepts don&#39;t radically change with new evidence, at least more recently in human history. You act as if we know next to nothing. This simply is untrue. I won&#39;t claim we know it all or even a lot, but we certainly know some things and are at least very very close with very many other things. Failure to recognize this will only garner a lack of respect, from me, unfortunately, so please take the time to consider what I&#39;ve said, and hopefully respond with more than a cracker jack box&#39;s sentiments.</p>

<p>Well first of all anyone can study it enough to the point of being able to see for themselves, although basic math will at least give you an <em>idea</em> of it if you&#39;re not retarded.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s not one person claiming it. There are and were thousands of scientists trying to dismiss and disprove these theories, which makes it evolve and come a consensus where it is declared a Theory (Law). It&#39;s not a guess, it&#39;s a process that takes decades. Science is not religion where your guess is as good as any.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Both these men recognized in the energy of radiation a phenomenon related to the Gnostic-Alchemical Tradition. Soddy was even daring enough to compare the transformation of the radioactive elements to the transmutation of matter achieved by the Alchemists: 
There is another still impossible feat, to the accomplishment of which all the appliances of modern science have been directed in vain, as well as all the utmost power of man from the earliest time. It is TRANSMUTATION or the conversion of one element into another. RADIOACTIVITY is the one process going on in matter we cannot influence or stop, while TRANSMUTATION is the one process in matter we have so far signally failed to effect. The juxtaposition of RADIOACTIVITY and TRANSFORMATION is not a fanciful one, because it will appear as we proceed, that the two processes are most intimately connected. &quot; - frederick soddy</p>

<p>do you really not know what parsons and hubbard were up to? the babylon working? and the collider is the machine, cern is the european nuclear agency and can have opinions. its also named for cernnunous the celtic god but you dont have to believe me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are thinking of the collider. the collider is the machine. CERN is the organization of scientists. lets try to be clear about what we are discussing. </p>

<p>to go back to my original point, if occultist see radioactivity as the transmutation the ancient alchemical philosophers spoke of, then the study of it has just as much religious implications as any serious theological research coming out of the vatican. also important to keep in mind is that this alchemy is the exact same philosophy that jung examined for his entire life (not to mention isaac newton who wrote tons of material on alchemy). so what you really have is psychology and physics interpreting the same philosophical phenomenon but simply from different schools of thought and methodology. thats why i admonished you for dismissing jung and praising cern when they are both studying the exact same patterns of thought but from different analytical frameworks and perspectives. </p>

I simply don&#39;t see the connection.

<p>i am not saying they are the same school of study, only that they both draw inspiration from a common pool of philosophical thought of the alchemists. jung applied it to psychological phenomenon and cern applies it to physical phenomenon, but they are both speaking of the alchemical process of transmutation. thats not my opinion or perspective, that is simply how it is. </p>

<p>&quot;In his laboratory, Rutherford continued bombarding atoms with alpha rays, until in 1919 he succeeded in transforming nitrogen atoms into oxygen, thus becoming “the first successful alchemist in history.” That transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen was the first artificial nuclear reaction, and among its remains Rutherford found the proton, a new subatomic particle with a positive charge.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so it seems that you&#39;ve fallen into a bit of a logical fallacy. You&#39;ve taken an old definition, and an old idea called transmutation, and you&#39;ve defined new science with it, rather than defining old concepts with new science.

    <div class="md"><p>helpful advice, im not the one shoveling these ideas on you, im only trying to open your eyes that they are already being presented to you in a manner that obfuscates the true nature of what you are being told. i think you greatly underestimate the historical overlap of religion and spiritual philosophy with what you call &quot;science&quot;. isaac newton wrote volumes on alchemy, mendelev was a monk, lemaitre was a jesuit preist. i think it is the height of folly to dismiss the influence of religion on scientific thought when its pretty well established that the reason for it is that men of faith were in most cases the only people with the time to devote to such studies. im not even trying to argue they are correct, im only asking you to look at things with a different lenses.</p>

<p>u/curiouscuriousone is on point mentioning Carl Jung and Synchronicity, thats probably the best thing to understand to start getting more informed on the topic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It never dawned on me until reading this post that discussions such as these, to my knowledge, never happen on national television broadcasts or mainstream radio airways. Whether that&#39;s by design by the <em>Powers That Be</em> or due to the general populace never being taught or incentivized to contemplate their realities on this level, I do believe it would be indeed beneficial for all of that to change.</p>

<p>Now, how openly that could be done? I don&#39;t know. Governments historically get frantic when their citizens--in particular, the lower classes-- begin to think constructively, and ESPECIALLY if they can do it without government &quot;assistance&quot;. Therefore, much like with the great esoteric/magick texts of the past, these programs, broadcasts and discussions of higher tier consciousness may have to be heavily coded somehow in order for them to reach the masses in their purest form.</p>

<p>Wonderfully question, koha12.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was really big into the idea of synchronicity when I was younger, but as I get older I realize that synchronicities I encounter with another person&#39;s conciousness can easily be explained by unconcious observations or just bad memory. For example, you&#39;re driving along with someone and you see a sign. The sign makes you start thinking about something related and you go down a chain of thought for a while until you think of something you want to mention to the other person. Surprise, they were thinking of the same exact thing! It&#39;s because you both saw the sign and followed a very easy path of thought while at the same time forgetting that the sign was what made you think of whatever was said in the first place.</p>

<p>Obviously the above example is kind of hard to explain with this, but coincidences do occur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another example: two people both read reddit in their spare time. Something happens that reminds you of a post you read yesterday and you start thinking about it. You make a comment about and it turns out that they just went down the same path of thought, but most people don&#39;t recognize the thing that set them on their current path of thought, so it seems mystical or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you believe that your thoughts change reality? What about your thoughts being a result of something that has to happen? Honestly, all life paths are pre-programmed. Timeline exists only in physical reality. Past, present and future all happen simultaneously. So when you are wishing for something and then get it, it is not necessarily that you influenced reality, it&#39;s the other way around. Your thoughts and your wishes are heavily influenced by the type of person you were pre-designed to be (date of birth, place of birth, name, parents, upbringing, experiences, etc). So technically, those aren&#39;t even your thoughts. Not to mention, at any point you can channel other people&#39;s or entities&#39; thoughts.  </p>

<p>If thoughts could influence reality children wouldn&#39;t get brutally murdered. If thoughts could influence reality sociopaths/people who think about murdering children wouldn&#39;t be wealthy and healthy. The only influence you have over this reality is the pre-designed choices you make within the pre-designed path and your awareness.  </p>
