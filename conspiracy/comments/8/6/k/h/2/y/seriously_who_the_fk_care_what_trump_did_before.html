       Nobody cares if he slept with a porn star, he could be into whipping and ball torture for all I care. What's fun is the character assassination trump constantly does to himself because he makes claims about himself that he continues time and time again prove aren't true.

       He screwed around on his wife thinking he'd get away with it, what'll stop him from screwing around on his voters if he thinks he can get away with it?

       And it's not that he fucked a porn star, it's that he fucked a porn star:

      <p>
       1) While lying to his wife, which is fucked up and shows us he'll betray trust and promises;

      <p>
       2) just after she gave birth, which tells us these betrayals will come when the victim is most vulnerable;
      </p>
      <p>
       3) that he paid $130,000 to cover it up, which suggest he was motivated to hide it, which suggests he's susceptible to blackmail (one of the worst things to have in someone in a sensitive public role);
      </p>
      <p>
       4) that he paid to cover it up in the last weeks of the election seemingly using Trump Org. or campaign resources, which may be a crime;
      </p>
      <p>
       5) that he lied repeatedly to the American people about it.

       I do remember, and I think Democrats should take a hard look at that and be embarrassed by it.  By the way, why is Trump's terrible behavior okay as long as someone else in the past has also been terrible?  Because it sounds like when you see politicians being shitty, instead of thinking "we should have politicians who aren't shitty," you think "now it's time for
       <em>
        my guy
       </em>
       to be shitty!"  That's fucked up.

       Perfect reddit explanations by AnalgesicSonar concerning 45 fucking a pornstar and why it matters:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's this thing where a person's behavior in the past tells us their character and informs us how he'll behave in the future, especially when the "past" is like 18 months ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        And it's not that he fucked a porn star, it's that he fucked a porn star:
       </p>
       <p>
        1) While lying to his wife, which is fucked up and shows us he'll betray trust and promises;
       </p>
       <p>
        2) just after she gave birth, which tells us these betrayals will come even when the victim is most vulnerable;
       </p>
       <p>
        3) that he paid $130,000 to cover it up, which suggest he was motivated to hide it, which suggests he's susceptible to blackmail (one of the worst things to have in someone in a sensitive public role);
       </p>
       <p>
        4) that he paid to cover it up in the last weeks of the election seemingly using Trump Org. or campaign resources, which may be a crime;
       </p>
       <p>
        5) that the deal to cover up seems to be a scam he's run more than once, suggesting a familiarity with this kind of coverup, again a terrible thing to have in our public employees who are supposed to be transparent; and
       </p>
       <p>
        6) that he lied repeatedly to the American people about it, and still hasn't come clean.
       </p>
       <p>
        Democrats should take a hard look at that and be embarrassed by it. By the way, why is Trump's terrible behavior okay as long as someone else in the past has also been terrible?

       Depends who you talk to. Trump will tell you he's a billionaire, but never quite provides the documentation. Estimates by third parties put his wealth
       <em>
        usually
       </em>
       in the billions, but sometimes less. Depends how you treat property valuations, debts, etc.

       The only thing I find disappointing is if you are gonna bang a porn star (which pretty much anyone in America can at the bunny ranch etc) at least make it a hot porn star.  Tiger woods banged a bunch of ugly porn stars too, I don't understand that part.

       LOLOLOLOL.  You think Donald Trump -- who had no problem loudly calling something like two-dozen sex assault accusers liars, who sent a threatening letter to the NY Times -- heard a false and defamatory claim from this woman, and his response was not only to not file a defamation claim, but
       <em>
        pay her
