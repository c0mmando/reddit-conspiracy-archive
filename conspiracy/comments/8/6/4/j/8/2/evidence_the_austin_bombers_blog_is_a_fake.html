        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>*UPDATE - the theory is most likely false due to the fact that there is not a known (legal) way to change the date of your blogger profile, and google indexed the site on March 2, 2018 (19 days ago) so it appears that the blog existed in its current form at least 19 days ago.</p>

<p>TL;DR - There is no evidence of this blogs digital existence prior to March 21, 2018 (today). There is no evidence of <em>any</em> of the other &quot;students&quot; in the class which the blog is claimed to be from. Nor is there evidence of the class titled &quot;American Government&quot; which is referred to in students profiles as having existed at Austin Community College in 2012.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://definingmystance.blogspot.com/">blog in question</a>, is claimed to be the blog of the suspected Austin bomber, titled &quot;Defining My Stance&quot;. </p>

<p>The posts triggered a red flag in my mind. This seemed too much like what I would write if I were a Russian propagandist trying to get the American people divided even further, knowing the hive mind of reddit would eat it up as truth as well as irresponsible media outlets looking to get their &quot;big&quot; story.</p>

<p>Please prove me wrong if you can.</p>

<p>Thanks to a little something called the way back machine, I&#39;ve scoured the posts from the other students as well as the Austin bomber and this blog looks to be some kind of propaganda piece put together on March 20th or the 21st, 2018.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that this blog, nor any of the other student blogs existed prior to March 21st. All dates can be changed/edited in blogger so the dates we see on the posts could have easily been faked.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://definingmystance.blogspot.com/">see for yourself</a> on the internet way back machine that there is no record of his blog at <em>any</em> time besides today, March 21st 2018. <a href="https://imgur.com/M8UYbSo">Here is a screenshot of the way back machine records for that blog</a></p>

<p>Feel free to take a look at all of the other &quot;classmates&quot; blogs. Not one of them has a record of existing prior to today&#39;s date of March 21st 2018.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/coBKgNx">Many blogs for the &quot;class&quot; does not actually exist in blogspot.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/nfXCgmN">Another &quot;student&quot; blog.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/fBl3Ydc">The meta data is scrubbed from the students that have profile pictures.</a> <a href="http://metapicz.com/#landing?imgsrc=https%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-ogNaZlMZCII%2FT39qDY1091I%2FAAAAAAAAACw%2F1UEfb6_itx0%2Fs113%2Fpersonal.jpg">Link to page</a></p>

<p>None of these student profiles exist on the way back machine as far as I can tell.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/5CC9OUL">I tried searching Facebook for some of these students</a>, searching their names filtered around Austin TX with no results.This is obviously inconclusive, since people could have (and probably ) moved in the past 6 years... but it&#39;s just another red flag which contributes to the stack of evidence that this is a fake.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find a single student by their posted name when searching in the Austin Texas area. Not even people with similar names went to Austin Community College. Again inconclusive, but adds to suspected theory.</p>

<p>Another red flag is that none of the students have comments on their posts while this is supposed to be some kind of &quot;discussion&quot; group, nor do they have other blogs.</p>

<p>I would love to register for the Austin Community College Admissions &amp; Records but don&#39;t have time or resources to do that... that&#39;s for real journalists.</p>

<p>We could be witnessing a new methodology from the Russians to spread discontent among US citizens and the world at large. Maybe it is just some malicious individual. Either way, there is no evidence (as of yet) that this is in fact the suspects blog.</p>

<p>Edit 1 - Mother claims bomber graduated high school in 2013, yet this blog is for a course (as stated in multiple bio&#39;s of other students participating in the blog) this is an &quot;American Government&quot; course at the Austin Community College in 2012. So what is a high schooler doing participating in a discussion for a college level course at ACC? Better yet, what are a bunch of college students from the Austin Community College doing in a discussion blog with a high schooler?</p>

<p>Also, the way back machine only captures blogs if someone saves them to wag back machine.  I learned this recently during Parkland shooting.  The reason it wasn’t saved is because nobody manually went in to save his blog until today.  </p>

<p>Around my area it’s called technical middle college or just TMC, which is a program that allows qualifying high school students (not sure on the specifics of what qualifies a student) attend a college instead of high school for the last few years.... </p>

<p>It’s really not that unusual, I had TMC students in my classes at the community college I started at, as well as the university I transferred to..... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly were having a misunderstanding here.</p>

<p>Obviously the students bio&#39;s are claiming they took a course... that was never in dispute.</p>

<p>What is in dispute is the title of the course they took. No course titled &quot;American Government&quot; exists or existed at ACC. There is only &quot;United States Government&quot; which are very different titles. I&#39;ve posted proof of this directly from ACC&#39;s course catalog.</p>

<p>But the only reference to a class you get is &quot;American Government&quot;. Are you suggesting all of these students didn&#39;t know the title of the class they were taking? Does that clarify the point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yep that would do it. If the dates are actual crawl dates from the google search index then it would have existed back then.</p>

<p>If they are however search results based on the page data, then it could still have been faked. I have to find out if those search results dates are from the site data or actual google crawling dates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure myself if page data or crawl date. There is one &quot;Defining my Stance: Why gay marriage should be illegal&quot; that shows on the google search as May 12, but the blog has it as May 11.</p>

<p>Another thing that caught my eye looking at dates is the times posts. On the blog going down the list.</p>

<p>9:52 pm<br/>
10:00 pm<br/>
9:52 pm<br/>
9:55 pm<br/>
9:56 pm<br/>
9:19 pm</p>

<p>All except one were posted within 8 mins of each other. There&#39;s not many posts to go off of, but between the 3 months from first to last, this guy seemed to only make blog posts a certain time. Don&#39;t know what to make of that if anything, just caught my eye like I said.</p>
