<p>Yeah, I feel like SRS or politics would definitely post &quot;things that are against the rules&quot; for subs they don&#39;t like to get them banned.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying, perhaps there weren&#39;t actual weapons being sold illegally...but people who wanted to shut the sub down.  Selling a firearm illegally is a fucking felony...I definitely wouldn&#39;t do that over reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s possuble but seems more likely that the Reddit admins are virtue signaling, trying to avoid any future controversies they can and protect themselves from any legislation that makes them more liable for what their users do. Just my take though. </p>

<p>And I’m sure there are somewhere on Reddit, people seem to have no problem committing all sorts of felonies on Reddit, whether it’s sharing illegal pornography, selling drugs, or illegally selling guns. </p>

For reddit to ban a well moderated sub who removed those posts when they were found...it shows that they wanted them gone...and we all know reddit admins have a heavy anti-gun bias.  Even though &quot;anti-gun&quot; just means the government, the rich, and criminals have guns...not that guns go away.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not accusing them of anything, but there definitely have been comments either implicitly stating or implying that if you PM them they could sell you a firearm. I also browsed the subreddit daily and while it wasn’t common there were definitely comments removed for trying to sell guns, usually with people referring them to other subs that allowed that sort of thing. It wasn’t common and the mods always dealt with it quickly so I don’t think <a href="/r/gundeals">/r/gundeals</a> should’ve been banned. </p>

<p>I wasn’t talking about legal sales, obviously there’s ways to legally ship and sell a firearm from one owner to another, Armslist being one of them. However, it IS illegal to agree to a sale in PM on Reddit and then ship covertly to another user without an FFL involved. Obviously this may not apply to every state as gun laws vary greatly </p>

<p>If you can shirk the legal responsibility as easily as you just have, by saying
Reddit is not intended to be used as a marketplace and takes no responsibility for any transactions individual users might decide to undertake in spite of this.</p>

<p>Why are you bothering to get in the way of some of the communities on here in the first place? Not your responsibility, apparently.</p>

<p>I wish reddit admins would take a much, much more hands off approach. The activities of a subreddit are the responsibility of it&#39;s members and moderators. Reddit admins should just manage the tech stack and tooling.</p>

<p>Edit: before more people armchair lawyer at me, unless you can provide a link to some statute or another clearly stating how a platform is held responsible for the crimes of its users, don&#39;t bother. Secondly, I&#39;m not even of the opinion that the above is a reasonable path. I do know however, that the more hands off a platform, the more legal buffer they have.</p>

<p>But because it was the Internet, the posts were anonymous. So instead, the firm sued Prodigy, the online service that hosted the bulletin board.</p>

<p>Prodigy argued it couldn&#39;t be responsible for a user&#39;s post — like a library, it could not liable for what&#39;s inside its books. Or, in now-familiar terms: It&#39;s a platform, not a publisher.</p>

<p>The court disagreed, but for an unexpected reason: Prodigy moderated posts, cleaning up foul language. And because of that, the court treated Prodigy like a newspaper liable for its articles.</p>

<p>The law states:</p>

<p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.47 U.S. Code § 230</p>

<p>Sauce: <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230</a></p>

<p>The only change to this was last year, when a site was actively engaged in it&#39;s users adult and child sex trafficking, tightening the reigns. Not exactly reddit&#39;s MO.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The SESTA/FOSTA is convienent scape goat. There&#39;s clearly a concerted effort to shut down free speech. Reddit is just starting with easy targets that not many will complain about. First they came for r/fakeids and I didn&#39;t say anything because I&#39;m to old,  then they came for r/dreammarket but I don&#39;t do drugs. You can blame Congress if you want they do suck, but the fact of the matter is Reddit didnt have to shut any of these subs down yet.</p>

<p>Fake news, porn, trade and transactions, politics, ideas, anonymity, finance, creativity, movies, music... think of the children! They&#39;ve stolen it from us. </p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re malleable and receptive to what the state wants you will never be allowed to have a prominent place on the web.  </p>

I really don&#39;t have the time or the interest to not keep it short. The mods of that sub will ban anyone who speaks about kratom in a negative light. A large majority of the kratom fan boys love kratom so much. Cause it gets them high. But then they build a tolerance. But who cares cause that shit gets you so high if you get your right strain.

<p>No, you did though. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit has been overtaken by the SJW&#39;s and soccer moms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the data:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/">About seven-in-ten (71%) of Reddit news users are men, 59% are between the ages of 18 and 29, and 47% identify as liberal, while only 13% are conservative (39% say they are moderate). In comparison, among all U.S. adults, about half (49%) are men, just 22% are 18- to 29-year-olds and about a quarter (24%) say they are liberal.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit is mostly young and male. And less than half identify as liberal, of which SJWs is but one subset. While there is a strong SJW contingent, when I look at <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> I frequently see tumblrinaction, mens rights, kotakuinaction, etc. That&#39;s about as anti-SJW as you can get.</p>

<p>Could it be that you have an extreme conservative bias that colors your perception of what is on reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is only a problem because we allowed the web to become centralized around a few large hubs. It&#39;s not new either, websites banning some types of content based on arbitrary rules is as old as the internet. One could even say it&#39;s not censorship, it&#39;s &quot;moderating your platform&quot;. The problem is that Youtube is so big and monopolistic that removing this content from Youtube effectively means removing it from the internet for a large chunk of the population.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want large monopolies to act as censors then don&#39;t put them in the position to do so. You&#39;re uploading your videos for free on their platforms, sometimes even expecting them to pay you for it. I can&#39;t really see how you can complain if they decide that they don&#39;t want to deal with your content anymore. Find another platform, that&#39;s how the internet is supposed to work.</p>
