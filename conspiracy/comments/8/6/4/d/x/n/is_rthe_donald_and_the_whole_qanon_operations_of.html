<p>The whole Calm Before The Storm sub is what really got me to believe it is an operation paid for by Trump or his surrogates.   The number of users who created their accounts on or around December 20th 2017 is staggering.   I counted one time 10 of the top posts there were posted by users who created accounts on 12/20/2017.</p>

<p>Just curious what this sub thinks. </p>

<p>Q... maybe.</p>

<p>CA Ai has essentially adopted the strategy of &quot;trolling&quot; the ADA AI, which relies on saturation and repetition, which has always worked. </p>

<p>Excessive trolling of the ADA Ai, that has all of the media at its disposal, results in the increasingly obvious dishonesty of the media.</p>

Suddenly half the users supported Trump and the mods all changed over to pro-Trump with a side of long term Redditors until the second and final massive switch up to mostly fresh alt accounts because all the mods were being harassed intensely.

I found a post where someone described what I was talking about where many in the_donald were not originally pro-Trump until they got shit for posting quasi pro-Trump memes, referring to the previous subreddit and community. Wasn&#39;t very important though, must have just a really strong imprint on me because I followed those subs and that community.</p>

<p>The methods are different, but it&#39;s effectively the same. And it&#39;s the same here on /conspiracy/ too. You won&#39;t get banned, but you&#39;ll have your comments downvoted so much that nobody sees them anyway. It&#39;s censorship with plausible deniability.</p>

<p>Just look at any post about politics in this sub. Every hidden comment is one that questions the mainstream narrative. This sub was taken over by &quot;normies&quot; a long time ago, and it&#39;s just getting worse.</p>

<p>I just pointed out, rightfully and factually, that comments going against the mainstream political narratives are regularly voted down to the point they are hidden from view.

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New regime </p>

<p>No again.</p>

<p>There are a ton of subreddit drama articles about each moderator transition, and at least one post on TD that explained each transition. </p>

<p>From my memory, it went like this.</p>

<ol>
<li>X number of moderators before CWM, I&#39;m not sure because I came to TD during CWM&#39;s reign of terror.</li>
<li>Ciswhitemaelstrom who deleted his account after a close call doxx </li>
<li>TrumpGal who didn&#39;t want to be top mod</li>
<li>LilZ (lyin&#39; Z)</li>
</ol>

<p>This caused the great schism which led to the creation of r/Mrs Trump which was moderated by ditario and a bunch of other mods who had been demodded and banned by LilZ and gumbledog (can&#39;t remember if this name is right) on the premise that they had created r/Mr_Trump to compete directly with t_d. Which was an elaborate lie concocted by lilz and gumbledog. More the latter than the former. Lots of fallout and drama from..all that.</p>

<p>That reign ended after the two subs were reunited thanks to some diplomacy by viking83, and possibly some shady underhanded dealings.</p>

<p>Lilz and gumbledog were ousted during the PAC BS. That is a whole story by itself. Possibly involved more drama caused by CWM</p>

<ol>
<li>Viking took over after that. </li>
<li>Then ohsnapyougotserved which lasted through the election and the inauguration.</li>
<li>Princecamelton was top after ohsnapyougotserved disappeared thanks to some internal drama I wasn&#39;t present for. </li>
<li>Shadowman3001 inherited in the most peaceful transition to date. Currently top mod. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is not a complete history, may not all be accurate as I was doing this all from memory. My access to some info was limited because I didn&#39;t become a mod till ohsnapyougotserved was top mod.</p>

<p>Discord doesn&#39;t give the marching orders, discord is used by the community and moderators as a live feed and chat forum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s really not a subreddit like that anymore. This is probably honestly the closest thing to that. And idk where you live but just for some perspective from someone on the right, t_d is more along the mainstream views of the right and Trump&#39;s base than Late Stage Capitalism is to the left. It&#39;s really pretty &quot;mainstream right&quot; if that&#39;s a thing whereas late stage capitalism appears to me to be very far left. </p>

<p>Or were you only comparing the echo chamber factor? I could agree on that but there&#39;s not much alternative and it&#39;s pretty upfront about it being so. There&#39;s nothing necessarily wrong with having a forum of like minded people for discuss things with as long as it&#39;s open about beings such. </p>

<p>Not true. Most T_Ders are pro Israel cuckservatives. If the JIDF mods fucked off, the /pol/ type people there would <em>eventually</em> get the cuckservatives to see things their way easily. But the mods ban anyone who speaks the truth about Israel. </p>

<p>That&#39;s basically the modus operandi of this sub. And Q is stupid because it&#39;s an entirely anonymous source writing a bunch of fairy tales which has obvious schizms from observable reality, unless your reality functions like a mediocre spy flick for teens. Though the idea of Trump being some kind of covert operations and military genius leading some intricate counter coup against (((the deep state))) is hilarious, it has little basis in reality.</p>

<p>Second, the emotional ones are the Q worshippers. They’ve built themselves an alternate-reality that reads like alt-right fanfiction. The guy rattles off literal nonsense and his fans grasp at the loosest straws they can to “verify” the information. If one (random, unrelated to a “prediction”) word that Q said shows up on any Trump / US government affiliated tweet, its all “OMG Q confirmed!!”</p>

<p>Nevermind the fact that none of it has actually come true. Arent all of Trump’s enemies supposed to be in gitmo according to this guy?? Hats off to him, honestly. Its probably been extremely entertaining from his perspective.</p>

<p>Clearly. The real story of Trump&#39;s campaign would be incredible to hear: who was enough of a genius to be able to exploit those cultural conditions to get Trump in? Why did they want him? It&#39;s obvious Trump wasn&#39;t behind the scenes scheming to get the more shadowy parts of internet culture on his side. Who was? God, it&#39;s so interesting.</p>

<p>He only won the primaries because the corporate media gave him billions in free advertising, far and away more than any other candidate. He only won the general because his opponent was a nearly universally hated criminal who rigged the primaries. Trump didn&#39;t run an amazing campaign worthy of special notice, the corporate media propped him for ratings and to give Clinton a better chance of winning the general (the &quot;pied piper&quot; strategy), and then he won by virtue of the fact that his opponent is a corrupt shitbag that no one actually likes. And he barely won too, that corrupt shitbag actually got more votes than he did. If his campaign was that great, why couldn&#39;t he get more votes than her? It&#39;s not like his people &quot;exploited&quot; the system to his benefit, it&#39;s more that the system tried to exploit him as controlled opposition to force us to choose Clinton and Trump won due to that strategy failing. It&#39;s not so much that Trump won as much as it is that Clinton lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump himself paid a guy 1 million dollars to spend a year listening to AM radio, watching fox, and combing the internet to get a pulse of the so-called silent majority. He then did what he has always been good at, he A-B tested it. </p>

<p>I personally think that the comparisons people make between Hitler and him are not only absurd but very damaging in unintentional ways, <em>however</em> there is one way that a comparison between them is incredibly apt. They both have a near-paranormal ability to read and interact with a crowd. So Trump takes these germs of ideas he thinks might stick and then he takes that show on the road with his iPhone and his gold-lined 757. That’s how he got elected folks, it’s no big mystery. Even the leaked texts from manaforts daughter have her admitting the campaign manager himself is just a facade, that it’s Trump running the show.</p>

<p>People all over are desperate for something extraordinary to reconcile their cognitive dissonance. Russia, Cambridge Analytica, mass stupidity etc.
Yeah, there were many balls in play but keep in mind we’re looking for the extraordinary here. CA is sly but nothing new and nothing that wasn’t used in a nearly similar way by the opposition. The real insane move here that resulted in Trumps election was the ability to put that sort of thing on the back burner and just throw caution to the wind. Not even Trumps people wanted him running his campaign the way he did. He made a gut call and it paid off.</p>

<p>This has been going on since the creation of facebook.</p>

<p>The whole CA thing is going to blow up in the medias face.  The republicans and democrats have been using facebook and even myspace back in the day for propaganda since they were created. 
 Myspace died because of the obvious propaganda in my opinion...
Facebook is headed the same way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think t_d was taken over by the opposition to mislead vulnerable people as to have a thing to point at in easy attacks. It then bends middle ground people to oppose anything from that area. We saw this in Rwanda with the opposition dressing as their enemy to insure their own group to attack people. We saw this in the American manifest destiny, South Africa&#39;s apartheid and Israels operation recreating david s kingdom.</p>

<p>Q seems to be something else. Worse case Q is a pacifier to keep the weaponized autists busy instead of going after the swamp that Trump is surrounding himself with. </p>

<p>Best case around Q is the anon generally wants unity in the country and wants people to get up and involved in the streets against the corroding influence of the deep state as Q can not do it alone nor can the current administration. Q is bucking the system, but there is a clear direction Q wants it bucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because we are discussing an aspect of GOP/Conservative election operations and intentionally not talking about what the DNC/Neoliberal side is doing does not mean anything other than people are trying to stay on point.</p>

<p>There is nothing nefarious about focusing a discussion on what one side is doing without including what the other side is doing every time.</p>

<p>No one is trying to justify what CA is doing here, just trying to examine and explore without trying to justify anything or muddy the waters to make it harder to focus on the issue at hand.</p>

<p>Clearly. The real story of Trump&#39;s campaign would be incredible to hear: who was enough of a genius to be able to exploit those cultural conditions to get Trump in? Why did they want him? It&#39;s obvious Trump wasn&#39;t behind the scenes scheming to get the more shadowy parts of internet culture on his side. Who was? God, it&#39;s so interesting.</p>
