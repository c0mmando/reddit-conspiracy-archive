<p>If the Flat Earth theories are being pushed as a government psyop, where are the paid/government shills upvoting all the pro-FE comments? Why is it that FE posts don&#39;t have thousands of upvotes with multiple posts per day dominating the front page? That&#39;s what a psyop looks like. </p>

<p>Yet every thread that mentions FE gets downvoted to hell and any comments within those threads that are critical of FE sit at +10 or more upvotes while the proponents are at -3 or less. How is that a psyop? </p>

<p>If anything, this should tell you that saying &quot;it&#39;s a psyop&quot; is the real psyop. Every Flat Earth shill should be in here and my post should be sitting at more than +50. Monsanto shills and pro-government shills are on some of our posts like flies on dogshit. Where are the FE shills? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a Chinese govt psyop, not a US govt psyop.  The purpose is to divide the truth seeker community against itself, so using shills doesn&#39;t serve the goal.  In other words, they don&#39;t really want everybody to be convinced, they are seeking something more like the current situation in which the FE dupes believe they are oppressed truth seekers.  They also know that some of us will never accept it regardless of popularity, because it&#39;s easily disproven by people with math skills and truth seekers aren&#39;t swayed by popularity, anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But from the standpoint of whatever government agency is trying to propagate it as a psyop, would they achieve their goals if everyone making videos about it is dumb? How would you convince a smart person to believe it when using a dumb person to propagate it? That makes zero sense.

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;organic,&quot; I would say, &quot;due to brainwashing,&quot; and I mean that literally.  The recent upsurge was driven by  Eric Dubay&#39;s &quot;200 proofs&quot; video on YouTube.  Please watch that video with the sound turned off.  At 0:09, Dubay is putting forward the lie that a globe earth should appear to have a curved horizon, so-called &quot;proof&quot; #1 of the flat earth.  This is totally wrong, the horizon should appear level on a round earth.</p>

<p>But notice, with the sound off, that at 0:09 timestamp, the video shows an image of the horizon spinning.  The ground is dark and the sky is light.  This spinning image reminds us off the hypnotic jokes &quot;you are getting&quot; sleepy that we see in cartoons.  That&#39;s because such a spinning dark/light image causes rhythmic firing of neurons in the visual cortex layers at the back of the brain.  Having someone watch that spinning image causes a rhythmic electrical brain wave that affects the entire cortex of the brain.  When the sound is on, the viewer is hearing speech that is very rapid, and synchronized with the spinning.  By the way, this brainwashing technique is called &quot;neural entrainment.&quot;</p>

<p>So the movement was literally driven by exposing people to sophisticated brainwashing techniques based on medical science and techniques researched mostly by intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>The entire video is packed with such sophisticated brainwashing techniques.</p>

<p>I believe the laypeople spreading FE are extremely convinced because they are the victims of advanced scientific brainwashing methods.  It&#39;s not &quot;organic&quot; at all.  It&#39;s more akin to MKULTRA/Monarch programming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth is not a psyop. I believe any psyop associated with FE is the disinformation spread within the community itself that makes it really easy to discredit. E.G., a large FE proponent states that &quot;gravity&quot; is due to the plane accelerating upwards, when in reality, most FE persons don&#39;t believe that. </p>

<p>If the globe model is indeed fake (not saying it is) it shakes the very foundation of our existence and would prove that the government extensively lies to us. I don&#39;t see any psyop pushing that sort of mindset. </p>

<p>I am very open minded and watched a couple FE videos as a farce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3H7Brj5NiE">&quot;Ball&#39;s out Physics&quot;</a>, and it was truly eye opening. In no way would I call myself a flat earther, but what Brain puts forth is at least worth watching for yourself.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Brian Mullen is supposedly missing and there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M4tR_OajXY">videos</a> on youtube trying to make sure he is alive. There are also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJfSmaAXNdM">videos</a> popping up of a dude who looks exactly like him (and who&#39;s content is no where near as intelligent and pushes a religious angle) which is really troubling to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said. I&#39;m just mentioning that if you search up &quot;flat earth&quot; on this sub, you&#39;ll find mostly posts saying it&#39;s a psyop by the government to discredit theorists in the eyes of the general public. If it was truly a psyop, that wouldn&#39;t be the case. If it was a psyop, most of the posts would be pushing it as fact AND they would be highly upvoted. This is not what is observed, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to preface this with I do not think the Earth is flat, but I like to entertain the theory. So calm down before you reply to me.</p>

<p>If the Earth was flat, then it means that much of science we are taught could be a lie. For example, did you know there is a prominent science who suggests gravity might not be real?</p>

<p><a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/science/13gravity.html">http://mobile.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/science/13gravity.html</a></p>

<p>So the problem is that flat earthers I always trying to argue scientifically, but they will not win if aspects of science are lies themselves. Not saying they are...just a thought.</p>

<p>So I think the spiritual arguments for flat earth are more profound. This is all just to entertain our thoughts...</p>

<p>Part 1:</p>

<p>1) It is possible the earth is flat.
2) Space may be real but only manifested interdimensionally.
3) Space and space travel is rooted in occultism.</p>

<p>The biggest evidence that space is not what we think it is is the bible itself. You are familiar with the tower of Babel. The original derivation of the name Babel(also the Hebrew name for Babylon) is uncertain, but it may come from bab-ilum, meaning &quot;gate of God.&quot; According to the Bible, the city received the name &quot;Babel&quot; from the Hebrew word balal, meaning to jumble or to confuse. Clearly, God stopped people from entering this &quot;gate of God.&quot; Is this what is happening today? Nothing is new under the sun.</p>

<p>Today there is a belief that technology or some type of ascension or new age oneness will deliver us into God&#39;s territory, essentially by making us Gods.</p>

<p>Did you know Satan is called the prince of air, too?</p>

<p> <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm</a></p>

<p>He is able to control and deceive us through the air and &quot;space&quot;...the physical world we see.</p>

<p>Further, astral mean stars. Many can access the &quot;astral&quot; realm where the stars are located. Further, one can access these realms (dimensions) through drugs or other mind altering experiences. (Still working on this). It is interesting to note that planet in the bible actually translates as &quot;wandering star.&quot;</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.bibleandscience.com/bible/books/genesis/genesis1_wanderingstars.htm">https://www.bibleandscience.com/bible/books/genesis/genesis1_wanderingstars.htm</a></p>

<p>The idea of going to space and visiting other worlds has created a false God in a sense - other realities people can worship and escape to while denying the real creator.</p>

<p>Further, if the Earth is flat and there is a firmament, then there would be no such thing as outerspace (at least nothing we can access through a space ship). The entire concept of popular occult movies like Interstellar and a Space Odyssey 2001 is space travel interdimensionally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eric Verlinde has put forward an eloquent theory that explains the origin of gravity as an anthropic holographic force.  When he says that he believes gravity doesn&#39;t exist, he means that what we call gravity isn&#39;t what we think of as gravity.  He does not mean that masses don&#39;t behave as if they attract each other.  His theory explains why masses behave as if they attract each other in terms of the origin of that behavior being a property of the way the universe manifests matter.</p>

<p>He does not mean that the gravitational field equations are inaccurate descriptions of the way matter behaves.  His model produces the same equations as a side effect of the entropic holographic force, and that the gravitational field equations do not define a force, but do describe the real behavior of matter due to a more fundamental force than what we think of as &quot;gravity.&quot;</p>

<p>You have to understand his paper on entropic holographic mass in order to understand what he means when he says gravity &quot;doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, do buy into it.  Verlinde&#39;s derivation is mathematically sound, and it&#39;s worthwhile to fully understand it.  With regard to the layman, what we understand about gravity is practically all a layperson needs to know.  Under Verlinde&#39;s refinement,  everything still behaves the same way we previously understood, just for different reasons than we previously understood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you are saying. Thanks! And I mean Im not buying into all of science is a huge lie (which is the stance of many flat earthers).</p>

<p>I am saying though is when I see flat earth debates, if the flat earth was actually real, then aspects of science as we know it would have to be a lie or misconstrued to fit a globe earth. </p>

<p>So a flat earther is really screwed in that sense.</p>

<p>If I am not making sense let me know.</p>

<p>However, I think the spiritual arguments that I have heard for flat earth are intriguing if nothing else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I mean when I write that you can&#39;t understand what that quote really means unless you understand his paper on the entropic holographic force.  For all practical purposes, the old understanding of gravity hasn&#39;t changed.  Matter still attracts other matter in proportion to their combined mass.  Verlinde&#39;s result explains why this is so, and that the cause isn&#39;t a gravitational force intrinsic to matter, but a holographic entropic force that causes matter to behave exactly the same way the old theory predicted.</p>

<p>Prior to Verlinde, nobody could explain why the inertial mass of matter is the same as the gravitational mass.  Now, we know why, and the reason is that the motion of matter interacts with the same holographic entropy as the gravity of matter.</p>

<p>I understand what he means when he says that gravity doesn&#39;t exist, and it does not mean that matter behaves any differently under his theory than under the previous theory.  What he has done is reveal the explanation of why that all happens.</p>

<p>Eventually, someone will explain why the entropic force exists.  Because he posits a thermodynamic entropic force, his own model means there are thermodynamic microstates.  In his own paper, he makes it clear that he is not explaining what those microstates are.</p>

<p>A thermodynamic model, also called a statistical physics model, always involves microstates.  In conventional, heat-explaining thermodynamics, the microstates are the vibrational and rotational degrees of molecules.  Water has a higher specific heat than CO2 because H2O is a bent molecule and CO2 is a linear molecule, this gives water an additional degree of rotational freedom than CO2 and we can calculate the difference in specific heat.</p>

<p>I want to make clear here that thermodynamics was invented to explain heat transfer, but it turns out that the same kind of physics, properly now called statistical physics, explains other, non-heat related behaviors of what are called population ensembles.  A glass of water is a population ensembles of trillion trillions of water molecules, each of which has around half a dozen degrees of freedom.  Physicists routinely call something &quot;thermodynamic&quot; whenever it&#39;s a population ensemble of microstates.  It would be more proper to always call those models &quot;statistical physics models&quot; when not dealing with heat, but everybody in the intended audience uses those terms interchangeably for non-heat theories.</p>

<p>Verlinde has put forward a statistical physics model of a holographic universe, but his own paper acknowledges that he isn&#39;t specifying what the microstates are.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that Haramein is on the right track when he defines the population as an ensemble of Planck spherical units, but he also has not explained what the degrees of freedom of the PSU microstates are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do get what you are saying. It is a different take on gravity.</p>

<p>With that being said, the original point I was making is that if a person truly believes in flat earth, they would have to dismiss some modern day science for it to work.</p>

<p>They could not argue the flat earth model with science as we understand it.</p>

<p>So in a flat earther&#39;s view, either the science we are told is right or a flat out lie. Many seem to think it is a lie.</p>

<p>Others try to argue flat earth with science for a globe model. It is not going to work.</p>

<p>Finally, I appreciate your expansion on gravity. : )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there are a bunch of logical contradictions in the Bible, but personally, I think it is due to manipulation and conspiracy to hide the truth by the Jesuits or whoever. Not to mention, you are likely basing your judgment on a comparison that involves a modern view of the cosmos, which according to this whole FE theory, is bullshit to begin with. I don&#39;t consider myself a Christian but I definitely can say I no longer consider myself an atheist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal view is that the supernatural stories in the Bible were just that: stories, and that people two-thousand-plus years ago were doing their best to figure out how things worked, just like we are. We happen to have the advantage of all those extra centuries of hindsight and experimentation.</p>

<p>And if we&#39;re agreeing that there are contradictions and absurdities in the Bible, that it isn&#39;t inerrant for whatever reason (you say conspiracy to hide the truth, I say inevitable errors in a large anthology written by many men who didn&#39;t know better) it really doesn&#39;t make sense to me to hold it up as &quot;evidence&quot; for a claim that goes against modern science.</p>

<p>I find it a prime example of cognitive dissonance to make use of a hundred different amazing technologies we take for granted every day as a result of centuries of gradual scientific progress, while simultaneously claiming that the world&#39;s scientists (especially astronomers and physicists) and astronauts and pilots and ship captains and anyone else whose job relies on long distance navigating <em>are all liars</em> and everything we&#39;re taught about gravity, tides, the seasons, how the stars appear to rotate at the poles, how some parts of the sky are only visible in one hemisphere or the other, the size and distance of the Sun and Moon from Earth, how stars for and how their nuclear fusion works etc. almost ad infinitum <em>are all a deliberate deception</em> even though the research and mathematics that led to most of these conclusions is out there for anyone to test for themselves.</p>

<p>[Phew, that may be a record for run-on sentences.]</p>

<p>I realize this is r/conspiracy and believing in the plausibility of conspiracies is kind of a prerequisite, but this one in particular just doesn&#39;t stand up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>I think some of the FE proponents are obviously trolls having a laugh at others&#39; expense, but I also think a lot of the true believers are people skeptical of gov&#39;t [often rightly so, don&#39;t get me wrong... politics is full of crooks] who end up throwing the baby out with the bathwater, dismissing <em>anything</em> they&#39;re taught by perceived mainstream authority figures. Then someone like Eric Dubay can bamboozle them with a long list of &#39;sciencey&#39;-sounding claims that simply aren&#39;t true.</p>

<p>Is it your experience that the FEers you know tend to be Christians or Muslims? I have been getting that impression from this subreddit. I can understand choosing to believe the Earth is flat when there are verses in the scriptures that say or imply it, but I also find it fascinating that these same people seem to want to limit the power of their omniscient and omnipotent deity by saying things like &quot;space is fake&quot; and that the only thing there is in all the universe is the flat Earth under a glass dome with the sky projected on it.</p>

<p>Forgive me if this was a bit long-winded, but I&#39;ve been reading a lot of FE posts lately and this post is kind of a summary of my feelings on the whole topic, at least as of this writing...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So most conspiracy theorists believe the moon landing was faked.</p>

<p>Well if it was...then why?</p>

<p>The answer could be that we cannot actually get to the moon but they want people to believe that it is possible.</p>

<p>Look at all the posts on the top of Reddit after Stephen Hawking passed. We need to leave Earth is the theme.</p>

<p>But according to the bible, that is not the answer. We will have to face the consequences of what we have done in this world. We cannot escape.</p>

<p>Again, this is all just a theory. I honestly have no idea at the end of the day. </p>

It is totally different though when a group of people believes the earth is flat and that they are following god&#39;s word despite it being written long after his suspected presence, by multiple people and translated from multiple languages multiple times.  your terms for good and evil are relative.  Is a person good or evil if they cure cancer and give the drug away for free but molest children at the same time?    I think if they had a conspiracy with some evidence and a plausible premise it wouldn&#39;t be ridiculed.  However, yes plenty of the time I come here to get my laughs from theists and flat earthers.</p>

You are a pretty small-minded thinker if you think believing in a supreme intelligence designed and created all of us is akin to Santa Claus and fairy tales.

    <div class="md"><p>Barantos, this is a bunch of delusional nonsense you are talking about. There have always been atheists. There have always been people who openly called themselves atheists. There is no grand history-long genocide against atheists, this is one of the atheist delusions. Similar to their other delusions that groups of atheists have never committed genocide. Imperialist Japan slaughtering and raping 200k Chinese and raping 3 year old girls and forcing parents to rape their children at gun point shows otherwise, as does the cultural revolution and gulags. </p>

<p>Some people are not so stupid that they fail to realize that the Bible and the Torah are mathematical texts and that they use collisions of metaphors and symbolic numbering systems and many other sophisticated literary devices, such as symbolic hyperbole, and that this is the way people used to communicate long ago. Not everyone is deluded into thinking that everyone in all of human history until about 2008 was a huge fucking retard with drool coming out of their mouths. There is a reason why many did not want things about God to be written down on paper. It was not because of some superstitious fear, it was a very real and logical fear based on empirical experience and wisdom towards analyzing the future. They knew that the concepts they were talking about were far too sophisticated and that it is dangerous to have it in writing because they knew how easily it is for things to be misinterpreted on paper. Whenever they would communicate these things it was originally all face to face so that if there was any confusion at all that they could fix the misunderstanding right then, and could use charisma and emotion to convey extremely convoluted constructs in a way that could be infused with life rather than bloated with meaning. Obviously the Bible that most people think of, the version in English, is extremely off the mark. Hebrew and Aramaic were both much more complex and mathematically based languages. </p>

<p>This is not comparable to the flying spaghetti monster. Anyone who tries to make that comparison is so fucking brain dead that they are already dead and don&#39;t even realize it. </p>

<p>By the way, the Bible is meant to be taken literally. ACTUALLY literally. Most people these days think that literal means corporeal. To read something literally means to painstakingly derive the most true and accurate meaning from a source based on the framework of literature analysis. For example, the word tiramisu literally means &quot;to rise up.&quot; The word &quot;circumstances&quot; literally means &quot;outskirts.&quot; The term human being literally means &quot;a vital unit that is a soul.&quot; </p>

<p>You have no idea what a straw man is, by the way. I never even referred to what your argument was... lol. Throughout human history, virtually all humans who have ever reached the pinnacles of human potential have been Theist.</p>

<p>By the way, you can actually read what these revolutionary scientists and artists and musicians said about God. You can see for yourself that it was something constantly on their mind and wasn&#39;t some abstract concept that they said they believed in just for lip service. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at some quotes from Max Planck, the father of modern physics. </p>

<p>“Religion represents a bond of man to God. It consists in reverent awe before a supernatural Might [Macht], to which human life is subordinated and which has in its power our welfare and misery. To remain in permanent contact with this Might and keep it all the time inclined to oneself, is the unending effort and the highest goal of the believing man. Because only in such a way can one feel himself safe before expected and unexpected dangers, which threaten one in his life, and can take part in the highest happiness – inner psychical peace – which can be attained only by means of strong bond to God and unconditional trust to His omnipotence and willingness to help.” (Max Planck 1958)</p>

<p>“That God existed before there were human beings on Earth, that He holds the entire world, believers and non-believers, in His omnipotent hand for eternity, and that He will remain enthroned on a level inaccessible to human comprehension long after the Earth and everything that is on it has gone to ruins; those who profess this faith and who, inspired by it, in veneration and complete confidence, feel secure from the dangers of life under protection of the Almighty, only those may number themselves among the truly religious.” (Planck, as cited in Staguhn 1992, 152).</p>

<p>“There can never be any real opposition between religion and science; for the one is the complement of the other. Every serious and reflective person realizes, I think, that the religious element in his nature must be recognized and cultivated if all the powers of the human soul are to act together in perfect balance and harmony. And indeed it was not by accident that the greatest thinkers of all ages were deeply religious souls.” (Planck 1977, 168).</p>

<p>Yeah, this doesn&#39;t seem to be some guy who just says lip service to not be slaughtered by some mysterious millennia-long genocide that has no evidence supporting it. </p>

<p>And this is merely one example out of thousands. Science is more aptly called &quot;Theistic Discovery of the Cosmos.&quot; </p>

<p>Perhaps you are a concaver, in fact maybe we invented that term right now in human history!</p>

<p>Some points that I have;</p>

<p>As a surveyor we have to take into account the curvature of the earth, grid versus ground, utm blah blah.</p>

<p>Flat earth peeps would have to have every single amateur rocket enthusiast in their grasps, as well as every single human being who has ever taken a round the world airline trip.</p>

<p>And if flat earthers are a real deal, why has none had the ambition to see what’s on the edge? Where’s the sense of exploration!</p>

<p>If a man can walk around the earth, and many have, does that not disprove this theory?</p>

<p>That’s not to say that we have to believe every single thing that nasa and other space agency’s says, we are in a conspiracy sub after all, but really? </p>

<p>There’s way better conspiracies than flat earth, this really  does seem like it’s a way to discredit anyone who believes anything else than the official norms.  Prove me wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Op, I’m one of those who have travelled around the world, never had to stop on one end of the earth and travel back to the other side to continue my journey.  I’m still not sure if your trolling me or if it is your honest belief that the world is flat and no one yet in your movement has had the energy to find out for sure.  </p>

<p>In regards to watching a ship go out far, I can’t honestly say  I’ve watched them disappear around the curve, but I think that’s far more plausible for international trade than falling off the edge of a flat earth. </p>

<p>Seriously though, are you an honest believer that we live on a flat earth or are you trolling? I try to be respectful, and by no means do I wish to portray a better than thou persona.  </p>

<p>gravity!  9.8 meters per meter squared aka acceleration due to gravity im fine with. Gravitational constant, aka the big G,  6.67408 x 10 <sup>-11</sup> m ^ 3 / kg s ^ 2 is my issue.  it&#39;s long story bud. i don&#39;t even know where to start. Cavendish?  Michelson Morly?

<p>Because you&#39;re looking at the fucking wiki page. You said something about doing research?  yet all you do is read wiki! Thats how children do book reports! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp</a></p>

<p><strong><em>5. Each Contracting Party shall, at the time when the present Treaty enters into force for it, inform the other Contracting Parties, and thereafter shall give them notice in advance, of

<p>That means you can&#39;t just willy nilly buy an ice breaker and head south! You have to tell them what you&#39;re doing, how long, why, where, with whom?, etc etc and get approval. </p>

<p>Your retarded co-workers went to a hand full of touring companies who take people to antarctic. All are owned by the same company. they will drop you off at the peninsula. You take pictures of penguins. take your money and take you home. That way you can tell people you went to Antarctica so you can impress your shitty friends because you&#39;re so empty inside. That is NOT equal to going on an expedition w/o permission.  sorry chief. </p>

<p>So lets look at what you cited in your above comment</p>

<p>Article XII section 5, subsection (a)</p>

<p>Oh... There is no section 5 under article XII which is &quot;[review of Treaty possible after 30 years]&quot;</p>

<p>So Ill take a look at Article VII since thats probably what you meant. </p>

<p>So whats the issue with having to tell the UN youre going to Antarctica? How is that an obstacle?</p>

<p>Is that the point at which you were denied?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That means you can&#39;t just willy nilly buy an ice breaker and head south! You have to tell them what you&#39;re doing, how long, why, where, with whom?, etc etc and get approval.</p>

<p>No because your argument is retarded. </p>

<p>What the fuck do you need an icebreaker for? Do... do you think thats the only way to get there lol? </p>

<p>Thats whats holding you back? An icebreaker lol?</p>

<p>IS that the point where you got rejected? </p>

<p>Hey sorry guy you cant go antarctica unless you have an icebreaker lol</p>

<p>This is funny as fuck. Youre so deluded and lazy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is NOT equal to going on an expedition w/o permission. sorry chief.</p>

<p>Ohhh so when you say you cant go to antarctica you were lying? </p>

<p>So Ill ask one more time since youre so fucking dense you cant put two and two together. </p>

<p>SINCE YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THE APPLICATION PROCESS WHY DONT YOU TELL ME HOW YOURS WENT??</p>

<p>Since we are doing caps lock now. I Can tell youre serious because you clicked a button. </p>

<p>Seriously though its clear you havent dont anything to verify this and instead just parrot other people. </p>

<p>For anything on a larger scale, land surveyors will ditch their total stations and other equipment and solely rely on satellites/GPS to give coordinates. They&#39;re essentially using Google Earth, which we all know is presented as a globe.</p>

<p>None of this proves the globe Earth, but it does prove how easily people can be fooled into accepting false proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply!  I must say, that it is false to say that areas under 100 x 100 miles curvature is negligible in regards to surveying.  In fact, grid coordinates (gps derived) always have a scale factor attached to it.  For example, I can use my utm (gps) coordinates to give myself a starting point, but then I must create a localized site with a scale factor of 1 in order to lay out any survey coordinates, such as bolts, foundations, etcetera.  We have to otherwise it won’t match a steel tape over distances where we try to make things fit with mm precision. Even over 100 metres there is a noticeable difference between grid and ground coordinates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll quickly adress those points, because you seem genuine:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#39;ve already anwsered the surveying thing. I personally know some surveyors (first hand knowledge), and the previous reply I wrote is factually correct. Curvature never gets taken into acount, nor is it ever measured. The few times it is (on scale larger than 100 miles or whatever the benchmark is), it&#39;s <strong>solely because satellites feed you the information</strong>, based on the globe model.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve watched numerous rocket launches, dare I say just about every rocket launch that&#39;s publically available. They don&#39;t prove anything, we <strong>can</strong> shoot rockets up, rockets exist, I&#39;m not disputing that. 
Look at the recent Falcon launch with the Tesla Roadster. We have Elon Musk himself saying it&#39;s real <strong>because it looks so fake</strong>. There is some merit to the arguement the lack of an atmosphere creates a different color palette than we&#39;re used to, but that&#39;s still a really shitty excuse.</p></li>
<li><p>Antarctica is at the edge. You can&#39;t freely go there, Antarctic Treaty and all that. You can <strong>either</strong>:
Fork up 10,000+ dollars to go on a cruiseships which takes you to some peninsula with pinguins. You get to walk around for some hours and then go back to your cruiseship. (10,000 dollars well spend if u ask me...)
OR u can contact your government to ask for permission to have an expedition, which will have to be approved by the UN. Unless you&#39;re working for a university (which are tools of propaganda because they&#39;ve built this house of science), you&#39;re not going to be allowed to go to Antarctica.</p></li>
<li><p>We can run in circles arund the Earth. Look at a flat Earth map (I guess you&#39;re familiar with the AE map, it&#39;ll do): you can easily circumnavigate the Earth using the oceans.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, not everything space agencies say has to be a lie, per se. But they <strong>have</strong> lied in the past, beyond a shadow of a doubt. They&#39;ve lied numerous times, on record, the astronauts, the scientists, etc. So the point to take away is that we can&#39;t trust our space agencies, especially not when we&#39;re going to hinge our entire cosmology based on their claims.</p></li>
<li><p>There is deeper conspiracies than Flat Earth, I agree. But the <strong>globe deception</strong> is very real, it&#39;s on of their (TPTB) biggest deceptions.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate this response as well!</p>

<p>Having watched numerous rocket launches going up, have you seen evidence of a flat earth? I’m not sure if there have been any cameras behind tempered glass to show start to finish of a launch that shows a round earth, but I would assume someone did it at some point?</p>

<p>Why would Antarctica be the only landmass evidence of a flat earth?  Should there not be multitudes of places on the edge of a flat earth?  That said, haven’t looked at flat earth maps, maybe I will after posting this comment. Seems strange though to just say Antarctica.  Not saying that there’s likely some weird shit down there, just that potentially it’s lazy to say Antarctica alone is evidence. What flat earth map do you recommend?  I feel that if I just google it there won’t be one consensus.</p>

<p>And I think space agencies have definitely had the potential to lie about certain things, such a restricted atmosphere,  that’s why Elon musk probably excites so many people in different ways, private enterprise.  So I’m not saying space agencies are totally honest, but I think it’s way harder to fake a round earth than say the earth is flat.  I just don’t see the purpose in it.</p>

<p>Fair enough, just pointing out there are examples of curvature with non wide angle lenses. </p>

<p>Here is an interesting link on how to de-fisheye images and you can still observe curvature when applying it to high altitude images. </p>

The link you shared asserts the notion that correcting for a wide angle lens reveals that there still remains curvature, even after the lens correction technique.

Not to mention, the author even asserts that you can&#39;t know for sure without knowing more specific information about the precise location in space in which the picture was taken. That being said, you can show all the corrected footage you want, but if one video shows a straight horizon bisecting the field of view of the camera above 50k feet and it&#39;s straight all the way across, then that is something you have to explain away, or else it completely shuts your theory down. Sending any kind of balloon up that high should always show curvature, whether the camera is using a fish eye lens or not.

</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough but this is at the very least part of the process to test this. One application in particular this is useful is footage from space or the ISS, or any video with another object in it that has a straight line. </p>

<p>So for example if we are looking at an image of the Earth from the ISS and we can see wide angle distortion but there is a solar panel in frame we can correct the image by using the solar panel, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That being said, you can show all the corrected footage you want, but if one video shows a straight horizon bisecting the field of view of the camera above 50k feet and it&#39;s straight all the way across, then that is something you have to explain away, or else it completely shuts your theory down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, is that what the hang up is? </p>

<p>Here, field of view is important (Again humans have wide angle vision) </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/OspaPIR">https://imgur.com/OspaPIR</a></p>

<p>Observe the above image, or the images I presented the other day from the 40&#39;s. </p>

<p>Another variable to keep in mind is how is the cloud cover? How can you tell the horizon is flat if its obscured?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So how do you account for cameras that don&#39;t use a fish eye lens and don&#39;t show any curvature?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason you keep ignoring the video I linked that used a non wide angle lens and there was curvature visible. </p>

<p>Why do you not address that and why do you refuse to accept that it shows curvature?</p>

However, in the bottom image that shows the full view, the video description indicates a height of 100k feet. Is there any way to confirm mathematically that the amount of curvature shown in the bottom pic matches the expected amount of curvature for an observation made 100k ft above a sphere the size of the earth? </p>

Is there any way to confirm mathematically that the amount of curvature shown in the bottom pic matches the expected amount of curvature for an observation made 100k ft above a sphere the size of the earth? </p>

<p>Having watched numerous rocket launches going up, have you seen evidence of a flat earth? I’m not sure if there have been any cameras behind tempered glass to show start to finish of a launch that shows a round earth, but I would assume someone did it at some point?</p>

<p>Why would Antarctica be the only landmass evidence of a flat earth?  Should there not be multitudes of places on the edge of a flat earth?  That said, haven’t looked at flat earth maps, maybe I will after posting this comment. Seems strange though to just say Antarctica.  Not saying that there’s likely some weird shit down there, just that potentially it’s lazy to say Antarctica alone is evidence. What flat earth map do you recommend?  I feel that if I just google it there won’t be one consensus.</p>

<p>And I think space agencies have definitely had the potential to lie about certain things, such a restricted atmosphere,  that’s why Elon musk probably excites so many people in different ways, private enterprise.  So I’m not saying space agencies are totally honest, but I think it’s way harder to fake a round earth than say the earth is flat.  I just don’t see the purpose in it.</p>
