        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In this day and age there is a big perception that the earth&#39;s population is getting out of hand.  i question the out of hand population based on a few observations.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>most people in civilized areas only have 1 to 2 kids. you just don&#39;t see that big 6+ family anymore. </p></li>
<li><p>There is a lot of chemicals in the air, water ,and food supply that drastically lowers sperm counts</p></li>
<li><p>the last few world and civil wars killed off a lot of the population. of course it was mostly men. but many women got caught up in the mess too.  I think the big perception on why there was a big birth rate after ww2 could be answered  by the redpill theory. The 80/20 rule could of got reduced so me and at least for a little while it was 60/40. Well till more higher quality males got resupplied in the dating chain.</p></li>
<li><p>finally , getting outside of the city and suburbs, it very empty. i remember taking vacations as a kid. outside of town it was a snooze fest. Nothing in sight. even at places that would seem populated, it&#39;s be like an hour drive with nothing but palm trees. good way to fall asleep. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So that brings me to the question where is all this out of hand population coming from? If the real population is being covered up, why would they do that? </p>

For a country with so much control over birth they sure have a lot of people. Yet other countries with no rules or laws in Europe manage just fine and are barely a fraction of a small chinese town (as in entire european countries have less people than a tiny village in China).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my own experience over the years living in a very suburban area, black people and Mexicans are just breeding at an enormous rate and being taken care of by the government. Educated and more responsible people (of all races) generally try to wait to have kids till they have a house and are more established.</p>

<p>So essentially what I’ve seen over my lifetime is a shift from 2 people getting married and having 2-3 kids to instead those same people aren’t getting married because of societal/money issues. Meanwhile the lower class is just having kids and collecting benefits from the government.</p>

<p>It’s terrible and I see it day in and day out. I’ve been told to my face by 2 people in my life they are trying to get pregnant for the sole reason of being able to collect food stamps again. Disgusting</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People create sock puppets for all kinds of reasons.. in real life as well as on the internet.. I suspect there is a lot of double, triple counting going on as well as people move around and data isn&#39;t updated everywhere at once. I imagine that in India the records may be particularly bad.. in China lots of people are illegally living in the cities when they&#39;re supposed to be back in the countryside. Also, why do they have entire ghost cities if there are so many people? There are loads of plausible explanations of course, but maybe bad statistics caused a misjudgement of demand. When the turkish national ID database was leaked, there were around 40m entires.. there are supposed to be 70m turks and just picking names at random, many of the ones I was able to find via google had left turkey and were living in europe.. some many decades years ago. I imagine many of them are dead too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>USA population is 325 million  and area is 9.8 million square km(2430034321 acres).</p>

<p>That works out to about 7.5 acres per person. 1acre is a football field.</p>

<p>Even with china&#39;s population(1.379billion) its still 1.7 acres per person.</p>

<p>The population is there man. Just too far away to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. statistics are being manipulated.  i read that if we would move every living human to australia and give each one of them a half an acre block of land to live on, there would be still quite a lot of land left empty. and all the other continents would be uninhabited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our roads are packed, even though there&#39;s tons and tons of uninhabited land across the U.S. our infrastructure isn&#39;t ready for more people. So yeah sure we could have more people, but it takes time to build more schools, hospitals, roads, etc. </p>

<p>Also another way to look at it is how many people can this planet sustain indefinitely? I&#39;d imagine that we are around the limit right now with our current rate of consumption. Maybe past the point of sustainability without drastic change. If we keep fishing the oceans like we are, creating more landfills, logging forest, drilling for oil, burning oil, imagine 300 years from now. Now 500 years. Yeah it doesn&#39;t look pretty. I see genocide and world wars. But who knows maybe we all start living like the Amish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The figures of 7 billion+ people on Earth are not inaccurate - there may be some quibbling over the methodology but it&#39;s in the ballpark.  The notion of an impending population crisis is a bunch of bullshit, and baked into the concept of a carrying capacity are a bunch of assumptions about what humans ought to have as atomized persons, and these eugenics-worshippers have no concept of human beings working and living together cooperatively.  My understanding is that Earth could support something like 15-20 billion people with current technology, at least as far as food production and distribution is concerned.  The former is not a problem, the latter is the real problem.</p>
