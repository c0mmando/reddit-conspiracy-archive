    <div class="md"><p>Corbett&#39;s a great guy. He&#39;s also highly intelligent, short and funny. No in all seriousness, Corbett is a great guy. Oh I said that already.
I have learned a lot from his videos and web site, donated to him several times, and appreciate his outsider-ness and independence of mind. The fact that he doesn&#39;t talk about politics with his wife, or so he claims, and I do believe him, is not only fascinating but seriously impressive, given the fact that he has dedicated a big part of his life to educating people all over the planet. Corbett is a great guy. Doh, I did it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no clue what an anarchist is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anarchy is the condition of a society, entity, group of people, or a single person that rejects hierarchy. The word originally meant leaderlessness, but in 1840 Pierre-Joseph Proudhon adopted the term in his treatise What Is Property? to refer to a new political philosophy: anarchism, which advocates stateless societies based on voluntary associations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could say he is a non-partisan or an independent, but definitely not an anarchist. He has made no indication that he is for a stateless society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a good point as he does create more videos/articles about left-wing conspiracies than right-wing conspiracies. But even Corbett mention that objectivity in journalism is a myth and everyone has their own subjective ideology they push, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ax7paIbXM">even he admits this</a>.</p>

<p>How many journalist or researchers who convey the news or their message talk about how objectivity in journalism is a myth? Little to NONE. So just because he doesn&#39;t fall into your subjective ideology doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t a great researcher/journalist. </p>

<p>In fact, some (such as Bill Cooper) have postulated that Jones is a caricature designed to provide an easy-to-mock mock version of alternative media as a way of distracting from journalists like Mr. Corbett. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r8rFNDh9WQ">In fact, Cooper&#39;s expose on Jones from 2000 still rings true to this day</a>. </p>

<p>Also, James Corbett has been kind enough to do multiple AMA&#39;s on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> over the years. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76uzvv/hi_im_james_corbett_of_the_corbett_report_creator/">His most recent AMA</a> even included some amazing video responses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be awesome I missed those. As far as Alex Jones I feel like for a couple three years in the nineties he was OK. He was breaking some new material kinda. But after y2k he went kinda apeshit. One of the first videos I watched before 911 was his about the rise of the police state. And sure enough we get DHS and other crap with the patriot act that he pretty much called.</p>

<p>Bill Cooper pretty much straight up called 911 and I give him credit for that. He hit on some other good stuff too there in the late 90s, but I also remember a ton of wacky alien stuff. Thanks for your response!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a 5 or 6 year subscriber, I would say that he&#39;s one of the best independent journalists out there. However, he is not without flaw; which, I feel, is that he&#39;s too optimistic about the capabilities and desire of the masses to function in a less or non-regulated society.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say forms of anarchism couldn&#39;t work, I guess. That said, I see the present system as anarchic on some level. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think he&#39;s great from a &#39;deprogramming&#39; perspective; i.e., to dispel all the lies that constitute the generally-accepted narrative; but, from a &#39;how to be&#39; perspective, the real truth IMO is that one needs to focus most of their energy on improving (and loving) themselves.</p>

<p>On a philosophical level, he&#39;s too blinded by ideology for me to really dig.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no clue what an anarchist is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anarchy is the condition of a society, entity, group of people, or a single person that rejects hierarchy. The word originally meant leaderlessness, but in 1840 Pierre-Joseph Proudhon adopted the term in his treatise What Is Property? to refer to a new political philosophy: anarchism, which advocates stateless societies based on voluntary associations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could say he is a non-partisan or an independent, but definitely not an anarchist. He has made no indication that he is for a stateless society.</p>
