       They blamed the Russians, at first, but now that that doesn't work, anymore, they are using a card they didn't want to play because it highlights their own tactics and strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
       ADA relies on saturation and repetition which can easily be trolled to expose dishonesty.
      </p>
      <p>
       These competing AI's are still being used in all political campaigns in conjunction with the media... news, music, movies, tv shows, Internet astrotrufing, etc.

      <pre><code>The records show Roldugin is a behind-the-scenes player in a clandestine network operated by Putin associates that has shuffled at least $2 billion through banks and offshore companies, an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung and other media partners has found.

Putin adviser Ruben Vardanyan was board chair and principal owner of the bank that ran Avtoinvest, a big shareholder in Kamaz. In 2008, Vardanyan wanted to consolidate a majority hold on Kamaz, according to press reports, but he needed help. The government of the Russian Republic of Tatarstan held a significant portion of the shares of the company; it had to be persuaded to sell.

      <pre><code>Accordingly, I dug back further and confirm that the original terms were for a 4 year vesting schedule of which John was ¾ vested (this reflects what John actually exercised – i.e. 75,000 out of 100,000 options). The 4 year schedule is reflected in the “offer” letter which our previous CEO sent to John and John signed and sent back. It is also reflected in the Board minutes where John’s grant was approved.

      <pre><code>Lack of transparency for funding sources

Some open government groups, such as the Sunlight Foundation and the Campaign Legal Center, criticize the Center's failure to disclose its contributors, particularly since it is so influential in appointments to the Obama administration.[23][24]
Funding

The Center for American Progress is a 501(c)(3) organization under U.S. Internal Revenue Code.[16] In 2014, CAP received $45 million from a variety of sources, including individuals, foundations, labor unions, and corporations.[44] From 2003 to 2007, CAP received about $15 million in grants from 58 foundations.[45] Major individual donors include George Soros, Peter Lewis, Steve Bing, and Herb and Marion Sandler. The Center receives undisclosed sums from corporate donors.[46] In December 2013, the organization released a list of its corporate donors, which include Walmart, CitiGroup, Wells Fargo, defense contractor Northrop Grumman, America's Health Insurance Plans, and Eli Lilly and Company.[47]

In 2015, CAP released a partial list of its donors, which included 28 anonymous donors accounting for at least $5 million in contributions. Named donors included the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, which each gave between $500,000 and $999,999. CAP’s top donors include Walmart and Citigroup, each of which have given between $100,000 and $499,000.[48][49]

      <pre><code>[Center for American Progress] Helped launch Media Matters For America in 2004

In a related endeavor, on May 3, 2004, CAP helped launch David Brock's Media Matters for America to serve as a "watchdog" organization monitoring "rightwing" media for ethics violations and factual inaccuracies. According to The New York Times, Brock conferred with Hillary Clinton, Senator Tom Daschle (a Distinguished Senior Fellow with CAP), and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore about Media Matters before embarking on the project. Podesta, noted the Times, "introduced [Brock] to potential donors."

As of February 2011, CAP's single largest department was its communications department, comprised of 31 full-time staffers tasked with spinning the news in a direction favorable to the Obama administration and the Democrats. “Rare is the day a reporter doesn’t get three or more press releases from [CAP],”

       That Clinton Uranium stuff happened long before the 2016 campaign and has been debunked by Fox News.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Clinton foundation is not the same group as the Clinton Campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if this was criminal, how come after 1 1/2 years of a total Republican government,  no charges been made?

       You use the data to make the chatbots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you going to deny there are chatbots? On both sides? Because there is plenty of proof of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, those bots and operations need funding, which came from RUSSIA and Saudi Arabia and other foreign investors who gave money to Podesta and the Podesta Group and other NGO's and quasi PACs.
      </p>
      <p>
       THe proof is there, you are just refusing to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you telling me that John Podesta did not get money from Joule Unlimited?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you telling me that you do not think that the Podesta Group was paid from Troika Dialog?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you contesting DAVID BROCK'S OWN WORDS when he said that Podesta and the Center for American Progress helped start his media operations like COrrect the Record, Media Matter and SHareblue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because all of that is documented.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have ZERO evidence, as of yet. Just denial and DARVO BS.

       Well, I have no idea how you became so confused.  Are you claiming that David Brock and one or both of the Podesta brothers worked with the Russians to help elect Trump? I don't believe it.  Did you think I would?

       They worked for the DNC and Hillary?
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you get things so backwards?
      </p>
      <p>
       JOHN PODESTA WORKED FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe start to get your facts right before you insist someone else is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe also consider that a person can find that both Trump and Hillary have some explaining to do, but they are hidden behind layers of propaganda so that they never have to do that.

       Here is the Podesta Group's LD 1 disclosure form that came out after the Panama Papers exposed Troika Dialog.

       You the bottom? The Podesta Group ADMITS TO WORKING FOR THE KREMLIN.

       What about John Podesta?

       Here, his assistant admits that Podesta is also getting paid from Ruben Vardanyan.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This first document shows a 3 year vesting schedule and the current one shows a 4 year schedule. Accordingly, I dug back further and confirm that the original terms were for a 4 year vesting schedule of which John was ¾ vested (this reflects what John actually exercised – i.e. 75,000 out of 100,000 options). The 4 year schedule is reflected in the “offer” letter which our previous CEO sent to John and John signed and sent back.

       Notice that joule-unlimited.com has been scrubbed and now advertises for Ralph Lauren.

       Bloomberg proves Vardanyan is on the Board of Directors.

       So, yes. THEY BOTH ADMIT TO WORKING FOR THE KREMLIN.
      </p>
      <p>
       They take money from it and then tell the FARA paperwork that they work for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only, John Podesta didn't disclose any of it and you can confirm that by searching fara.gov, yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... are you really going to tell me that Podesta isn't getting paid by Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you going to tell me that David Brock isn't getting financial help from Podesta's NGO's to run his Internet astroturfing campaigns?

       Technically, btw, this is treason and people have been hanged for less.

       And I can sort of understand their cult-like worship of Trump because it's fascinating how cults recruit the disenfranchised but they feel the same way about almost the entire GOP. It's really bizarre.
