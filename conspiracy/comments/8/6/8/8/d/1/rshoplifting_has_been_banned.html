       r/shoplifting was one of those subs that I just found really interesting to read through. It was like, you know it's technically wrong what they were doing but you still kind of rooted for them for being the underdogs fighting the big bad corps. Ya stealing is wrong but seeing posts of people walking out with hundreds and thousands of dollars from stores that exploit child slave workers just seemed like bittersweet revenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm bummed to see it has gotten banned by Reddit's most recent purge. They've been getting hit a lot with shills lately so it was clear that sub was attracting attention but still surprised to see it banned when I went to visit it earlier.. hopefully Voat will carry on the torch.

       Shoplifting is not a victimless crime. You are thinking of it on a higher level, and I get what you are saying. But think about it on a store level. The employee now has a theft on their watch, this will likely negatively affect them. The store managers also have this on their watch, this very much will affect them and their paycheck of not their job completely.

       Theft is wrong, there is no gray area here.

       If none of those employees were dumb enough to work for those corporations in the first place, they wouldn't even be able to exist to exploit child labor to begin with.

       Have you ever really talked to a walmart employee? They hate their jobs, I've literally had a 40+ year old man just straight up tell me he hates his job and it makes him miserable. People shouldn't even be working for a company that treats them like lesser beings.

       Yeah because everyone can just wave his/her hands and magically start working for themselves and make 10x as much ... people work shit minimum wage jobs that they hate just because, reasons?

       All you're doing is making excuses to why you can't do something, it's part of the problem with a victim based mindset. Instead of telling yourself reason why you can do something, you just tell yourself reasons you can't. You're defeated before you ever even gave an attempt. Enjoy working for and answering to somebody else the rest of your life.

       Best Buy for example has a management position that is over the warehouse and it's straightup lose over this percentage in shrink and you're fired. I don't agree with it, but it exists.

       Most places are structured that way. If it is not tied to your pay directly, it will be a factor in your job description aka responsibility. If no one is held accountable for ensuring shrinkage is kept to a minimum, the potential for loss if too great. It keeps people focused on making sure security of product is just as important as selling it.

       The people at that sub were actually pretty strictly against stealing from individuals or small mom &amp; pop shops. r/shoplifting focused only on shoplifting from unethical corporations. Now that doesn't make shoplifting morally okay, but at the same time they aren't on the same level as thugs who'd steal your grandma's purse while she wasl ooking away

       I mean I'm not exactly pro-theft, I just found the sub entertaining to go through and it was just interesting peering through it and I'm surprised it got wiped by Reddit's purge. And for what, a corporation telling us what we can and cannot talk about?

       A walk through the product store and 15 aisles to see
      </p>
      <p>
       All the pretty, pretty packages staring back at me
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is my favorite, where is my chance
      </p>
      <p>
       To remove the product and stick it in my pants
      </p>
      <p>
       And I want to see what's on sale now, what's for free
Every time I go to shop I steal from enemies who steal from me and from you
      </p>
      <p>
       (If you only knew then you would steal too)
      </p>
      <p>
       Adrenaline rushes, the products in my grip
      </p>
      <p>
       I am only shopping but now it's time to lift
      </p>
      <p>
       I look for my moment, and down my pants I stick
      </p>
      <p>
       The product I've selected is concealed against my dick
      </p>
      <p>
       Paranoid as fuck security in tow
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he really trailing me and does he really know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of my little secret, my pride and his shame
      </p>
      <p>
       This is so exciting kid, it's like a fucking game
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm almost to the counter, will I make it to the door?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will I get away like a million times before
      </p>
      <p>
       Or be caught, jailed, banned from the store?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like if the product I've selected slips and crashes to the floor
      </p>
      <p>
       I get to the door and out the door I slide
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel a sense of dignity, I feel a sense of pride
      </p>
