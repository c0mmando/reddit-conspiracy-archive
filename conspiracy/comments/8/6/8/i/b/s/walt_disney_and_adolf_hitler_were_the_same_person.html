    <div class="md"><p>Dude what exactly are you referencing who’s we. Where is the reasoning Iv looked into this and it’s absurd. The thing about conspiracy’s is that there is usually more than enough reasoning and evidence to raise enough doubts in general public that logical people are not satisfied with the official story. Examples would be JFK assassination, 9/11. These were filled with so many holes it would be almost laughable if it wasn’t so serious. If something like an assassination can have this many holes in it, shouldn’t something as big as flat earth be glaringly obvious to anyone who opens their mind up enough to consider it? Well I’ll tell you it’s not, I would say hollow earth is more probable according to my studies, but it’s really irrelevant because it distracts us from the real issues and makes us look insane to the average person. Have you heard of disinformation? It’s the elites favorite tactic these days, the whole point of it is rather than execute everything perfectly which they’ve shown time and time again they are incapable of. They feed ppl bullshit, this is an intelligence strategy that works brilliantly and allows them to control their opposition, and ruin them. This is the biggest threat to the truth community and flat earth is much more likely a psy op than a credible theory disagree, let’s see some evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know what disinformation is and unless you realize the truth about the &quot;outer space&quot; hoax and the globe earth hoax you will be lost in a world of pure disinformation imagination.</p>

<p>Flat earth has much more programming to break through to be considered and that&#39;s why you have a problem with it.  You have been shown the globe subconsciously since you were a child.  Every movie, TV show, commercial, absolutely everything has the programming in it.  This is probably the most important truth to understand today to be able to sift through all the red herrings that are presented on sites like this one.  The evidence is everywhere you just need to go find it.  Here is a decent place to start, the ISS hoax:</p>

<p>Are you, though? The Rothschilds and other front families are replaced with a flick of the wrist once public opinion has sufficiently turned against them; we are shooting at the armour, not the heart. The time currently spent on spreading awareness of the Rothschilds and their activities would be put to much better use by investigating the actual culprit, whomever that may be.</p>

<p>Indeed I do not, but the attractiveness of a piece of information is hardly a criterium for its validity. It is mind-boggling why a family as (supposedly) powerful as the Rothschilds would live their lifes in the public realm, instead of retreating to a mansion in buttfuck nowhere and ruling the world from the shadows, where vermin grows much better.</p>

<p>But I&#39;d draw you attention to Canadian photographer Francois Brunelle&#39;s project to track down real live doppelgangers. People who look so alike that they could be identical twins and yet are unrelated in any way at all. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been claimed that we all have a double out there but Brunelle is the first to ever attempted to verify it. Here&#39;s just a few of the 200 pairs he set as his goal...
