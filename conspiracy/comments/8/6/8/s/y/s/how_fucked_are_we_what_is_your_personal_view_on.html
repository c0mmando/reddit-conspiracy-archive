       My faith wanes every day. Each Dawn I wonder more and more if we don't simply deserve the shit we see coming. The Republic is dying, Free Speech on the internet is being destroyed, and civic mindedness is as low as it's ever been. Is there any reserve of civic strength left? Are there even enough of us to fight this? I'm struggling to find a positive answer...the darkness wraps around my mind and I fear for this country and its inhabitants.

       If you got a thing you know you should be doing, quit procrastinating, get on it.
Whether we're all fucked or not, I think we can all agree time is short, make it count.

       People are comfortable, distracted, and generally unaware of what's going on.  Regardless of the political persuasion of the folks inhabiting this small corner of the internet, they have sustained a lifetime of indoctrination and mind fuckery, as I have, and managed to survive with some semblance of self.

       Doing nothing isn't being apathetic. You can do nothing and still have feelings about it just like you can do something and feel apathetic with your decision. I love quotes from games but sometimes we get so caught up in the story line it makes edgy quotes like this seem to make more sense than they actual do. Also the reason that apathy being worse than death makes no sense as well. Death feeds the environment where as apathy is a state of mind that is somehow worse because it can't also do the job of rotting flesh? But that being said.. My favorite games to borrow quotes from are the Tales of series. Tales of Symphonia comes to mind.

       You can disagree all you want. Imagine unlimited resources, brain power, and time being the tools of your enemy. Anything you do has either been calculated and accounted for long in advance or have had counter measures in place against it before you even thought about it. To put it into perspective.. your enemy lives and thinks in decades while people live and think in days or weeks/months at most. It's not fair. It's not supposed to be fair. It's rigged and there is nothing you or anyone can do about it except for watch  things unfold while trying to have as good of life as possible and maybe get lucky and become wealthy. Just because we lost doesn't mean we can't enjoy life.

       Define "we".  In the long run humanity is destined to be replaced in every aspect by machines.  There once was a vision that man would be so ambitious in exploring space that a never-ending manifest destiny would push a frontier farther faster than the forces of mechanization could keep up.  But we see now that more likely we'll sit on Earth until the tech is mature and omnipresent and then the AI will expand at it's own judicious pace.

        the long history of doomsday predictions

       suggests to me that the feeling that's the whole world's coming to an end is just a very natural, innate part of the human social psyche.

       It doesn't matter how dire things seems--they've seemed just as, or even more dire, to people in the past, yet somehow the world still hasn't ended.

       Not even a nuclear apocalypse would end the world, and it probably wouldn't even end humanity. Life, uh, finds a way.

       Personally, I think climate change is a thing.  Bit even if it isn't, we've fcked the oceans w/plastics and other chemical pollutants.  That's all working its way up the food chain.  All of the veggies/fruits we grow seem to be losing overall nutritional value from prior decades.  We're wiping out bee populations somehow and that has an effect on food availabilty as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in climate change...  Society will be unrecognizable to us within a few generations.  Methane hydrates are going to be doing their thing soon.  Coral bleaching, which is accelerating, is indicative of the health of the parts of the ocean that provide over 60% of our oxygen.  Warmer temps make it easier for viruses and bacteria to migrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the number of strange attractors that have to balance out to provide the stability humans need, humans have been mucking about with double-digit percentages of them.  Adding unorganized energy to the system.  And that's just in nature.  Wait until food-insecurity spreads to 1st world nations or big 2nd world nations (like the US has become).

       Well there's two parts to this question. How fucked are we as a human race? Pretty fucked. But in my opinion not because of the current state of affairs - look at our history. Things are not on whole that much worse. Can you imagine if you were living as someone in Paris during the 1400's when the black death was killing half the city, or a Chinese academic during the Cultural revolution, or a young British man during WWI, or a librarian under the Khmer Rouge regime?
      </p>
      <p>
       The common denominator is that people are corrupt, and that those in power have always and will continue to concentrate their power and fuck over the average person. At some breaking point their may be a revolution, but the whole thing will happen again. You might say that no, we can rise up, but what happens after that? Corrupt people will begin amassing power and the whole thing starts again. It's because if you're not a sociopath, you'll be enjoying life and helping each other, not scheming to fuck people over and amass power, so unless the human race miraculously ascends to a different type of being, we're fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my personal view on the planet as a whole? It's fine. Humans are a minor blip in the overall history and scheme of things. We'll come and go at some point and perhaps some other species will evetually reign supreme and then come and go as well. The planet will be fine, and probably better off when every last one of us, corrupt or not, are gone.

       I think the world is unbelievable but all that's reported is the bad (especially right now).  I think it's absolutely astonishing that even though I'm nowhere close to being rich that I still have more available to me than a person like Caesar who was ruler over most the world he knew.  The fact that so many systems are working simultaneously each time to make a light switch give out light each time, or hell, even the amount of effort and people working together to make it possible for me to even communicate this gratitude with other people around the world...it blows my mind honestly...and it happens every time I turn the switch. There are so many things that we can do better, I'm not denying that and every day I hope I improve and do better than yesterday. But still, I can't believe how awesome it is to be born in this time period.

       Too many people. Even the "overpopulation is a myth" estimates for where the population will go, is grazing the estimates for the  maximum carrying capacity for the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently having kids is going to go out of fashion so we will see how that goes when we need constant population growth for the right demographics to maintain economic growth.

       Oh and the election cycle promotes fairly short term thinking from one election cycle to another. Long term we are rudderless.

       The USA is more like a mafia, and this mafia thinks it owns your business' storefront. They divvy up americans like crackheads that are only allowed to buy off this guy, or that guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll kill to protect their business, they'll kill you to maintain control of your street corner. Them police arresting low level dealers so that the mafias profits remain good and that the tithe always goes upward.
      </p>
      <p>
       This mafia looks at the citizenry as nothing more than unshom sheep. Are you ready to pay homage to plastic CD companies by buying his movie for $25? We need to keep the economy healthy! More plastic bottles so water is clean! That fool didn't pay his permits! Take eveything!

       All is not lost though, we are heading into a future technocracy, its possible that the walls will be erected and this dynasty has a chance and becoming the way of life for our descendants - an eternal unending nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we also get a chance to fight, we are in a new age, the age of ideas, quite different from 20 years ago, the age of mean production . Bordering on the threshold of the everlasting technocracy, the ability to spread ideas like wildfire and thus a chance to moonlight the crimes of the last 2000 years.

       IMO we eventually are destined to die out and become another smidge on the earths history unless we can “ascend” past this current (last few hundred years) trend of hierarchy and corruption in societies.

       I believe in my lifetime there will be an overthrow of the elites that have plagued this world since long before I was born. When that fight comes, I’ll be ready. It feels as if thats my purpose and reasoning for being on this planet right now, out of all the years throughout history. I don’t think there has ever in history been so much lying and deceiving to the public by those in power, something has to be done about it. It has to come to a head. To answer your question, I don’t think we’re well and truly fucked. I think we’re letting ourselves get fucked though, maybe because collectively we have so many distractions going on in our day to day life that we feel like we’re powerless to change things when the truth is we hold all the power. I think the internet and social media can be used to our advantage if we can somehow get passed all their censorship and monitoring. I’m confident we can take this world back from the hands of those that don’t deserve to call the shots if we all worked together, every single country. I wish there was a website or something that we could all gather on and pledge to fight all the evil in the world. I wish we as people had that in us, but right now, as of 2018, I don’t think that day is near. Again though, I do feel it will happen in my lifetime.
