        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Michael Bennet had an “altercation”with security , including a 66-year old paraplegic officer at the past Super Bowl. Supposedly he pushed past said security (who was in a wheelchair) to gain access to the field where his brother was after winning the Super Bowl. As of now, TX authorities have said there are no videos/pictures of the incident. Only a witness statement from another officer. The felony charge holds a max sentence of 10-yrs and $10,000 fine. He is an active voice against police brutality and of course the situations and racial tensions that are ongoing throughout the world. What is your take on the situation? IMHO, it is very suspect as there are no other witnesses as of now, no video to prove his wrongdoing, only another officers account. The TX authorities have already spoken “he needs to turn himself in, he is not above the law.” Might I also add the fact that this happened weeks ago, they didn’t pursue this case due to “more significant cases” so its almost out of nowhere. Additionally, no officer was actually injured or hurt, in reality, sounds like he just pushed through(if he actually did do so) which I’m sure hundreds of others did as well, thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a quote from my provided source. Maybe you read it? Who knows. </p>

<p>“Travis, 38, is among the most listened-to sports personalities in America. He made his name tying the business woes of ESPN to its coverage of politically progressive athletes. But since Donald Trump’s election he has evolved into something much bigger than just a sports bro with an unlimited supply of attitude. In warp speed, he has gone from opining and blogging on SEC football and posting leering pictures of quarterbacks’ girlfriends to a darling in Republican media circles, a reliable source of ammunition in an increasingly bitter and polarizing national culture war. He is an oft-cited source on websites like the Daily Caller, Breitbart and Lifezette, delivering anti-politically correct hot takes like offering $50,000 to charity if progressive commentator Shaun King would take a DNA test to prove he is black.”</p>

<p>Pretty controversial guy </p>
