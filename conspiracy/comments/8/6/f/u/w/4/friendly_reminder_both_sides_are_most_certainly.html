<p>The two parties are polarized which is exactly how the elite want the country. Divided. </p>

<p>More voting against party lines would indicate to me that real people are in office that know how to compromise and work together for the betterment of the country. </p>

<p>Downvotes do not always equal shills. Are you saying there&#39;s a subset of shills that want us to think both parties are the same?  What organization would they be working for?  </p>

<p>Shills love when stuff they want to hide gets lots of comments. Why?  Because they are able to manipulate the vote totals. The downvotes have an effect on human reasoning. Lots of downvotes equals this is a bad thought and I shouldn&#39;t think it if I want to fit in and be accepted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>Just look at the issues that they <em>both agree on</em>.</p>

<p>Why won&#39;t any of these people tell us that the twin towers were not brought down by fires or arab terrorists? </p>

<p>That is more important than anything listed by the OP. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a hard truth to digest, but all of these politicians are loyal to the pope of Rome. The heads of both congressional parties, including the whips, are Catholic Jesuit coadjutors. Trump&#39;s transition team which was responsible for cabinet appointments was dominated by Catholics. His chief of staff who oversees the White House is the powerful military general and former DHS head, John Kelly, who is Catholic and Jesuit-trained from military intelligence stronghold Georgetown University, the same place where the current head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was trained, Joseph Dunford, also a Catholic. </p>

<p>The war in the middle east exactly as George Bush described it, is a &quot;crusade;&quot; a crusade for the pope. The Syrian crisis for example was caused by a Jesuit named Paollo Dall&#39;Oglio who incited <em>armed revolt</em> against the Syrian government. Dall&#39;Oglio was expelled from Syria for doing so immediately prior to the eruption of conflict there.  And now the Jesuits, operating their Jesuit Refugee Service are bringing these militarized invaders into Europe for the goal of European &quot;integration,&quot; pursuant to the Charlemagne Prize and revival of the Holy Roman Empire. </p>

<p>When any of these congressional whores decide to whisper a thing about this, is when I might consider listening to or voting for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Purely on issues I tend to agree with the Dems more.  However, this is balanced by how much I absolutely detest blue team because of their corruption, unethical practices, and ties to the CIA.  Also, the constant brigading of this sub by blue team isn&#39;t doing much to endear them to me.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, red team is fucked too, corrupt from top to bottom, and completely ineffectual at governance.</p>

<p>To me, the difference between the teams is more or less negligible, except that blue team is way more fucking annoying.  America behaves the same no matter who is in office, and while I would generally vote more in line with blue team, it doesn&#39;t really seem to matter much how they vote because nothing ever changes.</p>

<p>Both teams suck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rich aren&#39;t evil. Many try to be good people. Some don&#39;t care at all about anymore but themselves. The problem is that their economic self-interests are in conflict with their hired help. If they pay them less, they make more. If they deceive them, they can pay them less. Some rich people say pay workers more and tax them more. </p>

<p>Elon Musk is a good rich man. Look at all the humanity improving projects he wants to direct. He&#39;s probably for labor rights I&#39;d wager. It&#39;s just the rich who only care about themselves that run wild trying to squeeze the workers to get maximum advantage for themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>Do what you will. I seek to understand and empathize with all. Elon is my favorite rich man. He&#39;s helping us transition to electric vehicles, which can derive electricity from renewables and any other power source ultimately. He&#39;s helping humanity get back into space since NASA has been cut back by the forces of <del>darkness</del> <del>ignorance</del> <del>selfishness</del> Republicans. He made a friggin&#39; reusable rocket FFS. He made battery arrays to capture renewables, which are a key technology to balance the intermittent aspect of renewable energy. He now wants to bring wireless internet to the whole planet via satellites. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to hate him just because he made our money we paid him for making stuff we really want. Show me the harm he causes or I&#39;ll only see the above. </p>

<p>Those who voted against it were worried about habeas corpus being taken away from individuals by what was proposed in the bill. The bill wasn&#39;t titled or solely about &quot;CIA oversight....&quot;</p>

<p><strong>FTFY</strong></p>

<p>The point is I don&#39;t believe you are actually interested in discussing conspiracy theories, I think you are only interested in supporting one side of the political spectrum which IMO is contradictory to the purpose of this subreddit. It doesn&#39;t matter which side that is. There might be differences, but one thing they always have in common, they are both corrupt. If you believe pretty much any conspiracy theories, you are likely anti-elites, and when you come here praising Trump or Hillary, it scream ulterior motives.</p>

<p>This same problem still exists, and it has arguably grown even worse. Obviously this astroturfing campaign can’t be killed. Our choices are to complain about it while this sub becomes an “alt-right hangout” and “t_d 2.0”, or to at least try to balance it out when it becomes clear that certain relevant truths are being omitted from the dialogue here.</p>

<p>You can call it partisan if you want, and maybe it is, but what I posted is the truth (obviously), and there absolutely is a conspiracy to brand the Democratic Party as “evil” when in fact the voting record shows otherwise. </p>

<p>If you want to talk about Hillary Clinton, then okay I’m right there with you. But let’s be honest, Democrat congressmen have kept a decent track record when it comes to how they actually vote. One could make the argument that bills are mislabeled, which they are, but the majority of the entries in this post are represented truthfully, and you are free to read the full text of any of them if you think the title is misleading.</p>

<p>So I’m standing by my post, and I’ll also say: There is a concerted effort to encourage tribalism and identity politics, and to sway people to the right despite their poor track record with regard to their voting record on issues that harm the middle class while enriching elites.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the bill before us today puts children’s lives and health at risk.  It requires doctors to immediately ensure transportation and admission of the infant to a hospital in all cases, with no regard as to whether doing so is in the best interest of the child’s health and well-being.  This mandate effectively overrides the careful, case-by-case exercise of professional medical judgment by health care providers, and replaces it with a blanket rule enforceable with criminal penalties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember the Democratic Party <strong>only</strong> started to vote for &quot;civil rights&quot; because they needed the black population.</p>

<p>--In 1947, after President Harry S Truman sent Congress proposals against lynching and segregation in interstate transportation, Johnson called the proposed civil rights program a &quot;farce and a sham--an effort to set up a police state in the guise of liberty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Next, we asked an expert in the offices of the U.S. Senate to check on Johnson’s votes on civil rights measures as a lawmaker. By email, Betty Koed, an associate historian for the Senate, said that according to information compiled by the Senate Library, in &quot;the rare cases when&quot; such &quot;bills came to a roll call vote, it appears that&quot; Johnson &quot;consistently voted against&quot; them or voted to stop consideration.

    <div class="md"><p>Except it doesn&#39;t. If you&#39;re qualifying your statement by comparing uninsured healthcare costs with insured healthcare costs, then obviously people with Obamacare are paying less than the uninsured. If you compare employer sponsored healthcare plans with Obamacare, the less expensive option is an employer sponsored plan in nearly every case. And that&#39;s bad news for the poor sob who doesn&#39;t have an employer sponsored plan. They pay more. What&#39;s worse is that those with an employer sponsored plan saw their premiums and deductibles skyrocket. In my case, I had a $500 deductable prior to ACA that increased to $5000. My premiums nearly tripled. </p>

<p>While doing contract work for a couple months I checked out Obamacare plans and find them to be more expensive than privately purchased plans from healthcare providers. $300/mo for private, $650 for Obamacare.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really no situation where any reasonable person would choose Obamacare over private insurance except in the midst extreme edge cases that serve as the exception and not the rule</p>

<p>Examples of ACTUAL topics (for which congressmen either don&#39;t vote or are always in overwhelming agreement):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Federal Reserve scam.</p></li>
<li><p>Fractional reserve banking.</p></li>
<li><p>Support to the apartheid ethno-Statelet in the near East.</p></li>
<li><p>Invasions and wars of conquests</p></li>

<li><p>Police militarization</p></li>
