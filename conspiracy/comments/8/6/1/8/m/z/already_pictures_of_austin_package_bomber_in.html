       We already have photos of the Austin package bomber caught by Fedex surveillance and we have still yet to see a single image of Paddock in a Vegas hotel.

       For the sake of conversation and conspiracy I stumbled along this tweet from a local Austin New station report , KXAN News :

       Granted they probably are being somewhat quiet on disclosing personal information, but interesting nonetheless!

       Yes, he is dead. CBS Austin has already released the FedEx surveillance showing him delivering package bombs at their facility. This was within hours of him being identified. We have gone how many months without one single image of Stephen Paddock inside of a Las Vegas hotel. Not checking in, not carry luggage, not gambling....
      </p>
      <p>
       Just trying to show the transparency between these two instances. I don’t feel like the Las Vegas shooting has nearly as much attention as it should and has been completely put on the back burner. I don’t know if I’d even say back burner, it’s an afterthought at this point.

       What argument did I make? I just said I would love to hear their all-knowing opinions on how in this separate instance, an armed resource officer prevented what should have been prevented at their school. Instead, he sat outside and “secured the perimeter”. Don’t blame the guns, and that’s exactly what they’re doing.

       Their all-knowing opinion is probably "great, glad that guy prevented it from being worse, however, just because no one dies..doesn't mean somone who shouldn't have had a firearm walked in a school an opened fire, let's seek every political and legislative avenue for trying to prevent any kind of event like that from happening again, after all, free speech and political action and change through legislation and discussion is the most American way we can solve, or attempt to solve a problem, what else is there?"

       Not angry at all, I enjoy having discussions but I also take a look at the entire scenario and not hone in on one specific aspect of this disaster. Have you not seen how many reports were made on this kid to local and federal law enforcement, by his peers, teachers, family members, etc? How much more prevention do you really need when you have red flags staring you in the face? I can’t really say how those kids feels and I’m sure it’s easy to point all kinds of blame in the haste of the moment. However, the townhall and the political agendas being pushed are what I find sickening. Mostly because I don’t actually believe it’s truly their own, informed opinions on this, but more what’s expected or encouraged to be said. That’s all.

       Just to let you know, it's not all a CNN conspiracy, lots of people just actually agree with it.  Like me, I don't think it was a conspiracy and I think it's totally possible for a kid with a gun to march in a kill a bunch of children.  I also think we can't rely on armed security to respond everywhere and blame them when people are shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the legislation that's pushed has a hidden agenda but I struggle to follow the money with this one.  I think there are just more and more people coming onto my frame of mind that guns are to blame and we should take them away.

       Just like criminals turned over all the cocaine when it became illegal.  Just because criminals won't stop breaking the law, doesn't mean we shouldn't make new laws.

       Yep, just like they "took away" the ability to own a street legal monster truck or make napalm in your home.  You can phrase it like it's government stormtroopers coming to take your guns, or you can phrase it that the law changed and it's no longer legal to own heavy weaponry.  Your choice of perspective.

       You're asking the wrong person.  I'd be open to seeing plans to resolve the current gun problems but I don't know how to make effective legislature.  The "weaponry" definition is shaky too, I don't oppose people owning shotguns and rifles and I'm not anti hunting, I personally think semi-automatic guns in general are excessive especially handguns and have enabled most recent shootings but it's hard to draw a strict line.  However I feel like someone has to and semi-autos are a good place to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those questions are for lawmakers really.  I'm not an expert, I'm just not a gun enthusiast and I'm sick of other people's hobbies being treated as a sacred right when they are excessively dangerous.

       Yes, let’s just trust lawmakers and politicians to legislate where to draw this line between guns you’re ok with and guns you aren’t ok with. They’re experts in weaponry.

       Nah man, just wondering how people who are against “heavy weaponry” think that changing laws will actually work. Change laws to make these guns illegal, what about the millions of legal gun owners who own these types of guns now? Are they expecting us to voluntarily surrender our guns?  What about the unregistered “heavy weaponry”, how is that accounted for?

       I am totally expecting you to voluntarily surrender them, just deal with owning something illegal.  I don't get why so much of the anti-gun control argument hinges around basic understanding of when something that was formally legal was made illegal.  There's usually a grace period, followed by varying degrees of enforcement.  Chances are the way it would work out in practice is that people would still own "illegal" guns in their home and no one would bother them until a crime was committed with one, same as with switchblades and brass knuckles.

       Having lived in a neighborhood where drug trafficking was the prevalent source of income, I would take issue with your statement that it wasn't the end of the world when people didn't turn over their drugs. Your argument that just because people won't stop breaking the law doesn't mean we shouldn't make new laws is self-defeating. The only thing these new laws would do is make more people who were law-abiding gun owners (such as myself) into criminals. I struggle with your argument simply because by your own admission, you don't know much about guns. It seems that your only argument is that you don't like them, so no one should have them. I could say the same about video games or skinny jeans on men. I don't like them, so no one should have them.

       I don't really get the drug comment.  What do you mean by that? If you're saying drugs should be legal to cut down on crime I can sympathize, if you're saying something else I can't really follow your logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're saying you'd become a criminal if the government banned a gun type you own?  Would you continue driving a car if it was deemed a risk to yourself or others?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need to know about guns to have an opinion on their use and ownership.  I don't know anything about bombs, or knives, or any number of other dangerous banned items and I think my opinion is just as valid as bomb experts on the subject of whether or not they should be legal.

       You said that it wasn't the end of the world when people didn't "turn in their cocaine". It became an illegal industry that has caused many, MANY more deaths by gun violence than legal ownership of firearms. I do happen to think that drugs should be legal, if for no other reason than to stop the slaughter of people over the trafficking of drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a law was passed banning a firearm that I legally owned, until I turned it in I would be a criminal through absolutely no action of my own. Every time I get into my car, I am taking a calculated risk. I have no control over the actions of other drivers, only my own. In answer to your question, yes I would. I do so every day. To say that cars are risky so no one should drive is ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your opinion is your opinion. Unless you did the research on how bombs or mechanical knives are constructed, and weighed the evidence on their use and/or misuse, you are just taking someone elses word on the matter, and I am fairly certain that you would discount the opinion of someone who does not share the same view as you, as you are doing here. 
Unfortunately for you, this is a right that is specified in the Constitution, just like freedom of speech, freedom from unlawful search and seizure, and the others. There is a way to amend the Constitution. Passing laws to neuter it is a coward's way.

       Until the Constitution is amended, they are a right. Being smarmy by calling me "boss" doesn't change that. If you think a gun is a "toy" I am grateful that you do not own one. I have never, and will never, consider my firearms "toys".

       You're right, I was being a dick.  I interpreted what you said as insulting for some reason but it wasn't at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       We already infringe on the right to bear arms in a thousand ways with special concealed carry permits, automatic bans, and tons of other ways.  So saying it's constitutionally protected doesn't mean a whole lot, we can interpret that as rocket launchers should be legal but we choose not to.  I don't support an outright ban but anything less would still fit under our current interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really this is just a fundamental difference of opinion and we're not going to convince each other.  You have something you like that you want to keep, and I think it's dangerous and don't think it's necessary.  These are both loose arguments that can and have been overridden before in laws, it's really just down to where public opinion leans.

       Okay I'm not going to go too deep down this hole, but I should just ask why do you think that?  Nobody uses their guns to defend the constitution today.

       I'm saying it wouldn't be as simple as the military rolling in with tanks/drones and murking the opposition. If there was an actual civil war and the government took a side, it would get complicated quickly. You'd have mass cases of desertion, sabotage, treason, etc.

       do you literally not understand what the second amendment is for? it's not for fucking sport shorting or hunting, I'll tell you that much. gun control is all about neutering the ability of the American citizens to protect themselves from a tyrannical government. if you don't see that, you are a lost cause. you base your arguments off of your feelings, which ends in having awful arguments that you can't back up with rational thought. go learn some damn history and try actually researching some firearm basics. it'll do you well.

       You get these responses bc no one can take you seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't feel like you are on the logic side vs emotion.   Your emotion is driving you to throw ideas at the wall to see what sticks. Logic would dictate you actually look into the facts and come.up with a reasonable solution.  As for your opposition, they don't believe throwing out the Constitution and taking guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens will make people safer. Examples being de-armed Germany, China ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly believe you should also note the reasoning the Japanese did not try to invade the US.  Behind every blade of grass there is a rifle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I believe there can be a discussion on this. But I'm.not going to give away where I able to flex bc that will be taken as an opportunity to start deteriorating the 2nd. Make reasonable suggestions and you can get reasonable conversation.    Removing the millions if not hundreds of millions of semi automatic weapons  from the popilace isn't a solution.  That will just make a huge black market. And everyone will be making good money off selling the extra guns and you'll be sitting cashless and gunless.

       Honestly the point of the post wasn't to spark a gun control debate, it was to let y'all in the echo chamber know that people with this opinion exist, are in fact common, and are not being paid by any shadow organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can try to dismiss it as completely insane but more and more people in the US are in support of a blanket semi-auto ban.  I do think the black market point is an issue and I need to look into that more, but I'm not in charge of a solution anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm already cashless and gunless so I'm not too worried about that.

       I'll just give you some of our Founding Fathers' thoughts on it...
      </p>
      <p>
       "A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined..." - Thomas Jefferson
      </p>
      <p>
       "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms." - Thomas Jefferson
      </p>
      <p>
       "I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery." - Thomas Jefferson
      </p>
      <p>
       “They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." - Benjamin Franklin
      </p>
      <p>
       "To disarm the people...[i]s the most effectual way to enslave them." - George Mason
      </p>
      <p>
       Never forget that those people controlling the government drones and police gear are citizens of the United States first. They are serving US, not our government. So yes, 330M Americans (give or take for young children and elderly/sick) armed to the fucking teeth is exactly why we are still free. Our government (especially over the last 25 years) hasn't just
       <em>
        given us
       </em>
       our freedom because they want to be nice people. They are slowly siphoning it away, and people like you are the pawns they need to complete the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       So give up your gun willingly, and I hope that
       <em>
        IF
       </em>
       a revolt ever happens, you side with out government. It won't be pretty, because it never has been in the past.
       <em>
        We The People
       </em>
       have always prevailed, and we always will.

       Because they're minors? They aren't old enough to vote and therefore have no power in legislature.

       It's likely that
       <strong>
        a lot
       </strong>
       of Reddit has not voted yet, or did not vote in 2016. Which means that
       <strong>
        a lot

       of the discussions about [gun] legislature that are being discussed on Reddit, and have been over the last few years, are being discussed by people who gave up their right to have any true power in legislation.

       Lol... Go do some research on the # of gun deaths per year and where they predominantly happened. Then do some research on how many school shooting fatalities happen every year. Then compare that to how many deaths happen in various other ways. Then try to justify why kids are scared of getting shot in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a hint: Manufactured fear. Those poor little kinder gardeners that are scared to go to school now, yeah those stories have been debunked already, thousands of times. Our government and our media is using kids as pawns to push political agendas. Prove me wrong otherwise, and I told you in the paragraph above how to do that.

       Who's joking? Support the 2A all you want but to think that the NRA is driven purely by noble intentions and are not in fact a front for the gun manufacturing industry where there's big money involved is not only willfully ignorant at this point, it's a pretty weird thing to ignore by someone who hangs out at conspiracy subs which tend to otherwise tends to treat big business and the "corporatocracy" with heavy and often even exaggerated skepticism.

       Private donations only make about a quarter of the funding for the NRA. The rest is corporate dollars. Why don't you try following the money?

       Where do the corporate dollars from (assuming you're referring to gun manufacturers as "corporations")? Here's a hint, gun manufacturers wouldn't be in business if there was no demand for guns.......follow the money and stop using "corporations" as a catch phrase.

       I’m assuming your point here is that something something abortion = murder and I’d like to remind you that the scientific community overwhelmingly disagrees. Now while I’ll agree that this alone does not completely invalidate the pro-life position, it does however make it a rather silly claim to drag into an argument about something entirely unrelated.
      </p>

       Since you’re here and your username is a pun on Goldman Sachs I’m gonna assume you’re rightfully skeptical when big banks funnel money into NGOs and buy politicans. Why do you give the NRA a pass for doing the exact same thing? It’s peak intellectual dishonesty.

       Convinced people that they care about the Constitution? What the hell are they teaching kids in school these days? The Constitution, by definition, is
       <em>
        a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed.
       </em>
       What the fuck do you mean the that the only reason people care about this is because of NRA propaganda? Have you ever even read the Preamble of our Constitution (assuming you're American)?

       My point about abortions is you can regurgitate the hit phrase "one child too many" all you want, but it's tired. "The boy who cried wolf." Fatal gun and car accidents in 2018 is a fraction of the number of drug overdose fatalities in 2018
       <strong>
        so far
       </strong>
       . Combine all three and it's still a fraction of the amount of abortions that have taken place
       <strong>
        ALREADY
       </strong>
       in 2018. Guns have been around since before your great-grandparents, and gun deaths are actually hovering around all time lows right now (most of which are from suicides and gang related activities, but I would have to do some more research on this before I established it as fact). What is a fact, is that school shooting fatalities aren't even a blip on the radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until you come back to me with numbers, facts, sources, or anything really besides some regurgitated Reddit posts, you really have nothing to offer this conversation other than your opinion, which is rather meaningless when it comes to legislation and human nature.

       I agree completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       A point I like to raise on this topic is that even if you're a student in a school with
       <em>
        an active shooter
       </em>
       , you're statistically
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       likely to survive. The likelihood of any random student being murdered at school is vanishingly small.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I haven't looked at the numbers, but I suspect more students die annually by their own hand (suicide), or while traveling to and from school, than in school shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is to say that we should do
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       about school shootings, but the response seems like an overreaction based on the cold hard facts.

       I have no doubt there was some sort of an arms deal going on there and Paddock worked for an agency involved. All the Saudi connections seem important to the big picture. The lack of any footage at all is astounding and definitely raises red flags for me.

       I always equate the people who call these tragedies fake with the people who argue about how the buildings came down on 911.

       I feel like they both distract from the matter at hand and don't help anyone get closer to the truth. We're much better off looking into the backgrounds and money connections of everyone involved than getting into a pissing contest about minutiae.

       Well fortunately there are a couple hundred lawsuits proceeding with discovery. You should follow those lawsuits and see what comes of them before you stick your head in the sand.

       If this conspiracy goes all the way up, and it would if assassinating a Saudi prince was the objective, then what's to stop them from releasing fake evidence for discovery? It's like when Trump allowed the CIA to redact the names of living persons in the JFK documentation release.

       It is a obvious cop-out for local people providing evidence. There were many security cameras in operation during that event. Due process for the murder victims should get footage, yet it does not. The FEDS restricted any and all evidence is my best guess.

       They dont own the floors above though. They own a stake in Mandalay Bay which owns the floors above. That same stake is not controlling and is equal to the share owned by Gates.

       Thanks for the information. It would be interesting to see who was staying in and around those floors at the time of the shootings. I admittedly haven't put a ton of research into this shooting due to lack of free time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The arms deal angle has made the most sense to me from what I've looked into. Paddock doesn't fit the MO of a mass shooter to me at all. He seemed like the kind of guy that just wanted to coast and enjoy everything he'd worked for. A little transparency regarding information around this case might go a long way in convincing me he may have been a lone nut. It feels like they could have handled this investigation much better.

       I certainly agree that the lack of transpernacy breeds wild speculation. No evidence points to it being an arms deal and no evidence in Paddocks back story fit it either.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a defense contractor but there are over a million of those in the US. The plane stuff was iffy at best because he it changed hands multiple times after Paddock sold it.

       The amount of weapons and the way they were displayed lends credence to the arms deal angle to me. Seems like the kind of guy that could definitely get involved in those circles, having an in through the defense contractor job. Which I believe he really only worked for a few years way back in the 80's before moving onto real estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could just be a gambler with a grudge and some debt that snapped but if that's the case why no transparency? It reminds me of the Russian investigation, if there is nothing there why act weird as fuck about it? lol

       Being a defense contractor doesn't really open the door to being an illicit gun trafficker. If he was a former CIA/FBI agent, sure. But working on say computer systems for a rocket at Raytheon makes you a defense contractor and idk how someone could make the logical jump from that position to gun runner.

       I would like to see some video of him bringing in the weapons or pretty much anything proving he was in there acting alone. I think some information being made public would go a long way to ease some of the speculation.

       I did see that video, I'm pretty sure it was debunked though. It ended up being an actual employee of that other casino I think. Someone had pics of the guy basically wearing the exact same clothes as the guy being escorted out.

       I'll try and find it for you, I think he might have been transporting cash at the time and due to what was going on the escort he usually has was drawing their weapons. fwiw I remember reading it a feeling pretty confidently about it being debunked.

       They believe he is the head of security at The Tropicana, his name is Jason Buff. He posted on facebook about it
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/1shirw0ixnwz.jpg">
        here
       </a>
       . He claims it's him in the video and explains the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://tobefree.wordpress.com/2017/11/16/hd-video-man-escorted-out-of-tropicana-is-not-prince-salman-but-this-security-guard/">
        Here
       </a>
       is a wordpress page with some links to some decent pictures and a breakdown of the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you google Jason Buff much more information comes up with decent pictures of what seems to be a similar softball uniform and cleats.

       Saudis own tons of hotels nationwide. I don't see how their ownership of this particular one is significant.

       Do you guys not know the main prevailing theory on this? It was an arms deal/assassination attempt on the new Crown Prince, who was staying in the casino at the time. The whole thing went FUBAR and the would be assassins opened fire on crowds as a diversion. The whole thing was covered up because the FBI was 100% brokering everything going on, I think they didn't realize the assignation part until it was too late to stop.

       In some weird ass way, i think paddock realized what exactly was going down. Whos to say he is the shooter? The police who found his body at thescene to be sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       He figured out he wasn't just selling military equipment to gun enthusiasts, maybe became aware that these automatic weapons where for use against the citizenry, some school or some other false flag. Weird ass inconsistencies and the media not reporting them. Smells like a DEA deal gone wrong if i ever heard of one. And not a random ass false flag where nobody actually got hurt. 500 people shot?

       I'm really surprised he actually brought all of that up there straight through the front door. I thought for sure that amount of guns would raise suspicion. I'm more open to the possibility that he was a lone nut that planned a massacre but I'd have to see more footage to be fully convinced. I still think he was dealing guns or dealing something. I'd like to see who came and went to that floor of the hotel.

       I think the reason nothing has been released on Paddock is there is something big behind it and releasing anymore info would impede their investigation.
Probably terrorism or arms dealing

       Paddock killed lots of people, the bomber killed none. There is ongoing invesgations with the paddock case and various civil lawsuits so they won't release stuff like that until all cases are complete.

       I think the vegas thing is super fishy as well but just to play devils advocate one could easily say that pictures of the bomber were released because he was still an active suspect who they were trying to catch for weeks, while paddock died right away after the crime and the police weren't looking for him for weeks.

       Your timeline is off. Austin police released the FedEx video
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the guy was killed because they were, and still are, trying to get better identification and more information about the guy. They don't have any similar urgency or motivation to release surveillance video of Paddock.

       Yeah the only footage was from way earlier and they were somehow able to narrow that stuff down pretty easily. Maybe it's because he was making a complaint about slipping on the floor but shooting 100s of people would also be a notable event

       Come on people, The casinos are making sure the Casino pictures of Paddock do not make the media.  Super bad PR.  Alot of people wouldn't want to go to that casino if pictures of Paddock in the casino were floating around all over the place.

       Wearing a baseball cap to ship a package is normal. In some communities, people wear wigs more commonly than in other places.  Even wearing gloves to carry heavy packages would seem completely normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when there is a serial bomber in your area shipping packages that are killing and maiming innocent people while hundreds of law enforcement are searching for even the smallest possible clue, wearing all three obviously raised some red flags.

       So a guy who made sophisticated motion sensitive and trip line  bombs planted anonymously then decided to send one via Fedex and then blows himself up as the authorities close in. He probably achieved his goal and set up someone to be a patsy. But that person is in pieces so no questions will be asked.

       I suppose that could be but I was waiting to hear a word on a motive before I jumped to any conclusions. I did find it very strange that they initially reported these packages being delivered anonymously but then he tried to begin sending them through Fedex? Maybe got too confident but definitely raises a question mark in my eyes.

       Or, he figured someone sees a guy in normal clothes dropping a package off at their door or a neighbor’s door would be suspicious and they might call the police,  but if he gets a guy whose job it is to drop off packages to deliver his bombs no one would think twice about seeing a FedEx truck in their neighborhood.

       What I read was they had already zeroed in on him at a motel in Round Rock and while waiting for SWAT he got in his car and took off. They cornered him when he drove in to a ditch and that’s when they started firing at him prior to explosion.

       Your comments are so conflicting. “Why did they fire” and then “why did they run up to the car”
      </p>
      <p>
       What probably occurred is that he hit the ditch, SWAT hopped out of the car, saw him reaching around for shit, fired and then he detonated the device causing the SWAT members,who were probably decently close because they pulled up in a car (says they were waiting for them to arrive), and knocked one off his feet knocking wind outta him or something

       It sounds like they wern't acting with the assumption he had explosive devices with him which can't be the case. If you know a guy can detonate himself you don't get as close as you can to him, give him space and shoot or try negotiations. I wasn't there, obviosuly, but it just sounds sloppy.

       Yeah, I was wondering about that too.  Just maybe,
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       the perpetrator might possibly have been a suicide bomber for the state -- the deep state.  The government and its "national security" apparatus loves it when mayhem ensues, because their power grows exponentially: larger budgets, more draconian laws, more surveillance, even the technical invalidation of the Constitution.  Look what happened after 9/11.  The national security state's power grew ten-fold.

       Also, it is important to remember that during the polygraph exams that anyone who wants to work in intelligence has to take, they make you admit you would do anything to protect national security, including committing crimes.

       You saw that too huh? Interesting article to say the least. I like how they took the time to point out that understanding his motive wasn't extremely important.

       This is what I'm referring to. Jornalists should ask if they need a warrant to "get info from Google." Was it a wide sweep of anyone searching for info on mailing packages? Is a warrant required or is there just an understanding and working relationship between LEOs and Google?

       I thought the same thing. I mean, if that isn’t the biggest red flag to the Fedex employee I don’t know what is. Not sure on the temperature down there but gloves inside in Texas delivering a package when you have a serial package bomber?

       Done and did.  See sheriff and neighbor statements just released. Minimal social media, home schooled, not employed..... referred to as "skilled" "advanced" and "sophisticated" by various authorities as this played out  yet dumb enough to not be concerned about surveillance at any given Fed Ex flagging a ridiculous BILL AND TED'S disquise??  Yeah... totally makes sense to me.  Nothing concerning here at all.   Silly citizens asking stupid questions.... when will it end?? I need to remember to just let the authorities do their jobs without all my "questions". I'm a terrible patriot.

       Or it could be like the 9/11 Pentagon videos, where the Feds took all of them from outside businesses with absolute authority. Whereas the general public would be left with only the

       I'd imagine he convinced the guy there was no way he'd be caught if this is the case.  Possibly rallied the dude on his side and got him to do it for some perceived greater good.?  -Just spitballing explanations about why he's so dumb in execution of his plans.

       Yes we did and those photos came out shortly after the incident. There are some people that are obsessed with the idea of a luggage cart video though. I really want to know more about what happened but I don't think seeing him take his bags to his room will help.

       like we have exactly ZERO photos... but only because I think I, some rando on the internet, deserve to see the entire case, before it's even through the same legal system I would demand protect

       if I were a victim or a criminal."

       You don't someone might have been with him in the photos. Maybe there are no photos. It will answer a lot of questions. 6 months after the incident we deserve some closure.

       No, it's not.  And that's not how properly presented and
       <em>
        respected
       </em>
       theories are written.  You cannot use hyperbole if you want others to take in and grok all you are putting down; you'll lose audience the moment they think, "I think this guy is exaggerating."

       That’s not what you should get by reading my reply.  My intent is to express that
       <em>
        we could do a better job

       at curating quality content that invokes an air of documented strength and respect instead of the “omg check this out” clickbait nonsense we have now.

        WASHINGTON - More than 15 years after a fertilizer bomb was used to blow up a government building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, the federal government is proposing to regulate the sale and transfer of the chemical ammonium nitrate.

       I thought it was odd that ‘he blew himself to bits’, but witnesses didn’t hear anything or see smoke from the vehicle.

       I stand corrected, found a local news source that confirmed about a 25 minute difference in images and apprehension.

       Still don’t see the argument in “literally no reason” to release a single still image of Paddock alive inside of a casino/hotel in Vegas. What’s your reasoning there?

       Just trying to have a free discussion, really, what do you think should be added? I just hate the fact of how the Vegas shooting is such a long gone afterthought and wanted to raise some awareness again. Also the Austin bombing has been an interesting topic and I’ve seen quite a few good ideas and theories brought up throughout the comments. Open for ideas! First time poster, long time lurker, ha.

       You are obfuscating the timeline and chain of events. The Austin bomber was at large when the Fed Ex photos were released in an effort to help identify him. Stephen Paddock was killed at the site of his crime, therefore no need to identify the perpetrator.

       <p>
        Isaac Figueroa, 26, said he and his brother heard sirens and helicopters early Wednesday in the area and drove toward them, then cut through nearby woods on foot after they hit a police roadblock. Figueroa said they saw a silver or gray Jeep Cherokee that was pinned between black and white vehicles and "looked like it had been rammed off the road." He said he saw police deploy a robot to go examine the Jeep.

       From the article:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        As SWAT officers approached the suspect's vehicle, the suspect detonated a bomb inside it, killing himself. A SWAT officer, an 11-year veteran of the APD, fired on the suspect. That officer is now on administrative leave.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So the cop shot at a guy that just blew himself up. Wow, they aren't hiring the sharpest guys down there are they.

       "Police zeroed in on Conditt EARLIER IN THE WEEK and located his vehicle at a hotel on Interstate 35 in the suburb of Round Rock. Officers were WAITING FOR ARMORED VEHICLES to arrive before moving in for an arrest when HIS VEHICLE BEGAN TO DRIVE AWAY, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said at a news conference."
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) So, it took DAYS for "ARMORED VEHICLES" to arrive on the scene?! (I thought every small town now had a fleet of surplus army MRAPs ready to close in on any dime bag dealer identified by the local fusion center within minutes of AI orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Is this another case of death(s) by SELF-DRIVING CAR? Did another autonomous vehicle decide to 'one-up' the #KillerUber in Arizona by delivering package-bombs? Was it an Autonomous Amazon Automobile making deliveries? Was it KITT dropping street-mines?! Seriously, how does a serial-bomber go from his hotel room to his car and drive away when it's all been surrounded by SWAT since "earlier in the week"? Aren't these guys now trained (((in Israel))) to put 100 rounds (minimum) into kids holding Xbox controllers on their porch if so much as a cricket chirps?? (but serial bombers and church mass shooters get the kinder, gentler machine gun hand?!)

       I don't know how many times I have to explain this. These are two completely different sets of circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       FedEx bomber: The FedEx bomber is at large and his identity is unknown. In this case law enforcement publicly releases a select set of photos and possible videos as part of a public appeal to ascertain the identity of the suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock: In this case law enforcement knew the suspect's location. There was no need to appeal to the public for an identity because before law enforcement could even acquire camera footage the guy was already dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Paddock case (and other similar cases) the only ways to get the footage is through FOIA of local/state/federla law enforcement (which is usually denied due to active investigations. Just because the guy is dead doens't mean the investigation is over), or through releases in open court.

       The Fedex videos were released after he was determined to be dead. That's much different. There was no appeal to the public as far as I know. Maybe I missed something.

       Yeah, maybe so... what do you think about this footage, though?  I mean obviously it's edited, but it does show him acting along bringing in a lot of equipment, etc.  Nothing about this even hints at any contradiction to the official story.

       He brought more in himself than I would have guessed. Nothing contradicts the story that they’ve revealed, but the delay is suspect. The story changed  many times in the first week. The sherif’s first reporting differs from all subsequent updates given to the press. It looks more like an arm deal gone wrong. You don’t need that many guns to do what he did. Why the huge delay between bursts if he had 20 guns all preloaded with mags. They didn’t all have bump stocks. It looked more like he was showing someone his merchandise. Have you heard that theory?

       Yeah the changing story is certainly interesting.  Yeah I have heard about the arms deal, but I dunno, seems a little fishy, too.  Do you think the deal was for more sophisticated arms than AR-15s?  Those are pretty easy to get (I built mine in 45 minutes(legally)), so I don't know why a covert arms deal in a hotel room would be necessary.  The trunk of a car in the desert seems like a much better option haha!  That's how I'd do it.  I think all we've seen is ARs, right?  Is he shooting out of the window in an effort to demonstrate the firearms?  That seems... uncecessary.... I haven't watched the footage in a while, how long was the delay between bursts?

       What's interesting is that the official story is that he was at the Red Roof Inn off of I-35 surrounded while police waited for ballistic vehicles, yet he was allowed to conveniently drive off... Meanwhile according to local news sources the motel is denying that he ever stayed there and that the "chase" did not start in their parking lot.

Austin Bomber I think is to misdirect us from Tim! Two weeks after he went missing CDC ask for 400 million for new facility, due to un fixable things in the current cdc building.

       Is anyone really surprised? The power the MGM wields in Las Vegas and elsewhere is stunning. Think about that--not a single leak of any photo or video! That's not an accident. That is incredible power and damage control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's right, but based on the fact that there have been no leaks or releases of photos from a place that is heavily monitored goes to show that something massive is happening in Las Vegas.

       I just found it interesting that the first thing I read about this mentioned that he was white and a racist.
Compare this to every single muslim terror attack [bar one maybe], where they are all called mentally ill and lone wolves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like equality but we are not getting it. If it is ok to belive this man is sane and a racist, why not believe that all the 'lone wolf' muslim attacks are also done by sane muslim racists?

       Yes, let’s just trust lawmakers and politicians to legislate where to draw this line between guns you’re ok with and guns you aren’t ok with. They’re experts in weaponry. 
More laws. More laws. Hell, look at the war on drugs, that’s working 😂😂😂😂

       I certainly agree that the lack of transpernacy breeds wild speculation. No evidence points to it being an arms deal and no evidence in Paddocks back story fit it either.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a defense contractor but there are over a million of those in the US. The plane stuff was iffy at best because he it changed hands multiple times after Paddock sold it.
