<p>Is this why trending hashtags and topics suddenly vanish? </p>

<p>This Saudi Prince is also the second largest shareholder after the Murdoch family in Fox News-owner News Corp., and also owns substantial stakes in Time Warner, Citigroup, General Motors and Apple. </p>

<p>Edit: What stake do Saudis have in Facebook? Reddit&#39;s owners Conde Naste? Perhaps someone can check.</p>

<p>Yes, Saudi Arabia is the same country that exports extremism globally, provides &#39;logistical and clandestine&#39; support for Isis, murders gay people, threatened the head of the UN so that it was removed from a list of child-killing countries and is currently committing war crimes, with the support of the US and UK, in Yemen. </p>

<p>They also appear to have had major influence in Brexit with Saudi intel giving money to the DUP, a small extremist party, that currently props up the Conservative/Tory government in UK as well donating and giving gifts to the Tory party directly. Can anyone imagine the shitstorm if this was Russia or another country?</p>

<p>And these aren&#39;t wild claims. Sources are below...</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/06/09/u-n-chief-admits-he-removed-saudi-arabia-from-child-killer-list-due-to-extortion/">UN chief admits he removed <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> from child-killer list due to extortion</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hillary-clinton-wikileaks-email-isis-saudi-arabia-qatar-us-allies-funding-barack-obama-knew-all-a7362071.html">We finally know what Hillary Clinton knew all along – US allies <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> and Qatar are funding Isis</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line">The paper drew on classified intelligence from numerous agencies: ‘Turkey and <strong>Saudi-based</strong> chemical facilitators,’ it said, ‘were attempting to obtain sarin precursors in bulk, tens of kilograms, likely for the anticipated large scale production effort in Syria.’</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line">By the terms of the agreement, funding came from Turkey, as well as <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> and Qatar; the CIA, with the support of MI6, was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi’s arsenals into Syria. A number of front companies were set up in Libya, some under the cover of Australian entities. Retired American soldiers, who didn’t always know who was really employing them, were hired to manage procurement and shipping. The operation was run by David Petraeus, the CIA director who would soon resign when it became known he was having an affair with his biographer.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/prince-mohammed-bin-salman-naive-arrogant-saudi-prince-is-playing-with-fire-a6804481.html">&quot;In Syria, in early 2015, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> supported the creation of the Army of Conquest, primarily made up of the al-Qaeda affiliate the al-Nusra Front and the ideologically similar Ahrar al-Sham, which won a series of victories against the Syrian Army in Idlib province.&quot;</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism#Saudi_Arabia">While the Saudi government denies claims that it exports religious or cultural extremism, it is argued that by its nature, Wahhabism encourages intolerance and promotes terrorism.[115] Former CIA director James Woolsey described it as &quot;the soil in which Al-Qaeda and its sister terrorist organizations are flourishing.&quot;[116] In 2015, Sigmar Gabriel, Vice-Chancellor of Germany, accused Saudi Arabia of supporting intolerance and extremism, saying: &quot;Wahhabi mosques are financed all over the world by Saudi Arabia. In Germany, many dangerous Islamists come from these communities.&quot;[117][118] In May 2016, The New York Times editorialised that the kingdom allied to the U.S. had &quot;spent untold millions promoting Wahhabism, the radical form of Sunni Islam that inspired the 9/11 hijackers and that now inflames the Islamic State&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism#Saudi_Arabia"><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> is said to be the world&#39;s largest source of funds and promoter of Salafist jihadism,[97] which forms the ideological basis of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, Taliban, ISIS and others. Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide, according to Hillary Clinton.[98] According to a secret December 2009 paper signed by the US secretary of state, &quot;Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaida, the Taliban, LeT and other terrorist groups.&quot;</a> </p>

<p>Meanwhile:</p>

<p>NY Times: <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/politics/hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign-charity.html">Saudi Arabia has been a particularly generous benefactor. The kingdom gave between $10 million and $25 million to the Clinton Foundation.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/871998983882891264">Britain&#39;s Tory government did secret deal to place Saudi Arabia on UN Human Rights Committee</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s infuriating. Their tentacles spread so far and wide. It&#39;s an actual rogue terrorist state - literally Isis with an actual state and an airforce. And this without mentioning 9/11, the redacted 28 pages or the fact 19 of the hijackers came from Saudi.</p>

<p>Where are the sanctions? Diplomats expelled? Bank accounts frozen? Punishment for the Isis terror attacks in the West and war crimes in Yemen. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t happen, because it has so much cash it is able to buy up Western politicians and the West&#39;s propaganda tools (social media) and prevent any dissent. Instead the US, the UK and other Western countries roll out the red carpets for their visiting rulers and sell them billions in weapons.</p>

<p>The latest being the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/20/us-saudi-arabia-seal-weapons-deal-worth-nearly-110-billion-as-trump-begins-visit.html">$350 billion weapons deal under the Trump admin</a>.</p>

<p>And this is shit:</p>

<p>&quot;Prince Mohammed bin Salman is already the most dominant Arab leader in a generation. His reforms inside Saudi Arabia have been revolutionary. He’s emancipating women, introducing music and cinema and cracking down on corruption in a land with 15K princes.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Yemeni war is a big deal and that&#39;s barely brought up.  I&#39;d assume we don&#39;t hear about it because the Saudis are losing.  What i don&#39;t understand is why they are losing.  They have american tech, unlimited funds and a land route to their enemy that is under siege by sea.  I follow on r/Yemenicrisis and the saudi big wins are blowing up hospitals and holding school teachers salaries at port.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent 3 months in that accursed country.  Been to more than a few places, but this one definitely seemed like hell on earth.  120+ degrees and a nice hot wind to go with it.  The Saudis hated Americans, but saw us as hired thugs, so they tolerated our use of certain facilities in and around Riyadh.  However, what was most telling to me was that they refused to speak Arabic with our linguists.  Any time one of them tried to start a conversation in Arabic, they would reply in English with something to the effect of &quot;oh, you speak very nice Arabic.&quot;  Apparently we were not good enough to speak the language of the enlightened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very informative post.  However, I have to ask this, why in the world is this sub so infatuated with Hillary.  She&#39;s a defeated candidate, a past SoS, and that&#39;s it.  Obama was the President, he knew the same stuff she did.  Why the obsession? A vast majority of posts seem to want to reference her and what she did and did not know.  Why the persistent attacks on her?  She&#39;s out of and without power?  It seems weird.  Of course it&#39;s weird when Trump does it but, he only does it because he&#39;s a traitorous idiot who&#39;s trying to deflect from all the shit he&#39;s doing it.  </p>

<p>But why are the folks on this sub so hung up over her? </p>
