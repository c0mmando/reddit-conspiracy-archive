       Ss: Trump has removed everyone who supported JCPOA and replaced them with AIPAC antiJCPOA people. This was a coordinated scheduled thing. Mattis is the only one left. Now that Iranians and Russians are indicted, with or without Trump, the Iran war will go on.

       Yeah.  I know.  The piece of shit, asshole war mongers could then/probably will just launch some heinous 911-like false flag and blame it on Iran/Russia.

       Again, however, I'm really hoping the public will be at this point at least somewhat wise enough to know the horrible m.o. of these psychopathic demons and really dig into any supposed

       I’m not sure this was ever really a functioning Democracy, to be completely honest.  It’s just that the internet is now making information much more widely accessible and available to pretty much everyone - so now anyone can really know and educate themselves with regard to what the truth of history really is and just how utterly evil and full of shit TPTB are and have literally always, always been.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system isn't “currently failing”.  We’re just now waking up to the fact that things have
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been failing.  More and more people are just waking up to the fact that it’s pretty much
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been a failure in many, many ways, for many, many people and groups in this society.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the more that folks find out about this, the more people who previously might have thought themselves unaffected by any of it begin to wake up to the way that this malady does indeed reach out and affect them directly as well.

       Well, I wouldn’t exactly go
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       far, as there are a lot of rich hard workers and lazy 99%ers.  The key isn’t so much in the hard work that one does one way or the other as much as it is about the positive or negative intent that one imbues in what they do regardless of whether they work hard at it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d rather have someone who generally doesn’t work too much, but when they do work, it’s for the good of everyone, than someone who’s a super hard worker, but it’s only to benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else around - and what they do is regularly enough to the
       <em>
        detriment
       </em>
       of everyone around.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s horrible - and it seems pretty much like the m.o. of TPTB to a significant enough extent.

       Among other things they try to shut down, yes.  This much seems definitely correct.  I don’t disagree with you.

       Which is why we are seeing this sudden rush to censor and control the internet. The MSM is under control and will always promote the war and back the MIC, while ignoring, or grossly minimizing anti-war protests and dissenting opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fabricating a reality in the MSM was working well before, but the free and open internet has been tearing at the fabric of the carefully crafted MSM reality, making it much harder to lie to the people and pull the woll over thee eyes of the sheep.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The MSM is under control and will always promote the war, hail Zionism, and back the MIC, while ignoring, or grossly minimizing any anti-war protests and dissenting, inconvenient, opinions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The more power and attention we keep giving the MSM, the more strength they will have to keep lying to us and clouding our minds with debilitating propaganda.  The more we all step away from the MSM and pay it no attention, the less we will be able to be manipulated.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fabricating a reality in the MSM was working well before, but the free and open internet has been tearing at the fabric of the carefully crafted MSM reality, making it much harder to lie to the people and pull the wool over the eyes of the sheep.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Exactly this.  This is the very reason, as you said, why TPTB have been rushing and fighting so hard to shut down and control the internet.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The information war is a critical component for TPTB's grip on the reality they want the people to experience.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yep.  Correct.  And they’re having a pretty hard time keeping a lid on their lies because of the internet.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They have to get the internet under control before they can start another major war.

      <p>
       We’re definitely saying the same thing sir.  Yes.

        ...but they are working tirelessly now on doing just that.

       Well-said - and not just because it’s what I would have stated. ;)

       Oh! How important "...Iranians and Russians are indicted...." How's that going to stop the hypersonic cruise missile from sinking an aircraft carrier and her crew? Will it protect the people in Tel Aviv from the hard radiation and blast waves? Will it stop the plutonium clouds from wrapping the world in their death grip? Can you at least wipe up the blood you hack up, or can it be used like a dustpan to sweep up the hair that falls out in chunks as you bump around your house blinded by the sudden flash of light while you slowly die?

       I was saying that for the benefit of the other dummies who don't know Iran has no nukes. It will be a privately owned weapon, one taken off a transport plane by a civilian contractor, probably from Turkey who wants to murder the Kurds while Israel massacres Iran followed by Russia blowing up the US Navy and perhaps the Pakistanis will take the blame and get blown up by India. China receiving the bulk of the radiation will demand cease fires but their own hotheads will probably go live with Kiloton range missiles. Angry, Israeli sub commanders will take out capitals of countries they are upset with.

       That woukd be a nutty progression. I believe the 12 missing micronukes from turkey will show up in Damascus. This will spur a huge crisis. They will "have evidwnce linking Iran. America Israel and Russia will make a super unlikely treaty work. Russia gets sanctions lifted and turna their back of Iran. Syria gets taken over by amerisrael. Iran will be taken by Russia. The corruption charges Netanyahu did business with Russian oligarchs will die. The trump russia collusion will drop. Its almost the only way Netanyahu and trump can sace face.

       They each have their own math and break down. Dependent on how each acts, the model changes. It is constant in its measurements bit constantly changing on how it assess each measurement. I think the ISI has way bigger role than many will admit as the relationship is fragile. Everyone wants to be tough and flex. Few actually care to sit down in unbiased agreement free of capitalist getting a piece of it....
