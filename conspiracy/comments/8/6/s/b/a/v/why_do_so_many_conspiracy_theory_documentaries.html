      <ol>
       <li>
        People are sensational and will do anything for views

       <li>
        Discredits actual conspiracies
       </li>
       <li>
        They intentionally say crazy shit so as to not get targeted or end up suicided( shot in the head twice or something )
       </li>
       <li>
        Some People actually believe in the supernatural and its role on mankind
       </li>
       <li>
        Conspiracies tend to look for answers and all we can do is speculate / add some imagination = gay frog aliens are eating magical babies .

       Everyone I have met that believes in magic is wrong about those non-magic things which I am competent to judge, so if they are not competent to evaluate evidence for easily identified reality, then they are not competent to judge occulted reality.

       Because magic is used by the elite to control the population. They keep magic a secret so regular people won’t know its being used against them. Magic is created by the persons energy, this being willpower intent and imagination. To utilize magic one needs to be a “perfect” being so to say.

      <p>
       There is many research done but few of the results reach the main public and there is enough stuff hidden in the past. Think of how Nikola Tesla and Carl Reich were treated. Why was this done, could it be this knowledge was not ment to be know to the public?

       Even with the qualifier you'd be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's had its time in the mainstream. In many places it still does (two of Sweden's largest scientific university still do research on the matter). Any push out into the fringe owes itself to centuries of failure, fraud, and shoddy - wishful - research. The results have reached the main public and could again, if you took the massive effort to google it: spoilers, there's nothing.

       Tesla shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as magic and the paranormal: *
       <em>
        the man actually contributed real-world results

       . And without ad-hoc excuses of "you just gotta believe", at that.

       Just becouse you think this reality is solid and real does not mean it is so. Tesla stated everything is energy, frequency and vibration, Einstein though reality is an ilusion, albeit a resiliant one and quantem mechanics proves both statements.

       If that is the definition you want to devolve magic to: then why the hell bother with the semantics of "magic"? All you have then is an aspect of our natural we do not yet understand (and which some people claim involvement with and are unable to substantiate).

       Sure if you want that to be the only implication these experiments have you may think that. But from my perpective there is much more prove in these experiments to explain the reality of our "reality".

       There is no magic, only use of energy and we Humans make use of this energy all the time. It apears as magic to some becouse they lack the knowledge behind this natural power we all have.

      <p>
       The Electric Universe theory combined with vortex math provide for me all technical explanations for this "reality" and the "magic" behind. Ofcourse this information is combined with a lot of other knowledge i have gatherd through out my whole life, but it enough for me to know and understand our existance is just a figment of an imagination.

       Ah you doubt, but you don't ask. What is your problem with the Electric Universe theory, the folks there have some correct predictions on NASAs own mission while NASA was stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The work of Nassim Haramein almost proves an energetic logic in our "reality" and vortex math and the numbers 3, 6 and 9 can explain that logic. The work of Itzak Bentov is also very interesting becouse he was almost able to link science with the "super" natural.

       My problem with EU is that isn't a
       <strong>
        theory
       </strong>
       (in that it is not a functioning explanation of the natural world that can be repeatedly tested) and that it doesn't make any actual predictions. There is no "if law X is true then we will find phenomena Y here" in EU.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no inventors making breakthroughs through EU science. No discoveries being made through the lens of EU theory. Not even any innovation building off of the "more correct cosmological view" offered by Electric Universe. It contributes
       <strong>
        nothing
       </strong>
       but inflated egos and fringe beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how you're constantly wheeling and whirring off and on to the next "theory": the next shoddy construct meant to justify the central belief in a magical cosmos, where humans can "use energy" in a manner you find personally pleasing. Science doesn't enter into it: you clearly disapprove of it and the skepticism it requires.

       A real magician wouldn’t even consider it.  It’s just not in their personality to do it. It’s extremely rare to find a genuine magician. And that magician won’t show to the world they are one. Because the dark magicians will hunt hen down. Plain  and simple.

       Define a "real magician". What is it that precludes anyone self-less and interested in the betterment of his fellow man from working magic? Your description certainly requires something of the sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that the dark magicians can cooperate? You refer to them as "they" and plural in their hunting down of a "renegade sorcerer". So the evil elite can gather and share ability, but the not-evil practitioners are compulsive lone-wolves?

       I don’t know this. This is theory based on studying and meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A real magician knows the universal laws with regards to the macro and micro. Not everybody can work with magic because when you do mess with these energies you risk hurting yourself and others.   You expose yourself to energies that will influence you negatively if you havnt gone through the prerequisites/training. It takes a lifetime to master. A master would be a perfect being in a sense that he does not have any negative attributes, they have all been transmuted into positive ones. This is alchemy of the self.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion a sorcerer is a fake magician. A sorcerer is a trickster and energy harvester. A magician you can say is the opposite. The evil ones can work together same as the good ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was a magician isn’t going to expose themselves to the world because they will be hunted down because they are powerful people. It’s karma. You expose yourself to the world and naturally you will be sought out because your asking for it.

       Again:
       <strong>
        What prevents someone who works magic from necessarily being courageous and selfless enough to inform people of the evil at work?
       </strong>
       There literally are no "good masters" interested in quite
       <strong>
        massively
       </strong>
       expanding the potential combatants against "the elite" by telling the world the truth?  People have sacrificed themselves for far far far less, under terribly gruesome circumstances (a certain burning monk comes to mind), than the conspiracy you're proposing.

       Depends on your definition of magic. If it's the more exotic variety with tangible effects on the world achieved through extra-normal means: no. If it's the one the discussion reduces to when the threat of "evidence" shows up, I guess I'm performing it right: there's a "will" at work, after all.

       You realize that Einstein believed time travel was possible, right? They may seem ridiculous, but that doesn't make them false.
      </p>
      <p>
       And magic is definitely a real thing as well. I've taken courses on Ancient Greek and Egyptian magic. It is a well documented phenomena of a lot of ancient cultures.

       I just think its too far fetched to make it work.

       Well, how scientific. You watch Harry Potter and think you know all there is to magic. And a wormhole in space time is just too far fetched to be real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd suggest looking into Einstein or tesla. Tesla especially.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to learn more about ancient magic, hermeticism is a good place to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be so quick to dismiss something just because you've given it a glance and it doesn't make sense to you right away. That's how humans stop learning and growing.

       The rabbit hole goes pretty deep.  Ask yourself, why are the elite so very interested in the occult?  "Magic" and time travel may seem like bullshit to you, but that's possibly because there's some missing links in
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       knowledge.

       If the main theory in this documentary isn't a secret plan orchestrated by two or more people to do something illegal, then it isn't a conspiracy at all.

       Get perspective first, kiddo: only a few go into time travel. The vast, vast majority delve into government + corporate conspiracies.

       Which if you hear and believe one side of it exists (worshiping and sacrificing to Evil entities for fame and fortune) then you have to believe he other side exists which is why a lot of “conspiracy theorists” are also believers of Jesus.
