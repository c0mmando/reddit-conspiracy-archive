<p>There is many research done but few of the results reach the main public and there is enough stuff hidden in the past. Think of how Nikola Tesla and Carl Reich were treated. Why was this done, could it be this knowledge was not ment to be know to the public?</p>

<p>Rupert Sheldrake has something to say about mainstream science you might be interested in:

<p>It&#39;s had its time in the mainstream. In many places it still does (two of Sweden&#39;s largest scientific university still do research on the matter).

The results have reached the main public and could again, if you took the massive effort to google it: spoilers, there&#39;s nothing. </p>

<p>Tesla shouldn&#39;t even be mentioned in the same breath as magic and the paranormal: *<em>the man actually contributed real-world results</em>. And without ad-hoc excuses of &quot;you just gotta believe&quot;, at that.</p>

<p>You tell me. Oh wait, you&#39;d be violating my free will by offering anything of merit or substance to your claims. </p>

<p>If that is the definition you want to devolve magic to: then why the hell bother with the semantics of &quot;magic&quot;? All you have then is an aspect of our natural we do not yet understand (and which some people claim involvement with and are unable to substantiate). </p>

<p>No, no, and no: none of those do anything of the sort and <strong>observe in the scientific sense of the experiments involved implies something completely different from just eyeing it up with your peepers</strong>. Tools were used to make the phenomena quantifiable - to observe and measure and interact with them - and it is this &quot;observation&quot; they&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Sure if you want that to be the only implication these experiments have you may think that. But from my perpective there is much more prove in these experiments to explain the reality of our &quot;reality&quot;.</p>

<p>Considering your touting of a <strong>very</strong> basic misunderstanding of quantum mechanics, I highly doubt there&#39;s any math or actual theorizing that&#39;s gone into your beliefs. Believing there&#39;s exotic &quot;use of energy&quot; requires a veneer of justification and stuff like &quot;vortex math&quot; offers it to you, and that&#39;s that.</p>

<p>The work of Nassim Haramein almost proves an energetic logic in our &quot;reality&quot; and vortex math and the numbers 3, 6 and 9 can explain that logic. The work of Itzak Bentov is also very interesting becouse he was almost able to link science with the &quot;super&quot; natural.</p>

<p>You have clearly showed me your use of free will a couple of times now and seeing you only are interested in the frase &quot;there is no magic&quot; without understanding or denying the contex i intended, i will stop with this conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with EU is that isn&#39;t a <strong>theory</strong>(in that it is not a functioning explanation of the natural world that can be repeatedly tested) and that it doesn&#39;t make any actual predictions.

<p>There are no inventors making breakthroughs through EU science. No discoveries being made through the lens of EU theory.

    <div class="md"><p>How can you possibly know this, if they don&#39;t reveal anything? </p>

<p>Define a &quot;real magician&quot;. What is it that precludes anyone self-less and interested in the betterment of his fellow man from working magic? Your description certainly requires something of the sort. </p>

<p>Why is it that the dark magicians can cooperate? You refer to them as &quot;they&quot; and plural in their hunting down of a &quot;renegade sorcerer&quot;. So the evil elite can gather and share ability, but the not-evil practitioners are compulsive lone-wolves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know this. This is theory based on studying and meditation. </p>

<p>A real magician knows the universal laws with regards to the macro and micro. Not everybody can work with magic because when you do mess with these energies you risk hurting yourself and others.   You expose yourself to energies that will influence you negatively if you havnt gone through the prerequisites/training. It takes a lifetime to master. A master would be a perfect being in a sense that he does not have any negative attributes, they have all been transmuted into positive ones. This is alchemy of the self. </p>

<p>In my opinion a sorcerer is a fake magician. A sorcerer is a trickster and energy harvester. A magician you can say is the opposite. The evil ones can work together same as the good ones. </p>

<p>My point was a magician isn’t going to expose themselves to the world because they will be hunted down because they are powerful people. It’s karma. You expose yourself to the world and naturally you will be sought out because your asking for it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again: <strong>What prevents someone who works magic from necessarily being courageous and selfless enough to inform people of the evil at work?</strong> There literally are no &quot;good masters&quot; interested in quite <strong>massively</strong> expanding the potential combatants against &quot;the elite&quot; by telling the world the truth?  People have sacrificed themselves for far far far less, under terribly gruesome circumstances (a certain burning monk comes to mind), than the conspiracy you&#39;re proposing. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t really call this a &quot;theory&quot;. This sounds like a personal extrapolation off of the available information to explain the current situation.</p>

<p>The term you&#39;re looking for his &quot;headcanon&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Thanks for clarifying things.</p>

<p>Depends on your definition of magic. If it&#39;s the more exotic variety with tangible effects on the world achieved through extra-normal means: no. If it&#39;s the one the discussion reduces to when the threat of &quot;evidence&quot; shows up, I guess I&#39;m performing it right: there&#39;s a &quot;will&quot; at work, after all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, how scientific. You watch Harry Potter and think you know all there is to magic. And a wormhole in space time is just too far fetched to be real. </p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest looking into Einstein or tesla. Tesla especially.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about ancient magic, hermeticism is a good place to start.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be so quick to dismiss something just because you&#39;ve given it a glance and it doesn&#39;t make sense to you right away. That&#39;s how humans stop learning and growing.</p>
