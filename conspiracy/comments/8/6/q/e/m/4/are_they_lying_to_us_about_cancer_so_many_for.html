<h1>A One-Eyed Dog Discovered Her Owner Had Skin Cancer</h1>

<p>A woman in Buffalo, New York, learned the true meaning of puppy love when her dog found a cancerous lump near her nose, which she initially thought was just a scratch. Lauren Gauthier adopted her one-eyed Teeing Walker Coonhound, Victoria, eight months ago, and the dog recently began sniffing her nose and would make a funny face each time. That tipped off Gauthier and made her realize something was wrong.</p>

<p>“She started smelling a specific area of my nose to the extent that she would actually touch her nose to mine where the cancer is and lean back and look at me and smell it again and look at me,” Gauthier told Inside Edition. She also noted her dog wasn’t trained to be a detection dog.</p>

<p>Gauthier said she eventually went to the doctor, who later determined it was basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/an-adopted-dog-detected-skin-cancer-on-her-owners-nose.html">https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/an-adopted-dog-detected-skin-cancer-on-her-owners-nose.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some studies have confirmed the ability of trained dogs to detect the skin cancer melanoma by just sniffing the skin lesions. Furthermore, some researchers have proven that dogs can detect prostate cancer by simply smelling patients&#39; urine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how can dogs smell cancer if cancer is just human cells rapidly multiplying?</p>

<p>What if cancer isn&#39;t human cells at all - what if its something a dog definitely can smell - fungus?</p>

<p>Cancer treatments make us sicker because methods to kill of human cells that are rapidly multiplying will also kill healthy cells too.</p>

<p>However, if cancer is a fungus we can kill off the fungus cells in a way that is safe for human cells.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a doctor who did just that - using baking soda. And his theory has been confirmed by mouse studies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The present study investigates whether inhibition of this tumor acidity will reduce the incidence of in vivo metastases. Here, we show that oral NaHCO(3) selectively increased the pH of tumors and reduced the formation of spontaneous metastases in mouse models of metastatic breast cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think? Could cancer be a fungus? Here are some more features of cancer which don&#39;t make sense from the &quot;human cells&quot; model:</p>

<p>-instead of fully respiring in the presence of adequate oxygen, cancer cells ferment.</p>

<p>Why would the fungus model of cancer be suppressed? Money? Or is it an effective assassination technique with plausible deniability?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cancer is two things:</p>

<p>(1) a natural result of our insane number of cells resulting in an eventual malfunction</p>

<p>(2) an increased amount of carcinogens in our environment making that malfunction more probable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>Our various cells are not reproducing perfectly.</p>

<p>Most of the time, our bodies can counteract rogue cell division.</p>

<p>Sometimes, under stress or with the lack of good nutrition (the broader immune system), those rogue cells keep dividing out of control and wreck the complicated symbiosis that our bodies are.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what we call cancer.</p>

<p>It happens naturally. It can happen more readily if environmental factors help create more rogue cells.</p>

<p>We all have &quot;tumors&quot; all the time. However, mostly their killed off or don&#39;t spread. We&#39;ve evolved to do that. Cancer is what we call it when there are too many for our bodies to fight off, or when our bodies are too weak to combat it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“The Hedgehog pathway was first identified for its role in controlling how the fruit fly’s body is divided into segments. Fly embryos lacking the pathway’s key protein messenger resembled spiny hedgehogs. Proteins in the pathway relay vital signals for cells to grow and divide in embryos and tumors. In healthy adult cells, the pathway is mostly involved in maintaining and repairing tissues. It also plays a role in regulating how stem cells generate different cell types.</p>

<p>Researchers previously showed that mice with improperly activated or absent Hedgehog proteins can develop cancers and deformed vital organs.” </p>

<p>You’re bullshit claim that cancer IS a fungus because a fungal cream inhibits a signaling pathway present in almost every animal phyla next to sponges and cnidarians is laughable at best. You know there are cancer drugs like Vismodegib that do the exact same thing and are not anti fungal, right? The anti fungal has been repurposed because it’s cheaper to take existing than create new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, if the body is surrounding a fungus with a wall of human cells, it&#39;s still uncontrolled cell mutation and division. </p>

<p>There are a lot of things that can cause this. </p>

<p>Skin would be prone to contact with fungus, so it&#39;s possible that a fungus could be carcinogenic. </p>

<p>Hell. It&#39;s probable that there are carcinogenic fungus. </p>

<p>But the cause of cancer is uncontrolled cell division.</p>

<p>When the body comes into contact with something that damages it, it rebuilds the cells through mitosis. A copying process of DNA replication. </p>

<p>Picture taking a xerox of a xerox of a xerox of a xerox etc. </p>

<p>Eventually, you get mutations. </p>

<p>When the body recognizes that it&#39;s causing mutated cells, it goes into overdrive trying to produce a proper copy.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it just keeps producing copies of mutated cells sometimes and they form malignant tumors.</p>

<p>But yeah, fungus could be carcinogenic. I&#39;m not a professional myco-oncologist. </p>

<p>Not even close. Drugs are not hyper-targeted things that only have one method of action (for instance I&#39;m currently on an anti-bacterial initially used to treat leprosy for a skin condition in which bacteria do not have a role). You&#39;ll note that itraconazole treats specific cancers by blocking the Hedgehog pathway (this is how researchers found that the drug may be useful for certain cancers -- by looking for drugs with that effect); this is a pathway that does not exist in fungi - its method of action of fungi and its method of action of cancers are distinct. You&#39;ll further note that itraconazole is less effective than vismodegib, a drug which specifically targets the Hedgehog pathway and is not an anti-fungal. This strongly suggests that the anti-fungal properties of itraconazole are not useful in treating cancer. </p>

<p>Ultimately, there are many different diseases, different causes, different courses of action that amount to cancer -- there almost certainly isn&#39;t &quot;<strong>a</strong> cure&quot;. Different forms, with different underlying causes, will likely require different forms of treatment. Some of those may well be triggered of fungi (but tumours are not fungi -- that would be immediately verifiable by examining excised tumours), but your link rather strongly suggests that is not the case here.</p>

<p>Further &quot;[a]nd his theory has been confirmed by mouse studies&quot; is <em>hugely</em> overstating the results of that study. It found, for some types of tumour, it &quot;inhibits spontaneous metastases&quot; -- that is to say, it reduces the <em>spread</em> of the cancer to other parts of the body. If you read the <a href="http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/69/6/2260.long#sec-2">full text</a>, you find that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bicarbonate therapy had no effect on [...] the rates of growth of the primary tumors. [...] The lack of an effect on the growth of the primary tumors (P = 0.80) is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1B to D. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or to put it another way, NaHCO3 is <strong>not</strong> a cure for cancer. Whilst it&#39;s a potentially useful result in controlling the spread, it&#39;s still a long way from leading to a cure, and is inconsistent with the motion that tumours are fungal in nature.</p>

<p>On a final note, you mention Tullio Simoncini in some of your other posts. If his new model of cancer is conclusive as he claims, I suspect there would not be two documented cases of death following his treatments.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t arbitrarily up the dosage of Sodium Bicarbonate -- in sufficient quantities it is directly toxic (and FWIW it&#39;s your source - I don&#39;t know why you would cite it if you later claim the drug is being used improperly). Which brings me to my next point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t referring to people who have been treated and later died. I was referring to people who have died <em>as a result</em> of the treatment. See, e.g.,:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2015/07/16/trial-for-bicarbonate-of-soda-death_04025602-9b40-4197-bac3-95b43bf8de49.html">Luca Olivotto, 27, died in a clinic in Tirana, Albania, in 2012, after he was administered the bicarbonate of soda. According to records his cause of death was &quot;metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a></p>

<p>Why does this treatment work? Because Dr. Simoncini maintains that cancer is a fungus. Therefore, just as millions of women who treat their Candida infections with baking soda have discovered, fungus does not do well with baking soda!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a claim, not a source -- there is zero independent verification, or even discussion, of the results, and the line that the 90% figure comes from makes little sense:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the fungus are sensible to the sodium bicarbonate solutions and the tumour is smaller  than 3 cm, the percentage will be around the 90%</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does &quot;sensible to the sodium bicarbonate solutions&quot; mean? The only reading I can come up with is that it means the sodium bicarbonate is effective (which artificially raises the number by excluding tumours where it _isn&#39;t effective), and if you are only accounting for those why is the figure only 90%? &quot;The 10% failure rate is due to bone cancers&quot; is also not supported by the direct quotes from Simoncini -- the only mention of the bones is where he claims that radiotherapy is useful with &quot;<strong>simultaneous administration of bicarbonates</strong>&quot;. Your link contradicts itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>90% is much better than 5%, you would agree?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are comparing <em>very</em> different figures. Your 5% figure comes from &quot;late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized)&quot;, whereas your 90% figure comes from &quot;the tumour is smaller than 3 cm&quot; and Simoncini makes specific reference to breast cancers of this size. Let&#39;s see what the five year survival rate for breast cancer is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/breast-cancer/statistics">The average 5-year survival rate for people with breast cancer is <strong>90%</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even by his own claims, his unproven treatments and unverified results (we have no records to indicate that 90% did in fact survive and were only treated with bicarbonate, nor do we know how many people have been treated) are <strong>no better</strong> than conventional medicine.</p>

<p>Further, referring to a single tumour of small size suggests that the cancer has not spread:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/breast-cancer/statistics">If the cancer is located only in the breast, the 5-year relative survival rate of people with breast cancer is <strong>99%</strong></a></p>

<p>99% is much better than 90%, you would agree? Even if the cancer has begun to spread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/breast-cancer/statistics">If the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is <strong>85%</strong></a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the cause is toxic industries; I think there&#39;s a single cause and it&#39;s something that is either too integrated into our society, or too profitable/useful to the PTB to be removed.<br/>
Another possibility is that it was intentionally introduced to our societies to kill older people who provide no value to the PTB, and, in fact, only causes problems for them. The cancer milks these older people of all of their savings then kills them. The fact that some younger people get cancer is an unwanted but acceptable side effect, the same way some sexually conservative people end up with AIDS even though AIDS was engineered for homosexuals and other &#39;sexual deviants&#39;.</p>

<p>You only think it is a single cause because you want it to be one. Or you think there&#39;s a conspiracy because then you can be blame someone. Sadly it&#39;s not that simple.

There&#39;s trillions to be made off of cancer treatment and &#39;research&#39; and nothing to be made from curing cancer.<br/>
The ACS works with the FDA, on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry, to ensure that any cure is dismissed as &#39;unsafe&#39;.<br/>
The situation is same in every other country where advanced research is taking place. All it takes is corrupting or replacing a few key regulators, and that&#39;s something the pharmaceutical industry in really good at.</p>

I believe it can exist in a dormant state and only starts to take over when the body is stressed in other ways.

I have no interest in ever seeing a Western doctor and getting on one of their plans that is just an endless loop of medication and no cures.  Trust your health to yourself.</p>
