<p><a href="http://www.truthinourtime.com/2010/09/04/how-zuckerberg-stole-facebook/">http://www.truthinourtime.com/2010/09/04/how-zuckerberg-stole-facebook/</a></p>

<p><strong>And called his users &quot;dumb fucks</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>,
Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard</p>

<p>Zuck: Just ask. </p>

<p>Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS</p>

<p>[Redacted Friend&#39;s Name]: What? How&#39;d you manage that one?</p>

<p>Zuck: People just submitted it. </p>

<p>Zuck: I don&#39;t know why. </p>

<p>Zuck: They &quot;trust me&quot; </p>

<p>Zuck: Dumb fucks.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>They knew the service was addictive:</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<em>The thought process was all about, ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?’,” he said. “And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever, and that’s going to get you to contribute more content, and that’s going to get you more likes and comments. It’s a social validation feedback loop. … You’re exploiting a vulnerabilty in human psychology.”</em></p>

<p><strong>They also purposely manipulated users emotions</strong></p>

<p><em>Facebook conducted a massive psychological experiment on 689,003 users, manipulating their news feeds to assess the effects on their emotions.    The details of the experiment were published in an article entitled &quot;Experimental Evidence Of Massive-Scale Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks&quot; published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/06/28/facebook-manipulated-user-news-feeds-to-create-emotional-contagion/#799bfa039dc7">https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/06/28/facebook-manipulated-user-news-feeds-to-create-emotional-contagion/#799bfa039dc7</a></p>

<p><strong>And they stole your privacy and sold everything they could find out about you. From tracking and showing people where you are (at first they actually turned this on for users without their permission</strong>)</p>

<p>&quot;Just because Facebook has moved on to virtual reality face gear and drones doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve forgotten their core competency: stalking. The company just launched an optional &quot;Nearby Friends&quot; feature that will let you &quot;continuously&quot; track friends like they were Jason Bourne.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/facebook-lets-you-track-friends-precise-location-throug-1564328515">http://valleywag.gawker.com/facebook-lets-you-track-friends-precise-location-throug-1564328515</a></p>

<p><strong>To tracking you online</strong>:</p>

<p>&quot;Over the weekend, Dave Winer wrote an article at Scripting.com explaining how Facebook keeps track of where you are on the web after logging in, without your consent. Nik Cubrilovic dug a little deeper, and discovered that Facebook can still track where you are, even if you log out&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/5843969/facebook-is-tracking-your-every-move-on-the-web-heres-how-to-stop-it">https://lifehacker.com/5843969/facebook-is-tracking-your-every-move-on-the-web-heres-how-to-stop-it</a></p>

<p>To locking users out and <strong>forcing them to upload a goverment ID</strong> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2013/10/29/facebook-asking-locked-users-provide-government-id/">https://www.ghacks.net/2013/10/29/facebook-asking-locked-users-provide-government-id/</a></p>

<p>&quot;If you have opened Twitter today you may have noticed an increase in messages reporting that the social media site Facebook was asking them to provide a Government ID to unlock their account on the site.&quot;</p>

<p>They asked for documents such as the following:
The very same page lists the types of IDs that Facebook accepts:</p>

<p><em>Birth certificate
Driver&#39;s license
Passport
Marriage certificate
Official Name change paperwork
Personal or vehicle insurance card
Non-driver&#39;s government ID
Green card, residence permit
or immigration papers
Social Security Card
Voter ID Card
In addition, Facebook will also accept any of the two following items that must show the name and date of birth of the locked out Facebook user.
Bank statement
Bus card
Check
Credit Card
Employment verification
Library card
Mail
Magazine subscription stub
Medical record
Membership IDs
Paycheck stub
Permit
School card</em></p>

<p>WTF, what business does a social app have asking for this information.</p>

<p>We all also know about the face recognition and users complaints of <strong>Facebook &quot;listening in</strong>&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-using-people-s-phones-to-listen-in-on-what-they-re-saying-claims-professor-a7057526.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-using-people-s-phones-to-listen-in-on-what-they-re-saying-claims-professor-a7057526.html</a></p>

<p><strong>To their shady behavior in allowing content that exploits children and then having the nerve to ask users if it should be ok to view inappropriate pictures of children</strong>:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>In thinking about an ideal world where you could set Facebook’s policies, how would you handle the following: a private message in which an adult man asks a 14-year-old girl for sexual pictures,&quot; Facebook asked.
Sexual contact with minors online, part of a &quot;grooming process&quot; in which adults seek to gain trust and lower inhibition, is often a precursor to sexual abuse</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/03/05/facebook-asked-users-if-pedophiles-should-able-ask-kids-sexual-pictures/395535002/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/03/05/facebook-asked-users-if-pedophiles-should-able-ask-kids-sexual-pictures/395535002/</a></p>

<p>SS: Facebook has been using and exploiting its user base long before CA scandal, how the hell did people let this go on for so long and why are they now just getting called out. </p>

<p>Facebook has always been the enemy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody forces you to be on Facefuck! We shouldn&#39;t seek to protect people again themselves. As I can put surveillance cameras on my property, Facebook can do (pretty much) as it wants on its site (which fools voluntarily join and upload information to).</p>

<p>The eternal and ONLY threat to liberty comes from GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>Beware of &quot;enemies&quot; that CNN tells you are enemies. Their idea here is to legislate, and declare Facebook, Youtube, etc. as &quot;public utilities&quot;. THAT is the real danger.</p>

<p>Can you cite many places where you are free not to connect to public utilities (power, water, etc.)?</p>

<p>The end-goal is of course a mandatory &quot;passport&quot; that thoroughly identifies you and every one of your digital exchanges. Ask yourself why André Kudelski is such a loyal attendee at Bilderberg.</p>

<p>I just get pissed off when CNN and the rest of the luegenpresse all agree on such agitprop, trying to let us know where the danger is coming from, all the while the tyranny keeps creeping in. Such hegelian dialectic seems to have reached new heights lately.</p>

<p>Same thing with the &quot;automatization&quot;, &quot;singularity&quot; and AI fear porn being promoted by Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and other such actors. In every thread I comment to remind people to keep the eye on the ball, the threat arises, always and everywhere, out of <strong>government</strong>, and its possible reliance on such technologies. </p>

<p>After all, government is the one with the armed thugs dressed up in costumes who love to initiate violence while brandishing scribblings made by other men in robes.</p>

<p>Make that 90%. Or 98% now. People who were aware of the privacy issues before went out long ago, which left all these who don&#39;t care, and of these, the ones who were convince-able by news bailed now.</p>

<p>No?</p>

<p>Still no?</p>

<p>Why not, FB never made a promise to not make use of any information you communicate in any way they can get their hands on in whatever way they want.</p>

<p>I have not given you any reason to mistrust me (the fact that I&#39;m in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> like you should tell you a bit about how I think and that we probably share some thoughts), FB has a few times, the bigger ones I remember are &quot;social experiments&quot; and the election.</p>

<p>Bold by me :) You hit the nail on the head: They are providing a convenient and cheap service, that&#39;s the plus, and in return, they use all means to spy on you and use the data, that&#39;s the minus. Getting out of being (further) spied on would &quot;cost&quot; you a serious margin in convenience. There is no easy way out, indeed.</p>

<p>No. You&#39;re right, there isn&#39;t. There&#39;s plain old email (while not using FB and not giving them the passwords). Or really phoning (using voice) instead of typing. All the alternatives &amp; options I can think of right now are considerably less convenient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excluding just the problem with privacy settings, you become entrapped in a very small bubble. You said you get Barkbox ads right? I’m sure you get The Dodo and similar dog / pet videos too. My point with this is Facebook is dictating what it deems of value to you. If you like someone’s status, it slowly stops showing you other people they deem “not important”. I have so many friends that just have different views than me and because of it, they are never featured. Because of this reason alone, to me when I’m on FB browsing, it’s like everyone is in agreement with me, I’m always right &amp; my happy little bubble will keep making me want to scroll, which of course, makes them richer through advertisers . That’s just one example.</p>

<p>As an internet marketer &amp; private investigator i can whole heartedly say in both my fields i use Facebook to negatively effect peoples lives, now the time. Now of course it’s great if i get to give you an ad that benefits you - right ? But what if because of my marketing, i get to markup everything just because of how you “clicked” me. It all gets tricky when a marketer can see what you type in what you are looking for your social worth etc . You can hypothetically be treated unfairly. 
As for Private investigations - if you are someone you know is being investigated, you can become part of a case that you are not really even involved in just because you are friends :) i could go on &amp; on regarding this, but I’m not going to. But it is very easy for me to figure out someone once they add me (if they do) this includes instagram with geotagging pics etc as well. </p>

<p>To me the most important part reminds me of the episode of black mirror that came out two seasons ago - see link below .
The big data matters on a big scale - not so much a YOU scale ... however ... in the future it may effect little old you. Why you say? Did you see China’s social ratings? People with positive online social scores will have better deals when buying homes, cars, being able to vote etc ! This is VERY TRUE and being tested right now. Scary right ? Imagine because you said something anti American now your car cost more ? This is how freedom of speech becomes attacked. Watch the video i attached. This is exactly why Facebook can become evil. When you become dictated to be someone you are not, your inauthentic life etc. (yes this video is from FB, that is where i saw it. Could have checked YouTube but google is just the same ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/trtworld/videos/2070957729841039/">https://www.facebook.com/trtworld/videos/2070957729841039/</a> </p>

<p>Those are just some very small ways I’ve noticed though. I’m 32 , i know better, but i love to see what everyone’s up to - so of course i never deleted it . Eeeek ! I’ll get what i deserve, i guess ? Ha ha . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but reddit is pretty much anonymous unless you go out of your way to identify.</p>

<p>FB you have pictures, friends, interests, your likes, who tagged you in photos, every comment/update, and anything else.</p>

<p>If you want to mine my reddit you’ll see I don’t trust any institutions more than I have to and I enjoy well crafted snarkiness.</p>

<p>But, if my best friend was naive enough to sign up for Obama’s campaign outreach in 2012, I may have been reached by the campaign directly through my best friend (who I presumably trust) and manipulated in this way. That pisses me off.</p>

<p>I have 1 follower on reddit who I’m pretty sure does so to downvote me, which is sad, but such is life.</p>

<p>So Reddit is pretty different from FB. So is twitter to be fair. The anonymous nature also makes bottling much more insidious on reddit and twitter.</p>

<p>There’s really no winning with social media and it’s proven to make people net unhappy.</p>

<p>So...burn it all down is I guess where I’m going with this.</p>

<p>But you can also do typing analysis and identify people like that.</p>

<p>Now since it&#39;s not too difficult to identify you (maybe not Reddit, but mix Reddit&#39;s information with some intelligence agencies, corporations, or governments and you should be able to do it), what you do, say, read, when, how long, what you click on, how often, etc etc etc all grants a pretty strong psychological profile which can be used to really analyze what you are thinking, and what you are likely to do.</p>

<p>Well.... other than the obvious IP address (how many of you are using a VPN?) which identifies you ... they probably also do some shenanigans with cookies to track you, although I doubt anywhere near the level of sophistication of Facebook...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are &quot;Reddit&quot;-buttons in certain places and reddit also gives you cookies, so it&#39;s possible to track people, but on a much lower level than FB or Google. Also, AFAIK, reddit is not making a business of selling data to companies to analyze it and use it.</p>

<p>And what does reddit have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>your username, which hopefully doesn&#39;t share too much with your real name</p></li>
<li><p>perhaps an email address which also hopefully doesn&#39;t contain your real name</p></li>
<li><p>your IP address, which may change during the day.</p></li>
<li><p>in the worst case, your location, possibly down to the street, maybe even the house.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Without your name and full address there&#39;s still not very much damage to do with this info, I&#39;d say. Google knows more about you, unless you block google&#39;s scripts everywhere (I do). From what I&#39;ve heard, FB knows your real name and maybe real address, all the names addresses of everybody you communicate using FB and what you communicated about <em>and</em> can track you at every place where a FB button is. That&#39;s not not as much of tracking capability as Google has but I&#39;d say it&#39;s still too much for my taste.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think my point is that not one of these companies is Big Brother on its own. But when you start cross-referencing data between things...like your Reddit data with Google with Facebook with Twitter, etc... then you&#39;ve got a pretty incredible surveillance network. </p>

<p>And when you consider the US government is passing cloud spying laws and the UK already passed laws allowing the government to spy on its people, in addition to the Snowden revelations showing that under Prism the NSA is already mass gathering all this data anyways... plus plenty of things we aren&#39;t aware of ... I think it is safe to assume that all of this data is being compiled together and used to not only identify and track you, but to predict and profile you as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I’m not completely ignorant of who owns these apps. I currently have an Instagram account but it’s not my “problem”. I’m trying to address it in a specific order...Facebook (because it’s <em>my</em> concern for myself and my problematic social media behaviors), anything Google related next (gmail, google, YouTube, etc) because they’re a similar behavioral issue I’ve found and they’re also actively censoring things I care about, then Instagram and reddit as I progress. I’ve got to find ways to replace my photo storage at the same time. It’s a process. I’ve just finally kicked it off and that meant my opening shot of the war would be sniping Facebook.</p>

<p>Eh. I couldn&#39;t give two shits about my Facebook. I haven&#39;t actually posted anything on my &quot;wall&quot; in like.. 3 years? But I&#39;m a daily user because we have a &#39;Dudes stuff&#39; group with all of my friends as we&#39;re getting into the marriage/kids years of our lives and it&#39;s great to have a spot to congregate whether just for saying stupid shit that you can&#39;t say around your family/SO or for setting up events/grabbing a beer/etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much that I&#39;m bothered by getting rid of Facebook as it is somewhat worried about missing out on group events because everyone just assumed everyone else saw the event on FB. My brother (Also apart of our group) got rid of his roughly 6mos ago and I still feel like I&#39;m the only one who actually keeps him updated on stuff.</p>

<p>I guess you could chalk that up to being bothered by getting rid of FB, but in reality I&#39;d jump ship in a heartbeat even if it meant going back to using IRC or something. It&#39;s just getting everyone else to adopt those &#39;changes&#39; that&#39;s incredibly hard to do, and even if they do, it tends to require more &quot;upkeep&quot; than FB does (DM&#39;ing people so they get notifications, etc).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I can think of a few people I know who are able to balance social media. I guess this problem is just as much “mine” as it is Facebook’s. Either way, I’ve got to deal with it. Their entire model depends on takin advantage of people like me, apparently.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t. Like I said, I&#39;m still a daily user, it&#39;s just that the only content I actually want to &quot;publish&quot; out to my peers is stuff that only goes to my direct group of friends. I don&#39;t need my Aunts and Uncles and Parents knowing about that new fancy computer part that just came out, but I know for a fact that my group of friends are interested in it and just as much, I&#39;d like to hear their input on it as well.</p>

<p>We also have a group Discord channel (But, let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s just another Free service so who knows what&#39;s being collected) but even that doesn&#39;t get used nearly as often as FB.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll be really hard to replace FB in all honesty. It&#39;s just that I wouldn&#39;t feel the slightest bit of remorse in deleting it if I could convince said group to move over to another platform.</p>

<p>The first few weeks you will still try to find it on auto pilot. It took me a month to stop trying to auto pilot find it on my phone/computer.

    <div class="md"><p>Right, that what I was trying to say they have been doing this shit for years and across all platforms.</p>

<p>People forget they also own Instagram and WhatsApp too.</p>

<p>When they asked to upload a government ID that&#39;s where I realized shit was just getting too weird. Who the hell are they to ask people to upload things like an ID, passport or marriage certificate. They are supposed to <em>just be a social media network</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did that &quot;upload your ID&quot; thing to me</p>

<p>Three or so years ago, I was hit with &quot;You have to change your displayed name to your legal name&quot; bullshit. My name on Facebook was Johnny Dangerously. I log in one day, and I get some page, in place of facebook.com, with a &quot;change your name&quot; box, with the explanation that I was using a fake name, and that I have to change it to my legal name, AND UPLOAD A COPY OF MY DRIVERS LICENSE... I literally couldn&#39;t visit anything on Facebook, go to my messages... Nothing. Until I changed my name, and they verified it, and unlocked my account.</p>

<p>That was such a pertinent issue to solve immediately, but [<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85c5l0/edward_snowden_facebook_is_a_surveillance_company/dvwwpxj/?context=2%5D(this">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85c5l0/edward_snowden_facebook_is_a_surveillance_company/dvwwpxj/?context=2](this</a> shit here isn&#39;t). Hell I have been a stickler since that, reporting people like &quot;Pepi Roni&quot; (pepperoni), and I have a guy on my friends list called &quot;Notbob suckmyballs&quot; but I guess after reporting him 3 times, Facebook has determined that is his real name....</p>

<p>I see Facebook slowly going away... M.Z. will fight it, but it&#39;ll go away. This won&#39;t be the last instance of Facebook violating trust coming to light.</p>

<p>(By the way the reason why the German Secret Service (B&#39;n&#39;D, remove the apostrophes for searching) and police wanted to spike all smartphones with a means to permanently listen on the other end (your end if you are in Germany), required by a law, was precisely because they now have a disadvantage against the American agencies, which can simply copy off all communication from the What&#39;sapp server.</p>

<p>Based on the fact that you think everyone changes to the worse, I&#39;m going to guess it&#39;s because you have surrounded yourself by people who don&#39;t want to be better than they were, and normalized being shitty and getting worse.</p>

<p>It certainly gives more credence to the claims but the trail ends with &quot;According to SAI sources...&quot;</p>

<p>Not sure what that means.</p>

<p>Anyway. It isn&#39;t that important. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he did say it. Just curious if it was documented.</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Add on:</p>

<p>They also tried to share information that let others be notified about what you bought on the web (meaning they followed you on the web) and set it to do it automatically/set this feature as a default.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg has produced a symphony of contrition in a blog post today about Facebook’s Beacon feature, <strong>which initially sent information on users’ Web purchases to their friends</strong> unless they specifically blocked the disclosure of each purchase.</p>

<p>He writes:</p>

<p>We’ve made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we’ve made even more with how we’ve handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it.</p>

<p>He explained the most controversial aspect of the system — the fact that it was opt-out, not opt-in — as an attempt to make it easy. “At first we tried to make it very lightweight so people wouldn’t have to touch it for it to work.” He acknowledged that this was a mistake.</p>

<p>Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I’m not proud of the way we’ve handled this situation and I know we can do better.</p>

<p>Last week, Facebook changed Beacon to make it an opt-in system on a per-site basis. And today, it allowed users to turn it off entirely, something that even last week it said it wouldn’t do.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>FB also listens to everything, even when your phone is dark (not off but in sleep mode or whatever u call it). I didn’t believe this at first so I tried it out for myself. </p>

<p>I rarely eat fast food, and never really talk about it. So I started saying things like, Big Mac, fries, McDonald’s, coke, etc.... I’d say they with my phone dark and in my pocket. About 5 days later, a McDonald’s ad shows up. I’m like ok, it could be a one time thing or a coincidence. I try something random like light bulbs. Saying things like, we need light bulbs, damn I wish I had some more bulbs, light bulbs, light bulbs god damnit! And wouldn’t you know? A fucking Home Depot ad shows up 5 days later with a picture of a light bulb. The other day I was talking to my brother about wanting to get Splatoon 2 for switch. 5 days later, splatoon/switch ads start showing up. </p>

<p>We’ve willingly let these fuckers not only into our homes, but with us at all times. Have u ever tried leaving your phone at home while you go out? It’s hard. It takes some psychological prodding and confidence. I had to tell myself, I grew up without a phone on me at all times. When I got my license I drove around all the time with out a phone. </p>

<p>This all started with pnac (project for a new American century). If u don’t know what that is id suggest u look it up. Then it was kicked off with a bang with 9/11. We’ve willing given up our privacy, let them into our homes and pockets. They can now socially engineer emotions, thoughts and ideas. This last election is a great example of how powerful this engineering can be. It’s straight up propaganda on a massive scale. Not only propaganda but emotional fuckery too. He talks s out fucking with ppls dopamine levels. We’re all fucked</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I deleted facebook app last year because i suspected it was listening in on my conversations, evidenced by its target ads thst would show on my feed. I ocassionally log in through a web browser but almost never on it. Instagram however has a grip on me. I hardly post but I browse hard, its a great time killer. There is now no doubt in my mind they too listen on my conversations despite the fact i have restricted access to my mic and camera. 
     The other night my gf told me she grabbed a drink with her friend, and I jokingly asked how many Magners did you have? Ive never searched for Magners cider, I have no need too.   The same day a coworker was eating lunch and he had mac n cheese and I said damn that mac n cheese looks awesome.. next day I had sponsered ads for Magners irish cider and valveeta mac n cheese. Havent uninstalled yet but im getting close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I’d love to see how many ppl would sign up for FB, back when MySpace was competition, if right at the top of their terms of service page they had written in bold, large font, “we will listen to everything you say, even when your phone is off.” I know I wouldn’t have signed up for it. Even now, I’m not sure most ppl even know they listen. I’m sure it’s not the only app that does either. I know Samsung has a backdoor on all of their “smart” products that allows them to be turned on at any moment and be used to listen and see what you are doing inside of your own home. I’m sure Apple, Sony, and all the other companies that have the word “smart” in their products do the same. This isn’t even a “conspiracy “ either. This is fact</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am I the only one who&#39;s not incredibly bothered by the Facebook news? Maybe it&#39;s just the cynic in me, combined with being an IT person but ever since day one when I joined Facebook I assumed every single tidbit of information I put on there was going to be digested, churned, categorized, processed, utilized in all sorts of ways. </p>

<p>Facebook&#39;s business is personal data collection and dissemination. It&#39;s their whole reason for existence. How did anyone not get this? Did they think Facebook was all about selling puny little ads or something? Wake up. It&#39;s the old adage but it&#39;s still true. If you can&#39;t figure out what a company&#39;s product is, the product is you.</p>

<p>Having said all this, yes I still signed up and used Facebook willingly, and will continue to do so. It&#39;s a trade-off. I assume Facebook is assembling a profile of me that can be used however the fuck they want, and they own every single post I&#39;ve ever made. I assume I have zero privacy. In return it gives me a convenient and fun way to stay in touch with family and friends. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like any other platform. You just need to use appropriate caution. Work emails for example. I assume every single email I send could potentially be read by the CEO. If an email fails this test I sure as hell am not going to use my company email account for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By signing up for centralized services, you run the risk of this exact problem. Simple research (i.e. reading terms &amp; conditions) would have displayed what all was collected. It was the users decision to sign up for the service, ironic that the user has taken no responsibility for mindlessly accepting terms. Just shows the sheer technology gap in today&#39;s world - something that&#39;ll only increase. CA certainly misused this data, but giving this data to CA was agreed to by the user.</p>

<p>I think the most ironic piece of this whole situation is the continued use of services like Instagram by consumers who now refuse to use Facebook. They&#39;re the same company, collecting the same data on each individual. While Instagram has less applications/extensions than Facebook, Facebook is still tracking all user data for those users still using any Facebook service. If you aren&#39;t paying for a product/service, you are the product/service.</p>

<p>Personal data will be the most prized asset at some point in the next 10-20 years. It&#39;s the consumers decision whether or not they decide to forfeit this data at no cost. Blockchain, or some evolution of the technology, will stimulate this exact movement in a way that secure and transparent.
