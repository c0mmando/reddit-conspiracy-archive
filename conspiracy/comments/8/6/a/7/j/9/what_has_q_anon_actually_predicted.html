But I did think it was kinda crazy 2 days ago tho... he posted something like, (paraphrasing) the FBI is investigating Q for the Austin Bombings. (because Q said &quot;Boom&quot; a bunch of times in his recent postings).  Then Q said, fake narrative, 4 am wednesday. And sometime around 4 am on wednesday the austin bomber blew himself up. </p>

I didn&#39;t personally buy into it. Maybe a little at first, but the longer it went on saying &quot;it&#39;s happening!&quot;, and the constant nothing happening made me realise it&#39;s just a subversion of attention. Still, I don&#39;t think the sub should have been banned. No one was hurting anyone and now all that&#39;s gonna do is convince all the followers that they&#39;re being silenced because they were onto something. I&#39;m generalising, of course, but yeah that&#39;s briefly my thoughts on the whole thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it’s more like Q saying “fire” and then somewhere in the country a tree catches fire and everyone looks at it and decides that must have been what Q meant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m already more on the q didn&#39;t predict shit school of thought.  Q knows some shit.    But no I wouldn&#39;t call it a random tree somewhere in the United States.  He knows enough and pointed out several specific trees before they caught fire.  I believe in coincidences but mathematically there is no way it&#39;s coincidence.   I&#39;ll repeat what I told someone else q has slightly better than average information and weaves it into his narrative as things happen sometimes before but mostly after the fact.  If it&#39;s a larp then we are looking at the next evolution of entertainment and man the future looks like loads of fun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with you that now that we&#39;re in &quot;Q Theory: Season 2&quot;, he has become reactionary with his hints, or kind of explain why something happened.  Early on though, he did have explosive information before I read it anywhere else.<br/>
So maybe this guy did have enough to start the story, and is now just trying to continue it, much like when a TV show starts declining.<br/>
The biggest example I can think of is the Saudi Arabia thing.  He was mentioning it, drilling it in, and that very weekend, the Saudi Arabia shake up happened.  That was a huge deal.<br/>
There are other things that I personally believe, but nothing I would throw into the ring of scrutiny, other than the Saudi Arabia thing.  If that doesn&#39;t convince you, then I can&#39;t really tell you anything that wouldn&#39;t be equivalent to these Q fan boys&#39; wet dream scenario&#39;s they are making up in their heads in an attempt to &quot;connect the dots&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  Inside information though.  Nobody reported &quot;They are going to arrest all the Saudi Princes tomorrow at 2:30 pm.  Please wear business casual attire.&quot;<br/>
Q was harping on it like a day or two before it happened.  &quot;Look at that tree.&quot;  Like I said, that&#39;s the best I have.  If you&#39;re not satisfied with my answer, I can&#39;t really try nor need to convince you.

    <div class="md"><p>Q has mentioned a bunch of things over the past 8 months so people draw their own dots and think he somehow predicted things. But if you look at his actual predictions, nothing has come true. He&#39;s said a few times that Hillary would get arrested. He&#39;s always hinting at the podestas being arrested. He said Obama lawyered up. And most recently he said a super undeniably damaging Hillary video was about to drop. None of that happened. But his followers are told to trust the plan. So it doesn&#39;t matter in the slightest when the stuff he says doesn&#39;t come true. All you gotta do is believe that someday it will. Which is surprisingly easy for a bunch of people to believe in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one I was referring to is by a dude who takes trump’s tweets, picks a tangentially related number, puts the letters from the tweet into a grid with the dimensions of the number (sometimes, since he sometimes ignores the number he picked because reasons), then tries to find anagrams there to assemble words and then assemble words into sentence structure. Basically playing boggle but instead of a 4x4 grid where you have to find actual words, sometimes it’s a 20x20 or bigger grid where you only have to find anagrams. It’s actually hysterical seeing the thread filled with “I don’t really understand it but great work” comments with the 2 or 3 people that aren’t sheep list a bunch of nonsense sentences they made the same way the OP does. </p>

<p>The rest of the sub follows the same pattern. Take 10 vague and cryptic predictions or statements from Q, interpret them to mean something connected to TPTB, they don’t come true, something else happens that looks related to one of the things he said, sub circlejerks that its happening and that’s what he meant all along. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost. For example, q makes a post that includes “11:11” (make a wish lol) so he put Trumps next tweet in an 11x11 Grid. The one on the front page right now is 26xsomethinglessthan26, because trumps tweet was deleted and retweeted after 26 minutes. But the thing is, the grid size doesn’t actually matter in large part because in their mind the grid doesn’t need to make words, you only need to make anagrams of words and you can do so with letters both next to each other as well as above and below each other lol</p>

<p>It&#39;s one that would&#39;ve been dead on arrival had they not lucked out with Trump&#39;s Twitter going down for 15 minutes. He got really lucky with that.  </p>

<p>Besides the Twitter shit, everything has been nonsense or information that was already in the news. People were going nuts over him &quot;predicting&quot; the arrest of the Saudi royalty, but weeks prior there were already questions as to why Kushner was taking an unannounced trip there. He only said &quot;why is JK in S.A.?&quot; Which anyone could have assumed would be realized eventually.  </p>

<p>The thing that really makes me mad is how people thought the whole &quot;4, 10, 20&quot; shit that was &quot;code&quot; for DJT, as if a top secret government agent would consider numbers matching directly to letters as being a cool way to &quot;prove&quot; themselves.  </p>

<p>All of that aside, why the Hell would someone with information for what would be the most significant revolution in modern history choose <em>4chan</em> to expose details? That would be the stupidest fucking thing they could do.  </p>

<p>They wouldnt ever disclose shit like this on any website, let alone a popular and easily-accessed clearnet forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far, the evidence I see regarding Q looks like stretches and leaps. People say things like “I understand how it decodes to this, because I have spent countless hours researching it” But, how much “research” can you do to come to the conclusion that some plus symbols and numbers mean a particular thing? That’s not research, it’s guessing and speculation. A lot of it is stuff people have been saying for a while. 
The only straight out predictions that don’t require decoding, such as arrests and saying video will be released, haven’t happened, aside from Trumps twitter going down, which was just some disgruntled twitter employee, and how would a Trump insider have known about that ahead of time? They would had to have been personally involved in some way with that employee. It’s not like it was a top secret government action that had been perpetrated by deep state to shut down Trumps twitter for only 15 minutes. I’m  thinking no on Q.</p>

Some currently believe he predicted the bomber getting caught because 4AM Wednesday was in one of his posts and that is when the bomber was caught, but when he mentioned a time and day he was referring to the time when MSM gets talking points from deep state (op mockingbird?) the BOOM BOOM BOOM post some people think refers to doj fbi and state dept taking losses.

    <div class="md"><p>Understand where your coming from and kind of agree, however, if you are playing chess against an opponent, shits going to go up in smoke, you can see the move being made and you let it go, then make your next move.</p>

<p>look i don&#39;t know, Since the last election has come and gone, the rules of engagement has changed given social media, This Q business could be one big Larp, However, real or not, a lot of people are glued into to this Q person, believing all that they are told, it&#39;s Genius actually, a way to steer and control a whole bunch of people.</p>

<p>For me this Q show would make a great movie, I&#39;d watch to see both sides, it&#39;s strange, one moment I&#39;m like this is BS the next I&#39;m having a scratchy chin moment when the bombings happened, </p>

<p>It&#39;s all fucking nuts and interesting if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People on that sub don’t have agreed upon concrete theories on anything he posts, so anything can look correct in hindsight. Some currently believe he predicted the bomber getting caught because 4AM Wednesday was in one of his posts and that is when the bomber was caught, but when he mentioned a time and day he was referring to the time when MSM gets talking points from deep state (op mockingbird?) the BOOM BOOM BOOM post some people think refers to doj fbi and state dept taking losses. Could also be a reference to an injury reserve song. You can cold read a restaurant menu and get just as much info as many of his posts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  Inside information though.  Nobody reported &quot;They are going to arrest all the Saudi Princes tomorrow at 2:30 pm.  Please wear business casual attire.&quot;<br/>
Q was harping on it like a day or two before it happened.  &quot;Look at that tree.&quot;  Like I said, that&#39;s the best I have.  If you&#39;re not satisfied with my answer, I can&#39;t really try nor need to convince you.  Just thought this sub should hear from someone ankle deep in the Q waters, instead of hardcore Q worshippers (which he directly stated not to do, btw). </p>
