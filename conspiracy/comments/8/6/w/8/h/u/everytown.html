Given birth soon after the Sandy Hook elementary school incident, Everytown is funded by Former NYC mayor/millionaire Michael Bloomberg. The list on his Advisory board members reads like a cast from a cheap spy thriller, A list Spy chiefs, warhawk Admirals, corrupt D.C politicians, dirty cops, religous pedo&#39;s and Agent provocateur&#39;s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everytown_for_Gun_Safety">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everytown_for_Gun_Safety</a>.
What does the prohibition of gun sales have to do with war-hawks like Admiral Mike Mullen? Former head of joint chief of staff who was at the tip of the spear starting the murderous campaign with the Afghan and Iraqi wars. To usher in a Militaristic regime against Americans. We have the retired ATF man David Chipman who had a hand in the Vegas harvest masscare cover up, there is retired Oklahoma Sen. Dave Boren, former head of the Senate Intelligence Comitee directly linked with CIA G. Tenet mastemind of the NATO interventions in the Balkans and the Second Gulf War. Down the line is Chris McDonnell, who &quot;posed&quot; for photographs during Sandy Hook Elementary. The advisary list of A list cast keeps shining with Irwin Jacobs head of Qualcomm and heavy funder of Technion the Israeli Tech institute linked with developing the IDF cyber warfare programs, and Eli Broad whose Institute is synonymous with biowarfare Ebola research in W. Africa. We Cannot forget the Clinton/Soros cronies on the Everytown Board such as Tom Barett Milwaukee mayor involved with the 08 Wall street bail out&#39;s and BLM, and lackey Philly mayor Michael Nutter. There are a few more on this list however you get the idea. This nation wide inititiative for the disarmament of Americans is exactly why our founding fathers drafted the Second Amendment to quell any attempt at a return of Tyranny against a defenseless public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everytown USA, formerly known as Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, was co-founded by Bloomberg and Thomas Menino. </p>

<p>Menino was the Mayor of Boston during the Boston Marathon Bombing. Menino was a devout Roman Catholic. </p>

<p>Bloomberg likewise is seen at the Al Smith dinners sucking up to the Archbishop of New York. Bloomberg is a pope-serving Jew.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/RomeRules/comments/5qpig5/united_states_conference_of_mayors_dominated_by/">The United States Conference of Mayors is, and has been, dominated by Catholics.</a></p>

<p>The current President of the United States Conference of Mayors is Mitch Landrieu, a Catholic who is Jesuit-trained from Loyola Chicago and is a foremost member of Everytown USA and top pusher of legislation for gun-ownership restriction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, those are some ridiculous reaches with Bloomberg, who obviously <em>has</em> to pose with catholics/etc to keep their scam going. They absolutely need the John Heggie types, and of course even the fake pope. You know this, you&#39;re just playing that guy they want you to play, calling out the zionist Christians in the mix saying, &quot;hey whatabout this man, he&#39;s Catholic.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, no shit. The entire wall can&#39;t be jews, right? They need there Abrahamic pedo-buddy sidekicks to play along to keep the plebs gathered around. Not rocket science.</p>

<p>Appeal to the stone fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ad hominem fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Fallacy of assertion and that does not address the catholic control of the mayoral council in the United Sates, or Bloomberg&#39;s allegiance to Catholic leadership. I also have Senator Chuck Schumer on video literally trying to one-up a Catholic senator in his profession of love for pope Francis. </p>
