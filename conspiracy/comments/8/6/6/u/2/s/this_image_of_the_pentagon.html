<p>Prior to the roof collapsing, there are a couple images showing a small hole in the Pentagon. I&#39;ve only been able to find this one, but I remember seeing more like this during the day of the attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pentagon plane people have to make up their minds: were the pentagon walls flimsy enough to allow 99% of the plane through, or were they strong enough to completely disintegrate 99% of the plane? </p>

<p>Seems to me where ever bits of the plane hit the building, but didn&#39;t punch through they would have bounced back at high speed. The best pictures of the damaged face of the building don&#39;t show the Wile E. Coyote cross section of the plane that we saw at the WTC--really only a hole for the fuselage and maybe the engines. This means that quite a bit of wing and tail section debris should be spread out all over the lawn. </p>

<p>That said, I really never know what to  think about the no plane at the pentagon theory. I&#39;ve looked at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=germanwings+crash+site&amp;amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwie0MbuoIDaAhVT7mMKHbIxAqAQ_AUICygC&amp;amp;biw=1680&amp;amp;bih=913#imgrc=rzosmiagXwj7CM:">Germanwings crash site photos</a> to see what a large passenger jet looks like after it hits something hard at full speed, and the largest bits aren&#39;t <em>that</em> big. Still recognizable as plane parts though, but the angle of the crash was much different. Oh well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spent a little time putting this together for you. There is a ton of really good information out there about 9/11, and it&#39;s my opinion that the more people read about what did and did not happen that day, and the more videos that they watch about what did and did not happen that day, the more they&#39;re no longer able to  believe  government lies  concerning and explaining  9/11. </p>

<p>Now, where to begin. No plane hit the pentagon. A Boeing 757 has 2  Rolls-Royce RB211-535 turbofan titanium engines that are 12&#39; x 9&#39; diameter and weigh 6 tons each. Only a magic trick could direct an airplane  into a wall and leave absolutely no evidence, zero evidence, of  2  massive engines traveling over 400 mph  into a building.</p>

<p>The section of the Pentagon that was hit had just completed a $250 million dollar renovation and strengthening. A missile entering the builiding would not have caused the outer ring of the newly reinforced structure made of heavily reinforced steel beams  to collapse. Something else besides the missile entering the building caused it to collapse 30 minutes after impact.</p>

<p>&quot;CNN’s correspondent Bob Franken who was at the Pentagon stated, “from my close up inspection there’s no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon” … “the only pieces left that you can see or small enough that you can pick up in your hand’ …“There are no large tail sections, wing sections, a fuselage” …”  &quot;According to Professor Fetzer, Bob Franken was later reprimanded for his comments which were televised live.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>A Missile</strong></p>

<p>“I heard a very loud, quick whooshing sound. I was convinced it was a missile. It came in so fast – it sounded nothing like an airplane.” Lon Rains – Editor for Space News (Pentagon eyewitness)</p>

<p>&quot;Donald Rumsfeld back in 2001, told ‘Parade Magazine’ about the missile damage to the Pentagon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Retired Army Major General Albert Stubblebine gave an interview stating that no plane hit the Pentagon. In his last assignment, he was head of all the U.S. Army’s Strategic Intelligence Forces around the world. He was “responsible for the signal’s intelligence, photo intelligence, counterintelligence, human intelligence.” He concluded that Flight 77 didn’t crash into, but something did. He found no evidence of wing marks on the Pentagon.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Hijackers</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Nine out of the nineteen alleged hijackers on 9/11 were found alive.&quot;</p>
