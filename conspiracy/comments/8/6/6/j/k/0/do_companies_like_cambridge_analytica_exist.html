       Mercer was born in San Jose &amp; is a computer scientist.  Obviously he is very familiar with Silicon Valley &amp; the neo-liberal/1984 agenda they push on the world.  Did Mercer get tired of this &amp; figure out how to exploit their algorithms?

       Did you give any indication you weren't a liberal? Aside from standing up for yourself, which is obviously not a trait of these modern neolib pussies. We need to establish a group of classical liberals. We are so stuck between red hats and ass hats.

       The idea that we are one &amp; you can get through life believing that is garbage.  Liberalism has infiltrated HR departments globally to the rights of m2f trans which are biological men are put above the rights of women using the restroom to change their tampons.  The we are all same narrative is how this happened.  Liberals will constantly be trying to force the next civil rights movemet &amp; if you dont support trans rights then you must be racist as well.  This is reality.

       Yes, liberals do that, and the conservative jam religious "values" down your throat as well as nationalist propaganda and science denial, the libs also conveniently deny science as it suits them. Both sides are bad and more similar than they are different. Centrists and those who deal in scientific facts are the future and will be the only thing that can save humanity from itself, they are unfortunately outnumbered.

       I've never had either at a company, that's unfortunate and depending on the context it's illegal. I wouldn't work for one or I'd sue them and own it, lol, Murica.

       I have been discriminated against during a hiring process for being a male but I simply "wasn't the right fit" for the job which is perfectly legal. Wasn't a liberal thing though, was just a female centered store and I can see why they wouldn't want a 6'3" strongman managing a jewelry store aimed at teen girls.

       At the place i currently work.  There are a few black people that i refuse to speak to because they have gotten several people fired for racism.  If you are going to go looking for it every day dont be surprised when i wont even say hello.  I’m not opening the door for you to have conversations with me just to use those conversations against me.

       If you live in the south religious views are very much in the public work sphere. I’ve had to be very careful about coming out as an atheist and my views on religion as I was was growing up in the Bible Belt.

       Live in the south in a red county &amp; work in a red county.  Openly agnostic at work.  The christians are willing to let me challenge them.  The muslims wont even join the debate.  Every friday we meet for beers to debate this &amp; try to get as many different opinions as possible to join.  No topic is off limits.  Last week this non-traditional christian friend explained to everyone that if they believe in Jesus/God they believe in extraterrestials.  He blew a few minds.

       They are all bound together under one giant umbrella of elite control that has been around long enough to completely rewrite history. Each state is just a Petri dish for the families at the very top to tune and experiment with societal theories and to tighten the leash a little more. The even more artificial dichotomy of left vs right exists only to mask the layers above it.

       What makes you think Soros is an elite?
      </p>
      <p>
       If he measures his wealth in monetary terms, if you and I both know his name, then he’s still a minion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the strictly segregated sandbox granted to us peons it’s still possible for people to rise and fall, GoT-style, accumulating vast sums of money and acquiring all manner of worldly goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some have it easier than others, of course, and the pseudo-elite like Soros enjoy all the main benefits in our playground.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he has bank accounts and is still legally bound by contracts then he’s still playing by
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       rules. People like Soros still operate within the ultimate confines of the same closed system. A system operated exclusively by a cabal of elite families who, at some point in the distant past, seized control and have been maintaining it ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty neat, really. They figured out that the best way to ensure their continued survival was to create a controlled environment for the rest of us, much like free range farmyard animals. The Matrix was a documentary!

       I believe that.  Also the word liberal has a much different meaning than it used to.  I wonder if Older Democrats are cringing at what some are doing.  It's the same when Nazi right wing people show up saying they are conservatives.  I think both are being controlled by outside sources.
