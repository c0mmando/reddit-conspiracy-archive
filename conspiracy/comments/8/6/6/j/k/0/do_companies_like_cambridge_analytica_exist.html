<p>Do you still believe in nations? Do you think countries actually have autonomy and sovereignty?</p>

<p>They are all bound together under one giant umbrella of elite control that has been around long enough to completely rewrite history. Each state is just a Petri dish for the families at the very top to tune and experiment with societal theories and to tighten the leash a little more. The even more artificial dichotomy of left vs right exists only to mask the layers above it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think Soros is an elite?</p>

<p>If he measures his wealth in monetary terms, if you and I both know his name, then he’s still a minion.</p>

<p>Within the strictly segregated sandbox granted to us peons it’s still possible for people to rise and fall, GoT-style, accumulating vast sums of money and acquiring all manner of worldly goods.</p>

<p>Some have it easier than others, of course, and the pseudo-elite like Soros enjoy all the main benefits in our playground.</p>

<p>If he has bank accounts and is still legally bound by contracts then he’s still playing by <em>their</em> rules. People like Soros still operate within the ultimate confines of the same closed system. A system operated exclusively by a cabal of elite families who, at some point in the distant past, seized control and have been maintaining it ever since.</p>

<p>Pretty neat, really. They figured out that the best way to ensure their continued survival was to create a controlled environment for the rest of us, much like free range farmyard animals. The Matrix was a documentary!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House rules</a> is a similar concept. We get to experience the agenda and are free to ask most questions, except for the one question that might threaten it. </p>
