<p>Something along the lines of &quot;All publicity is good publicity&quot;</p>

<p>Dont give pessimism your focus, it&#39;s sneaky. </p>

<p>You are naturally geared towards what&#39;s good. Start by seeing how awesome/aware YOU are to be able to see whats wrong with the world and not put up with it</p>

<p>I am my friend. I try to be every day. No snowflake thinks it is responsible for the avalanche, but they <em>all</em> are, and this goes for the good things in life too. I know where and how I fit into my community, and I work outwards from there. Even just a little bit of positive change on the personal level works towards a better tomorrow.</p>

<p>As Tolkien said: &quot;It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay&quot; and I believe that with all my heart. </p>

<p>That&#39;s probably a good start. Try to ignore anything about religion. Your own heart/mind/soul/whatever you wish to call it will guide you to 
&quot;what&#39;s next&quot;. So just listen inwardly. Meditation helps a ton. Just sit and feel, things will start becoming apparent and you&#39;ll start digging into yourself and then one thing will lead to another. It&#39;s inevitable for all, that I know. </p>

<p>The objective will have to be enforced upon the people, and as the prime motivator to comply, the only example that I know of from the past history as well as current events, is a barrel to the head, 0&#39; the wonderful NWO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my opinion, </p>

<p>The NWO is driven by a motivation based within a  ‚Äúservice to self‚Äù  - it necessitates the manipulation of our ‚Äúfree will‚Äù which is the one cosmic Law, all else can be considered ‚Äúnegative‚Äù polarity. The basic principle behind what we hear called ‚Äúdark magic‚Äù. </p>

<p>I personally believe that light will always overcome the darkness, it‚Äôs a simple factor in the cycle of our current density. ‚ÄúService to others‚Äù is the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù polarity, seeing and learning from your ‚Äúother selves ‚Äú with the understanding that to accept is to be accepted. To forgive is to be forgiven. </p>

<p>Order in the world is a given...peace is achievable, it necessitates Empathy in its very core. The NWO and the agenda of the Cabal are the dark which we have begun to cast a light upon, simply by our awareness of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen that the devils these new agers are channeling (pretending to be aliens) are saying a huge &quot;event&quot; is coming that will hit the entire planet and some people who are a &quot;low vibration&quot; and aren&#39;t ready to handle the light will be removed from the planet and relocated somewhere else until they can handle the light?  </p>

<p>All of these new angers are gearing up to go out and spread their false gospel right after &quot;the event&quot;.  So Lucifer already has his cover for the Christian rapture:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are told to see good vs evil, light vs dark. That is distortion.</p>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance.</p>

<p>So, every being choosing evil is also choosing to be parasitic on the value created by others.</p>

<p>All beings want to be free and joyful. </p>

<p>Parasitic beings just do not care about others&#39; free will and persuit of happiness.</p>

<p>So, instead of seeing good/light vs evil/dark, why not see it more accurately?</p>

<p>Beings that produce value for consciousness are repeatedly undermined by beings that do not wish to produce value for consciousness in their persuit of value for their own consciousness. </p>

<p>The productive need to recognize the methods of those who will to be parasites, or they lose their own vitality they created for one another.</p>

<p>Parasites require deception or coercion in order to maintain imbalanced value exchange relationships.</p>

<p>So, by defending others&#39; free will and the truth we undermine the efforts of parasites and protect ourselves.</p>

<p>We can unite around our collective self-interests, which is also in our individual self-interest, simply by being true to what we know and compassionate for the situations of others.</p>

<p>It has been distilled many times..</p>

<p>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know now, is that you are the central nucleus of your reality, so what you focus on, what you prject, what you assume to be true on a deep, subconscious level, is what manifests in front of your &quot;projector screen&quot; of 3rd-5th dimensional reality.</p>

<p>So it behooves you to choose loving thoughts and projections! Dont focus on the takers, the parasites, it only gives them your power! Focus on the harmony, the joy, the empathic beings that have compassion for each other. Watch a new world manifest based on what you hold to be true in your heart!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is an achievement to convince your prey to not defend themselves. It makes feeding on them easier than ever before.</p>

<p>When we ignore their operation around us, does it not serve their self-interest of feeding us?</p>

<p>They work hard to obfuscate their operations. I assume this is why. </p>

<p>Perhaps if we instead accurately assess and discuss their operations, we will become so negatively emotionally charged we won&#39;t tolerate their operations anymore. Negative emotions are all designed to protect what we love. </p>

<p>It seems to me that for the longest time, mostly through religion, these very beings have convinced us to stand down and tacitly consent to their exploitation.</p>

<p>Fear is not the enemy of love, but they want us to think so. We fear the most for what we love. Think of parents loving children. When we don&#39;t love something at all, we lose our fear for its peril. This is why suicide occurs. People lose the love of their lives and the fear of their deaths.</p>

<p>So, being positive is necessary and helpful, but protecting what we love is also necessary. Evil wants us to believe otherwise and it knows we&#39;re likely to trust the light. The light gets that mind job done. </p>
