<p>Neocons aren&#39;t really trendy. There&#39;s plenty of Neocons and Neolibs in power but I wouldn&#39;t say any of them or their ideas are popular. </p>

<p>Lots of people voted for Trump because he was criticizing these kinds of people and their wars. Trump&#39;s appointment of these people doesn&#39;t mean that the ideas are now popular. It just means they were duped.</p>

<p>It seems like whatever way you vote in the past 4+ elections.... you&#39;re going to end up with a State Department lead by Kissinger goons and Goldman Sachs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think once you reach the position of president of the United States it is either do as you are told and make a fuckton of money or become Kennedy 2, or &quot;they&quot; fuck up your country so bad that there will be nothing left to govern. The same goes for any president-like position in any country of significance.</p>

<p>It is about time for people to realise voting for anything does not change anything as long as the current power/money structure exists. Money is in the hands of a few and it is going to be in the hands of even fever people. Until they are so few and have so much money that they turn the world into a totalitarian world. </p>

<p>We are right on the track to totalitarianism but it is not yet sure which party will be the ruler of the coming world. Will it be China?  Or the British Elite? Be prepared for a very ugly war with lots of casualties. Best you can do is get as far away from everything as soon as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like we, meaning the US, isn&#39;t already at war in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and all across Africa that we know of for sure and who&#39;s to say in how many other places that aren&#39;t being disclosed.</p>

<p>Moreover, there have been no military successes since WWII against countries far less formidable than the Germans ever were, despite dropping more bombs on some of them than were dropped on the Germans in Europe and on Germany itself to finally defeat them. </p>

<p>That should tell you something about what the true purpose of those wars actually is. You have to feed that ever hungry maw of the military industrial complex and winning isn&#39;t what&#39;s wanted if your aim is to get rid of much in the way of munitions to keep the re-orders for more continuing at a steady pace.</p>
