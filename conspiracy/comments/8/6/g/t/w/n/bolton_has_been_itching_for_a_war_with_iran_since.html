    <div class="md"><p>Reinstate the draft, or better draft anyone over 50. These are the ones rankling to get even for all the evil things Iran did to us over the years. Why, I remember once when the Iranians killed my baby puppy they said something about jihad and slit his throat and than killed me for which I never forgave them. Nosiree! They&#39;ve been stirrin&#39; up things and stuff what makes me real mad and things. Coincidentally the same letters that spell evil are in Iran, synonymous fer sure. TV tells me to kill, kill, kill! I saw it on TV. Bibi (the worlds savior and king jew) said they were bad and that&#39;s good enough for me to kill, kill, kill! Thank got that we have Bolton back. He&#39;s gonna make sure we hurt them real bad for the bad things what they done to us, real bad things. Just ask Bibi. Bibi knows. Ask him about the Acme cartoon bomb with the fuse in it. What? You don&#39;t believe they&#39;re trying to kill us every day? Just go ahead and kill &#39;em and God and John Bolton, and Bibi will figure out who the innocent ones are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cute, but one reason we have no draft is because of our now legalized graft, called privatization.  </p>

<p>Soldiers and Seamen and Airmen are not needed so much, thanks in part to technology but also to, the Private Military Companies.</p>

<p>Cheap laborers imported from Indonesia and Pakistan and Bangladesh and similar nations provided almost all the non-combat support staff, hired by the private, profit from tax money private military contractors for Afghanistan and Iraq and that will continue for future wars and why not even, eventualy replace, the U.S. men and women in the Military.   </p>

<p>It saves big money, not only in paying the service personnel, but in health care and pensions, and other benefits traditionally provided to veterans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I am horrified to see Swamp Thing PNAC Bolton back in charge of anything in FedGov, I have a theory.</p>

<p>Trump is one by one destroying the Neocons by elevating them. Everyone is confused why top WH jobs have becone a carousel, where the average tenure before implosion is measured in weeks or months before the next DC Lifer replaces the last one.</p>

<p>For starters, the Deep State has never mobilized like this to bombard the President 24/7 with a shit shower.</p>

<p>Exactly zero bureaucrats who spent their entire careers in DC have the stamina to withstand the trench warfare onslaught against Trump.</p>

<p>So Trump picks some popular Neocon and says &quot;welcome aboard, do your thing&quot;, only he knows they are being set up to be the next hostage who gets shot by the Deep State SWAT team.</p>

<p>Bolton probably thinks he finally achieved his life dream to pre-emptively nuke Iran. The vast Neocon attendees and courtiers and Zionists are smacking their lips drooling over it finally happening.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think Bolton is going to get what he wants. Now the spotlight is on him like a heat seeking missile. There is going to be some dirt on him from the Bush era that digs itself up and torpedoes his best efforts. Like all the rest, Bolton will be ignited by the flame thrower and ejected. I bet Bolton doesn&#39;t even survive past August.</p>

<p>We know Trump already rejected Bolton the first time around because of his stupid mustache. You think Trump has suddenly changed his temperment about that? Now he gotta stare at Bolton&#39;s pussy lips from 5 feet away for several hours per day.</p>

<p>I voted for Trump to be the Chaos Candidate and nothing more. I have zero expectations from him except to fuck shit up in DC, be a wrecking ball, and lob monkey wrenches into the gears of the well oiled Deep State machine. Keep the Bureaucrats guessing, sweating and questioning their own sanity is all I ask for from Trump.</p>

<p>Even recently &quot;DO NOT CONGRULATE PUTIN&quot; turn  in to &quot;Congratulations, Putin!&quot; and a good ol&#39; &quot;YOU&#39;RE FIRED&quot; to McMaster. Trump is in charge, and the fact that he&#39;s exposing both NeoLib and NeoCons is amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t think Bolton would cross the line THAT early man. Probably after 6 months then maybe he will.</p>

<p>Right now Trump is trying to assert dominance over the white house. Which means if Bolton trying to cross him, he&#39;s gonna get axed. </p>

<p>Bolton has been itching for a War with Iran since high school.</p>

<p>What a weird ass fucking thing to dream of in high school. When I was in high school, I dreamed of playing video games, skateboarding, crushes, etc. I looked forward to getting out of school and having freedom to do whatever I wanted. I never dreamed of orchestrating a conspiracy to commit mass murder. </p>

<p>So implement the draft, which will obviously cause people to riot, then maybe they&#39;ll have a use for those empty Wal-Mart prisons that people were taking footage of around the Operation Jade Helm scare.</p>

<p>Remember that guys? We know that they are prepared for this level of containment, there is a war brewing, either there or here...</p>

<p>It would be wise to prepare. </p>
