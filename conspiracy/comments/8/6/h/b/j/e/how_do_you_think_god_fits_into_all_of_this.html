<p>In this scenario the elite still have knowledge of these “creators” and have hidden it from us. Also, it wouldn’t discredit any <em>true</em> spirituality, it would simply erode our tendency to focus purely on Earth as the source of spiritual evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the beginning, I believe that they worshipped various Gods because they had no science that explained phenomenon like droughts or rainstorms, blizzards, bad crop harvests, etc.  To them, it made the most sense.</p>

<p>The science community nowadays have a system of evidence and theories that can be proved over and over again to conclusion. Most scientists reject spirituality and religion because there is no evidence to support a higher being or creator. The burden of proof lies upon the religious to prove that God exists. </p>

<p>As for mental illness, no, they are not mentally ill. I think religion and spirituality are misunderstood. People choose to believe and place their faith in whatever helps them cope with everyday life, tragedies, etc. You can&#39;t fault them for that, because we all need something that helps us deal with it. Some choose religion and others choose evidence.</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s how I rationalize it all.</p>

<p>To me, I think it boils down to emotion, such as great loss. People often question why did it happen to them or what did they do to deserve it? Or, it could be a case of being raised and taught their whole lives to believe something and they simply don&#39;t question it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Evolution. Animals cannot comprehend things on the same level as humans. Animals live primarily on instinct alone. Humans just happened to be lucky in the roll of the dice of the evolutionary chain.</p>

<p>After studying occultism, I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s quite what happened. In most cases, it&#39;s more a case of the inner elites concocting silly stories that they know are false but which hold an esoteric, hidden meaning for them. </p>

<p>The priests of the sun god knew when the sun would rise due to advanced, hidden astronomical knowledge. So they created a cult whereby they would call the sun forth in the morning at just the right time, enthralling the people they kept in ignorance about the true source of their knowledge.</p>

<p>As a result, they could speak for the &quot;gods,&quot; and control people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like the atheists don&#39;t like this post. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do the elite appear to worship Satan and/or a host of pagan deities? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of them follow the ancient <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11E33A6AEEB2674F">mystery religions</a>. Most don&#39;t see this at overtly Satanic (although some do), but they are obsessed with enlightenment and consciousness as well as controlling people through information disparity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why has the notion of a spiritual reality been a staple of human life since the beginning? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>God has set eternity in the hearts of men (Ecclesiastes 3:11).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is science diametrically opposed to the idea of the supernatural?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they follow Aristotelian reductionism (the only things that exist are those that are detected by the senses), instead of a Platonic philosophy of science, where you imagine how something may work and then set out to investigate it. Most of the important discoveries were made by Platonists, the lesser things are filled in by the Aristotelians.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or simply because the evidence of supernatural phenomena is inconclusive?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evidence for the existence of a creator is overwhelming. The reductionist model is completely unable to explain the origin of matter, energy, life, and so on, because it presumes a closed system with fixed natural laws. The supernatural worldview can explain reality, because it uses an open system, with laws that were fixed at a certain point in time by an external creator who also placed the matter and energy here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But this to me, is a complete leap of faith in itself, what without proper evidence on either side. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re free to believe that, but it doesn&#39;t reflect the claims of theism generally or Christianity in particular. Theists will offer specific philosophical propositions in support of their claims, and they are pretty strong. Christianity offers specific evidence in support of its claims, particularly the historical examples of miracles, in order to prove itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do the vast majority of humans, who believe in something higher than science, simply have a mental disorder, or is the aspect of something higher than ourselves intricately built into our being? </p>

<p>How can we long for something that does not exist</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Correct.  God is <em>also</em> darkness, however.</p>

<p>&quot;God&quot;, you see, is the word that we humans have for &quot;everything that is&quot;.  God is, after all &quot;omnipotent&quot;, is God not?  All powerful?  God cannot be all powerful/omnipotent without also being omnipresent - i.e. literally <em>everything</em> that is - for if God wasn&#39;t everything that is, then that means that there would be something that God was not, and therefore, not in full and complete control over - which means that God would in that moment not be omnipotent/all powerful.</p>

<p>If God is all powerful/omnipotent, therefore, God has to also be omnipresent - i.e. literally (and again) &quot;everything that is&quot;.</p>

<p>If one says that God <em>isn&#39;t</em> &quot;everything that is&quot;, then you&#39;re left with a <em>not</em> omnipotent, all powerful God - i.e. a limp dick impotent &quot;God&quot; that says &quot;you kids play nice now...please?&quot; and you can say &quot;Meh.  Go fuck yourself, God.  You ain&#39;t shit.  Suckadick.&quot;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s literally no kind of God - especially by the classical definition of God as &quot;omnipotent&quot; and &quot;all there is&quot; - i.e. omnipresent and everything.</p>

<p>You cannot get out of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=8by0Wpe5KoypjwTw1KqQAg&amp;amp;q=yin&amp;amp;oq=yin&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1l5j0l2j0i67k1l3.6580.6859.0.7091.3.3.0.0.0.0.111.311.1j2.3.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.3.311...0i131k1.0.1tvoK50bkuI">yin</a> if God is omnipotent and omnipresent - which God is.</p>

<p>God is everywhere everything.  Therefore, God is the light and the darkness - the yang and the yin, the up and the down, the good, the bad, everything in between, and everything far beyond all of that in a state of transcendence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The creator God which I assume you are referring to is currently letting the <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">&quot;god of this age&quot;</a> to run his experiment to prove the argument that arose in the beginning of human creation that man can rule himself and Satan can do a better job than God by allowing mankind to experience the full spectrum (good and bad, positive and negative) instead of the bliss love higher vibrational state we were once in. So humans agreed to allow themselves to be altered and live life apart from love and to struggle and find meaning by intellectual enlightenment and their own means rather than love. It&#39;s obvious by the way the world is that this has failed and man cannot rule themselves and we all deserve better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Satan is real so is God/Jesus Christ.  He really did die for your sins and the elite don&#39;t want you to know that.  They want you to die without ever accepting his blood sacrifice personally so it applies to your account and reconciles you to God.</p>

<p>The King James Bible is God&#39;s preserved word.  It explains everything that is going on right now.  Satan is the &quot;god of this world&quot; he has control to give power here.  A one world government and ecumenical religion is going to happen under the Antichrist who people will think is an alien savior of some sort.  He will make everyone worship &quot;The God of Forces&quot; this is probably some sort of false god of all the forces of physics.</p>

<p>Repent (change your mind) and believe this gospel and be free of all of this.  Know there is nothing you can do to save yourself.  No good works, no going to a place called Church, no donating money no nothing but trusting this alone:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Why do the elite appear to worship Satan and/or a host of pagan deities?</em>
Satan is the prince of this world, and can give you the treasures and Kingdoms of this world, as dominion over them was given to him. </p>

<p><em>Why has the notion of a spiritual reality been a staple of human life since the beginning?</em>
Because it&#39;s a part of reality. </p>

<p><em>Why is science diametrically opposed to the idea of the supernatural? Is it because there are truths that aren’t for everyone? Or simply because the evidence of supernatural phenomena is inconclusive?</em>
Firstly we have to look at what the word &#39;supernatural&#39; means. In one sense, even if we don&#39;t understand something in the universe, that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t a naturalistic explanation for it. I don&#39;t believe God has to break the laws of science to do any miracle. Therefore I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s possible for something to be &quot;supernatural&quot;. Everything that exists is a product of nature, which is a product of God. Science and religion are not opposed - they are in perfect harmony. Only shallow minded individuals think they&#39;re opposed. </p>

<p><em>Why does humanity from its very beginning appear to worship? Everything from ancestors, to snakes, to the idea of God, to Mother Nature, etc has been subject to worship.</em>
To worship is to acknowledge something greater than ourselves. Seeing as how most people that are born eventually gain the ability to see how greedy, selfish, violent, crude, unjust and terrible most human beings and human rules are, it is only natural for us to conclude that there must be something greater and better than...Us. To think we are the epitome of greatness would be a sad revelation indeed. </p>

<p><em>I know what some of you will say; that science and spirit are “inconsolable.” But this to me, is a complete leap of faith in itself, what without proper evidence on either side.</em>
Give me one example of how people think science and spirit are inconsolable, and I will explain how I console it in my mind. </p>

<p><em>But is that the case? Do the vast majority of humans, who believe in something higher than science, simply have a mental disorder, or is the aspect of something higher than ourselves intricately built into our being?</em>
I think you would have to have a mental disorder to be an atheist. </p>
