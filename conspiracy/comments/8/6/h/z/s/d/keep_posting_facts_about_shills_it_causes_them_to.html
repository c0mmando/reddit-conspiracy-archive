<p>The era of &quot;don&#39;t feed the trolls&quot; is over. That was for a time when trolls were just random buttholes. Professional shills should be refuted, their tactics specifically explained so that people will realize that this is a shill and not a random troll, and they need to be constantly demoralized and reminded of how transparent and ineffective they are.</p>

<p>If that bothers you, read the shill manual, because it&#39;s <em>exactly</em> what they do to us. And remember that controlling public opinion is how the military-industrial complex maintains power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did you ask that?</p>

<p>I’ll bite though but if you don’t then answer my previous question I’m just going to block you dude.</p>

<p>I think the organized shilling efforts are a big problem for this sub, this site, and the internet at large. I think reddit should implement some sort of system to identify people as real without compromising their anonymity, but I don’t know how exactly that could be accomplished. However, I feel like it should be possible, somehow.</p>

<p>Now you. And to be clear the reason I ask is because I’m pretty sure you are assuming quite a bit about me and I’m curious to see where exactly it is that you think I’m coming from.</p>

<p>Now please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But honestly how would you even know? Those &quot;easy to spot&quot; shills could be shills or they could very well just be regular dumb people pushing an agenda. And if a shill isn&#39;t easy to spot then how would you know they weren&#39;t there?</p>

<p>If anyone genuinely believes all the &quot;real&quot; shills are easy to spot then I have to imagine they would be pretty susceptible to shills, as the implication is that if someone don&#39;t immediately stand out as an obvious shill then you just assume they aren&#39;t one.</p>

<p>So in an ironic twist all the &quot;easy to spot&quot; shills get you thinking you can trust people who are actually just shills themselves but are better at hiding it from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All right here goes my food for thought for today, feel free to add your pitch:</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t shills meme correctly?</p>

<p>You have to grasp the underlying principles that define a meme to understand why is it that shills are unable to meme successfully.
A meme requires 2 essential components to be labeled as such:</p>

<p>A parcel of truth at its core: a meme conveys a message and can be vulgarized down into a large scale inside joke that appeals to a group of people. If the initial premise isn&#39;t true, the targeted audience will not feel integrated in the &quot;inside joke&quot;. Since shills push a false narrative, the impact of their memes is significantly impared as the very core of their message is rotten. Their only asset are brainwashed people who believe their narrative to be true and that are therefore reachable by memes.</p>

<p>Layer(s) of irony: a well done meme conveys its message in a humoristic way, always implicit but evident. People who are talented enough to make money out of their jokes will career in comedy and will not content themselves with a 6 cents per post salary; comedy talent is extremely scattered within the shill community. <em>But what about shitposters?</em> Shitposters are in for the lulz, those who create memes want a laugh and/or recognition for their piece of art. Shills are quite the opposite of that; they don&#39;t want a laugh, they want a paycheck to pay their bills, at any moral cost. They don&#39;t want recognition, else they would be aiming for a career, not a dead-end job.</p>

<p>A meme with no truth is a lame joke at best, and flagrant propaganda at its worst. A meme with no fun will be uninteresting to the targeted audience.</p>

<p><em>why are memes so successful in the information war?</em></p>

<p>People go on the internet for one of two things: productivity or entertainment. Those who seek a laugh in their coffee breaks will tumble on memes, share with their colleagues, etc. Same goes for chronic procrastinators who end up sharing a meme with their friends. Memes are viral because they are fun. Since memes are viral, they convey their message faster than any other medium. Why shills haven&#39;t successfully weaponised memes yet is beyond me. It inevitably has to do with their philosophy being diametrically opposed to the above-defined concept of a meme.</p>
