        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As someone from eastern Europe, I would like to say a word or two.</p>

<p>We had our share of student movements overthrowing governents in eastern europe (I won&#39;t say what country, but you&#39;ll probably guess right). We&#39;ve overthrown our goverment , and I was firmly behind the protest, even close to ones in the top of it, and what we got is the removal of old system that was rigid and conservative, to be replaced with liberal and with young blood in it. What came soon after is sellout of all country resources and healthy industry to foreign interests, and the death of all industry that was troubled. Corruption got waaay higher, and our student leaders went on to be more corrupted and without any clear vision for our country while others went with Soros as part of Resistance movement, to teach students of various countries how to overthrow their countries, specifically as far as I know, to Ukraine and Egypt.</p>

<p>So, as I was easily mislead (it was the end of 90&#39;s) and thought it was organic, and full of frustration of then current goverment, only to learn years later that it was all orchestrated by globalist and Soros to drain the country resources and kill independence, I warn you now to read the signs, learn about what S. founded and funded, and be sceptical of what is going on with this, at least.</p>

<p>Because for me, it has all the signs.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

My family is from the same country op is from (this is why I added him as a friend on reddit)...my family looked on in horror in the late 90s at what unfolded. Coincidentally not only was part of a country stolen but a huge mine was taken over and the profits divied up amongst the then us president&#39;s cronies. I would say more but I want to be respectful of OP&#39;s wish to keep his background private. </p>

<p>wall street bankrolled Lenin to overthrow the Czar in a stupid futile attempt to recover earlier Russian stock market losses.</p>

<p>ZAKARIA: First on Ukraine, one of the things that many people recognized about you was that you during the revolutions of 1989 funded a lot of dissident activities, civil society groups in eastern Europe and Poland, the Czech Republic. Are you doing similar things in Ukraine? </p>

<p>SOROS: Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, u/babaroga73, for that information.  I love coming tothis sub, and enjoy hearing other&#39;s POV.</p>

<p>I am as skeptical as the next person on here when it comes to motives for polical movements and what not, but I think this is different.</p>

<p>I was a middle school teacher for about ten years, and the kids are actually a lot more reflective and caring about one another.  The advent of the internet might have muddied the waters, but it also exposed students to ideas that I never would have heard about when I was growing up in the 80s and 90s, and especially my parent&#39;s generation before that.</p>

<p>I think these kids will be a very different force who are actually much more aware of how previous generations are screwing them, be it guns, corruption, the environment, or overspending on the military.</p>

<p>What these kids do with this power is another story, and something you are concerned about as well.  For me, talking to these kids at the DC rally yesterday, and engaging with them as a former teacher, I would say you should be a bit more optimistic about these new group of kids.  </p>

<p>I do not think Hogg or Gonzalez are being told what to say. They were attacked, and are fighting for their fellow students.  Wouldn&#39;t you do the same if you were already slightly against something, and then that something upturns your world in the worst way possible?</p>

<p>I think these two are genuinely good people, very well spoken, and personally congratulate them.  Neither of them do not even want all guns taken away.  They aren&#39;t extreme in their proposals, which is another sign that they understand the issue more than many people are giving them credit for.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s my two cents.  Thanks for posting on here!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admire your spirit and faith in new generation of kids, but kids will always be kids. The first time I was brought out of school and into protests was in my 11th grade (16+ years), in the late 80&#39;s, and I was having much fun not being in classes with my classmates. That&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve changed the goverment. And from then to my 25th year, we&#39;ve done it once again, as students, each time bringing worse people in power. We&#39;ve had one brief month or so of ray of light, but it all shattered too soon to build anything good.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for the internet age kids and their experience, but there&#39;s reason why every village (and so shoulf this global village) had &quot;the elders&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not for kids to guide, and they aren&#39;t doing it in this case, too. Their idealism is invigorating and infectious, but they don&#39;t undestand the bottom line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was just a comment that we won’t see it. Hunters alone in this country needs guns, and people do need protection. I’ll march with you if they ever try to take handguns, which I believe truly protect good people who are vulnerable. </p>

<p>I personally know someone who was shot and killed by a gun when we were kids. Parents left it out and he was shot in the head. Too many of these stories every day pop up. It should be really hard for someone to get a gun. Would you agree that we need to make it harder for any ransoms person to just fill out a silly test and get on with it?

    <div class="md"><p>...how are cars regulated, exactly? 😑 Cars kill far more people than guns do.</p>

<p>Your anecdotal story isn&#39;t good enough reason. The vast majority of gun related deaths are from suicides....the left likes to leave that lil detail out. I wonder why.</p>

<p>So what sort of guns do you think they want to take away? </p>

<p>Guns are not that easy to obtain. If this Parkland kid had been dealt with properly after the ungodly amount of times police were notified of him and dealt with him, he would never have been able to purchase the guns he did.</p>

<p>And how do you think full on gun confiscation begins? </p>

<p>This is why pro 2A people are very defensive of their right and justifiably cautious. Once you begin chipping away at something it becomes increasingly easier to chip away more and more. And then what are we left with? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, Serbians, a more paranoid version than Romanians or Bulgarians, suffering as well due to rancid political corruption (generally, not accusing anyone).<br/>
While I&#39;m not going to go into those events that transpired, I&#39;d like to mention that generally among our group (Bulgarians/Romanians/Serbians) there&#39;s this sort of expectation that if you &quot;revolt&quot; once that&#39;s all you need to do in order for things to get &quot;better&quot;.<br/>
Romanians are slowly learning that the past few years, corruption hasn&#39;t started the moment we overthrew our dictatorship, we simply exposed more of it. It&#39;s not enough to protest once, or to overthrow them once, or to execute the dictators on second day of Christmas and broadcast it on the national television channel, you must do so continuously and involve yourself <em>in</em> the political and societal system.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point here is that too many people do not know about the Russian Revolution (and others) and strategies used to overthrow a government.  There is a lot of propaganda and manipulation happening --as well as false flags.  I believe the long-term (or maybe short term) plan is to create upheaval such that it will be necessary to establish a police state.  People will be controlled by the military.<br/>
Some of the current anger and demonstrations are against the Trump government.  But if we are not careful, we will bring on something much more dangerous.  There are powerful (and corrupt) people behind Antifa, BLM, the media, etc.  Soros is one, but there are others.  We are currently engaged in culture wars which are aimed at undermining traditional sources of stability (e.g. family, churches, communities).  Before getting actively involved with some of the activist groups, people need to be aware that they could be inviting something much worse.<br/>
Now another example is Iran.  There was a lot of corruption with the Shah and people wanted him gone.  Some were hoping for a Communist regime, others for something more democratic.  But the ones ready to pounce were the Islamic radicals.  Once a vacuum occurred, the radicals were able to take over whether or not the people were onside.  A small group of ruthless people is all you need to create a totalitarian state.<br/>
My view is that a lot of the political chaos happening, demonstrations and the rabid anti-Trump rhetoric is undermining democracy rather than helping to bring about a more just world.  Trump is for 4 years -- a military takeover (possibly even by the UN) would last for much longer.  I even think that threats to impeach Trump are misguided as it would create visceral and likely violent anger among his supporters.  Yet, those seeking chaos support this.  Dems, of course, support this, but I think they simply swept away with their own political animosity and not looking at what is best for the US.  Such a thing would be very damaging for the country. </p>

<p>Do not squander our democracy.  You need only look at revolutionary movements around the world to realize that what is going on is dangerous.  It is not the young people protesting (the useful fools) -- but those who are orchestrating all of this that are the danger. </p>

<p>I used this very same argument, which I see as truth, to a young liberal acquaintance recently. Sadly, she did not understand the logic behind the statement, but I am glad to see my sentiments echoed here.</p>

<p>My gut feeling here (don&#39;t ask me for proof, I have none concrete) is that Trump is on the better side of this far from Soros. Las Vegas, and its connection to Saudi, gun-running, and outside forces supports this as I really think Trump was blindsided by this event. Also, this event happened to target prime Trump supporters (country music fans). It was almost a warning to the Trump establishment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve written previously about the decimation of the family unit and the flipping of role normalization going on today. Children are now loners who give their attention to violent media, eat and drink toxic chemicals that affect their minds and bodies, have lost the ability to healthily express themselves and cannot function in a stable society. Of course this breeds violence and mental instability. Now that there&#39;s at least two or three generations of folks who have been affected by these factors, there will be bad actors who are happy to take advantage of the weakened state of these young people and mold them into whatever they want them to be. Even school shooters. Even militants. The data is there if anyone cares to look.</p>

<p>America did this decades ago and is still getting rid of what&#39;s left. We don&#39;t use protests to do it either, we disguise it a cultural advancement. Allowing Americans to protest is a good thing for TPTB. It gives the soccer moms and constitutionalists the illusion that they have some form of control over what the government does. Some protests will enact change, but it&#39;s usually short lived and any progress is quietly rolled back.     </p>

On the other hand, car accidents, cancer, and heart disease aren&#39;t as exciting despite causing more deaths and being preventable. The outrage against guns isn&#39;t proportional to the casualties or even to the chances of getting killed with a gun. I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t regulate guns, but seriously some people are taking it too far and are getting too caught up in their crusade. Anti-gun protesters are really great people with good hearts and good intentions but they are being manipulated by the media.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said it before, I&#39;ll say it again:</p>

<p>Obesity kills 10 times (40k vs 400k) more than guns annually in the US.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying.php?cycle=2018&amp;amp;ind=N01">food and drink lobby</a> spends more than the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying.php?cycle=2018&amp;amp;ind=Q13">gun rights lobby</a>, who is the favorite boogeyman of democrats right now, <em>and</em> it has more &quot;revolvers&quot;, or lobbyists who formerly held positions in government.</p>

<p>Food and drink companies lied to consumers about the effects of processed sugar, and have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/food-makers-pay-study-discredit-sugar-research-n698051">actively tried burying research</a> on the health effects of sugar.</p>

<p>Cigarette companies are banned from advertising to children, yet we have live in a culture that celebrates cartoon characters selling drinks with 40g of corn syrup to toddlers... in the middle of a child obesity epidemic.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is a growing body of data linking poor mental health outcomes to poor diet and nutrition, mental health and antidepressant use (benzos) is in turn linked to mass shootings.</p>

<p>So working on public nutrition not only saves lives out of that 400,000... it has an added result of reducing mental illness and thereby mass shootings.</p>

<p>But how often do you hear people talking about <em>that</em> on this sub, vs &quot;ban guns&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any concern for &quot;ban food companies from marketing sugar to toddlers&quot;... cause apparently no one actually gives a shit.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let the gun grabbers fool you... they don&#39;t give a fuck about preventing loss of life. The gun issue is entirely political to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t strictly used for anxiety. Maybe by classification, but you&#39;ll find plenty of evidence online that meds like Valium are often prescribed if a patient comes in with anxiety and depression, to treat them both.</p>

<p>Also, worth noting that Xanax is the most prescribed psychoactive drug in the US. So while the distinction is there, it doesn&#39;t really have an impact on the argument that poor mental health outcomes lead to greater prescription of psychoactive drugs, including benzos.</p>
