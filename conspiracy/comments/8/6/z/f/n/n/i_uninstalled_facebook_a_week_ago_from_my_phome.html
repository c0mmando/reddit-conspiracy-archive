       Watching a video now, another Facebook ad. I've seen the ad so many times now (50ish ballpark estimate) that it's catchy jingle is memorized perfectly. Screenshot taken a minute ago (ad played but is now on bottom of video);

       What I wanted to ask all of you; anybody have any memories or recent examples of something like this, involving strange 'coincidences', happening to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have targeted advertising disabled for google. So... I don't get it. Didn't see a Facebook ad ever before on Google until this. I also have been getting a lot of Rules of Survival ads recently ever since I downloaded PUBG for mobile. Again, don't get it since I disabled targeted advertising. Shits fucked.

       almost all the ads Ive gotten over the last year reflect this... leave home depot, instagram advertising home depot. park near a resturant, promted by maps to add review for resturant etc.  most recdntly was talking about finding new work, and started getting bombarded with 'looking for work in so and so province?' Ads on youtube, insta which is all I really use anymore. (Canada) Its getting very blatent and desperate. every phone is like a tether to most of these peoples minds, especially the majority with little to no attention span. Our attention and our money is what they want, milk as much of it before we die, unfortunatly many are walking dead, or deeeeeply sleeping

       This is what I don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôve been TALKING to friends (not googling, not web searching, not on any apps) to my friends about one time I went on a greyhound bus in college. Five minutes later, browsing Instagram and theres a Greyhound bus ad. It was the creepiest thing I‚Äôd ever seen and definitely not a coincidence.

       Nah I once got hungry and me and my friends started talking about getting some Burger King. I opened up google on my phone to see until what time it was open in my town and I only typed the letter ‚Äúb‚Äù and the first suggestion was Burger King. Im not even a fastfood guy, it was just that one occassion that we wanted a quick fat meal

       I have one FAR more obscure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to work for an IT company. My buddy was working on a project where he was using BRIX computer systems. Prior to that day I had never heard of them. I had been talking to him about the specifications etc. Then when I got back to my desk and pulled up Facebook, there was a big ad for BRIX computers on my iPhone. The odds of that occurring organically have to be absolutely astronomical.

       Use the web versions.  If you are more paranoid, use them in incognito mode.  I use web wrappers for any social media sites and you can deny them individual permissions such as location and microphone.

       Sorta remind me of my xbox(No Mic or kinect) and my brother and I were talking about dping our taxes. BOOM! Ads for TurboTax and the rest of them played non stop on YouTube. I yelled at the xbox jokingly that we did our taxes already and to show some other stuff.

       It has since then(1 month ago) never showed a tax ad or anything having to do with taxes. It freaked me out

       I‚Äôve been systematically removing apps and accounts for this exact reason. I‚Äôve seen things I haven‚Äôt searched or typed in ads immediately after a verbal conversation as well. So far I‚Äôve removed all Facebook stuff and am in the process of downloading all my pics to delete my account. Next, I‚Äôm disassociating google from my life and all associated apps and accounts. Then I‚Äôm moving from there. Not sure exactly how but I found an old flip phone that I‚Äôm very tempted to add as my dedicated phone again so I don‚Äôt have an info-scraper in my pocket at all times.

       Even if you have your gps turned off it figures out where you are and stores you frequent. I get ads for stores I go to all the time despite not having their apps or viewing their website on my phone. 
Strangely Insta seems to have no idea where I go or what I'd be interested in. I'm constantly getting ads for Coach bags and pageant dresses even though I've never been to a store that sells them and who I follow would indicate that's not my taste.

       Did you turn off your mic access on the app? 
Ever since I did that for Facebook and IG their ads literally don‚Äôt know what to target anymore.

       Also, I‚Äôve started to think since they don‚Äôt know what to target
       <em>
        in the moment

       that somehow it‚Äôs almost as if the ads have decided to start pulling back to what I used to look at over the last few years which is fucking creepy

       Ill discuss buying something and find it's 're first auto search after one letter. E.g. talking to my SO about buying some reptile bedding, open Google, type in 's' snake bedding immediately pops up and no I hadn't searched it before. Talking to MIL about Eleanor of Aquitaine, open my Google later, don't type anything and Eleanor of Aquitaine pops up with no prompting.
      </p>
      <p>
       On my SOs Xbox he has adverts for games or customs controllers on the front page, I get films - stereotypically for women films - or things like HayU (I think that's the reality app thing) rather than anything that would hint I play the games. It almost feels cultured.

       Clicking an ad only refreshes their 120 day window. You will see more ads, likely in greater ways as you now have their cookies in your browser allowing them to track everything from location to device.

       Facebook spends money every time you see a Facebook ad.

       Plus we can probably guarantee that Facebook ads aren't going to, like, surreptitiously install malware or mine bitcoins.

       Nothing you‚Äôre saying is vaguely related to what I said.

      <p>
       Yes, they cost them money. Because you make them more money. But clicking on them is insanely dumb. It is like putting out a fire with your face.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, they‚Äôre not mining bitcoins, just legally tracking you offsite. Any single click and you‚Äôre in their hands for another 1/3 year.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they can do significantly more. Because Facebook only tracks what cookies you have. Clicking an ad allows them to track you offsite.

       You obviously have zero understanding about the topic at hand. Nice try though.

       This isn't about the mic. They texted it. They probably clicked through and granted all the permissions to some app allowing it to read the MSM messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy the mic part because it doesn't make much sense from a technical position.
      </p>
      <p>
       First and foremost, what you do online is far more revealing. If you use Google,
       <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">
        go to your history.
       </a>
       It knows every page you go to, every search term used, if you use location data, then it knows every store you've visited.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason for them to listen to your microphone, because all of this other data is far more telling as it is what you
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       do rather than what you might casually mention at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, technically speaking, they are either sending all the data back to be processed, which would take up a ton of data, or they are constantly processing everything that is coming in through the mic, and sending back just keywords, which would be a huge drain on your battery. Either of these would be easily noticed and simply testable. Why hasn't anyone definitively shown this yet? The most likely answer is that it isn't happening.

       I believe they are seeing ads about things they've talked but that's because they are noticing those ads more. People don't notice things well that aren't already in their heads. When they talk about things their memory is structured to help notice ads about that.

       How do you know they never searched for it? Because they said so? Maybe they don't realize that they searched for it or maybe they are lying. How do you know that they didn't piece the information together some other way? How many things did these people talk about in front of their phones that they didn't get advertisement about?
      </p>
      <p>
       But, more importantly, why hasn't anyone been able to show any reasonable evidence that they are doing this? As I said, processing all of the data coming from the mic would cost a lot of power, and sending all of the data back to avoid processing it locally would use a ton of bandwidth. These would both be easily detectable, so why hasn't anyone offered up something that actually detects them using a lot of either one of these during times of lots of talking?

       Sorry, but this sounds like nonsense. You think a pet store is reading your texts? Coincidences like this happen all the time. I can believe Facebook targeting ex-users to try and get them back but Petsmart isn't spying on you.

       You'll learn to ignore them.  Stop watching television too, as soon as you can.  Once you start dropping all the ways we're socially programmed, you'll see more ways we've been programmed and you'll find yourself becoming quite insulted and angered that you never noticed it all before.  Bit by bit you'll regain control of your own mind and your self-knowledge will increase as you go along.

       This isn't a conspiracy. Facebook is losing people from everywhere, and they advertise on one of the largest social media platforms. To recoup those people, not because you deleted Facebook. Trust me, I'm getting those ads and I've never used Facebook.

       Happens to me all the time, too. Except I don't use Facebook, and haven't in a year and a half. The ads show up on YouTube, in chrome, and on quite a few other apps I use. We were talking about where to go for dinner one night, one of us mentioned how good tacos sounded. For the next day or so, pretty much every ad I had seen on the phone was for local taco shops and Mexican restaurants.

       Get rid of your smart phone and buy a clam shell. Uninstall FB or Insta or YouTube and you feel better but all your other apps are tracking you, Google is tracking you, there is nothing you can do while still holding the device on your person.

       But...  I like targeted ads.  It's gonna show me an ad anyway, might as well be something I'll actually buy.  I spend a lot of time searching for and reading pro wrestling articles (indies too, but the ads are all WWE) and gaming PC parts and accessories, so those are my ads.  Sure beats ads for home loans or cars or other things I can't afford anyway.

       Does this mean the only way forward after deleting Facebook is to do a clean install of the OS on your machine? That's 12 hours from scratch if you weren't smart enough to save an image after the last clean install (like dummy me who didn't!).

       Constantly getting ads on Facebook and other websites to buy Mets tickets. We often experience this when we search for something on Google/Amazon/eBay, etc... However, I haven't Googled or otherwise searched for Mets tickets. Oddly enough, I did just receive a postcard in the mail with their schedule yesterday and I talked about it in front of my computer, which was open and is microphone accessible.

       Strange coincidence.

       Late last night: I started seeing advertisements for 'The Terror', a show appearing on AMC this Monday. Once again, I haven't searched for it in any way. However, I was just watching a DVR'd AMC show which had loads of commercials for 'The Terror'.

       My stepdad is a huge fan of this little known brewery across the country, and was talking to my mom about how when they go on their trip to said brewery he wants to stock up on beer and more specifically, buy a shirt.  While they were talking about this he was on the brewery's Facebook page. Two weeks later (before their trip) he gets a package in the mail, no return address, with a shirt repping the brewery in his exact size.

       I made a comment about how "I'll fly you to london for the wedding"

       within 10 seconds, both of their skype ads changed to "cheap flights to london!"

       I've never even had a Facebook profile, but I bet they've still got shit loads of data on me. Bastards!
