       The shilling is so bad that it no longer feels like a place that could even host a decent debate/discussion.
 TPTB learned a lot when DIGG failed and decided that slow changes that are hardly noticed by the regular users is the way to go to avoid causing a mass exodus. Well, after many years of these changes, reddit is no longer being driven by the community. It feels fake. 
Time to go to voat.co or others. 
Good luck fellow legit conspiracyst :)

       That’s exactly what they would say.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want you to stay in their echo chamber, their golden social cage.
      </p>
      <p>
       In doing so they can moderate the spectrum of information you’re exposed to, and therefore subconsciously define what you deem reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how the Overton window is constructed, and why alternative media is so dangerous to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal of every freedom fighter/free speech advocate should be to stay behind and provide off-ramps for the unaware masses towards more open and censorship resistant platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to replace Reddit with a Tor-like open source P2P application that’s as impossible to shut down as bit torrent.

       This is a perfect example:

If you're not willing to see things the way the mainstream does,  head on out.  The sub is in good hands now,  thanks to the new people willing to apply some "healthy skepticism" to this place.

       HaHa!  I've seen the phrase "healthy skepticism" used this way before.  Red flags go up for me when things like this are said in a particular way,  especially when those words come from a year-old-plus account that has only commented in this sub ONCE BEFORE despite their age...

       I noticed that, too. If you can't continue slogging through the drudge, then hey, it's because one lacks "healthy skepticism." How about people get sick of applying CPR to a dying, fly-encased wisp of an entity?

       It requires a second layer, or dimension, of healthy skepticism to gracefully navigate through the misinformation efforts. Those incapable of this should cease participation. Your input is welcome but the landscape has definitely changed. The goal now is to reduce the white noise and to listen/read carefully. We need to reduce the amount of feedback so that the misinformation can be contrasted against the regular noise of information. It starts to stand out like as if it is a luquid motion that flows slightly against the grain of what otherwise would be the path of least resistance. We need it to stand out more clearly, and as much as possible.

       Normally once a week a language teacher would read us a story and tell us to write back how we perceived the meanings behind symbols, signs, taking into account the author and his circumstances, what hidden lessons and warnings were embedded etc. Another name for it perhaps would be analysis? That was a regular homework assignment too.

       Free speech is important, but so is intelligence. Anyone who is busy being prejudice racist idiots contributes absolutely nothing to intelligent discourse. If they want a chance to argue for that very right to be racist I think they should be allowed a platform to voice their opinions. The reality is they exist, so they should have a right to free speech, but I see their views are inherently flawed and destructive to themselves but more importantly anything the associate with, most notably the conspiracy community as we are already cast in a bad light by the media. Of course there are real racists idiot conspiracy theorist, but also undoubtedly a agenda by the news and media to cast us in that light and not to mention paid shills on reddit and voat who’s job is making us look bad, racism being one of the most effective methods

       Because I wasn't an idiot and decided not to spend a ridiculous amout of money on a specific education that wouldnt necessarily be useful towards a career that interested me straight out of high school, my perspective is invalidated on the fact that pretty much all of them are majorly liberal whether naturally or over time intentionally, and as a result ideas have to be self challanged, and most people can't do very well at it, which results in a ton of shit and very few good works?

       Not denying them a forum for speech just suggesting we are less tolerant of them this time around. How often have you ever been able to convince someone on the internet they are wrong? It’s not easy, put on top of that there’s a part of this movement that is exactly that countelpro and shills and good luck explaining anything to these ones

       We can gentrify Voat in a way...If enough reddit users head over to Voat, the uglier side of it will be diluted. Of course, there will be subs dedicated to racism, fat people and whatever else people like to hate just like the old reddit had. If people don't like it, they are free to ignore them...good and bad makes the world go round and will undoubtedly make it a more "interesting" place...Like a big city, there are place you go and places you don't...that is what makes it real, gives it personality. All that reddit has lost and will never get back.

       That's not really how free speech works though :p If you have that opinion, then it is up to you to argue for it but stopping people from speaking altogether is a dangerous way to go.

       The problem isn't, IMO, so much that they are allowed to say it, but that those who do it fall almost exclusively into two general categories: idiots who actually think racism makes sense and idiots who think they are being edging and trying to troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it suggests, with almost certainty, that the poster doesn't really have anything intelligent to add.

       Not exactly. We have to choose between an overly-regulated forum or a forum that includes mostly the people who want no regulations -- and that group is more likely to put up poor quality posts and comments.

       Who cares if people are liberals. Be apart of the solution, not the problem. Everyone can get along if we try. Your opinion is as valid as the next guys. We're all humans. No one is above another, and if they think they are, then I believe they need to do some soul searching.

       There is a 'market' for Reddit accounts... if there was a new rule that only old accounts could be used for something, then those kinds of accounts would go up in value in the 'market', and would be available to whoever has that much money.

       I am well aware of the marketplaces for reddit accounts although there is a finite number of ones which are pre-2015, and a few other sanity checks ( such as running a script through the account and checking for a “gap” in post history, most accounts which are sold through marketplaces have their history “stop” when the original account creator puts them up for sale and then starts again once purchased )

       Exactly.

       I've been a conspiracy skeptic that has been posting on and off in here for most of my time on reddit. It really wasn't until maybe late 2015 when I started to get called a shill (mainly for not being anti-GMO), however, it sky-rocketed to the go-to ad hominem during the 2016 election and immediately derails any debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I feel like this is what most people want. They don't want to actually have to defend their position, because this is hard. They just want to call people who disagree with them stupid, or accuse of them being paid by someone else, which justifies their position, because this is easy.

       I disagree with you there: I don't think this is a conscious effort to avoid arguments, I think some people truly believe this and every time this kind of paranoia gets posted it just reinforces itself.

       I didn't mean to imply that it was
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       a conscious effort. I do think it is conscious sometimes, but it is also a perfect refuge for the subconscious as a way to deal with cognitive dissonance.

       That's not what I said. Also, I get it. I used to be able to relate a lot to that point of view. I know it sounds cliche, but I moved from whitebread countryside to an extremely diverse city a few years back and my perspective has changed a ton, especially since being involved in an equal diverse church. So many community functions there involve people sharing each other's lives and it was very eye opening

       If someone was in front of your house yelling racist shit, youd also have the right to go out there and tell them to shut the fuck up. Hell, in some states you can threaten to shoot him if he doesn't want to shut up and leave and you'd be in the right.

       worldnews was never really shilled hard, it's just they banned any one even remotely possibly right leaning. I still remember being banned for nazi apologia for saying something somewhat critical of antifa, which even the average person on the left is iffy with

       I've noticed that lately the 'open minded' and 'woke' people have actually been the worst and a complete opposite from what they claim to be. If your ego is truly free, you don't have to say it, people just know.

       It is sad to see what has become of Reddit. I haven't been here from the beginning but definitely for quite a while. This site truly does hold a special place in my heart. I'm getting a bittersweet feeling about the end :/

       Frogs in hot water... People have been pushed to be angry an blame it all on others (once again) but so many people have been manipulated via their online haunts and habits they don't even know they're being played against each other.
They're given inane videos to watch whilst anything important slips by, and then given the exact news they need to be fed to do as needed.

       And there you go being a part of the problem. "Democrat controlled media" has nothing to do with it. The issues with this country stem from the government and media as a whole, both republican and democrat. Trying to blame one specific side like "democrat controlled media" or "Republican controlled government" instantly makes you a part of the problem. You are falling for their tricks and putting the blame on a specific party instead of blaming the real culprit, which is literally everyone involved both democrat and republican.

       I installed Tootdon (Mastodon client) last night just to see what its like, and I quite like it, its a bit chaotic compared to Reddit but you can have multiple instances logged in at once, so you can use the main mastodon.social and engage the general population or you can join or start private instances based on your interests. Mastodon shows promise, but its still in its infancy.

       I made a post months ago addressing the fall of  internet content in general and attributed it to the rise of the smart phone. Here’s why...
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to a decade ago to get on the net you had to a) love computers, b) understand computers and networks, c) have the financial inclination to make computers your hobby, and d) be a little bit of a loner. For all intents and purposes you had to be a bit of a nerd and this set the tone for what the internet was and the content on it (and I loved it, by the way).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then along cake smart phones and not only could they grant you access to the net with one button, but they did it as cheaply as $19.95 per month with your phone plan. Now suddenly every grandma, soccer mum, Cali-girl, 12 year old, a third world person was on the net, connecting and contributing to everything, and the quality and content of every webpage went down the toilet. Memes suddenly appeared, Facebook arrived, fake news, Buzzfeed top ten lists - it all arrived with the smartphone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Reddit hasn’t been immune. It took longer because Reddit’s UI is still very old school and
       <em>
        original internet
       </em>
       looking, but with the adoption of apps, the internet newbies have eventually arrived, bringing their low intellect with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how is this a conspiracy? I think it was intentional. The internet was a place for outward thinking, cynical nerds who would innovate ideas and fact check each other. We were seperate from the pack. I believe that by making it global and giving everyone access flooded the space with stupidity. Now everything is trivial gossip and vine videos and us old-schoolers are leaving the clearnet in droves.

       I don’t really agree with your idea that the internet was only for nerds who loved computers in 2008. Lots of average folks had computers then. Maybe in 1998 that was true...

       I think it's a pretty big stretch to say the internet was intentionally flooded with average people to thwart nerdy fact checking people from being able to have their own space. It was the marketing potential that made companies use the internet more and more, and the demand from people to have access on the go that caused smart phones to react accordingly. Remember when phones like black berries or slide phones had terrible internet browsers and you couldn't even load half the sites you went to because they weren't compatible? It was consumer demand to make those things better that drove the internet into what it is today. It was inevitable the internet would grow and grow and become more and more accessible. It got this way from consumer demand. Not because it was intentionally flooded to stop outward thinking.

       To that extent I agree with you, but what of the “last billion”? Zuckerberg wants these people online so badly he’s prepared to give them free internet to do it. These people are so poor they don’t have two cents to rub together, so why? They’re not going to buy anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Connecting the last billion to the net is either a case of pure generosity and global connectedness or something else, and since they’re browsing, buying potential, and data are worth nothing I’d say it’s about the final play for dilution of content of the net.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the last billion start sharing and posting and contributing no one will want to be on the net anymore and that’s the conspiracy in my eyes - dilution of its credibility to zero.

       Traffic has also gotten astronomically shittier with the introduction of the smart phone. I caught one dumb ads teenage woman holding up traffic because she was texting and honked and was like ,"What the fuck?" She then got mad at me.... her fuck up was my fault. Couple the full of shit nature with narcissistic kids and you get an incredibly toxic society.

       If you ask a legitimate, thoughtful question seeking more information about how a person has reached a conclusion, you're a debased shill.

       I could make posts all day saying things like Politician Paula is a carnivorous alien from space that sleeps inside a specially made chamber containing a mixture of Boric acid and Neon gas.

       If someone says, "Hey, wait just a minute.  How do you come to that conclusion?" - maybe I should have some sources.  I could get really defensive and personally attack anyone who questions or disagrees with me

       There are a few subreddits that are shaping up to be quite good, but I dare not say them out of fear of them getting too big and ending up like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has (full of shills, fake accounts, and generally being neutered to the point of being a joke).  They're small and usually a bit more focused on different topics and I think it works out better that way.  They're out there, just look for them.  Consider anything handed to you on a silver platter with a healthy dose of skepticism.

       In the last month I have noticed an actual

        decrease

       No doubt the players want the few dozen who see

       All of social media has been destroyed these days. The only answer is no more online anonymity. I can't believe I'm advocating for this but look at what we've gotten without it. People should not be afraid of pointing out when politicians are doing shady shit publicly.

       I'm in the same boat.  It feels really strange because for so long I feared the disappearance of anonymity online and the stifling effect that might have on voicing unpopular opinions, but it's beginning to look like it might be the better option going forward.

       last week for not being a retard. People do not realize I bait them in to look stupid by saying things like, 'men and woman are not equal because equal means the same, and woman can make babies and men can't. Men and woman can have equal rights and equal opportunities, because rights and opportunities can literally be the same. Men and woman are not literally the same, they are not equal. Our differences are beautiful, I'm glad we're not the same.'

       My point is that nobody on Reddit can even read properly anymore, I get labeled as a misogynists because I didn't express myself through endless declaimers using grade 5 English.
      </p>
      <p>
       The disclaimer is an obvious sign reddit doesn't respect free speech. This is why whenever someone asks a pro-life question, they add a disclaimer that they are pro-choice just to mitigate attacks, even though their opinion has nothing to do with the question that they are asking.

       Even
       <a href="/r/subredditcancer">

       If you honestly don't understand why you'd be banned from a sub after what I quoted, then that explains it all. You don't know how to interact with people in a reasonable fashion and you think you're the victim, when it's rather clear you're the aggressor.

That is why you punks all lose in the end and are beta males. Attack me for my ideas, not the way I convey them. Soo beta of u.

       At some point we have to wonder if using our time and energy to propping up Reddit is worth it. I went off Facebook because I couldn't support its principles and I often wonder if this site is much better. These days, it's not. This site is also nothing without genuine, organic users promulgating legit content so the BS is less discernible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I think the best thing legit users can do is walk away, not all too different than just shooting a rabid dog out of its misery as being the kindest course of action. Furthermore, the more we pretend like viable alternatives don't exist, the more we deprive better platforms of a solid chance of taking off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I burn accounts just about yearly, and my cakeday was two days ago. I've wondered if I want to renew or just walk. I like the mod changes of the site so I think I might hold on for a bit in hopes of brighter days, but I might migrate to minds.com or even voat.

       Because Reddit might be the best case scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       Servers aren't cheap and unlimited free speech means offering services to groups far outside the mainstream, which restricts commercialization. The lack of open funding restricts community size and market of appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are still very diverse communities available on Reddit: which leads me to believe that the people complaining are either extremists in their own right or are just whiny edgelords who got banned form other subs for being whiny edgelords. Either you learn to work within the system, accept the truth I've known for years: you aren't and never have been anonymous on the Internet and there's no such thing as free speech without repercussions; or you get the fuck out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This free speech bullshit, that you should be able to say whatever you want, whenever you want, that's a delusion: nothing stops me from thinking you're a shit, whether or not you have the right to say it. It's time for a lot of people to grow up and realize that the things you say and believe will influence how you interact with the world and no one owes you shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's only two solutions to the non-bias problem: either we decentralize so no one can control the entire network, which might mean there is no Reddit replacement, or we figure out how this system works and insulate ourselves from the effects we want to avoid. \
      </p>
      <p>
       Decentralizing also comes with the risk of the echo chamber, which only amplifies bias. You can see that happening at Voat.

       Question: did you think that because the user above said "I tried Voat and three of my first four posts were outright deleted by partisan mods" that there is lots of censorship at Voat?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that user specifically said to me when I drew that conclusion, "Now you are putting words in my mouth." You're not supposed to get the idea that Voat censors from that statement, so I've been told by that very user. :D
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, You can check the fully transparent moderator logs at Voat and see how much censorship goes on there -- virtually none. I'n mot one to agree with the prevailing view over there (as my history shows clearly), but I can tell you for sure, Voat is virtually uncensored.

       Over 10 years ago I came here from digg too. At one time digg was a great site. Better than reddit ever was tbh. But when when digg took away all the features that made it great, it went down the shitter ...it went down hard and fast.  It was no longer a fun place to be and users left digg in an epic exodus to reddit.  Now reddit is set to be even worse than digg ever was...reddit is becoming the dystopian future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with two brain cells to rub together will leave reddit to the new world...wherever that might be. The bells of tyranny are ringing...TPTB believe they have the people cornered. Censorship and loss of privacy and freedoms will be shoved down our throats in the very near future...quality of life will suffer hard if we don't fight back.

       LOL then delete your accounts and do not post at reddit nor read reddit any more.  The truth is you're gonna stay just like all the other "lets go to voat!" types.  Reddit has issues but it isn't the lack of censorship of hateful and quasi-illegal reddits.

       I actually feel like the sub is finally taking a turn for the better lately. Seems more and more people are accepting both sides politically are shit and some of the stuff we gave been saying for years like Facebook, Alexa, corruption across the board regardless of political affiliation are being more widely accepted. I just feel like we might be going the right direction and you shouldn't give up, that's what they want.

       We can gentrify Voat in a way...If enough reddit users head over to Voat, the uglier side of it will be diluted. Of course, there will be subs dedicated to racism, fat people and whatever else people like to hate just like the old reddit had. If people don't like it, they are free to ignore them...good and bad makes the world go round and will undoubtedly make it a more "interesting" place...Like a big city, there are place you go and places you don't...that is what makes it real, gives it personality. All that reddit has lost and will never get back.

       Oh, boohoo, I'm unpopular because I say stupid shit at inappropriate times, calling people beta males as if anyone gives a fuck what my opinion is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you honestly don't understand why you'd be banned from a sub after what I quoted, then that explains it all. You don't know how to interact with people in a reasonable fashion and you think you're the victim, when it's rather clear you're the aggressor.

       This beta male nonsense just raises a big 'asshole' banner.
