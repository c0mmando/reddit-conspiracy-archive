        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The world is up in arms because the rnc propagandists stored your information without consent.   Who cares?  Facebook AND Adobe AND Google AND nearly every other company make you agree and consent to storing your information and sharing it with capital P Partners (legal term).  So Cambridge may be a Partner meaning you consented.</p>

<p>In addition to this, even if they didn&#39;t have your information to run through algorithms to best sway your psychology, they can still place very directed ads and less effectively acheive the same goal because it is the business model of FB and Google to build such profiles on you.</p>

<p>So who cares who stored the data.  Pavlovs humans are easy to make salivate at whatever you want them to with the centralized free data we provide them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to do stage hypnosis shows.  With information about what you get emotional about feel rewarded about and feel scared about, it is VERY easy to force the logical thinking questioning mind into distraction.  In that state the suggestions they pose are accepted into the emotional part of the mind without question as the mind seeks shortcuts from perceived authority.</p>

<p>It is no different to Germany in the years leading up to atrocities.  Very small compliance tests were given first, then built upon.</p>
