        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Its_Malignant.html">Its_Malignant</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to think that <a href="/r/JUSTNOMIL">/r/JUSTNOMIL</a> was a support group for redditors who suffered from abusive and/or violent In-Laws... But after today I have to call it as I see it. I can no longer trust that the stories and accounts of the posts are actually true any longer...</p>

<p>Recently about a week ago a user by the name <a href="/u/IHocMIL">/u/IHocMIL</a> wrote a long detailed (embellished) story about her time saving a young woman from an abusive family who was forcing her into an arranged marriage with an extremely abusive older man. When the little girl fled from her family, IHocMIL took it on herself to help the girl immigrate to Finland to escape from being &#39;honor killed&#39;. I wont write out the whole story but instead enclose screenshots of the whole story first: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/2AvMT">Source 1</a></p>

<p>It took about a week before <a href="/r/Pakistan">/r/Pakistan</a> users saw the post and during that time IHocMIL managed to jump her way up to one of the top posts for the whole subreddit. A user on <a href="/r/Pakistan">/r/Pakistan</a> posted IHocMIL&#39;s story to the subreddit due to his skepticism and how the majority of the story did not add up considering the OP claimed it happened 15 years ago, but still could not have been possible even yesterday due to the fact the logistics of such an event never being able to happen: <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/v6cYe">Source 2</a></p>

<p>Users from the Pakistan subreddit posted on her story on <a href="/r/JUSTNOMIL">/r/JUSTNOMIL</a> asking for clarifications and within a few minutes she promptly deleted her story to brush it under the rug. I contacted the moderation team to let them know that they have a karma farmer who is using their subreddit to boost her karma and inflate her ego. If she has written such an embellished tale already, it is highly likely that the rest of her JUSTNOMIL stories are also fake and just written to farm some juicy karma. I get a response within moments of reporting her from the moderation team of the subreddit, and at the same time got a response from the PM I sent her telling her that she has been caught red handed lying. IHocMIL and the moderation team call me a tinfoilhat wearer and told me to stop believing in &#39;conspiracy theories&#39;. <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/JSRI0">Source 3</a></p>

<p>I refute their defense of her and as a result the moderator laughed, mocked me, and swiftly banned me. <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/cYIeq">Source 4</a> </p>

<p>So guys. What do we think about this? Is it based or is it just crazy talk? If the moderation team has no interest in making sure the stories are not fabricated, how can the integrity of the sub even be maintained? There are ways to say a story without doxxing yourself, and no where in her story would there have been an opportunity to reveal her identity. The details that were lied about were irrelevant to even protect her identity. It seems to me that the whole tale is one of self aggrandizement for the sake of karma. Its pathetic and its not honest to post such things in a subreddit that (claims) is a support subreddit.</p>

<p>When you call me a tinfoil hat wearer, I suppose I should post where all the tinfoilers go? Amirite?</p>

<p>Edit: User has now deleted all her stories on the subreddit. I guess that speaks for itself.</p>

<p>Edit2: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/86viid/a_reddit_post_showing_how_easy_it_is_to_spread/">/r/Pakistan documents the story</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>She is not. OP is butthurt over the rules of our sub and his poor reading comprehension. User was already in contact with us over (a) the details of the story &amp; what was changed &amp; why, and (b) the fact that she already intended on wiping that account because she had still left too many details to reveal her identity. The brigading and harassment that OP incited simply prompted her to do it immediately. Surely you don&#39;t think someone who has an entire subreddit attacking her deleting her account is unreasonable or signaling some kind of conspiracy?</p>

<p>She moved an entire country.</p>

<p>Anyone who is been to Pakistan and worked there would know that.</p>

<p>She also mixed up what language was spoken in what province.</p>

<p>yes, people do that. because if someone says &quot;i live in [tiny country] and [unusual thing] happened to me,&quot; that makes it pretty damn easy for the people she&#39;s hiding from to figure out who she is. </p>

<p>they&#39;re not mistakes, they&#39;re deliberate detail-fuzzing so you can&#39;t pin down exactly <em>which</em> country or <em>when</em> the story took place and thereby identify her. </p>

<p>You did not have a specific disclaimer saying that details had been changed. </p>

<p>You commenters, based on her story, called Pakistan a terrorist country, called for Pakistan to be wiped off the map, called for Pakistani &#39;middle eastern people to be banned from entering the US etc. In none of these did the poster contradict these commenters by saying that her story did not necessarily take place in Pakistan but that the details were fuzzed for anonymity. </p>

<p>You are contributing to ostracising of an entire nation of 200 million people, contributing to racial stereotypes about them and then claiming the moral high-ground and talking about how the other person did not &quot;comprehend&quot; the situation.  </p>

<p>You need to have clear disclaimers on the top of all such stories. Racial abuse and propaganda is fine in your sub but dont call out obvious factual inaccuracies in someones account because that will get you banned /logic</p>

<p>none of those comments were appropriate and should have been reported since they are clearly racist. regardless of what story a person shares, where it takes place, what religion/nationality it involves, we don&#39;t allow hate speech. but we can&#39;t remove it if we don&#39;t see it because it goes unreported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK I understand both sides of the issue now. </p>

<p>The dissenter guy was a bit of a dick, I will agree with you. Your own responses were not much better though. You refused to try and understand his concerns, and he yours. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll summarise how it should have gone for you.</p>

<p>Him: She is lying because her account is factually inaccurate. This portrayal of Pakistan concerns me because, Pakistan, already has a big image problem internationally and Pakistanis are regularly victims of hate crimes abroad. And this account, that is not factually correct, could serve to solidify negative stereotypes even more putting lives and wellbeing of Pakistanis abroad in danger.</p>

<p>You: Her account is factually inaccurate because it has been changed to protect her identity. She has explained to us that she did infact change the names of the country and cities this occured in.</p>

<p>Him: Oh, I understand. Could you please put up a big disclaimer that details have been changed. Especially in cases where the poster has actually told you that the names of places have been changed. Because while it may be that this is understood, alot of your users forget this and take the whole story as being true. This is evident from a majority of the comments passing judgement on Pakistani society after reading the story.</p>

<p>Also while this may be an unspoken understanding on your sub, popular stories also attract a large audience from r/all who would not be aware of such an understanding.</p>

<p>You: Oh yes, that would be a good step and it would prevent alot of misunderstanding. </p>

<p>Now if both of you hadn&#39;t gotten into a pissing contest. This is what the exchange would have been like and would have benefited everyone. Have a nice day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say only you were at fault. The communication breakdown was due to both of your faults&#39;. Though I do agree he became irrational first. I told him as such as well. </p>

<p>&quot;users from r/all have an obligation to read our rules before participating in our sub.&quot;</p>

<p>Ofcourse in an ideal world, everyone would do as they are expected to. In an ideal world the communication breakdown that happened here wouldn&#39;t happen either. Ofcourse, this world isn&#39;t ideal which is why I would encourage you to add such disclaimers to every story. </p>

<p>Also, its not just users from r/all. Like i said before, details being changed may be a generally understood thing in your sub but judging by the comments on the original post, hardly anyone keeps that in mind while reading the stories. So yeah, it would be nice to have disclaimer above every story just to remind everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stand corrected then. I do think that the original poster (the guy from r/pakistan, who called her out) was a bit of a dick. He was right to point out the inconsistencies but his language and attitude afterwards become personal and egotistical. Also, there is obviously a small chance that we are wrong and the woman was telling the truth. We obviously can&#39;t know for certain, but he was unwilling to allow that chance at all. </p>

<p>The mod who was replying to him here was a bit of a dick too. All in all, both of them were at fault somewhat. The stories should have clear disclaimers, on every story, regardless of whether it is understood to be the case or not. </p>

<p>OP in her actual post: &quot;they&#39;re fighting against a culture that thinks women&#39;s shelters are just brothels and there&#39;s no such thing as domestic abuse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s not their nationality that&#39;s the problem, it&#39;s their ideology.&quot;
OP: &quot;Housekeeper&#39;s FOO aren&#39;t from here and have run away back to their rural homeland where the rule of law is a myth, like dragons.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Geez. I have a friend from Pakistan who is here as a Fulbright scholar getting her doctorate. I don&#39;t think I fully realized how fortunate she is&quot;
OP: &quot;I imagine she&#39;s probably from one of the more metropolitan areas. The rural areas, especially near Kashmir and Iran, are much less liberal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This example of their culture is why I don’t want to let a single refugee from the Middle East into America&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That certainly sounds like most of the Pakistani people over the age of 25 I know&quot;</p>

<p>These are only a few of the examples of people forming opinions about Pakistani society based on a story which by the mod&#39;s own admission didn&#39;t even happen in Pakistan. </p>

<p>She could have easily replaced whatever country/cities it happened in with a generic &quot;X&quot;. I am not saying she had malevolent intent. She made a mistake. This can easily be solved by adding disclaimers to every story, or by making sure that generic placeholders are used in stories instead of country/city names. The main mod that replied is also at fault. Instead of admitting that there need to be a change in policies, he made it into a personal pissing content between himself and those that pointed out these issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She also removed her post because she realized that in using a country near-ish to where she was she’d unintentionally maligned a nation. </p>

<p>Not because she was part of a conspiracy.  </p>

<p>OP also left out his/her original messages to both the mod team, AND the user. In doing so you can’t see the original tone, or the words he used in his original messages. That leaves out a large piece of the puzzle. </p>

<p>However, asking personal questions to be answered, posting a whole post in r/Pakistan and getting users to come comment, DM OP, and several other moves OP made aren’t just against the sub’s rules, it breaks Reddit’s site-wide rules as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never implied that she was part of a conspiracy. Only that the mod &quot;dietotaku&quot; was being extremely daft in his replies. </p>

<p>The whole issue eventually just became a pissing contest between the OP and &quot;dietotaku&quot; tbh. And I said as much to both the OP and the mod replying here. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know why OP deleted her post. Those claiming her to be a part of a conspiracy, and you attributing her actions to purely good intent are both wrong. There is not enough evidence to be sure of either case. </p>

<p>In either case the rules of the subreddit need to be changed. Disclaimers on every post, and generic placeholders instead of real names are needed.  </p>

<p>The OP here left out his original messages in the original post. He commented with a link to them somewhere but I cant find them. Although the whole thing devolved into a pissing contest, his tone initially was not too inappropriate.</p>

<p>I am not too well versed with reddit&#39;s site-wide rules tbh, so I dont know if they were broken here. Have a nice day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you personally didn&#39;t imply it was a conspiracy, but look where OP posted.</p>

<p>And instead of reporting the unacceptable comments so we&#39;d see them quickly and remove them, he <em>first</em>made a whole post on r/pakistan about it, then went after the user (she got multiple unacceptable PM&#39;s) and demanded she come tell her personal information to the sub, <em>then</em> finally hours and hours later sent us a whole &quot;I caught a liar and I&#39;m going to break this sub&#39;s rules and make a whole post about it&quot; message.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where mods got involved. As to how I know the location and intentions when it came to the user deleting her post? Simple, I&#39;m a Mod there and she actually sent a modmail to us <em>before</em> he did.</p>

<p>The subreddit rules are clearly stated in the Wiki, which is very conveniently located on the sidebar. We, BTW, don&#39;t allow links out to other subs in our comments to avoid brigading. Users from r/Pakistan broke not just our subs rules, but by coming from there to JNMIL and voting and commenting they broke Reddit rules. That is brigading. Users of every sub and the site itself have the responsibility to read and follow the rules prior to commenting. </p>

<p>Had each of those users just reported each comment that was offensive they would have quickly come to our attention and been removed. And if OP here cares so much about our sub and community like he said  he wouldn&#39;t have shit-stirred. He&#39;d have come to us first, saying he found the post to be Inappropriate. He&#39;d have reported the comments. He&#39;d have <em>known the sub rules</em>.</p>

<p>He was banned for breaking rules, not because of some cover-up like he thinks. His message literally said &quot;ban her or ban me&quot;. Well, one broke sub rules multiple times, harassed the OP via PM and got other to do so too (and he claims <em>she</em> wants karma? Who cares about karma?!), then when told his posting would cause a Ban threw out the &quot;ultimatum&quot;. The other user notified us first, explained the situation, and pulled the post as to not offend anyone else. They&#39;re also a frequent quality commenter that has helped a number of people with her comments. </p>

<p>Placing an anonymous post on a support sub does not mean that readers are welcome to the details of that person&#39;s personal life. We don&#39;t truth police for that exact reason. These people come from abusive backgrounds and do not want to be found.  PM&#39;ing them asking for exact clarifications of where and when they were somewhere exactly is nuts. And the whole huge &quot;FB wasn&#39;t around  back then&quot; argument shows that when riled up, people&#39;s reading comprehension flies out the window. It meant that they were found on FB later, by their brother who was using a fake account. Also, if you read it clearly, there was years since the housekeeper ran, then more time between the user&#39;s and her housekeeper meeting then re-meeting in which time she was back on the street. There was also no timeline mentioned for how long it took to obtain a tourist Visa. And she clearly stated that the firebomb <em>didn&#39;t work</em> as it was not made correctly. </p>

<p>Thank you for being civil in your conversation and not joining in the brigade, but instead trying to see things from both sides. </p>

<p>Please apologise on my behalf to the OP. I wont message her myself because it might get buried in the spam she might have gotten from this post. </p>

<p>I apologise on behalf of everyone at r/Pakistan for users that engaged in brigading. We have more than our fair share of hot headed irrational fools there unfortunately.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in the middle of exam week at uni, so I dont have time right now. But I will make a post on r/Pakistan detailing the issue later and try to make users understand where they went wrong in trying to correct their grievances. </p>

<p>Thank-you for giving your time and resources to a valuable place like r/JustNoMIL. A cursory review of the subreddit shows that you guys are doing a valuable service</p>

<p>Instead she went on and on about Pakistan and barbarity and how she survived a supposed firebomb in Finland by honor killers... like wtf?

<p>Terrible plot, research, and worst of all her writing style is garbage. She hates &quot;white knights&quot; like her FIL yet works exhaustingly to be a white knight in her tale of grandeur. She survives firebombs and has a &quot;Spy&quot;-like hubby willing to go the extra mile to save that poor impoverished girl from those tyrants!</p>

<p>Worse yet you wont quit insisting you have integrity all the while defending this garbage you have on your subreddit. You are defending an <strong>N</strong> to the death!

<p>no, it really hasn&#39;t. all we have is one person saying &quot;it couldn&#39;t have been pakistan!&quot; okay, well it wasn&#39;t. she told us that. it happens all the time because people don&#39;t want to be identified. the only proof that has lent itself to actually getting someone removed for making up stories is when someone sent us a screenshot of person A posting an update to a completely different story as if they were person B (so one person was using multiple accounts to post multiple stories). THAT is proof of lying. &quot;i don&#39;t think that could have taken place in the exact location OP says it took place&quot; is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of them was removed &amp; it should have been. I&#39;m not attacking you. Ofc no moderator can verify the story before it&#39;s posted. I don&#39;t have anything against you.</p>

<p>But I find it wrong that someone would use a made up story about another country &amp; use a sensitive topic such as violence against women for what seemed like an attention seeking ploy. It had 900 upvotes so let&#39;s just assume 900 people read it who now think honor killers from Pakistan are running around freely in the West firebombing locals, peeing on their cars &amp; terrorizing them. It plays to the stereotypes people have of immigrants &amp; their fears regarding them not to mention making light of genuine problems Pakistani women face. </p>

<p>If the story wasn&#39;t even set in Pakistan then why not use a vague term to define the country? Why was that OP giving such detailed answers on Pakistani geography/culture etc. to anyone who asked? It&#39;s fishy &amp; weird. </p>

I love justnomil and it has helped me so much with my MIL and I understand changing details to remain anonymous , so I hope this doesn&#39;t get me banned... However, the OP didn&#39;t just change the country, she was responding in comments specifically referencing other places in Pakistan. It&#39;s not something you can just transpose and approximate from one country to the next... If Pakistan was just a place holder, why was she very specifically pointing out different cities where one of the commenters friends could be from? Changing details is fine I suppose but I don&#39;t understand why another country even  had to be used? Why not just say &#39;a middle eastern country&#39; if that&#39;s where it was, or a disclaimer like someone suggested...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do kind of understand where they&#39;re coming from, it is kind of frustrating that a lot of posts asking for advice get 15-20 comments maybe, many of them not directly saying &#39;NC&#39; but still giving unrealistic advice that doesn&#39;t break the rules but still ultimately boils down to cut off everyone in your life, while MILITW posts get 100s of comments. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything that can easily be done to fix this, but it is kind of frustrating. But I&#39;ll still take what I can get to help me deal with my MIL!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you seem like a more sensible/unbiased fellow than the other moderator posting here. </p>

<p>You guys really need a big disclaimer above stories that have their details changed for the sake of anonymity The other mod basically implies that the country name itself was changed in this particular post for anonymity. </p>

<p>Pakistan already faces alot of international censure and Pakistanis are routinely made a target of hate crimes abroad because of its bad reputation. I am not saying that we dont deserve some of this censure, but alot of it is due to pressure groups/interest groups that deliberately sell this narrative about Pakistan. India in particular has not been shy about admitting that they fund an international campaign to isolate Pakistan and Pakistanis politically and culturally. We have seen a exponential growth in online biased material portraying Pakistan in a bad light ever since Pakistan broke off with the US politically and started moving towards China. In a climate like this, you would understand why we would be sensitive about such a story. </p>

<p>I understand the need for the support group to not call out posters&#39; stories. Or to change details for anonymity. But if such large details are changed, there absolutely NEEDS to be a clear disclaimer about it. </p>

<p>Just in the comments of this story. Pakistani were called terrorists in general, culture was criticised based on the details of the story (which are fundamentally wrong on details about Pakistan btw), one person called for Pakistan to be wiped off the face of the earth, another person called for banning of entry for &#39;middle eastern&#39; Pakistanis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be more reasonable to continue to deal with problem threads on a case-by-case basis, rather than make our stickied auto-post yet longer, seeing as this happens so rarely [read: once ever].  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not seeing a lot of comments you&#39;re talking about. There is a conversation about whether or not to classify <em>these</em> people as terrorists, where the OP of that suggestion specifically states several times that it&#39;s due to the methods, not the nationality. A controversial conversation, but civil. There&#39;s one person who states that situations &quot;like these&quot; make her sometimes wish for the <em>continent</em> to be wiped off the face of the earth (which was removed by a mod after it was reported). I see one comment stating they don&#39;t want refugees coming from the Middle East to America, which was downvoted and quickly deleted.  </p>

<p>I understand the frustration that comes from identifying with a culture that is constantly negatively stereotyped, harangued, or worse, so I won&#39;t begrudge you the hyperbole. I understand seeing a thread full of falsehoods would be more than just irritating, but you have to take into consideration that people can&#39;t help what they don&#39;t know. Most people don&#39;t even know something as basic as that Pakistan isn&#39;t in the Middle East.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to track how it was handled at the onset of members of <a href="/r/Pakistan">/r/Pakistan</a> calling out falsehoods. It looks like the OP deleted the thread pretty quickly. Most of the posts from users are just calling OP a liar without substance--only one falls in line with out rules of asking for details without being accusatory, but the next reply to it does, and at that point the thread had already been brigaded anyway.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ll keep in mind to manually add a sticky about the &quot;fudged details&quot; practice in the future on threads that look like they may end up controversial, and about topics most of our users will have little knowledge of. I&#39;m not sure what else can reasonably be expected to have been done, but if you have any suggestions do let me know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you personally didn&#39;t imply it was a conspiracy, but look where OP posted.</p>

<p>And instead of reporting the unacceptable comments so we&#39;d see them quickly and remove them, he <em>first</em>made a whole post on r/pakistan about it, then went after the user (she got multiple unacceptable PM&#39;s) and demanded she come tell her personal information to the sub, <em>then</em> finally hours and hours later sent us a whole &quot;I caught a liar and I&#39;m going to break this sub&#39;s rules and make a whole post about it&quot; message.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where mods got involved. As to how I know the location and intentions when it came to the user deleting her post? Simple, I&#39;m a Mod there and she actually sent a modmail to us <em>before</em> he did.</p>

<p>The subreddit rules are clearly stated in the Wiki, which is very conveniently located on the sidebar. We, BTW, don&#39;t allow links out to other subs in our comments to avoid brigading. Users from r/Pakistan broke not just our subs rules, but by coming from there to JNMIL and voting and commenting they broke Reddit rules. That is brigading. Users of every sub and the site itself have the responsibility to read and follow the rules prior to commenting. </p>

<p>Had each of those users just reported each comment that was offensive they would have quickly come to our attention and been removed. And if OP here cares so much about our sub and community like he said  he wouldn&#39;t have shit-stirred. He&#39;d have come to us first, saying he found the post to be Inappropriate. He&#39;d have reported the comments. He&#39;d have <em>known the sub rules</em>.</p>

<p>He was banned for breaking rules, not because of some cover-up like he thinks. His message literally said &quot;ban her or ban me&quot;. Well, one broke sub rules multiple times, harassed the OP via PM and got other to do so too (and he claims <em>she</em> wants karma? Who cares about karma?!), then when told his posting would cause a Ban threw out the &quot;ultimatum&quot;. The other user notified us first, explained the situation, and pulled the post as to not offend anyone else. They&#39;re also a frequent quality commenter that has helped a number of people with her comments. </p>

<p>Placing an anonymous post on a support sub does not mean that readers are welcome to the details of that person&#39;s personal life. We don&#39;t truth police for that exact reason. These people come from abusive backgrounds and do not want to be found.  PM&#39;ing them asking for exact clarifications of where and when they were somewhere exactly is nuts. And the whole huge &quot;FB wasn&#39;t around  back then&quot; argument shows that when riled up, people&#39;s reading comprehension flies out the window. It meant that they were found on FB later, by their brother who was using a fake account. Also, if you read it clearly, there was years since the housekeeper ran, then more time between the user&#39;s and her housekeeper meeting then re-meeting in which time she was back on the street. There was also no timeline mentioned for how long it took to obtain a tourist Visa. And she clearly stated that the firebomb <em>didn&#39;t work</em> as it was not made correctly. </p>

<p>Thank you for being civil in your conversation and not joining in the brigade, but instead trying to see things from both sides. </p>
