       Asking out of curiosity more than anything. The way I see it, some of what he says rings true, and he seems a genuinely nice man, but on the flip-side, he's been around for a while, so it seems unlikely that he hasn't been compromised by now.

       I might be mistaken, but is that from the interview with Terry Wogan? And if so, didn't he clarify that he was saying that ironically? My memory is hazy, so i could be wrong there.

       Its not a scripture? Its critical thinking. Your mother and father created you yes? You share DNA and look similar yes? Ok, so why should it be any different from who we are created in their image? Maybe we're  in hell right now because we do not realize our true birth right as the children of god.

       Lol.  God has a chosen people,  the Israelites. He's not dealing with anyone but them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joel 2:27
And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.

       This is repeated all throughout the bible.  But read what he thinks of you if you're not an Israelite.

       2 Esdras 6:56
As for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from a vessel.

       Jimmy Saville was exposed long before Icke. Be real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pick an undesirable, real world human behaviour, any you like. Congratulations, you can now roam around calling out "the elite" on having that behaviour because a percentage of them in line with that of the general population will indeed attribute that behaviour.

       Are you joking? Allegations of Jimmy abusing kids go back to 1966. By the 1990s you have the Jim will fuck it t-shirts. Icke did nothing special.

       There are more pedophiles who aren't "the elite" than there those who are. In fact you will find at least 1 pedophile within an 8 block radius of any point in any metro city. Shoo now

       I think he has a lot of good information gathered and researched over decades.
He makes good connections in his dot connectors by following the money and influence orgs  - especially in the EU. 
He called out VIP pedos like Saville decades ago.Kudos.
Much of what is written in his first book has turned out to be correct.
Like everything each claim should be judged on its own merits.

       David Icke was an early influence for me. I don't have to agree with every single word he, or anyone, has ever uttered to derive value and different perspectives to incorporate into my twisted world view.

       I think his ideas on archons and the focusing of various types of energy (love/hate) are important considerations one should keep in mind when determining their path in this life.

       The thought crime laws are sort of literal. I.e. someone else cannot paraphrase / rephrase what you have said and then pass that off as the new truth in court. What you said is what have, meaning if you call youknowwho "reptilians", its not against the law. At that point only the individual who was called a reptilian could potentially sue you for defamation, etc, but not the government.

       Not really. Even if a small fraction of jews controls very much, this cabal still has a lord to follow - enter Yaldabaoth and his Archons/lizards/Annunaki bloodlines. People like to throw both ideas together and fail to connect the dots.

       He's right about the Archons/reptiles being the controlling force on the planet. The ancient Gnostics talked about this as well, and it's the most important subject of all.

       I think he's a good person. A genuine and sincere man who cares about people. He seems like a gentle soul... However, he believes that the royal family are reptilians who can shape shift into giant lizards. Believes there is a reptilian race who control the world. That we are being controlled by interdimensional beings.. I think he had some sort of psychotic breakdown and went totally off the deep end. If he could stick to the nwo stuff and the visible, tangible conspiracies he would be better respected. He needs to focus on what can be achieved, what we can actually change and be less concerned about convincing people about outlandish theories

       I like him, don't agree with everything but he's on to something for sure. I don't think he talks publicly about certain things, and he may be talking publicly about one thing, when he really means another. I'm not saying he's lying, but rather... I don't know, I think lizards are something else, he means something else, but uses lizards as a shield or obfuscation.

       I have watched David Icke for many years and here is what I think:
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, David Icke went on TV and claimed he was the second coming of Christ...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiyrHZCksDM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiyrHZCksDM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That should send up a couple red flags to start off.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the bottom line is David Icke is selling you a product in the form of books, videos, and lectures.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can take any of his books or videos and when you dissect the content you will find there is nothing original.
      </p>
      <p>
       He, and others like him such as David Wilcock, takes material that has been around for a long time (UFOs, Illuminati, Masonry, etc) and then repeats it with his new agey slant.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Icke can be a source of information but one very important thing to remember is that you NEED to double check and search out the original sources for all of this type of material.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the worlds greatest information resource at your fingertips, never take any single person's word on anything just because you like the way it sounds.

       my take on the "second coming of christ" bit is that
       <em>
        we all
       </em>
       have the potential to be a christ-figure. we are all sons &amp; daughters of the creator of the universe. therefore we are all holy. we only need to shed ourselves of material distractions &amp; embody the power of love. (cue Huey Lewis &amp; the News)

       They don't need to compromise or kill this man. His early concept of "lizardmen" played well into the hands of the mainstream media. They could throw "lizardmen" into any conspiracy and discredit the idea. They were happy to have him around with his "crazy" ideas just to abuse him with his "godhead". When he continued writing about worldwide conspiracies and many of his ideas turned out to be real, they were left with still discrediting him or offering him no platform anymore (until today). Killing this man with all of these books would legitimize many dangerous ideas from David. He is a pain in the ass of the worldwide satanic deep state and continues to push forward with ideas, that sound strange first, but may suprise anyone open for new ideas. That is my opinion on why he still lives and others don't.

       I read his early books when they first came out in the 90's and didn't really know what to think. They were not well written but his claims were interesting. He was correct about elite pedophile rings long before it became widely known or suspected. Everyone takes this for granted now but he was considered completely crazy to suggest it 20 years ago. I think he is sincere and not some kind of agent. It's probably worth listening to him or reading a more recent book but I don't know what he is interested in lately. I don't believe in real, biological lizard people but i think it's possible there is an ancient cult or bloodline that doesn't think of themselves as human.

       I feel like the lizard people theory is a metaphor for soulless humans who put money above all else. or there really could be reptilians I guess. Why is there many movies with actual lizard humanoids then? The elite are definitely fascinated with snakes but we do not know why.

       I just finished reading 'and the truth shall set you free' about a week ago and it blew me away. It was spectacularly researched, referenced and a number of things in it have since turned out 100% legitimate. The book was written in the 90's and so much of it is relevant even more now. Icke is probably the person who has done the most to 'wake' me up. Would highly recommend his books to people that want a bit more meat than posts on reddit.

       I love a lot of his work from the reptilian theory to the very interesting saturn worship to the matrix theory to moon theory etc. They are amazing. But again i hate him because he uses the 'fear technique' to sell his stuff to make make money. Also he does b*llshit a lot.
