<p>This is repeated all throughout the bible.  But read what he thinks of you if you&#39;re not an Israelite.  </p>

<p>2 Esdras 6:56
As for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from a vessel.</p>

<p>There are more pedophiles who aren&#39;t &quot;the elite&quot; than there those who are. In fact you will find at least 1 pedophile within an 8 block radius of any point in any metro city. Shoo now</p>

He makes good connections in his dot connectors by following the money and influence orgs  - especially in the EU.

<p>However, I don&#39;t really like Icke&#39;s delivery and some of his emphasis on specific people like the Queen of England, so I generally use other sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he&#39;s a good person. A genuine and sincere man who cares about people. He seems like a gentle soul... However, he believes that the royal family are reptilians who can shape shift into giant lizards. Believes there is a reptilian race who control the world. That we are being controlled by interdimensional beings.. I think he had some sort of psychotic breakdown and went totally off the deep end. If he could stick to the nwo stuff and the visible, tangible conspiracies he would be better respected. He needs to focus on what can be achieved, what we can actually change and be less concerned about convincing people about outlandish theories </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have watched David Icke for many years and here is what I think:</p>

<p>First off, David Icke went on TV and claimed he was the second coming of Christ...  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiyrHZCksDM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiyrHZCksDM</a></p>

<p>That should send up a couple red flags to start off.</p>

<p>But the bottom line is David Icke is selling you a product in the form of books, videos, and lectures.</p>

<p>You can take any of his books or videos and when you dissect the content you will find there is nothing original.</p>

<p>He, and others like him such as David Wilcock, takes material that has been around for a long time (UFOs, Illuminati, Masonry, etc) and then repeats it with his new agey slant.</p>

<p>David Icke can be a source of information but one very important thing to remember is that you NEED to double check and search out the original sources for all of this type of material.</p>

<p>You have the worlds greatest information resource at your fingertips, never take any single person&#39;s word on anything just because you like the way it sounds.</p>

<p>&quot; Cayce sometimes interpreted the Second Coming of Christ as being <a href="https://www.near-death.com/paranormal/edgar-cayce/book-of-revelation.html">an internal, psychic event within the individual seeker</a> (as in his commentary on the Book of Revelation), and sometimes as the actual return of Jesus Christ in particular.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t need to compromise or kill this man. His early concept of &quot;lizardmen&quot; played well into the hands of the mainstream media. They could throw &quot;lizardmen&quot; into any conspiracy and discredit the idea. They were happy to have him around with his &quot;crazy&quot; ideas just to abuse him with his &quot;godhead&quot;. When he continued writing about worldwide conspiracies and many of his ideas turned out to be real, they were left with still discrediting him or offering him no platform anymore (until today). Killing this man with all of these books would legitimize many dangerous ideas from David. He is a pain in the ass of the worldwide satanic deep state and continues to push forward with ideas, that sound strange first, but may suprise anyone open for new ideas. That is my opinion on why he still lives and others don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read his early books when they first came out in the 90&#39;s and didn&#39;t really know what to think. They were not well written but his claims were interesting. He was correct about elite pedophile rings long before it became widely known or suspected. Everyone takes this for granted now but he was considered completely crazy to suggest it 20 years ago. I think he is sincere and not some kind of agent. It&#39;s probably worth listening to him or reading a more recent book but I don&#39;t know what he is interested in lately. I don&#39;t believe in real, biological lizard people but i think it&#39;s possible there is an ancient cult or bloodline that doesn&#39;t think of themselves as human.</p>
