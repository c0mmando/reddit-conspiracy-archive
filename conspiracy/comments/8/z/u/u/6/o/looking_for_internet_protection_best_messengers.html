<p><strong>Signal</strong> </p>

<p>In the AppStore, the app appeared in July 2014, and in Google Play-in November 2015. Members of the non-profit organization OWS (Open Whisper Systems) worked on the creation of the messenger. The application can be used to exchange calls and messages with subscribers whose contacts appear in your phone book.</p>

<p>Signal uses &quot;Double Ratchet&quot; end-to-end encryption technology. Signal users who start chatting immediately initiate the creation of two encryption keys that exist only on their phones. And when users try to call, they see randomly selected phrases on their screens that must match.</p>

<p><strong>Wire</strong></p>

<p>This application was created by developers from Microsoft, Skype, Nokia and Apple. The first version of the messenger appeared in 2014 and immediately became cross-platform: you can install Wire on Android, iOS and even Mac OS. Initially, the program differed from its analogues, mainly by the stellar composition of developers. You can use it to send messages and voice, make group calls and chats, and send music and video.</p>

<p>The messenger is registered in Switzerland – a country whose legislation is famous for its respect for the privacy. In addition, the Wire provides strong encryption of data regardless of what device and OS used by the subscriber.</p>

<p><strong>Silent Phone</strong></p>

<p>This messenger is one of the tools of the Silent Circle package, which Edward Snowden still calls to be used in his interviews. Silent Circle develops various products for secure communication. Its origins are well-known experts on encryption Jon Callas, Phil Zimmermann, Mike Janke.</p>

<p>By its functionality, the silent Phone messenger is quite standard: you can use it to write messages and make calls, as well as to transfer various files. In addition, users can &quot;revoke&quot; messages that have already been sent, erasing all evidence of their existence in the application. Data transmission is carried out through peer – to-peer computer networks of high stability, while information is encrypted by SCIMP Protocol-developed by the company.</p>

<p><strong>Threema</strong></p>

<p>Threema is a Swiss-made secure messenger, which is quite popular among Russian law enforcement officials, businessmen and civil servants. The functionality of the application is standard: text and voice messages, opening group chats, transfer of various files, synchronization of contacts, etc.</p>

<p>Until recently, some experts have named Threema almost the most secure messenger available. The application uses the same end-to-end encryption mechanism, thanks to which the keys required to decode information exist only on users &#39; devices. Also, to use Threema, you don&#39;t have to enter an email address or even a phone number, which made. The app as anonymous as possible.</p>
