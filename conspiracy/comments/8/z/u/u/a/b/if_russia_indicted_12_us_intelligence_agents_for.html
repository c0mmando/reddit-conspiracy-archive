       Listen, I’m not saying Russia isn’t to blame or isn’t a bad place. However, everyone that is placing all the blame on Russia is ignorant of what the US would actually do to accomplish is ulterior motives.

       You left out the part where the United States illegal annexed Iraq, passed policies that allows for the targeting of their own citizens based on sexual orientation while also assassinating dissenters. Oh wait... that was Russia. This false equivalency is exactly that. False.

       See my comment below smart guy. False equivalency? Ooooh... You must be one of those smart college educated types! So what you are trying to say is that it's impossible to measure wrong doings? Or are you arguing that one side does more wrong things than the other and Russia is "more bad" than the US? Talk about brainwashed.

       My other comment in this thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yeah, Russia went to war with Iraq over non existent wmd's and a non existent connection to 9/11, a war that killed countless civilians and soldiers based on lies! Oh wait, was that Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well they went to War in Vietnam over totally legit reasons too.  What? That wasn't Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, don't forget that Russia spies on every American citizen recording and storing data of every type of communication including phone calls and emails effectively destroying any notion of privacy.  What's that? Not Russia either?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well Russia assassinates lots of people! They are so EVIL. They assassinated JFK, MLK, Bobby Kennedy, countless other world leaders and American dissidents like those American traitors at Wako and and Oklahoma City. The intelligence agency of Russia runs assassination squads all over the world, they developed undetectable methods of assassination like a heart attack gun and we really have no idea how many American citizens they have killed! Ummmm... What's that? Not Russia?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Please excuse the sarcastic tone of my comment but to suggest that Russia as nation is morally " more wrong" than the US is PROPOSTEROS. The US has become nothing less that Imperialistic. US imperialism is defined as " a policy aimed at extending the political, economic, and cultural control of the United States government over areas beyond its boundaries." The US has the greatest military force in the world with an annual budget of 10x more than Russia as admitted to by Putin himself. The US has extended is reach around the world in the name of "democracy" yet the US government has yet to bring to light and bring to responsibility the misconduct of the "democratic" party in propping up one candidate over another. That goes against the principles of Democracy. Anyone with basic intelligence and the abillity to make an unbiased assessment of the global political events and actions of the US over the past 75 years would be able to determine that the US is just as culpable if not more of most of the global conflict that has occurred. Let's not forget that it was the US that financially and politically supported Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan against Russia in the 80's which had tremendous blowback to the US and the rest of the world.

       I agree 100% with you Ben-Swann, Russia is shitty for brainwashing all of the STUPID, IGNORANT, EASILY INFLUENCED, and GULLIBLE American citizens! NOT COOL! Russia doesn't have the right to expose the political wrongdoings of the Democratic Party, and the American public obviously has no right to know what's really going on behind the scenes because then they might be able to actually make an informed decision about who to vote for. Americans are too easily influenced and should be left to be brainwashed by our own media's lies, we don't need to be confused with the truth of the actual election fraud perpetrated by the "Democratic" party!

       Yeah, Russia went to war with Iraq over non existent wmd's and a non existent connection to 9/11, a war that killed countless civilians and soldiers based on lies! Oh wait, was that Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well they went to War in Vietnam over totally legit reasons too.  What? That wasn't Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, don't forget that Russia spies on every American citizen recording and storing data of every type of communication including phone calls and emails effectively destroying any notion of privacy.  What's that? Not Russia either?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well Russia assassinates lots of people! They are so EVIL. They assassinated JFK, MLK, Bobby Kennedy, countless other world leaders and American dissidents like those American traitors at Wako and and Oklahoma City. The intelligence agency of Russia runs assassination squads all over the world, they developed undetectable methods of assassination like a heart attack gun and we really have no idea how many American citizens they have killed! Ummmm... What's that? Not Russia?

       Bob Mueller is a conservative republican and was appointed by Bush.  Bob Mueller was nominated by Deputy Attorney general Rosenstein, who was appointed by Donald Trump himself.  If they had a partisan goal, I'm gonna take a wild guess and assume they favor their own party... but no no

       So then we should allow it and encourage it?  This investigation isn't just about election meddling, it's also investigating Trump's role in the meddling and if his onslaught of pro-Russian actions are a result of some quid-pro-quo for getting him elected.

       Well yea, we have a large group of people who scream 'fake news' at anything that contradicts Trump while getting screwed with his tax breaks &amp; for-profit prisons &amp; increasing deficit &amp; loyalty to big Pharm (and big baby formula).  IMO this sub needs reprogramming since the alt right decided to make this their safe space
