<p>I received a community strike for cyberbullying and harassment on a video I made and uploaded about 911 and Aliens and Archons. The video was deleted. The strike is gone but I feel that ever since the strike my views and subscribers has gone down considerably.</p>

<p>I have seen entire channels deleted that I was subscribed to that were on conspiracy stuff.</p>

<p>Really sucks! I need a place to upload videos like this.</p>

<p>In Addition, I get recommendations of &quot;Like a Boss Compilations&quot; and other stupid videos. I click ignore but they keep recommending even more. I guess that stuff is really what they want you to watch. The dumbing down of Society!</p>

<p>The Truth About The Paris Attacks, 9-11 and Archons - This video was deleted by YouTube on the mind444 Spiritual Tribe Channel, but now you can watch it on our website exclusively. Here is a link to the website: <a href="http://mind444.com/">http://mind444.com</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>While maybe not a dumbing down per say, there definitely is an agenda, and being the powerhouse they are, YT has creators by the throats. A good conspiracy out there is that LeafyIsHere was their first major test run for the new algorithm when it came to &quot;BLACKLISTING&quot; content they didn&#39;t approve of. Yeah, one could argue Leafy deserved it, but it&#39;s been becoming a very prominent issue. A lot of channels have been hit for stuff like swearing, or mention of explicit content. Look at the fitness industry. Someone gets called out for steroid use, the person who called them out gets hit for mentioning steroids in their videos, while the accused are doing better than ever. Gun related content of any kind has been hit hard too from what I can see, but I&#39;m no gun enthusiast. I rly couldn&#39;t tell you. As for conspiracy videos, I feel you there as well. The Leafy consp. I told you about came from Shane Dawson&#39;s YT, but I hardly get notifications from his channel, even though I&#39;m subscribed. </p>

<p>At the same time, however, I think there is a manual side to this as well. Look at Logan Paul. After the suicide forest incident, you&#39;d think there would be some blacklisting, but no. He still rakes in millions. I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s why they even turned a blind eye to it in the first place.  It&#39;s about an agenda, but money is money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes money and fear. They allow videos that fill you with fear that is part of the agenda. But not the fear that opens your mind. This topic is in the video on my home page <a href="http://mind444.com">http://mind444.com</a> but yes it started with swear words, gun videos and stuff most of those the demonetized like prank channels. But the conspiracy stuff the flat out deleted channels and videos. YouTube is becoming a shot show if you ask me. High frequencies and vibes.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think it slowed down but at the end of 2017 gun channels whether memey or not were getting fucking nuked. I had a playlist mostly by guys like nutnfancy, hickok, and demoranch, but i would add recommended videos and related videos to the playlist. I checked it out last month, over 1/3rd of the videos were deleted. Maybe more, it was a large amount of my playlist gone.  </p>
