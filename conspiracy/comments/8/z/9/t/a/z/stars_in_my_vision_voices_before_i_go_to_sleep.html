       Either you have mental health problems or you’re victim of a psyop. Either way you should see a doctor ASAP. This country is over medicated but guys like you should definitely be evened out, unless you enjoy the experience. If not I’d see a professional

       I have mental health issues, like everyone else.

      <p>
       But i liked “victim of a psyop”. That’s amazing. It’s a great way to describe what I feel day to day.

       Trust me, the dot in my eye that i can talk to that replies back, cannot really be considered anything like a mental illness. Read my other posts. I’m not

       I tried 😂. It’s a female and a male. I’m not quite sure what they want. They communicate with me, occasionally, but intentionally leave me in the dark about their intentions.

      <p>
       Apart from the occasional body pain that they provoke when I pray, they’re harmless-ish. I just want to know if other people know about this.

       Nobody is watching you, ask yourself the question why would they bother? you are a nobody just some random person. You're nothing special your not a world leader, a business leader, or someone with a following.

       So please whats the most likely explanation, that a government is watching you and your boring life for shits and giggles or you're having a mental breakdown.

       I trust that every single time people make posts like this they deny they need medical help. Then it always comes out that they used to be on some meds, or have a history of mental health problems. Which one applies to you? Because I bet it's both, visit your doctor.

       Voices before falling asleep is not uncommon. Is say it's akin to slipping into a dreamstate where you yourself aren't fully unconcious enough to experience them passively. The more exhausted you may be and they will be easier to experience.

       Hey OP, medical professional here. I thought you might be trolling, so I took a look at your post history to see if that were the case, but it looks like you're telling the truth, and you used to be on Risperdal and Zyprexa.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important you go see a doctor and tell them what's going on. What's happening to you isn't something to be taken lightly, so for your own sake, please go talk to someone and at least entertain some other options.

       You could be a targeted individual. Should you have a predisposition for consciousness of the higher densities...it wouldn’t too far fetched to say you have an “invisible” force around you. Focus on higher density thoughts like love, forgiveness, and empathy while weeding out thoughts like anger, hatred and jealousy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try exercising and talking to other targeted individuals. There are plenty of online support groups and articles about what you’re experiencing. If it gets to be too much, professional help always is a go to. There are many psychologists who take a very different approach to ensuring mental stability.

       This is a spiritual thing.  You have unclean spirits and their thoughts become your own thoughts and you can sometimes differentiate them.  You open yourself up tot hem when you meditate, astral project, or take certain types of drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 11:24  When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 11:25  And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 11:26  Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above is an example of a spirit leaving a person then the person meditation or doing something to "clear their mind" and makes more room and gets more of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next is a very far gone example of someone who is so full of them he no longer has control of his body.  They also can give humans supernatural ability which si why they are sought after in witchcraft (they call it "filling your chalice")
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:2  And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:3  Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:4  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:5  And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:6  But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:7  And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:8  For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:9  And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:11  Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:12  And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:13  And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:14  And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:15  And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best solution for this problem is to have the Holy Spirit dwell within you.  You get that by repenting and believing this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       I Meditate often and have not experienced anyone pretending to be any of those things, so that is a loaded question. Do what you will, but don't impose your beliefs on others through fear. You are doing a disservice to OP to reinforce their paranoia while in a way dissuading them from seeking expert advice.

       On the contrary I'm one of the few that believe he's actually hearing voices that aren't his own.  So called "experts" have no clue and are simply blind practitioners of the materialistic region of scientism.  They will simply peddle drugs to him for the pharmaceutical companies.

       You imply that you are more experienced or proficient at meditation without knowing my abilities, and also imply that hearing voices is something to progress towards while doing meditation. Perhaps you're doing it wrong? Don't worry sometimes you have to fail a few times at something before you learn how to do it properly, we're only human..  you do claim to be a human right?

       Hey friend, I belive you.
Rather, I believe you have a better grasp on your mental state than I can or should infer.
As such, what you claim I believe you at face value.
Anything is possible, I am a concerned/interested stranger.
If there's no malice in their presence I would say there's nothing to worry about.
Choose to be master of your internal domain.
Tell the darkness very clearly.
I love you, I am you, thank you. 
Don't be afraid to play in your imagination, bw delusional, be happy.
But also be aware.
Just some sharethoughts
Here's my two cents.
If it's a highly spiritual significant event taking place, good vibe, good advise, possibly painful but for-the-better-good type of interactions you may be in a position to hear the Mother and Father. Or the Goddess and God, the beings from whose mind this reality shapes. They are deeply interpersonally conscerned about us so it's entirely possible. This would be why it hurts when you prayeditate. If you have some lower entity attachments, Energy blocks, it's going to Hurt to remove them. 
They are a part of you and they "stick" it takes some effort to remove them and it's only comfortable afterwards.
So your pain could be a sign of healing work being done on you.
Love and light to you friend, the path is dark and gray on it's bleakest streets, but sunlight and betterdays await for the moment you are ready to become them.

       Hmm, then in language molded from my mind for your use is that the God and Goddess are but identity extensions of the nameless, formless, boundless one.
I call that being, Source.
You may call them what you wish :)
