       (This post was removed from r/politicaldiscussion, because the mods claimed I was “soapboxing my political agenda”. Thought I’d try posting it here.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re a mod who’s reading this, I’d implore you not to remove this post or to shadow ban me. All I’m doing here is
       <em>
        desperately
       </em>
       trying to raise awareness about a profoundly important topic most Americans know little or nothing about... Please don’t rob my of my last shred of faith in humanity by denying the opportunity to participate in this public forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who don’t know, the FBI’s COINTELPRO—COunter INTELligenge PROGram—was a program which sought to actively sabotage/discredit a slew of leftist dissident movements, organizations, and leaders using subversive/deceitful/manipulative and
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       illegal, amoral, and anti-democratic tactics. Among others, the dissident movements which were targeted by the FBI included the civil rights movement, the black panthers, the anti-Vietnam-war movement, and the American Socialist movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI would effectively accomplish their goals by planting evidence, planting bogus stories with contrived narratives in the media, infiltrating organizations and publicly engaging in illegal behaviors which reflected poorly on those groups, no knock raids (one of which ended with an up-and-coming civil rights leader being shot to death by law-enforcement while he was sleeping in bed), “alleged” assassinations (MLK), and a slew of other despicably unconscionable tactics which served to undermine the success of leftists dissidents by quietly sniffing them out, or by baselessly destroying their credibility in the public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI got caught, but was never held even remotely accountable for what it had done. Barely even got a slap on the wrist from the federal government. American news media barely touched the story, swept it under the rug, and the American people ultimately forgot about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, in the wake of Donald Trump’s entirely-avoidable presidency, leftists across the board have become
       <em>
        vehemently
       </em>
       supportive of the FBI, despite the Bureau’s verifiable history of effectively getting away with COINTELPRO. In my mind, Democrats supporting/trusting the FBI after COINTELPRO is akin to rape victims supporting/trusting Bill Cosby after he was convicted for multiple rapes (an ugly metaphor, I know, but it gets the point across).
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, it’s worth mentioning that I was born and raised in The USA, and that I’ve been a registered Democrat since I was 18. I voted for Sanders in the 2016 primaries, but didn’t vote in the election because I was butt-hurt about his loss to Clinton, and about Hillary supporters’ outspokenly smug victory. (Truth be told, I firmly believe that Hillary’s victory over Bernie was just as illegitimate as her supporters believe Trump’s presidential victory was). All this being said, my voting decisions and my vaguely butt-hurt attitude
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be completely irrelevant to the discussion I’m hoping to have here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, my point is that I’ve brought up these COINTELPRO-centric concerns to establishment-loyal Democrats many,
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       times since the Trump/Russia/collusion/propaganda scandal hit the mainstream, and
       <em>
        every single time
       </em>
       I’ve been baselessly accused of being a “Russian troll/shill/puppet”, a “Trump supporter”, a “traitor” and crap like that, and
       <em>
        none
       </em>
       of these people have offered me a valid counter-argument in response to my concerns about their trust in the FBI. It’s like they’re overcome with emotion to the point that they become irrational when I openly criticize the FBI. I know for an absolute fact that I’m not the only academic dissident leftist who has been effectively alienated by establishment-loyal Democrats in the past couple years. In all honesty, I have almost no interest in voting in the next election because of how I’ve been treated by my peers since 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, from my point of view, it seems highly,
       <em>
        highly
       </em>
       likely to me that the FBI has either embellished or entirely falsified this entire Trump/Russia narrative just to divide and weaken the American political left. As someone who has spent literally hundreds of hours researching COINTELPRO over the years, such a strategy fits the archetypal COINTELPRO m.o.
       <em>
        flawlessly
       </em>
       .

       I hear what you’re saying, and I agree with you. In the wake of the 2016 election, rational conversations about politics are as impossible as I’ve ever seen them in my life, especially ones that are centered around Trump and the FBI investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn’t help that social media sites like Reddit—the most popular and accessible forums for political discussion in our time—are strictly controlled by private interests who can censor content freely with the blessing of our federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I see the narrow-scoped nature of these MSM-guided discussions on this site and others, I can’t help but be reminded of something Noam Chomsky once said:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but to allow very lively debate within that spectrum”.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s exactly what’s happening on Reddit and all these other privately-owned “public” forums that Americans depend on to discuss politics with our peers. Genuinely dissident content is being actively censored with great prejudice, and the general public are comfortably oblivious to that fact. Hell, I’ve had well over a dozen of social media accounts be shadow banned because I used them to raise awareness and to educate people about topics like COINTELPRO and Operation Northwoods, among many others. I’ve even seen dozens of self-proclaimed “liberals” express whole-hearted approval of government suppression of what they called “leftist radicals” like me. The second you begin advocating for the suppression
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       dissident’s voice, you’ve gone from being pro-democracy to pro-fascism, that’s a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, establishment-loyal Democrats and Republicans alike are so emotionally invested in these deceitful and contrived narratives, when bona fide dissidents come along and start making arguments that cast doubt on the popular, MSM-inspired “world views”, rationality goes out the window. All these people who naïvely rely on exclusively for-profit corporate media to accurately convey truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth invariably come unhinged when you insinuate that they aren’t as informed as they think they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you being up the FBI’s COINTELPRO to establishment-loyal Democrats, they abandon rationality because they can’t face the fact that they’ve been blindly rooting for bona fide “bad guys” throughout this whole investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, when you point out the fact that Trump is just another corrupt/inept politician, they abandon rationality because they can’t face the fact that their “swamp-draining renegade” is just another archetypal crook/useful idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, I was also disappointed when Bernie made that dismissive, off-the-cuff comment about Hillary’s emails during that debate, but not half as disappointed as I was to see millions of democrats hypocritically denouncing Trump as a traitor without hesitation as soon as the collusion/election interference scandal broke. Both scandals are undoubtedly in the same league, but democrats chose to blindly dismiss one while vehemently validating the other. That’s irrational hypocrisy, plain and simple.

       You're thinking clearly, and this subreddit is definitely the place for this kind of discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember that when you think you've reached the bottom of the rabbit hole, it almost invariably goes deeper…
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, for your comment alone I should point out that Noam Chomsky is in fact a government asset and gatekeeper to corral freethinkers into his worldview. Listen to what he won't talk about and whom he won't criticize. Then you know who his real bosses are.

       Well, you're barking up the wrong tree talking to democrats about anything anti deep state. The three "greatest" democratic presidents of all time were all horrible. FDR, JFK, and Obama. Think about the the worst parts of modern American history, and all three are at the forefront. JFK alone set I'm motion things that changed the face of what the deep state is that affect us to this day.

       Very interesting. Obama wouldn’t surprise me, but I’m curious to hear your reasoning about JFK and FDR. The way I’ve got it figured, JFK was assassinated for
       <em>
        opposing
       </em>
       Operation Northwoods and the CIA as a whole.

       I’m not gonna go there with you. If you
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       want to understand why so many Sanders fans felt as if they were cheated by Clinton and the DNC, you should have no trouble figuring that out in your own. Research and critical thought are your best friends. If you don’t think you can investigate that topic with an open mind—which I suspect is the case—don’t bother. At any rate, I’m not going to waste my time trying to convince you of something you don’t want to be convinced of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said in my post, I’m here to discuss the notion that the FBI could feasibly be employing COINTELPRO tactics to confuse and divide America’s political left, not to convince you that Bernie would have won (which he totally would have).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to chock up this response—which I have no doubt will disappoint/offend you—to me “shying away from an argument”, feel free to have the last word. My treat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take care, cool guy.

       (a) The whole "Bernie was cheated by the DNC" thing is claim used by Trump supporters as whataboutism to distract from the investigation into his administration and as a means to justify Russian hacking because the hacks supposedly exposed this cheating.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) People don't suddenly love the FBI or exonerate the agency for their awful history. Your claims about divisions on the left sound like concern trolling and/or wishful thinking.

       What victory?  Trump won more electoral votes which I was pretty sure determines the outcome of the election.  She got more popular votes but these were in states she had already won, so it would make no difference in electoral votes.

       And yet more people showed up to support Hillary at the polls. Who gives a shit if Bernie could get a bunch of idealistic young folks to come out to a campaign rally when those same demographics repeatedly fail to actually show up to vote. The fact is Bernie supporters are much more likely to be in the cynical "the systems rigged, why bother voting" camp than Clinton supporters were, and in no surprise to anyone actually paying attention that habit of not showing up to vote (and not spending non-election years organizing) bit them in the ass.

       You think votes cast on electronic voting machines are tallied like they should be?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are mountains of evidence that this isn't the case.   Way back in the year 2000/2004 elections,  there were many precincts in which there were more votes cast for Bush than there were registered voters in the precinct.   That didn't make the "news", but it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vote tallies acquired through electronic voting machines are, generally,  a reflection of who can fuck with them the most. If you want to pretend that easily manipulated vote tallies are 100% reliable,  though....  Have fun with that.

      <p>
       And why do you suppose that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Has it ever occurred to you that the
       <em>
        exclusively
       </em>
       billionaire-controlled mainstream media’s
       <em>
        blatantly obvious
       </em>
       anti-Bernie/pro-wealth-disparity bias might have contributed to Bernie’s loss in same way you believe “Russian propaganda” contributed to Hillary’s loss against Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       Has it ever occurred to you that Bernie was at a severe financial disadvantage against Hillary, because he stood by his promise to reject donations from the radically-wealthy, whereas Hillary shamelessly took millions and millions of dollars from the billionaire class while she hypocritically claimed she supported campaign finance reform?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the incontrovertible
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       that the sheer magnitude of Bernie’s grassroots support was
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       unprecedented in American history lost on you? Did it ever occur to you that a candidate who was receiving a
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       unheard of levels of grassroots support might be worthy of your fair consideration instead of your MSM-inspired dismissal?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the incontrovertible
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       that the DNC flat out said that they were “under no obligation to run a fair primary” when they were accused of displaying favoritism towards Hillary and prejudice towards Bernie irrelevant in your mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       You Hillary loyalists can sit there stubbornly rejecting reason and rational thought, spouting off senseless technicalities and irrelevant facts, basking in your deplorable and undeservedly smug sense of self-righteousness, and resentfully accusing us Bernie loyalists of being “sore losers” while you hypocritically bitch and moan about your ‘unfair’ loss to Donald Trump—the most blatantly corrupt and easily defeat-able presidential candidate
       <em>
        of all time
       </em>
       —but no matter how desperately you want to pretend it isn’t true, no matter how many bogus excuses you choose to lean on, and no matter how painful it might be for you to face reality, Bernie would have beaten Hillary
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       Trump in a fair election, no doubt.
       <em>
        That’s
       </em>
       reality. You either choose to come to terms with it, swallow your arrogant pride, and admit to yourself that you’ve been siding with fools, hypocrites, and crooks for the past 2+ years, or you can double down on your willful ignorance, adamantly deny any wrong doing on your part, and reject all accountability like the stubborn ass your corrupt-to-the core political party chose as their laughably-befitting logo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay,
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       , you can have the last word. There’s nothing you can say that will negate the truth of what I just told you, although I
       <em>
        seriously
       </em>
       doubt you could even bring yourself to read this entire comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take care.

       I'm deplorable, but Berniebros I know didn't put the bong down long enough to vote for him. 15+ people, one voted for him. Everyone else had some bullshit excuse for why they didn't make it to the polls. Now repeat that 20,000,000 times. Combine that with the DNC picking Hillary to be the 2016 nominee in '08, and you get what we got.

       Anyone in here defending HRC or establishment democrats is just here to stir the pot. They know what people think in this sub, and don’t try to convince anyone of anything. Instead, they attack your arguments and offer nothing in return.

       On another note, I would have liked to see sanders as president, but at the same time I wonder how much of a difference he really would have made. He probably would at best have ended up writing good bills that get filled with screwed-up, unrelated legislation. In the end it is apparent that on a long enough time span people who get into power are either converted to the dark side, rendered impotent, or thrown out. The entire government needs a reset at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also struggling with whether or not to support the progressive cause. Many progressives seem to on one hand be saying, “the system is broken!”, and on the other hand saying, “the same system should provide healthcare and college education!” This combination of ideas really seems like double think to me. I agree that equal opportunity of healthcare and education are important in the modern world, but I think the better solution would be to make these things actually affordable. Both healthcare through insurance, and college through easily qualified student loans have made those markets awash with seemingly limitless amounts of money. This creates a situation where it is a race to raise prices rather than lower them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not really on topic, but I’ve liked your ideas so far.

       Maybe because the DNC rules for closed primaries made it difficult for people to vote for Bernie
      </p>

       Garber-Paul thought to double-check her status – only to discover she’d missed the voter affiliation change deadline (of which she was unaware) by about a week.

       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/new-york-primary-deadlines-voter-registration">
        “The most frustrating part to me was that neither the state website nor the Democratic party [notified] me that the registration was invalid,” she said.
“This feels like a bullshit way to disenfranchise people in the primary,”
she added. “Given that our presidential elections are two-party affairs, it seems pretty disingenuous to make it so hard for voters to participate.”

       Throughout primary season in 2016, Bernie was the only Democratic candidate who beat all of the Republican contenders in all of the head-to-head polls. I distinctly remember commenting several times here on Reddit that if the DNC wanted to win the general election, they'd better get behind Bernie. They didn't and they didn't.

       The polls in question were conducted by the mainstream polling companies (Harris, Rasmussen, AP, etc.) and reported on the Internet. If they are no more than "fake news," then maybe they should be shut down so that they don't muddy the waters during election season?

       Hillary, for reasons that became obvious after analysis, usually polled better against Bernie, but when polling Hillary vs. any given Republican and Bernie vs. any given Republican, Hillary had mixed results and Bernie always won. That remained the case throughout his primary bid.

       Bernie lost because a majority of American democrats can see right through his bullshit rhetoric and recognize that, while he talks about problems that everyone agrees are problems, he has ZERO realistic policy proposals to address those problems. If you’ve EVER seen or heard an interview where he gets pressed on the nuances and complexities of the issues he stumps about he folds like a cheap suit because he’s nothing more than a cranky old fart who waves his finger and likes to get people riled up.
      </p>

       I don’t know why you people continue to ignore the fact that bernie got his ass kicked in the primary but he did.

       If something did get hacked into, I highly doubt it was in effort to help Trump win.  Is this the same server that Hillary was sending classified information to people without that clearance to?  Probably just a case of them being stupid and then bam they get hacked into.

       Ehh I don't buy the "Trump colluded with Russia" narrative either.  I think you're right that these people lied about the entire thing.  Then they hired the ex-head of the FBI to be the special prosecutor?  Hmm.  And I'm sure we'll hear about Trump being under investigation his entire first term come election time.  That's all this is about.  A way to discredit Trump because he beat Hillary and they're mad.

       If the American people really want to start getting to the bottom of all the corruption in our government, they should start by extrajudicially arresting Trump and his cohorts, Clinton and hers, Muller and his, and every head of each major federal department (retired and active), and then allow each state to elect a few interrogators—via publicly-funded elections—to take turns interrogating these people on live stream for the general public to watch. Before the interrogations begin, give them all the opportunity to come clean in exchange for a reasonable degree of amnesty, and let them know that if we find out they lied during their interrogations, they’ll be imprisoned for life and their all their assets will be seized, divided up, and given back to the people. Once one crook starts spilling the beans, the rest will start falling like dominos, and the corrupt won’t have a leg to stand on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I’d like to personally recommend that we allow Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, Ralph Nader, and Rand Paul to temporarily take over the responsibilities of the presidency while we purge corruption from our government.

       Taking control is also literally how the American revolution started, and that worked out pretty well, wouldn’t you say? Bluntly speaking, your argument is invalid, no offense, cool guy.

      <p>
       At any rate, believe it or not, fascism is
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       here, and it’s been here for decades masquerading as a free and fair democracy. COINTELPRO was just one of the many symptoms our media swept under the rug to keep us passive and obedient. The 2016 election was another symptom, and—once again—the media is sweeping it under the rug by making Trump the poster child of fascism, and by talking about American as if it’s still preventable.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a country, we’re way,
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       past being able to
       <em>
        prevent
       </em>
       fascism. At this point, all we can do is
       <em>
        fight
       </em>
       it, which is something nobody seems to realize, let alone wants to do, because they’re all intently listening to this regime’s propaganda when they should be stuffing a sock in its mouth and saying “it’s our turn to talk”.

       Agreed.  We've been functionally fascist for the last several decades at least.  Mussolini would be proud (or as proud as he could be considering his idea took proper root somewhere outside of his beloved Italy).

       That's because most Americans are also fascist, having been raised in a fascist country and educated in fascist schools.  They are immersed in fascism and know nothing else, nor do they desire anything else.

       By the way, are you familiar with Edward Bernays?  His work is how fascism was implemented in this country and his models form the basis of engineering our society.

       Yes, but I don’t have them readily available for you. I’d highly recommend picking up a few different books about COINTELPRO, and counterintelligence tactics in general. If you ask me, a working knowledge of counterintelligence tactics is the ‘bread and butter’ of any respectable conspiracy theorist.

       THANK YOU. It’s truly astounding just how few people are willing to put in the effort needed to confirm the validity of that statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are definitely clueless, naïve, and far too trusting of people in positions of authority, but most of them aren’t stupid. The trouble is that most of them are  deeply confused and
       <em>
        afraid
       </em>
       , and their fears make them difficult to enlighten. I’d implore you not to lose your faith in humanity. The subversives in power
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       people like you and me to give up that hope. They
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       us to believe our peers are too dumb to be reasoned with. They gaslight us, they target us with lies and propaganda, and they try to turn our peers against us, because they
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that every time one of us stops believing that people can be persuaded to see the light, they have one less foe to worry about. It’s
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       to persuade someone to our way of thinking when they feel like we’re being condescending or arrogant.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the wake of this latest scandal, it’s definitely become way,
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       more difficult to talk sense into people and to treat them with the patient respect they need in order to be persuaded, but that just means people like you and I have to become better at what we do. If you’re intelligent, resourceful, and persistent enough to figure out our government’s “signature move” as you have, you’re definitely more than capable of outsmarting and outmaneuvering them in order to recruit some new talent to our side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep fighting the good fight, man. If you ever feel overwhelmed with despair, or if you just want to exchange thoughts and ideas with an ally, don’t hesitate to reach out!

      <p>
       I doubt that, but I'll bite. The FBI, like most human endeavors, especially those comprising thousands of people over many decades, is a complicated beast with a checkered history. You are obviously right to be skeptical of them. But any serious attempt to understand the world is going to require a hell of a lot more nuance than "FBI lied so they're lying now too."
      </p>
      <p>
       That last bit may sound like something of a straw man, but if you take a close look at your post, you literally don't make any case that Trump-Russian collusion is an FBI fabrication other than "FBI did COINTELPRO."

       The thing is you don't even need to trust the FBI at this point. We know about the Trump Tower meeting. We know about Manafort's emails offering private campaign briefings to Russia in order to get whole on his debts. That's the ball game right there.

       Disgusting as the metaphor may be, the metaphor is indeed perfectly accurate, no matter how badly you might not want to admit it, and it’s hardly a “cheap rhetorical trick”.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I’m super duper glad you brought up “cheap rhetorical tricks”, because the 2nd/3rd paragraphs you wrote are textbook examples of such a trick. They’re hollow and devoid of significance, yet somehow vaguely-compelling. They’re intellectually dishonest, yet give the appearance of being forthright (“that last bit may sound like something of a straw man”... excellent rhetorical ploy, very meta), and of course they deliberately mischaracterized and oversimplified the content of my original post. It’s funny how you shamelessly accused me employing “cheap rhetorical tricks” and then immediately proceeded to counter my argument with a
       <em>
        slew
       </em>
       of cheap rhetorical tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       “This is a shameful and pathetic attitude”? Really dude? What, are you trying to steer this conversation off the rails by provoking me on a personal level? Funny, that’s
       <em>
        yet another
       </em>
       “cheap rhetorical trick” from you on your end. Moreover, the fact that you would resort to such an underhanded trick tells me that—from an argumentative standpoint—you don’t have a leg to stand on, and that
       <em>
        you know it
       </em>
       , subconsciously or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point in our conversation, I can’t help but wonder if you could be a paid shill or a federally-employed subversive of some kind. Granted, in all likelihood, you’re probably just some privileged college grad with a penchant for rhetoric who—like me—has an acute understanding of how America’s corrupt-to-the-core regime manipulates and exploits the ignorant, and the naïve, but who—
       <em>
        unlike
       </em>
       me—is willing to play along with their charades, because you would
       <em>
        gladly
       </em>
       exploit the vulnerable for personal gain. All that being said, I can only speculate as to what kind of person you are. Lucky you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that brings me to your conclusion, the climax of your failure to conclusively discredit me and the idea that I’m defending. To put it bluntly, the point you tried to make in that paragraph is disastrously naïve, at best, and intellectually dishonest, at worst. Either way, you are absolutely wrong, largely because your assertion that “[we] don’t even need to trust the FBI at this point” and the “reasons” you gave afterwards all rest entirely on the assumption that America’s
       <em>
        exclusively
       </em>
       for-profit mainstream news media can be relied on to convey the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
       <em>
        without fail
       </em>
       . You’re smart enough to know that—in the age of popular sensationalism—things don’t even remotely work out that way. I could go into more much,
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more detail about why you’re wrong here, but I don’t want to waste anymore of my time or yours.
      </p>

       No it does not. Trump Jr. himself released the emails regarding the Trump Tower meeting. Also, just for the record, American news media is not "exclusively for-profit." NPR, for example, has done some good reporting on the issue.

       Haha! Alright, Mr. “big boy pants”, go ahead and tell yourself that’s what’s happening here. Truth is, you’re not half as clever as you think you are. You wanted to have your intellect and your narrow-scoped beliefs validated, so you got into an argument with someone you didn’t expect would see through your cheap ploys and your naïvely-shallow worldview, and you’re clearly frustrated that you were outfoxed, outmaneuvered, and shot down by someone more clever than you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming you are indeed a normal human being and not some paid shill or troll, here’s my advice to you:
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of sticking to your guns, stubbornly clinging to the effortless comfort of willful ignorance, and doubling down on the intellectually dishonest, manipulative, evasive, and fallacious pseudo-argumentative tactics you’ve clearly come to rely on in these situations, how about you try doubting yourself and that immensely popular, pre-packaged, narrow-scoped “worldview” you chose to adopt at the behest of venal journalists, attractive propagandists, and duplicitous personal heroes, instead of indulging yourself with delusions of certainty and infallibility? How about you try suspending your beliefs and pushing all your rosy preconceptions about the world out of your mind so that you can begin learning to see the big picture with
       <em>
        your own eyes
       </em>
       without depending on corrupt and untrustworthy institutions to do the investigative legwork for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       You—and every single one of our American peers—are currently trapped in an abusive relationship with your government and your media, but you can’t see it because you adamantly refuse to distance yourself from them. Right now, I’m the ‘best friend’ who’s vehemently begging you to abandon that relationship, because I know you deserve better.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can take my advice, or you can do the predictable thing by blindly dismissing me as a lunatic who doesn’t know
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what he’s talking about, all the while thanking your lucky stars that you’re not a conspiracy kook like me.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, COINTELPRO is—in my experience—the most accessible and least daunting jumping off point for people like you who can sense that something is amiss with the way things are, but who have yet to discover exactly what’s going on. The entire purpose of this post was to show people like you where to dig, and to give you an idea of what to dig for, but the digging is something you have to do for yourself (unless of course you want to pay me a salary, which of course would defeat the whole purpose).
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck, cool guy. Stay humble.

       You have just
       <em>
        definitively
       </em>
       advocated that my voice be silenced, because you don’t like what I have to say. Granted, you did so quite subtly so nobody would notice, but you did it!!! Do you understand what that means??? Do you understand what you are??? You have just
       <em>
        definitively
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        publicly
       </em>
       expressed support for
       <em>
        fascism
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Good god, I
       <em>
        live
       </em>
       for these moments. I absolutely
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       goading closet fascists into showing their true colors. How does it feel? How does it feel knowing that you’ve just taken your first steps toward becoming a full-fledged neo-Nazi? Oh god, I wish I could see the look on your face as you read this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh buddy, oh boy, you are oblivious to the slippery slope you’re smugly standing on right now. You’re already advocating that I be silenced. Next you’re gonna be advocating that I be stripped of my wealth, and my freedom, and I’d bet my testes that you’ve
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       fantasized about killing me.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have officially been recognized for what you are: a closet-fascist masquerading as a champion of democracy.

      <p>
       Game over. I win.

       Bullshit. You haven't addressed the Trump Tower meeting or Manafort's emails except to say that believing they indicate collusion requires a belief that mainstream media never gets anything wrong, which is clearly not the case for reasons I've already explained.

       To be fair, the black movements were influenced by Soviets. Just as the BLM movement is influenced by Soros. Like now, racism was not as bad as it was made out to be, and outrage had to be manufactured. Measures were needed to countreract those forces. The only difference is that nobody is doing anything about the Soros influence.

        Now, in the wake of Donald Trump’s entirely-avoidable presidency, leftists across the board have become vehemently supportive of the FBI, despite the Bureau’s verifiable history of effectively getting away with COINTELPRO. In my mind, Democrats supporting/trusting the FBI after COINTELPRO is akin to rape victims supporting/trusting Bill Cosby after he was convicted for multiple rapes (an ugly metaphor, I know, but it gets the point across).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well you have to understand that liberals tend not to see the world in black and white. The FBI is an institution that has a history with some issues, as do most institutions and even the country itself. There's also the FBI currently investigating the Russian attack on our democracy, holding this compromised white house accountable and even do things like bust up pedophilia rings. The FBI isn't some monolith, it's made up of lots of people.

        At this point, it’s worth mentioning that I was born and raised in The USA, and that I’ve been a registered Democrat since I was 18. I voted for Sanders in the 2016 primaries, but didn’t vote in the election because I was butt-hurt about his loss to Clinton, and about Hillary supporters’ outspokenly smug victory.

       I don't see why you're mentioning this unless you're attempting to give yourself some legitimacy with your claims. It's not really effective, I suppose. But it's odd to not vote because you're salty. You should always vote as made evident with the current predicament we're all in.

        (Truth be told, I firmly believe that Hillary’s victory over Bernie was just as illegitimate as her supporters believe Trump’s presidential victory was). All this being said, my voting decisions and my vaguely butt-hurt attitude should be completely irrelevant to the discussion I’m hoping to have here.

        Anyways, my point is that I’ve brought up these COINTELPRO-centric concerns to establishment-loyal Democrats many, many times since the Trump/Russia/collusion/propaganda scandal hit the mainstream, and every single time I’ve been baselessly accused of being a “Russian troll/shill/puppet”, a “Trump supporter”, a “traitor” and crap like that, and none of these people have offered me a valid counter-argument in response to my concerns about their trust in the FBI.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because it's a ridiculous argument. The current FBI is under fire from the WH and the entire right wing propaganda complex because they are investigating corruption and collusion with the Russian government. And one of Russia's main goals is to depress voter turnout on the left and sow discord, mainly by pretending to be disaffected liberals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP hates the FBI now when they were in love with them during 2016 because it was their vehicle to come after HRC. Funny how that's changed and suddenly the FBI is the
       <em>
        enemy

       . What are your thoughts on that?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It’s like they’re overcome with emotion to the point that they become irrational when I openly criticize the FBI. I know for an absolute fact that I’m not the only academic dissident leftist who has been effectively alienated by establishment-loyal Democrats in the past couple years. In all honesty, I have almost no interest in voting in the next election because of how I’ve been treated by my peers since 2016.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you think the liberals you're speaking aren't angry about your criticism but moreso you falling into the trap of using vague stories about the FBI to cast doubt on it right when the organization is under attack from the very people being investigated? Or that you're using this as a pre-text to discourage voting in a pivotal election?
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely you can see how odd that sounds?

       It's really depressing that half the country will engage in conspiratorial, paranoid thinking when it's anti-Russia and against Trump-- and that kind of conspiracy is mainstream-- but if you believe any unsanctioned conspiracies then you're a wacko.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a bad president and harmful for this country but that doesn't automatically mean the people going after him are our heroes. The intelligence community is highly corrupt and has been consolidating power behind the scenes for decades. They represent a very dangerous existential threat to liberty and democracy in America and are not the Good Guys. It isn't that simple.

       (a) The whole "Bernie was cheated by the DNC" thing is claim used by Trump supporters as whataboutism to distract from the investigation into his administration and as a means to justify Russian hacking because the hacks supposedly exposed this cheating.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) People don't suddenly love the FBI or exonerate the agency for their awful history. Your claims about divisions on the left sound like concern trolling and/or wishful thinking.

       For instance, for your comment alone I should point out that Noam Chomsky is in fact a government asset and gatekeeper to corral freethinkers into his worldview. Listen to what he won't talk about and whom he won't criticize. Then you know who his real bosses are.

       Well, you're barking up the wrong tree talking to democrats about anything anti deep state. The three "greatest" democratic presidents of all time were all horrible. FDR, JFK, and Obama. Think about the the worst parts of modern American history, and all three are at the forefront. JFK alone set I'm motion things that changed the face of what the deep state is that affect us to this day.

       You have just
       <em>
        definitively
       </em>
       advocated that my voice be silenced, because you don’t like what I have to say. Granted, you did so quite subtly so nobody would notice, but you did it!!! Do you understand what that means??? Do you understand what you are??? You have just
       <em>
        definitively
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        publicly
       </em>
       expressed support for

        fascism

       Good god, I

       for these moments. I absolutely
       <em>

       </em>
       goading closet fascists into showing their true colors. How does it feel? How does it feel knowing that you’ve just taken your first steps toward becoming a full-fledged neo-Nazi? Oh god, I wish I could see the look on your face as you read this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh buddy, oh boy, you are oblivious to the slippery slope you’re smugly standing on right now. You’re already advocating that I be silenced. Next you’re gonna be advocating that I be stripped of my wealth, and my freedom, and I’d bet my testes that you’ve
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       fantasized about killing me.

       You have officially been recognized for what you are: a closet-fascist masquerading as a champion of democracy.
