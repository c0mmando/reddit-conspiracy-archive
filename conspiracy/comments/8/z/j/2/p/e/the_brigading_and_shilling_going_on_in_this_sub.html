<p>Are you kidding? Sort by new. There&#39;s been tons of pro-Trump posts today. It seems to me like an effort to distract from what seems to be a bad day for the US President. There&#39;s way more complaining about &quot;shills&quot; and brigading than anyone supporting the CIA.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that is true, I know it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The people pushing these claims that Trump is a nazi for reasons, Russia is our direct enemy and they meddled in our election, the MSM is to be trusted, but not Fox! they are racists, you are a racist and a bigot if you didn&#39;t vote for Hillary, despite her being an awful human being etc etc</p>

<p>These are all being posted by fake <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users, it is easy to tell this because they are against all conspiracies that go against the official narrative and all of the fail the three basic litmus tests that the JFK assassination had to have been a conspiracy and state cover up, the Apollo program was a work of science fiction and 9/11 official narrative simply can not be true.</p>

You probably don&#39;t see the cognitive dissonance-- and actually knowing what the fuck you are talking about is above your pay grade.</p>

<p>Some of the posts in here would be akin to going into the Bad Cop No Donut subreddit and telling redditors that deadly force was warranted in the cases of Daniel Shaver, Tamir Rice, and Philando Castille.  And have your post upvoted while those that disagree are downvoted into oblivion.  </p>

He would tell us things about the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover. This was before the Leonardo DiCaprio movie. He was a pretty cool teacher. He gave me an interest in finding out the truth. My mother was also a history teacher and I opened up her mind on a lot of things I’ve learned over the years.

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; Why doesn’t Clinton have her own sub full of supporter that make memes and jokes </p>

<p>Because nobody worships Hilary as much as Trump supporters worship Trump. In fact, you guys talk more about the Clinton&#39;s and Obama than their supporters do. You know why you&#39;re so blind to Trump yet scream and yell about liberals? Because you&#39;re delusional due to psychologically tricking yourself into not facing who and what you really are. It&#39;s too painful for you. So you split everything into black and white, good and bad. Everything you think you are and claim to be (but in reality you are not)  = good = America = Trump. Everything you think you are not and claim to hate (but in reality you are) = bad = Anti-American = Obama/Clinton&#39;s. You can&#39;t stand how you truly feel about yourself so you project all of your own behavior and negative self feelings onto other people and outside groups you deem your enemy. Every reality based fact that proves to you that Trump is a LIAR and a TRAITOR to America, must be met with extreme psychological defense mechanisms in order that your brain does not have to face reality.</p>

<p>1) <strong>Ad Hominem</strong>: From the Latin meaning “towards the man,” an attempt to shift the conversation by getting personal.  </p>

<p>If you bring up a topic that threatens a narcissist’s ego, he may resort to name-calling, questioning your intelligence or attacking your character. This technique is designed to distract from the topic at hand and make you feel you have to defend yourself.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) <strong>Glittering Generalities</strong>: Using glowing words and statements to describe ones self, ideas, or behaviors without providing evidence.  </p>

<p>Narcissists are in love with their words just as they are in love with everything about themselves. They think superlatives make them look good.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/eugene-p23v">eugene-p23v</a>:  I think it’s because TD is organic in a way that $0.05 per post can’t replicate. Even if TD posters were getting $5.00 per post, you still wouldn’t get that level of originality in your “propaganda.” TD is love, in the way that young girls will make Taylor Swift fan accounts on twatter or insta. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>6) <strong>Minimizing</strong>: The opposite of exaggeration, minimizing denies or downplays anything that doesn’t fit with a propagandist’s goals.  </p>

<p>Narcissists are desperately image conscious so they frequently minimize the negative consequences of their actions. They also discount others’ feelings and needs, which narcissists tend to see as nuisances.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>7) <strong>False Equivalence:</strong> Attempting to equate vastly different situations to one’s advantage.  </p>

<p>Narcissists use false equivalencies to justify their unreasonable views and grandiose needs as well as to avoid responsibility for their destructive behaviors.  </p>

<p>11) <strong>Scapegoating</strong>: Falsely blaming one individual for a group’s problems.  </p>

<p>Scapegoating is one of narcissists’ favorite tactics because it can accomplish many things at once: making others feel inferior; getting other people to go along with the narcissist in ostracizing someone; gaining a feeling of power at orchestrating a group action; hiding or distracting from anything that would make the narcissist look bad; and evading the narcissist’s responsibility for creating part of the problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reaction formation</strong> is the superficial adoption—and, often, exaggeration—of emotions and impulses that are diametrically opposed to one’s own. A possible high-profile case of reaction formation is that of a particular US congressman, who, as chairman of the Missing and Exploited Children’s Caucus, introduced legislation to protect children from exploitation by adults over the Internet. The congressman resigned when it later emerged that he had been exchanging sexually explicit electronic messages with a teenage boy. Other, classic, examples of reaction formation include the alcoholic who extolls the virtues of abstinence and the rich student who attends and even organizes anti-capitalist rallies.  </p>

<p><strong>Projection</strong> is the attribution of one’s unacceptable thoughts and feelings to others. Like distortion, projection necessarily involves repression as a first step, since unacceptable thoughts and feelings need to be repudiated before they can be attributed to others. Classic examples of projection include the envious person who believes that everyone envies him, the covetous person who lives in constant fear of being dispossessed, and the person with fantasies of infidelity who suspects that his partner is cheating on him.  </p>

<p>Just as common is <strong>splitting</strong>, which can be defined as the division or polarization of beliefs, actions, objects, or people into good and bad by selectively focusing on either their positive or negative attributes. This is often seen in politics, for instance, when left-wingers caricature right-wingers as selfish and narrow-minded, and right-wingers caricature left-wingers as irresponsible and self-serving hypocrites. Other classic examples of splitting are the religious zealot who divides people into blessed and damned, and the child of divorcees who idolizes one parent while shunning the other. Splitting diffuses the anxiety that arises from our inability to grasp a complex and nuanced state of affairs by simplifying and schematizing it so that it can more readily be processed or accepted.  </p>

<p><strong>Splitting</strong> also arises in groups, with people inside the group being seen in a positive light, and people outside the group in a negative light. Another phenomenon that occurs in groups is <strong>groupthink</strong>, which is not strictly speaking an ego defense, but which is so important as to be worthy of mention. <strong>Groupthink</strong> arises when members of a group unconsciously seek to minimize conflict by failing to critically test, analyse, and evaluate ideas. As a result, decisions reached by the group tend to be more irrational than those that would have been reached by any one member of the group acting alone. Even married couples can fall into groupthink, for instance, when they decide to take their holidays in places that neither wanted, but thought that the other wanted. Groupthink arises because members of a group are afraid both of criticizing and of being criticized, and also because of the hubristic sense of confidence and invulnerability that arises from being in a group. Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once remarked, ‘It is a good thing that I did not let myself be influenced.’ In a similar vein, historian Edward Gibbon wrote that ‘…solitude is the school of genius … and the uniformity of a work denotes the hand of a single artist’. In short, a camel is a horse designed by a committee.  </p>

<p>An ego defense similar to splitting is <strong>idealization</strong>. Like the positive end of splitting, idealization involves overestimating the positive attributes of a person, object, or idea while underestimating its negative attributes. More fundamentally, it involves the projection of our needs and desires onto that person, object, or idea. A paradigm of idealization is infatuation, when love is confused with the need to love, and the idealized person’s negative attributes are glossed over or even imagined as positive. Although this can make for a rude awakening, there are few better ways of relieving our existential anxiety than by manufacturing something that is ‘perfect’ for us, be it a piece of equipment, a place, country, person, or god.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. When someone presents a claim to me, I like to see proof of that claim. Otherwise me stating &quot;The DNC server hack provides proof of Elvis being alive&quot; is no less valid than &quot;The DNC server hack provides proof of the state department being sold&quot;. If you provide nothing to back up the claim, that&#39;s not a conspiracy theory. That&#39;s just stating irrational ideas.

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck are you talking about dipshit.  My post concerns how a fucking posters in a fucking CONSPIRACY subreddit are telling other redditors to trust the NSA/FBI/CIA.  You probably don&#39;t see the cognitive dissonance-- and actually knowing what the fuck you are talking about is above your pay grade.</p>

<p>Some of the posts in here would be akin to going into the Bad Cop No Donut subreddit and telling redditors that deadly force was warranted in the cases of Daniel Shaver, Tamir Rice, and Philando Castille.  And have your post upvoted while those that disagree are downvoted into oblivion.  </p>

<p>All I am saying, is don&#39;t make it so obvious.  And I hope for your sake that the paycheck is worth it.  </p>
