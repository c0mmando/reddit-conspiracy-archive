<p>You know why &quot;there is no such thing as socialism &quot;with capitalist elements&quot; or &quot;not full socialism&quot;.&quot; is true?

<p>This is a nice right up on what single payer is all about. We stop feeding the profit-hungry healthcare machine that takes up the majority of our tax dollars through Medicare, and replace it with simpler tax-payer funded medical care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still worth talking about the top 0.1%, too.</p>

<p>From a <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/bernie-s/dnc-bernie-sanders-repeats-claim-top-one-tenth-1-o/">recent study</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The top 0.1 percent was composed of 160,000 families with average wealth of $72.8 million. All told, they owned 22 percent of the nation’s wealth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the bottom 90 percent included 144 million families with average wealth of $84,000, and they owned an equal 22.8 percent of America’s wealth.</p>

<p>&quot;Wealth is getting more concentrated in the United States,&quot; the researchers observed, &quot;but this phenomenon largely owes to the spectacular dynamics of fortunes of dozens and hundreds of million dollars, and much less to the growth in fortunes of a few million dollars. Inequality within rich families is increasing.&quot;</p>

If &quot;the rich guys&quot; decide to peace out of the country, they lose their assets, which can be put to much more productive use. </p>

<p>Practically speaking, tax flight on any scale that would actually impact a country is A) pretty much a myth even now, when we aren&#39;t flat out seizing mansions or yachts, and B) isn&#39;t at all a concern given that what actually matters for producing something are talents and skills, which the extremely wealthy don&#39;t have themselves- they merely pay others to have them.</p>

<p>Again, money is completely irrelevant if you have capital and labor dancing to your tune. Liquidity is a convenient fiction that modern economies agree on for a variety of pragmatic reasons, but it&#39;s not power. Capital, and the ability to accumulate more capital, is.</p>

<p>Nah, capital depends pretty clearly on how much labor is required to make the capital. </p>

<p>Good luck getting people to work for you if you don&#39;t pay them.</p>

<p>I think guaranteed food, housing, clothing, entertainment, etc. are preferable to pieces of paper, but that&#39;s just me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>100%. What&#39;s anybody actually going to do about a hegemon that still has thousands of nuclear weapons, though? And again, what does a piece of paper matter when you&#39;re getting more than what you got when you had the pieces of paper?</p>

<p>Even without jumping quite that far off the deep end into complete collective control of capital, MMT makes cogent arguments for why it&#39;s pretty easy to invent jobs out of thin air (did it post-Great Depression, and we can do it again when we care to); we also have more empty houses than we have homeless and under 2% of our population is employed in feeding the entire country (and then some).</p>

<p>Why would disparate points be a proposed solution to anything? All of the above was just an illustration of the many ways in which money isn&#39;t actually equivalent to power at all. Absurdities abound when you try to peg what&#39;s actually valuable (labor and capital) to pieces of paper or potential voltages on some server in New York City.</p>

<p>I&#39;m alright with threatening people who engineer inequality by force in the last instance, but I&#39;m pretty sure the unconscionably wealthy don&#39;t actually have the balls to play that game and would roll over in the face of a couple thousand people outside their doorsteps, general strikes, etc.</p>

<p>Money literally defines value. On its own, it doesn&#39;t mean much. but it&#39;s just as valuable as labour or capital because we all collectively agree, that it has the value we attribute to it. You can get anything you want with money (including capital and labor) so how doesn&#39;t it have any value in your eyes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1, Italy is doing some interesting things to encourage worker co-ops; workers own and democratically operate their workplace.  Managers and CFOs are hired by, and work at the pleasure of, the workers. Slowly change the population&#39;s perspective on which direction power should flow. 
2, take monopolies that the people rely on (internet, Amazon...) and make them public utilities: either owned by, or at least regulated by the people, democratically. 
3, establish a national bank to provide small business loans as start up capital to co-ops without the profit motive or reckless gambling done by private banks. 
4, allow for drastically more participation in governance by the citizenry.  This would likely lead to a shift in national spending priorities from destructive things (bombs) to constructive things (infrastructure, education, health care).</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually Individualism vs Collectivism. There&#39;s a reason that bad people use Collectivism as a tool. It&#39;s much easier to control a herd than it is to control a whole slew of individuals, often with guns.</p>

<p>My primary metric when deciding someone is a good guy or a bad guy: Are they mostly advocating freedom for individuals, or freedom for groups? If it&#39;s groups, then chances are, they have a secret agenda (even unknowing) to control people.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say I believe in Anarchy or even Libertarianism. Extremes of anything are bad. We still need public roads and public parks are great. But those are still about empowering individuals and the entire society, not specific groups.</p>

<p>Collectivism is the great evil that seeks to enslave everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it&#39;s a balance. The reason the United States has been so successful is because we created a government that codified specific limits to the power granted to it. The founding fathers knew the danger of giving someone too much power, yet, as you say, you need some amount of organization to run the society.</p>

<p>What societies have been the biggest disasters in history? The ones with the strongest, collectivist governments: Soviet Union, Nazism, Italian Fascism, etc, etc, with the latest example being Venezuela. The Nazis nationalized hundreds of industries, including colleges and health care. European Democratic Socialism has only worked to the extent it has because they&#39;ve kept a underpinning of Capitalism (along with the United States subsidizing their economies because they never needed a military). But even now, look at all the rot we&#39;re starting to see in the EU: Imprisoning people for speech. No rights to self-defense. Tyranny is alive and well, and is trying to get a foothold in the U.S.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying now that &quot;it&#39;s a balance&quot; -- but you also called Collectivism &quot;the great evil that seeks to enslave everyone&quot;, which is absurdly hyperbolic. By that logic, Individualism is the &quot;great evil that seeks to divide us all.&quot;</p>

<p>Ultimately I don&#39;t disagree with a lot of what you&#39;re saying, as I agree that heavy, top down control of societies frequent ends poorly when the &quot;wrong&quot; people get the reins of government. But I don&#39;t see the point in demonizing collectivism explicitly when individualism can be just as destructive.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where I disagree. It&#39;s always better to err on the side of individualism than collectivism. Too much individualism just means you need more private individuals taking up the slack via private organizations. Too much collectivism -- you&#39;re screwed. What can you do?</p>

<p>Collectivism is a necessary evil trading freedom for various benefits. It&#39;s necessary. But freedom is an extremely valuable coin that should only be spent when absolutely necessary.</p>

I&#39;ll be considerate in my request, 1% of 600k is 6k, 1/2 of that is 3k. Show me a post on this subreddit with 3k total upvotes/downvotes that backs up your claim.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much everything Trump does is the polar opposite of what the previous administration has done. His views of immigration, free trade, NAFTA, the EU. He is universally hated by the media, other governments, etc etc. Trump very much believes in the idea of national sovereignty, which most establishment politicians do not. They want a more integrated global system without borders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the elite are complete for free trade without any kind of barriers or tariffs. And that normally means production goes to countries with the absolute lowest wages, and or non existent safety regulations or environmental protection. The EU is an obvious power grab. The goal is to eliminate borders completely and make all countries just states in one giant country, one currency, one EU army, one political system. Obama was the golden boy, he was given a free rein to do almost anything he wanted. Trump gets apposed just walking out his front door.</p>

Your whole ideology relies on this bullshit. You realise the EU doesnt decide shit? Tariffs and immigration qoutas are decided by Parliament not the EU illuminati. Both Obama amd Trump were set up to complete objectives. Trump is just of the republican flavour. His hate from the media is staged, the mainstream Media have a growing liberal audience because mainstream conservatism and patriotism is a dying trend and so they are saying what people want to hear. When you hear CNN making fun of Trumps hands, it makes everyone come to the same conclusion. They out to get Trump. But in reality if they wanted to get rid of him they&#39;d be talking about his business deals with shady countries or his overzealous support and rotating door for the Israeli lobby. Instead they talk about his hands and how he made a remark towards a pornstar. Straw men criticisms which give the illusion of opposition but really just push people to his side.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the crazy theory I&#39;ve ever heard. Almost delusional. Trump was given a 1% chance of winning by the media, and universally mocked. In fact newsweek was so sure Hillary would win they printed a madam president edition. The media (CNN) even went as far as to help Hillary cheat in the debates by feeding her the questions before hand.</p>

<p>Come on. Why do you think Trump has vastly increased the already bloated military budget. Why do you think he wants to create more military branches? Why do you think he wants military parades? Why do you think he schmoozes with militant authoritarians like Kim Jong Un and Putin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is either disinfo or just disingenuous.  It depends how far down you think this goes.  Clearly, Trump is being attacked by establishment entities (intelligence community, MSM, captains of certain industry, foreign establishment, etc), so at that point you either have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) ignore the fact that the people who are usually pushing propaganda are pushing propaganda against him.</li>
<li>b) assume this is a song and dance and an expected part of a bigger plan to accomplish...something (fill in the blank).</li>
</ul>

<p>or </p>

<ul>
<li>c) he actually is a threat to TPTB and this is an attempt at a coup. </li>
</ul>

<p>We know the lengths they&#39;ll go to remove a threat (JFK anyone?) and trying what they&#39;ve done in the past in just having him assassinated would cause civil war, so they do what they have been doing since the 80s which is undermine and subvert.  This, to me, feels just like the type of propagandistic fervor you&#39;d see before a major war they&#39;re going to start.  You honestly don&#39;t belong in this sub if you think this is just a grassroots uprising.  </p>

<p>Which, at that point I&#39;m left to decide whether it&#39;s scenario B or C, and I&#39;m honestly not sure.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfT5NTHU9HQ">Everything is a rich man&#39;s trick</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is endorsed by the president of the united states as one of the few accurate news sources. The president has said, on multiple occasions, that Alex Jones is one of the few news programs he constantly watches.</p>

<p>Alex Jones also, in turn, has changed quite a bit of his content from anti-establishment (he was against both Bush and Obama) to practically sucking the cock of the president and coming up with every excuse not to blame the president for government actions that not even 19 months ago, he said were Obama&#39;s fault.</p>

<p>He makes the cash based on controversy, but he interestingly has always been able to incite the anti-establishment crowd regardless of the politics of that crowd. He&#39;s now fully establishment, but has tried to also keep on his crowd by differentiating &#39;the establishment&#39; and &#39;the deep state.&#39; As if there has ever been any difference.</p>

<p>All Presidents since 1880 are puppets, but Trump is a puppet to a different master (hint: not the American people)</p>

<p>It should be establishment versus anti-establishment, however the right has spent the last 10 years courting the anti-establishment crowd and brain washing a large portion of them (every thing from tea-party movement that was confirmed to have been started by Republican billionaires to discredit Bush-era regulations, to the modern &#39;alt-right&#39;)</p>

<p>However, instead of seeing that they were duped and now the people that used them to strengthen establishment power are in complete control of the government -- they&#39;re doubling down, saying there&#39;s a massive conspiracy, but instead the current anti-establishment crowd is the one secretly controlling everything from the shadows preventing the establishment from being the good guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. How? This sub isn’t a political sub. This sub is about conspiracies. That’s why the post was relevant. If you were in the Donald, the post might be asking why left wing liberals are controlling the sub but it doesn’t. If you were in march against trump it would ask why right wing conservatives control the sub but it doesn’t. This is relevant to this sub because like I said, it’s not a political sub. Seeing posts that glorify the left or right while demonizing the other is not what this sub is for. It’s the equivalent of subscribing to the Star Trek sub but seeing post about Star Wars all day. This sub will light knew about operation mockingbird. So why do I see sources that lead to the mainstream media? You can learn about John Kerry and George Bush both being part of the skull and bones society. So why do I hear debates about the left and the right they are obviously on the same team? You get it now? Or 9/11 was an inside job and how is this possible without the cooperation of both the left and right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve noticed similar posts in this sub a lot lately but at the same time, I absolutely agree. I can’t talk shit on trump without being called a libtard and I can’t talk shit on Hillary without being called a Trumpet or Russia troll. It’s gotten pretty ridiculous. In no way do I support either side of the government but I’m constantly being put in one of these groups. This should be a sub where we openly discuss how elite powerful sociopaths conspire against us. After all, it’s us vs them. Not, left us vs right us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. That’s what cointelpro are making it seem like. Real conspiracy have nothing to do with politics. Using money to influence an election is not a conspiracy, it’s common practice in a capitalist democracy. it doesn’t matter where that money comes from. Real conspiracies are things like the JFK assassination, 911, the Moonlanding, Sandyhook and so on. All those conspiracy need you to be focused on politics instead of seeing what’s really going on. All those conspiracies need complicity from all sides of the government. Focusing on a person like Trump is what their illusion of democracy is supposed to accomplish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but who ever characterized a group simply with a representation of it&#39;s outliers? I mean there are ginger muslims in the UK, but when you look at that pie slice it&#39;s an abismaly small portion of the total populace of muslims.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s just a representation issue. For example: when people around the world think americans, they generally think a white person, not because we&#39;re all white, but because it&#39;s just common knowledge that it&#39;s the dominant demographic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What governments have done and will do again to people they don&#39;t like or understand.</p>

<p>Obviously religion is a choice. But it&#39;s not on par with &quot;choices&quot; like, say, choosing beef over chicken.</p>

<p>Religion, philosophy, politics to some extent; all have bases rooted in your upbringing and subconscious. No person under the age of 15 has ever gone to church via a choice, at the very least not a choice they ever realistically considered. That blurs into adulthood where now most of all the decisions you ever made in life are based on some kind of personal philosophy you were more or less indoctrinated into.</p>

<p>By the time it comes to a crossroads most people literally do not have the ability to just &quot;choose&quot; a different path. It&#39;s a main reason why people that get raised and braibwashed in cults have such a hard time coming back even though the concept they&#39;ve been following is batshit. (see scientology) </p>

<p>As an exercise: Find something you and your wife disagree on. Try to change each other&#39;s minds, diligently. When yo inevitably fail, imagine if someone came along and said &quot;we are going to kill you if you don&#39;t change your mind&quot; can you or her sincerely change your mind at that point? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for starters I don&#39;t buy into the idea that there&#39;s a cabal of powerful elites that are pushing every political position. For instance you&#39;re going to have a vastly disproportionate amount of money spent by billionaires that push for things like right to work policies, and far less pushing for unionization. </p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t really matter to me if someone who I don&#39;t like is trying to push for the policies I want since I want those policies for my own reasons. It doesn&#39;t matter to me if some Russian agent tried to push BLM narrative one time because i agree with the premise of BLM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if it&#39;s from a plethora of organizations then it&#39;s no longer &quot;divide and conquer&quot;. It&#39;s just various groups trying to enact their policies. I&#39;d also note that, like, 90% of the money going to buy politicians aren&#39;t coming from progressive pockets to push progressive policies. I&#39;m pretty sure i read somewhere that the kochs alone outspent the top 10 Unions  3-1, that&#39;s just 2 dudes. Not to even mention money coming from outside like Russia funneled through the very not progressive NRA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I started reading this sub several years ago, it was all articles about 9/11, Bush, fringe weirdness, etc. When Trump came into play, the same off-the-wall shit that was going on in T_D started bleeding into this sub. It really became an offshoot. Then a bunch of people were making this same post, &quot;What happened to this sub?&quot;</p>

<p>Fast forward to Trump being elected and generally doing a horrific job, this sub was being constantly called out elsewhere as being an offshoot of T_D. Subs mocking people here, i.e. Top Minds of Reddit started popping up to highlight the pro Trump/Putin nonsense, which of course was interpreted by the pro Trump/Putiners as vote manipulation (those RU bots haven&#39;t figured out to manipulate this sub yet?). </p>

<p>Now we have threads all the time calling for the mods to censor this sub and do mass banning like the T_D fascists. I don&#39;t know about you, but that is as anti-intellectual and dishonest as it gets, and I don&#39;t spend a lot of time reading the posts here anymore.</p>

<p>Just my two cents, but I know I&#39;ve seen the same concerns raised. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Wait, i have a few first.</p>

<p>Did you intentionally imply that no money was repatriated?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, I implied that relative to the amount of money that&#39;s overseas, the amount that we actually repatriated (and the tax levied on that money) was a pitiful fraction of what was actually owed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you also consider off shore profits estimated at 2.6 trillion as meager?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not, there&#39;s a ton of money overseas, especially since that estimate also doesn&#39;t account for personal holdings in tax havens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then did you try to catch me in an ah ha moment by posing a question that we both know is not quantifiable?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How on Earth is it not quantifiable? Compare stock buybacks from the last few years to stock buybacks from this year, etc. Just because you&#39;re not competent at the craft doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not quantifiable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Talk about fucking dishonesty holy shit. Shoot yourself please</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reported, I guess?</p>

<p>Edit: one final question</p>

<p>Are you ok with collecting little to no tax revenue on off shore profits as it stood? In this specific case, isnt any tax revenue better than what we had collected before?</p>

<p>Getting tax revenue is great; we should make sure we get more of it. One-time stimulus is a horrible policy for sustaining policy, and won&#39;t do anything to curb continued withholding overseas.</p>

<p>We&#39;re arguably past that now, but as Trump&#39;s Tariff&#39;s take effect(the same tariffs that failed previously), and as the reality of our exponentially accelerating debt thanks to the GOP spending bill take effect, we&#39;re going to crash again.</p>

<p>Reversal of Dodd-Frank and the destruction of the CFSB by Trump also really, really makes for an easy recession. Be prepared for sub-prime debt to sky rocket again (it&#39;s already spooling up) and when mixed with the still unfixed Student Loan issue, we&#39;re going to see at least half the country default on their debt shortly after the next presidential election at the latest. Which will lead to another 8 years of a democrat using all of their political capital trying to just restore the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not sure I vibe with saying we are just coming out of a recession after 10 years. Im not sure what the CFSB is but am familiar with the CFPB. Of which not Trump, but US courts determined its structure questionable. Afterall Trunp made a pick for it&#39;s head a month ago.</p>

<p>So with that said, these are GOP plans, not Trump. Student loans are concerning but not unmanagable. And Dodd-Frank is still the same as it was</p>

<p>I think his point is he doesn&#39;t trust <em>any</em> agency. Y&#39;know, being a conspiracy theorist, and all. Though to actually answer your questions, I&#39;d like to point out the Russians have probably, at some point, claimed their innocence. It would seem a little weird if they hadn&#39;t.</p>

<p>You forgot how this sub hated Hillary for the last 10 years.

You forget that this sub was overrun by ShareBlue and instead say it was just all T_D. It was all just one side and you are bogus for pretending it was.</p>

<p>Is not necessary to conclude that the Russians are likely lying. Look no further than the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting (the emails were released by Don Jr. himself) and the emails between Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik. Those two pieces right there, which are publicly available, practically seal the deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Addressing any issue head on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What part of single payer healthcare or social ownership of capital, for instance, doesn&#39;t address the issue head on? Somewhat more to the point, how does one &quot;address any issue head on&quot; without popular support for said issue (support that is necessarily going to result in a belief that one is part of a group fighting for particular rights- y&#39;know, something that would be part of one&#39;s identity)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taking a step back and realizing that our bottom 10% is among the top 1% wealthy in the world, for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonsense, you&#39;ll need a citation for that; you don&#39;t seem to understand how much poverty actually exists in the US, nor what percentage of the world population 1% is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of the wealthy in this nation are first generation. They earned it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huge source required on this, and an actual metric for what we&#39;re considering &quot;wealthy.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A combination of a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Around the time of the Benghazi hearing, leading up to the election this sub was <em>filled</em> with anti Clinton posts, along with anti DNC overall posts. With wikileaks only releasing anti DNC content, that flooded this sub. A LOT of the posts were speculative garbage TBH.</p></li>
<li><p>During the election cycle, an equal and opposite reaction happened where anti republican content started popping up, mainly pointing out stuff Trump had said or done. Most of these weren&#39;t a &#39;conspiracy&#39; - they were just political posts to counter the anti clinton / dnc posts.</p></li>
<li><p>Outside of the political spectrum, many of us deep conspiracy folks realized Trump wouldn&#39;t be able to keep any secrets, so things like aliens, space travel, reptilians, 9/11 and other popular conspiracies are likely not true, because Trump would be using them for political gain by now - considering how he ramped up the JFK papers, then didn&#39;t actually release any new information. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point it&#39;s mostly far out speculation being posted by Trump supporters, flat political news by non Trump supporters, and the conspiracy folks who had been here for years with nothing to talk about since most of it would be leaked or pushed politically by this administration. </p>

<p>For the last few months the sub was swamped with sub average posts and bots that ruined the conversations that got going.

This was long the plan but it came into to pass officially this week. </p>

<p>The rothschilds now have received the payment from n Korea in gold bullion and the debts payments from Russia for the loan for the German natural gas pipelines buildout. Now that the cabal has all it needs with new leadership, the sub should continue to see downsizing like the agents of social media wanted.

Not to mention there was a traffic camera pointed at the restaurant that was moved to look somewhere else just for that day and then moved back after the shooting took place. The police formed a perimeter and were aiming outward instead of inward at the guy being arrested. And he supposedly went upstairs and fired just one shot that perfectly went through a door and hit a computer in its hard drive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democrats = Republicans is a false premise and one being advocated primarily by the people who lean towards republicans. This post IS the problem with this sub. Your comment could just as easily imply that people on the left are targeting this sub since it seems like the obvious Russian conspiracy is finally getting traction here while a much more likely scenario is the complete opposite. That this sub is being ruined by rightwing propaganda but the russian election conspiracy is so clearly real that they couldn&#39;t shut down every post. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories aren&#39;t fun or helpful without facts. The right wing bullshit being parroted here is devoid of facts. There are no facts backing up fema death camps, crisis actors in mass shooting and pizzagate but thats what this sub is really about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, prove it. Or talk like an adult. You could have tried to make a case that the small difference between republican and democratic platforms doesn&#39;t make a noticeable difference.</p>

<p>Of course I&#39;d counter with &quot;it definitely is making a difference to all the immigrants being locked up, deported and separated from their families&quot;. It definitely makes a difference the workers who won&#39;t be have access to a union in the future based on a recent supreme court decision that would not have gone that without trumps appointment.</p>

<p>Basically you&#39;re refusing to acknowledge that if two groups of people are robbing and killing people, the one more eager to kill more people is actually worse. And even if two groups engage in similar behavior, if one that advocates intolerance while the other doesn&#39;t, well that right there is a real difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had kind of the same experience as you. This used to be my favorite sub and I felt like I could actually learn things here that no one else would talk about. People requested links and sources for outlandish claims, and the discussion was fairly civil. Now I basically just check it to see what the narrative being pushed to the &quot;fringe groups&quot; are. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if the authentic users fled to another forum once it became obviously compromised, or if their voices are just lost in the partisan bickering at this point, but I&#39;m not sure how the sub comes back from here. Congrats, we (I use this term because I have been guilty of it from time to time too) drank the left vs. right kool-aid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nor do I. But there is also an anti-authoritarian right. Some of them may think of Trump as a tactical temporary sacrfice of morals to achieve a greater good (dismantling of corrupt intelligence agencies, aggressive deregulation of markets, originalist interpretations of the Constitution in the SCotUS, etc). Even though we&#39;d disagree on two of those three examples I listed, there are dozens of policies I can think of where we strongly overlap (surveillance state, military industrial complex and endless war, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-left-and-right-can-learn-to-love-localism-the-constitutional-cure-for-polarization">localism</a>, <a href="https://socialistra.org/">preservation of gun ownership rights</a>, corporate globalization, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine">neoliberalism</a>, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happens every time there’s a major power change in the political structure. Whichever side is out of favor will tend to propose conspiracy theories about the people who are in power, and their opposition will try to pick those theories apart.</p>

<p>Usually it’s pretty straightforward. Obama was a <em>relatively</em> scandal-free president, at least as far as his personal life goes. So most people focused on other things like aliens or whatever.</p>

<p>The transition to the Trump administration is a lot more complicated and there are more outgroups. Obviously there’s the Dems, but he’s also alienated his own party’s moderate wing, and also the Establishment and/or Deep State. And his personal life/history is way more of a mess than Obama’s ever was, and his assets and business dealings span a global scale with more entanglements and secrecy than any president before. There’s a lot of conspiracy fuel there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as someone not quite in the 1% who is surrounded by people in the 0.01%, there&#39;s a huge difference between being almost in &quot;the 1%&quot; and the elites that actually run things.  </p>

<p>those guys meet with top politicians, are friends with CEOs, get their kids internships at each others&#39; companies, and live in the best places with awesome schools, public pools with no crime.  </p>

<p>in high cost of living cities like NYC and San Fran, being in the 1% is like being middle class.  you have to earn that much just to pay the rent.  Folks here still work 60-80 hour weeks for people who under-appreciate and underpay them and still can&#39;t get their kids in a decent school or afford childcare.  NYC schools in particular are a shitshow.  </p>

<p>Two years ago Wikileaks published a bombshell leak of the operations of a major party in the middle of an election. Suddenly everyone who knew almost nothing about conspiracies were confronted with the reality of (possibly) illegal DNC behavior done  in secret: An actual current conspiracy. </p>

<p>And obviously the reverse seemed to be at play: a conspiracy to expose and discredit the DNC, through illegal means of hacking internal party secrets. </p>

<p>So yeah, thousands of new sub members who only know about 2 conspiracies, namely the most political ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but I have to rant.</p>

<p>I lurk on this sub, but don&#39;t comment much. I&#39;m not a shill, I&#39;m a liberal-type crypto-redneck regular dude. I&#39;ve been interested in what we call &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; throughout my intellectual life and I was once avid in my belief in many of those conjectures. I still subscribe to some, but not many, and I have noticed a few things. One of which I will henceforth describe.</p>

<p>From, therefore, an outsider: Most of the information in these various conjectures, conspiracy theories, is specifically designed to change your viewpoint to an irrational one. </p>

<p>What do I mean by &quot;irrational viewpoint?&quot; Belief without evidence. </p>

<p>Why do I believe this is true? Because these conjectures range from god/alien super-consciousness and flat-earth, (i.e. preposterous,) all the way to Hillary-killed-everyone and Trump is a Russian puppet, (i.e could be true, but not enough information, just circumstance,) on the Same Web Sites. &quot;Conspiracy Clearing House! Step right up and have your minds blown.&quot; The range of options for you to believe is very much like a marketing net which is cast very broadly, is it not? (Yes, that is circumstantial conjecture.) </p>

<p>Now, Who would want you to believe irrational things? Or, likewise, to believe things without adequate evidence, only circumstance? </p>

<p>The answer is salesmen. Whether those salesmen are selling books about the Mars face or Obama, or asking for you to donate to a political cause, you are being had. </p>

<p>That is one of the few conspiracy conjectures i retain. </p>

<p>BTW, it was Richard Hoagland who killed that golden goose in my case. NASA blew up the Mars face? Come on.</p>

<p>I mean well. That is all. </p>

People who are below average intelligence, or don&#39;t have a lot of power in their lives are particularly susceptible to this perfectly natural human need.</p>

<p>The counter-argument is: it is true that powerful people, groups, corporations, and nation-states, do often malevolently conspire to achieve their goals, and history is full shocking examples.    </p>

<p>Ever since Alex Jones and his ilk stopped even pretending to be freedom fighters and became shills for Trump, people of that persuasion have gotten it into their heads that somehow by being a fan of Donald Trump they are part of some underground resistance movement against the Deep State, failing to recognize the irony that Trump is now head hancho OF the Deep State. But of course it was never about that, as seen by their denial of any conspiracy theory that implicates Trump - those, they insist, are never true. Only ones involving Obama and Hillary and the DNC and Soros are true.</p>

<p>Did you imply that no money was repatriated? </p>

<p>Did you also consider off shore profits estimated at 2.6 trillion as meager?</p>

<p>Then did you try to catch me in an ah ha moment by posing a question that we both know is not quantifiable?</p>

<p>Talk about fucking dishonesty holy shit. Shoot yourself please</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money per se is irrelevant paper (or, realistically, bits on a server); what matters for actually sustaining countries / people is land and resources. If &quot;the rich guys&quot; decide to peace out of the country, they lose their assets, which can be put to much more productive use. </p>

<p>Practically speaking, tax flight on any scale that would actually impact a country is A) pretty much a myth even now, when we aren&#39;t flat out seizing mansions or yachts, and B) isn&#39;t at all a concern given that what actually matters for producing something are talents and skills, which the extremely wealthy don&#39;t have themselves- they merely pay others to have them.</p>
