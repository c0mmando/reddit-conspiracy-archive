       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “I do not miss childhood, but I miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from things or people or moments that hurt, but I took joy in the things that made me happy.” ― Neil Gaiman, The Ocean at the End of the Lane
      </p>
      <p>
       We were once all children, and I think, most of us reading can reflect on the euphoric feeling of childhood, discovery, innocence, and youth. By the way, I did not have the best childhood, but I always remember truly feeling the world around me for what it was – without seeking control of it. When does that change? Is it supposed to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, many reading this, struggle with the feeling of not really feeling at all. Many reading have addictions, even if they do not realize it, whether it be to sex, drugs, food, adrenaline…(insert vice here).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adhedonia is defined as the inability to feel pleasure. I believe that many in our society are suffering from it, and in order to cure it, many (unfortunately including myself) try to compensate through hedonistic tendencies. In other words, for us to feel, we want any ounce of pleasure we can take, which often means we go to extreme measures. No longer do we enjoy anything “simple” as we are simply living for pleasure. In this post, I will examine the root of modern hedonism, as well as what we can do to feel again, to avoid becoming the “Modern American Psycho.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hedonism
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “We have had enough, once and for all, of Hedonism--the gloomy philosophy which says that Pleasure is the only good”. - C. S. Lewis
      </p>
      <p>
       “Traditional hedonism...was based on the direct experience of pleasure: wine, women and song; sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll; or whatever the local variant. The problem, from a capitalist perspective, is that there are inherent limits to all this. People become sated, bored...Modern self-illusory hedonism solves this dilemma because here, what one is really consuming are fantasies and day-dreams about what having a certain product would be like.” - David Graeber
 
Hedonism is defined as “the pursuit of pleasure; sensual self-indulgence.” Today, in American society, there is no shortage of pleasure. But is hedonism really about pleasure – or is it about the avoidance of something
       <em>
        else
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purpose of this post, I want to tie hedonism to addiction, even though they are NOT the same thing. One can be hedonistic and not addicted to something; however, I’d argue that hedonism is tied to addiction or can lead to addiction. Further, I believe one can be addicted to anything, really, and I would argue most are "addicted" to something. So please allow my looser, non-medical use of the term addiction in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Psychology Today, “Addiction is actually nothing more or less than one very common way of trying to cope with feelings of intolerable powerlessness.  When coping mechanisms work poorly, as addiction does, we call them symptoms.  Addiction is neither more nor less than a psychological symptom, a way to deal with a difficult emotional state, like other symptoms we all have.  It has nothing to do with getting high, being gratified, or having any other kind of pleasure.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-heart-addiction/201510/is-addiction-about-pleasure">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-heart-addiction/201510/is-addiction-about-pleasure
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What are we feeling powerless about as a society? Why do we feel the need to give into these hedonistic tendencies?
      </p>
      <p>
       “Every form of addiction is bad, no matter whether the narcotic be alcohol, morphine or idealism.” ― C.G. Jung
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Feeling Out of Control
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, many feel out of control, but why? I would argue that people are feeling more out of control than ever before in American history. Today, our reality is dictated by extremes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Extreme 1: Money
       </em>
       - One can go to school now for 4 years, spend $50,000, and still NOT find a job when they get out. Talk about insanity. Millennials now face a “quarter life crisis” after college:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And, let’s not forget, most Americans are in debt:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.fool.com/retirement/2018/02/15/its-official-most-americans-are-currently-in-debt.aspx">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In America, there seems to people who have too much money, and people who have too little, and there seems to be no in between:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who actually have money, there is an endless amount of things to buy and waste money on, and it seems never to be enough – perhaps that is why we rarely hear any good stories about lottery winners:

       <em>
        Extreme 2: Relationships/Sex
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Families and even friendships are on the verge of breakdown. Many have given up on the concept of a relationship altogether, from MGTOW to people marrying themselves:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Traditional families are on the decline, and many are feeling that social media friendships are not as fulfilling as real-life friendships:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure you have heard about “incels” by now. This article may be a tad biased, but just in case it is a new word for you:

      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other end up the spectrum, sex positivity is on the rise, which basically says all sex is good sex. More and more, dating apps (which are really just apps to find sex) are feeding promiscuity:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/dating/as-many-sexual-partners-as-they-can-get-dating-apps-fuelling-rise-in-casual-sex/news-story/7bb94ffbf5ddec69fd5a114aabed54db">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, for the incels, there is an endless amount of porn, and no surprise, a rise in porn addiction:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/elwood-d-watson/pornography-addiction-amo_b_5963460.html">
        https://www.huffingtonpost.com/elwood-d-watson/pornography-addiction-amo_b_5963460.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       People are forgoing relationships altogether, or they are having endless amount of empty sex either in real life or virtually.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Extreme 3: Food
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not know much about eating disorders (I have some experience with this unfortunately), it is often about control.  Behind anorexia, for example, is not necessarily self-image (though that is part of it), but a need for control:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/wellness/anxiety-desire-for-control-can-be-at-root-of-anorexia/">
        https://www.seattletimes.com/life/wellness/anxiety-desire-for-control-can-be-at-root-of-anorexia/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point here is that we now live in a society where there are now extremes in food itself. While there is more food than ever, many are still experiencing food poverty:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://bristolfoodpolicycouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Food-Poverty-Report-July-2013-for-publication.pdf">
        http://bristolfoodpolicycouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Food-Poverty-Report-July-2013-for-publication.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I live in a very poor area, and many I know have hot cheetos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other end of the spectrum, there is a rise in the “obsession with healthy food”
       <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/other/orthorexia">
        https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/other/orthorexia
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And, then we have a huge problem with obesity, binge eating disorders, and eating disorders in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Dysfunction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I do not have the time or space to write about every single extreme in our society, but clearly, many are coming from less functioning lives. While the “rat park” study is said to overly simplified, it explains that drugs themselves do not cause addiction, rather addiction is the result of a dysfunctional environment:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the study is said to be overly simplified, as we all know addiction is extremely complex, but it is something to ponder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you agree with that conclusion is up to you (and more research), but the point is that our society has become increasingly dysfunctional, and basic structures and security that we had before, from family, to relationships, to money, are out of whack.
      </p>

       <strong>
        Desensitization and the Root of Anhedonia
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “I had all the characteristics of a human being—flesh, blood, skin, hair—but my depersonalization was so intense, had gone so deep, that my normal ability to feel compassion had been eradicated, the victim of a slow, purposeful erasure. I was simply imitating reality, a rough resemblance of a human being, with only a dim corner of my mind functioning” 
― Bret Easton Ellis, American Psycho
      </p>
      <p>
       As I am writing this, I am watching “American Psycho” in the background. Some of the themes of the movie include over-indulgence, decadence, isolation, and in a sense, desensitization. In the movie, nothing seems to truly phase Patrick Bateman, and in the scene I just watched, raunchy porn is just playing in the background, like regular tv.
Ironically, I am typing this to the sounds of people being murdered also in the background, and I am completely unnerved.
The point is that as a society, we have stopped feeling, and that is because we are over-stimulated, over-consuming, and over-compensating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to think the ones complaining about violent video games and movies were religious lunatics, but now I know better. This is one study about youth exposure to violence and desensitization:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Daily, we are desensitized to sex, violence, and general depravity. We stop feeling, so we seek more, just to feel again, if even for a moment. Here is an article about some of the ways we are desensitized in society:

       <strong>
        Reflecting
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       For one moment, I want you to really think about the media we consume daily because the problem is, I do not think any of us are really thinking about it. Let’s take a look at some aspects of modern society.
      </p>
      <p>
       -There is now a “50 Shades of Grey Effect” where people are seeking BDSM, and “In the past, BDSM has generally been depicted in entertainment and the media not only as a taboo sexual fetish, but as dysfunctional and dangerous (all untrue). Fifty Shadeshas uprooted those notions, casting a more positive, even romantic, light on the kinkier side of sex.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.flushthefashion.com/culture/getting-the-kinks-out-the-rise-of-bdsm-in-pop-culture/">
        http://www.flushthefashion.com/culture/getting-the-kinks-out-the-rise-of-bdsm-in-pop-culture/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But really think about what BDSM truly entails, and people are even dying from BDSM sex acts:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/2016/05/11/man-who-beat-woman-death-bdsm-case-gets-life/84231280/">
        https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/2016/05/11/man-who-beat-woman-death-bdsm-case-gets-life/84231280/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, that may be an extreme case, but would that be something that existed 100 years ago? That is the point. It is about GRADUAL desensitization.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Let’s continue. Today, you are hearing more about cases about people not helping others, even during death. These teens filmed a man dying as they laughed:
      </p>
      <p>

        http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/07/20/teens-filmed-mocked-and-laughed-while-man-slowly-drowned.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Are people becoming desensitized to reality itself?
      </p>
      <p>
       -Family Guy always creeps me out. The point of the show is to purely desensitize its audience, and the laughs come from deeper and darker things. Watch this abortion scene, and tell me, is this
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       funny?:

       While there are many forms of comedy, and many reasons why we laugh, I wonder what a person from 1950 would have thought about that Family Guy abortion scene.

       I can do this all day, but the point is pretty clear. We are simply being desensitized to more extremism on a daily basis.

       “I’m in touch with humanity.” Patrick Bateman
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I’m not saying all of us are going to become axe murderers, and this post is not meant to be a commentary on the different interpretations of the classic book/movie (just do a google search for that). Still, in Patrick’s overly-indulgent life, the only thing that really seems to make him feel anymore is murder (whether fantasy or the actual act), and that is the direction society is heading.
      </p>
      <p>
       As our sense of anhedonia increases, we seek out more hedonistic tendencies, as a way to compensate for not feeling as much as we once did. As we know, though, there is never enough to fulfill us – not enough sex, not enough alcohol, not enough money, not enough of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even deeper than that, though, is that we lose to ability to feel and empathize for others. As we become more hedonistic, we become more self-absorbed, and lose what makes us “human.”
      </p>
      <p>
       A sociopath is “a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that people are becoming more sociopathic, in this is rooted in the constant quest for fulfillment through hedonism, in order to try to cure that adhodenia.
      </p>
      <p>
       In our quest for pleasure and fulfillment, we forget about others. Hedonism is about doing what brings us individual pleasure, and it is often at the cost of others.

        Feeling Again
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Feeling is often painful, and that is why many avoid feelings, but here are some suggestions on how I think we can regain our feelings as a society.
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         Take a break from media: You do not have to give up all media, but taking breaks can be beneficial for our minds:

       I stopped watching most movies, and now I can barely stand to watch nearly any modern movie today. I feel for the characters now like I never have before. Many may think that is a bad thing, but I feel human again.
      </p>
      <p>
       ·         Help somebody – You do NOT have to be rich or famous to help someone. Helping someone can be as simple as a kind word. We now live in a society where we feel only those of power can help people, but anyone at any level can help someone else at anytime. Helping others makes us happy:

      </p>
      <p>
       ·         Get back to nature – This one is hard for some, especially if you live in a place where nature is not your backdoor. Still, whenever you get a chance, try to go out in nature, and if possible, put your phone on silent. I was getting to the point where I was taking pictures every single time I took a hike, and while I really enjoy photography, I need some time with my thoughts, alone. No matter what is going on in our lives, we can always step outside and take a walk:

      <p>
       ·         Be like a child – Being like a child does not mean that you should give up on your responsibilities or feel happy all of the time. When I say this, to me, it just means seeing the world through a different perspective. Our attitudes literally control our perceptions of reality. So, I know this comes off as cliché, but try to remember how you viewed things as a child. I know, for me, I simply enjoyed the moment for what it was. I did not try to control or shape it or make it better. I accepted that I only had some level of control, which leads to my next point.
 
·         Control the things you can. On a conspiracy forum especially, we are bombarded so much by things that are out of our control. I am not saying not to care about those things, but I am saying that sometimes all we can really do is try to control the things in our immediate live environments. I may not be able to stop the global, elite cabal, but I can probably be kinder to those around me, and give back to people in my community. I may not change the world, but maybe my writing can help people. Find what you have control over, and try to give back to the world in a way you can. Remember, our sense of feeling out of control is what often leads us to addiction/hedonism in the first place.
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Patrick Bateman: There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe most of this post is obvious, but I think that sometimes the truth is simple, and then often, the truth is overlooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we can become addicted to anything, even self-improvement. This post is more about recognizing things that may actually be making us feel less in our lives. For example, how much money did I spend on those clothes recently just to feel that slight tinge of happiness?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of course, you might be thinking, “Well, am I supposed to be a monk or something? What is wrong with pleasure?”
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing wrong with pleasure or enjoyment in and of itself. It is when seeking pleasure becomes why we live.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a mantra right now in society about “do what you want as long as it makes you happy”, and I am sure you know where that little mantra comes from. The thing is, when happiness is our end goal, we never really live life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because in order to live life, you have to feel. You have to suffer sometimes. You have to go through bad moments. You sometimes have to experience moments of unhappiness
Yet, people will do anything, nearly anything, to avoid feeling a moment of displeasure. Can’t go outside – might sweat! Can’t get into relationship – might risk getting hurt. Can’t pursue that dream – might risk failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are literally being held back by this pursuit of happiness, in my opinion. Today, I say, let’s try to be human again.

       I heard from a man I know who's had a lot of sex with women. He says it feels like masturbation because there is no intimacy or connection there. He says even if there is some connection, it's fleeting because they're not really all that compatible and it ends up with him being in negative situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is lack of intimacy and balance in this world and that's what causes the emptiness. People are fake with each other. Pretending to like something they don't or be someone they aren't just to impress. And then when they get to know each other, the reality sets in, they don't like each other all that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's lack of sincere and genuine people and a growing fear that people are not good enough. All this self-loathing and anger leads to self-destruction. The man who looks in the mirror and wishes to change nothing is truly happy. We must be content with who we are not just from the outside, but from within.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we like ourselves, and we invest in ourselves and the world, we begin to really connect. That connection, that love, is lacking, everywhere.

       Probably not. Empty sex I'm sure is like porn addiction or drinking. It's just used to numb people and distract them from the pain. I remember monks practiced living within emotional pain to better understand themselves. If we deal with what burdens us, perhaps we can experience true happiness because we'll learn self-love and the ability to truly care.

       Really cool write up, I agree with a lot of this and the problems you are presenting.
      </p>
      <p>
       My two-cents is that studies have show that the happiest people in life are those who find purpose and feel fulfilled. Playing video games and watching Netflix is fun and a great way to relax, but if this is the only way you spend your time then you will soon suffer from a lack of purpose and fulfillment, which leads to many of the poor side effects we are seeing now (mental health related mostly).

       From a comment I made elsewhere which I think is in sync here: Houellebecq (at least) was an extreme, active hedonist. So evidently, his observations (I don´t know if they´re original enough to be called theories) are a product of his practices; if he´s any sort of mystic or indeed prophet he would seemingly have achieved such qualities by having fully indulged or plunged into his nostalgie de la boue–which (said desire), one imagines would have been a product of certain particularities of his psyche (how universalizable they are is another question).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, a regressive recapitulation of earlier stages in Western civilization, even in anthropological prehistory may be in evidence here, in order to understand ourselves now (if not for and in all time) what better way than by viscerally and psychically (hence the hedonistic bent) revisiting the fully egoistic hedonic violence and violent hedonism (not least of all to the experiencing subject him or herself) of the first men, for whom anything and everything was a violent sensual experience, the original anaesthesia (paradoxically) before the overwhelming, indeed surely inconceivably so to us, menaces of that primeval human world. Why do men rape in times of war, after they have finished assaulting a city, won and survived a battle? Perhaps because the fear of war, of the uncertainties inseparable from it and the likelihood of the most agonizing forms of death, produces in them an overwhelming desire for life and for the most intense experiences that living can afford. Via such acute anxieties they are returned, catapulted, as it were, into the most primitive periods of human existence: when life tout court was characterized by such terrifying uncertainties, agonies, and mortalities, palliated only by the synesthesia/anaesthesia of the most undilute (plenary) sensuality.
      </p>

       The modern hedonist intuitively seeks to recover such a resource, such a stratagem when the perception (subconscious) is that all others have failed. The analytically brilliant hedonist discovers that he or she may make a methodically observational experiment of it and thereby regain a measure of their civilized sanity and self-respect, perhaps even make a contribution to artistic or scientific universality (knowledge) in the process or as an ultimate goal (transgender persons of a similarly analytical bent not only may but have been documented as expressly stating that such factored into their decisions to “transition”).

       Thanks for the write up &amp; interesting topic. I think the becoming desensitized is a natural part of being human. However modern society has magnified &amp; sped this up hugely.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly what can we do about it?
Have a look at some of these search results - I believe some of these techniques work.

       I cancelled a vacation to the Bahamas just so I can smoke some yots with my buddy, visit the muskoxes at the zoo while I was passing by the river. I'm tired of luxury and travel and just want simple shit.

       The less I can be satisfied with the better. Everything about life just gets more and more complicated if it's lived on the rails as defined by society.

       Nobody's got any real control over their lives anymore aside from illusions, I think. We're all puppets whether we want to be or realize it or not.

       Happiness and Fulfillment is two very different things. Happiness is a shot of Dopamine; Fleeting by nature and design.

       Very well written post here.

       I fear that things are brewing and I believe that the elite want America to be de-stabilized as much as possible in order to fulfill its agenda without the American people interfering.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you notice that most Americans, whether its the working man to a welfare feminist who dropped out of the graduate school, all complain about things not being proportional anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       And.. everyone is powerless to change it. No one can risk having a criminal record anymore. No one can overthrow any government or expose corruption, as the police state is for the Big Brother, not 'We, the People'.

       you can never be fully happy until your health is good.
eat clean and excersize, get tons of sleep and water.  raise your biophotons with fruits, juices, salads and smoothies.  get into excersize .. beat all addictions to master youself.    THEN you can start trying to find happiness.  good luck and peace be with you

       Everyone is too concerned with what group they’re a part of now rather than who they are as an individual. Social media makes it easy for us now to say ‘I won’t like that person based on their posts/about section because our x y and x opinions aren’t compatible.’ We all think we know all we need to know and don’t learn from each other anymore.

       I look forward to it. In your 8 misconceptions about Christianity post you mentioned being Buddhist for a period. I'd be interested in hearing your experience with that. I was involved in Buddhist type meditation for many years and recently came to Christianity. I still haven't accepted all the views of Christianity though. I know the Bible says Jesus is the only way to heaven but I kinda feel like God sees what's in our heart and allows people of other faiths to go there. Maybe it's just wishful thinking on my part because I hate the idea of people going to hell.

       I feel for you. That was one of my struggles with Christianity. It is the most asked question (but the hardest)...how could a loving God send people to hell?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the way I see it, and feel free to disagree!
      </p>
      <p>
       1) We choose. God tells us exactly what we have to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Standards ARE loving. I realized thid working with children. Parents without standards are not doing what is best for their children in the long run. We are literally God's children.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Standards help us differentiate between good and evil. Despite what the world tells us, evil exists. I realized there is true evil in the world, and nihilistic religions like Buddhism have no consequence for this evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) It is the easiest "assignment" possible. Literally all someone has to do is accept Christ into their hearts. That is it. Yes once you become Christian truly you will show it through your works.
      </p>
      <p>
       God gave humans the easiest chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Why not 100 paths? Because humans will then make 1000. (Saw this answer in an NDE video). People will always find a way around God's word.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) There is a theory that God did this all to rid evil in himself? Interesting theory! I actually saw a good post on this...maybe I can rind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) We have free will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could probably talk about this all day : )

       I will gladly disagree :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we all deserving of heaven? No. But on the other hand I don't think someone is deserving of hell because they don't believe or believe the wrong thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I believe is that there are different layers of heaven and hell. The closer you get to the Father the more heavenly and the further away the more hellish. Earth is somewhere in between because good and evil both exist. He doesn't send us to hell or bring us to heaven but it's our cumulative thoughts, actions, and intentions that send us to where we belong in relation to His holiness. Or in essence the condition of our heart. Our Father is pure, holy, and good and anything that is not that cannot exist in his presence. But as we draw closer to him we are purified and can exist in a heavenly realm closer to Him. If we choose sin we move farther from Him. Jesus is the only way to the Father but that doesn't mean everyone who doesn't accept Him is going to hell, it just means they will go to a heavenly realm that further away from God or a hellish realm if their heart is evil. There's a guy named Howard Storm who had a NDE and went to hell and was saved by Jesus and he has a similar view to this.

        <p>
         Jesus speaks in parables that can be interpreted many ways. Most of the time people didn't understand what he meant, even the apostles. In the gospel of a John it emphasizes that all we have to do is believe in Jesus but other places in the Bible say that it also depends on our works. So is it just faith or is it faith + works, and if it's faith + works, couldn't it be said that the person who does just works has faith inherently?

         You are right that standards are loving and there are consequences for disobeying, but I don't think anyone on the planet in their right mind would say burning someone is an acceptable punishment. Usually punishment is used to correct behavior but the punishment of hell is just for punishment sake. Should we burn our children slightly every time they disobey one of god's commands so they know what punishment awaits them? That would be loving wouldn't it, a little pain now so they will avoid an eternity of pain.

        <p>
         I agree with you that standards help us differentiate between good and evil. The Bible says that those who don't believe will be burned in hell for eternity. Is non-belief evil? If an atheist and a Christian both act exactly the same in their everyday life and how they treat other people is one evil because they don't believe in God? Do they deserve to be burned for eternity? Or replace the atheist with a Muslim, do they deserve to be burned for eternity because they believed in the wrong God?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes it is easy but many people don't do it for one reason or another. There was a time in your life when you didn't do it.
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         Could the path be love? Would an atheist or Buddhist or Hindu with love in their heart and compassion for their fellow man go to hell?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I don't see this theory as plausible. To me God is everything good and perfect. Evil is the absence of God. I believe God allows us to experience evil in this world so we know Him better and want to turn toward Him.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         God gave us free will and he told us to seek Him, I can't see him punishing people for seeking Him in the wrong place.

       |Christ is our salvation.  But let us just be realistic. If we are truly saved, won't our works show it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely. I believe our works show the condition of our heart, and when we are saved God purifies our heart and our works reflect that purification. This shows me that the person who has works but doesn't verbally claim faith still has faith because they allow the will of God to work through them (This is dependent on their intentions as well, good works for self-serving purposes are not of God). God is everything good and righteous and when we choose to express these qualities we align ourselves more with the will of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       |If someone says they are sorry, how do we know they are telling the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know because their actions align with their words. They recognize that their actions caused pain to another person and so they choose not to do it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person knows that a certain action will cause pain so they choose not to do it, and in not doing it have no reason to be sorry, wouldn't that person be just as convicted about that action as the person who did it and was sorry?
      </p>
      <p>
       |We go where our consciousness goes. If we are evil murder pedophiles, could we even comprehend God?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the choice to choose good or evil. God gives us a conscience to know the right thing to do, but if we continually choose evil we cut ourself off from the guidance of God. An evil murderer pedophile could comprehend God if they turned toward Him but they are so deep in their evil ways that they are blinded by them, they cannot see the truth of God. If they could see the truth of God they wouldn't do what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       |What is the "wrong" place?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Christianity is the true religion and that Jesus is the way to the Father. On the other hand I also believe that every person is a son or daughter of God and by choosing to do good they are following the Fathers will and accepting Jesus even if they don't consciously know it. Like you said, God searches our hearts. I believe someone can follow the wrong religion but do the will of God in their heart and thus accepting Jesus Christ.
