    <div class="md"><p>Who is they? Can you name the politicians who has proposed permanent sanctions? You know about it so you have to at least remember a name from the article you read. That proxy war in Syria has been going on since Obama was in office, why no cold/hot war then? Because Obama is a wimp and Trump is a tough guy not to be messed with? </p>

<p>The end result? No clue because there are no names, no proposed sanctions to go along with this conspiracy, I guess that&#39;s how &quot;they&quot; want it, easier to conspire with the public in the dark. Inflation causes wars to be more expensive compared to past wars and American soldiers will always die overseas in countries that American soldiers shouldn&#39;t be but the United States government like sticking it&#39;s nose in other countries&#39; business. </p>

<p>The DNC can have passwords that will take ten cray mainframes 20 years to break but password complexity is completely negated if some idiot high up in the DNC gets fooled by a phishing email. What does the EU and Ukraine have to do with Democrats calling for war with Russia?</p>

<p>How is it clear that they want permanent sanctions if none of them even called for any sanctions temporary or permanent? None of the politicians you mentioned said the meeting is an act of treason, how did you come to that conclusion?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Trump gave the Russians a heads up on the airstrikes to give Russians time to make sure their planes and men were not close to the designated areas to strike. How will a hot war start from Trump giving Russians a heads up to prevent Russian casualties and Russian lost of expensive military planes and equipment?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ukraine has everything to do with this. Russia&#39;s occupation of Crimea and meddling in Ukraine against our meddling is the sticking point for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is obviously clear. They are calling Trump a traitor for meeting with Putin. They don&#39;t want sanctions lifted if they are demanding isolation. Sanctions will be permanent until the government in Russia is overthrown. The goal of sanctions is to break their economy.</p>

<p>Of course Trump gave them a heads up with the two airstrikes but we did kill scores of Russian/affiliated mercenaries a few months ago. We aren&#39;t in Syria to fight Russia, we are there to punish Assad. Why would we risk escalating a war with Russia over Assad using chemical weapons? Those strikes hit his aircraft and alleged chemical weapons facilities. </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton for a start. The Crimean issue is one of the main reasons why we are in this situation with Russia. </p>

Why make enemies? 
Democrats have been sour about civil and peaceful diplomacy between the us and the two mentioned countries. Which ones? I&#39;d say a majority of dems don&#39;t want to acknowledge that these are good things.
Imagine demonizing the shit out of these countries while visiting during diplomatic engagement. That&#39;s war. Look man, we try to live in a peaceful world despite all that goes on. We got kids that should see us getting along with everyone. Other countries have nukes like the US, and it&#39;s better for everyone if we can all get along together.

<p>Make no mistake that they, along with the Democrats, would call Trump a &#39;warmonger&#39; and &#39;baby killer&#39; if he started talking belligerent on Russia. Remember how quickly they went from &quot;Trump is gonna start a nuclear war with North Korea!&quot; to &quot;Why is Trump being so buddy-buddy with the evil Kim!&quot;.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>With due respect, I believe that this is the wrong way to go about this. What we need isn&#39;t a &quot;fuck &#39;em&quot; mentality, but rather an open minded mentality. If one side can show that they are willing to listen, it makes it more likely that the other side will as well.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t force anyone to think or act in any way. But we can control our own actions. We shouldn&#39;t divide ourselves further, or we are doomed to be ruled over from greedy power-seekers.</p>

<p>Compromise and working together is necessary. And it might seems like one side is thinking &quot;Well, they don&#39;t listen or want to work together, so why should I?&quot; But sometimes it takes the bigger person to reach out first, and to continue trying if rejected. It is the harder option, of course, but the rewards far outweigh the cost of pride or humiliation.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we can compromise with these people. They hate Trump personally and they hate those who voted for them. The people pushing these narratives have their agendas and they are far above the heads of the average American. </p>
