       There have been some posts here in the sub over the last year or so, about a rising anti-White Sentiment from the left. Some know about this, but others refuse to believe it is happening and argue that it's not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me it culminated when a Professor (jewish) tweeted that "All I want for Christmas, is White Genocide."
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you are on twitter, you can search the term "white genocide" and find thousands of posts and
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/q9e989uonv811.jpg">
        it also exists on reddit as well
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, this is now fully confirmed to be a rising sentiment on the Left, because Obama spoke out about it. He knows white males are leaving the Democratic Party in droves because of this Sentiment and because of all the SJW's:

      <p>
       And this will cost the Democrats the 2020 Elelction. Obama knows this, so he had to tell the Left to chill the fuck out with the Identity Politics by telling his base not to silence White Males:

       It's good that a major voice on the left is finally saying some of the things Obama is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama also said this recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the West’s current debate around immigration, for example, it’s not wrong to insist that national borders matter; whether you’re a citizen or not is going to matter to a government, that laws need to be followed; that in the public realm newcomers should make an effort to adapt to the language and customs of their new home.”

       The definition of “deportation” was changed under the Bush administration and was later expanded by the Obama’s administration. 2/3 of people who were “deported” in 2013 were actually either turned away at the boarder or were caught within 100 miles and brought back after they had recently entered the country. If you extrapolate that 2/3’s across his presidency, only 850,000 people of the 2,500,000 he “deported” were actually legitimately deported.

       So coming into the US illegally and being stopped and sent back isn't actually deportation. Got it. Semantics are fun.

       We’re talking about a legal definition, so it’s not semantics. It actually means something. No one realistically will say that being turned around at the border is being deported. The definition was changed, most likely to raise the “deportation numbers, which it ended up doing.

       So stopping someone crossing the border or catching them just after they crossed and sending them back is fundamentally different than catching someone who's made it past a certain mile marker and sending them back? I understand everyone is a lawyer on reddit and everything, but for the sake of not being a lunatic yes it is semantics. You know what else happened under Obama? Work place raids were every single person who was in the US illegally would get rounded up and deported from a work place. Now correct me if I am wrong but under Trump the people being targeted for deportation are specifically those who have a criminal record or commit crimes in the US? Is that not the case?

       They were still taken back to their country though after entering, or were turned away. Shouldn't those numbers still count? Or do you believe they shouldn't be included in the "deportation" data?

       Completely false, or at least VERY misleading, and it’s a shame that this is being upvoted so heavily here. The only reason why Obama’s deportation numbers were so high was because they included those turned away at the boarder as “deportations”. The definition of what a deportation is was changed during Bush’s administration

       Not a fan of Snopes at all but they actually did a good job at adding legit sources in here. It’s reported that Obama “deported” roughly 2.5 million people. But in 2013, almost 2/3 of deportations were people who were turned away at the boarder or were caught within 100 miles and brought back. If we extrapolate that to cover his eight year as president, that would mean 1,650,000 people fit the new description of “deportation”, meaning only 850,000 were really deported in what the true sense of the word is.

       Obama was not a redistributing Marxist, and if the left doubles down and puts a Marxist in office, this will be painfully obvious. Let's hope it doesn't come to that, because that would spell the end of America.

       Marx said the workers should seize the means of production and overthrow the ruling class and abolish capitalism. Repulicans said obama was a kenyan, muslim, socialist because it wasnt politically correct to say "he's black". Obama was a spineless centrist. I don't know a single marxist that voted for him.

       Obama is anything but a redistributing Marxist.  He "redistributed" plenty to the rich, but that's little different from every other recent president.  If he'd given money to the poor as conservatives pretend, there'd actually be a lot less focus on racial animosity these days.

       We've had two big parties for a long time now. I thought the Republicans were a dying party during Obama. But Republicans came back and won again without the popular vote. History tells us this country goes back and forth and back and forth. So you will be quite disappointed if you're under the impression that the democratic party is dying.

       Dems have to reinvent themselves in the same way the republicans have via trump. Most of the new school conservative voices are much more "left" than I ever thought possible. The dems will need to move right on some things and back away from identity politics as OP has pointed out, or face losing in 2020 almost certainly. The other thing they could do is double down on all their BS and suck up to the commies in hopes of literally shaming the nation into voting for them again. Unfortunately it seems like the latter is the direction they are going currently.

       The problem in the last election was Hillary was seen as a centrist. She was supposed to just be a safe bet. It was the lefty guy who riled up the base. Democrats arent going to win more by moving right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont expect the country to change much by the time 2020 rolls around so I wouldn't be surprised if Trump got reelected. But no way in hell there's a Republican president in 2024. And I'm not exactly sure where the party goes after Trump.

       I agree with you mostly.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say "move right" I mean on specific issues like immigration reform for example. This whole "abolish ICE" thing being spouted by some dem leadership is not winning them any favor with anyone but the open borders hard left... they aren't a big enough voting block to win with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't really mean move right of Hillary I just mean move right on some things. Hillary lost partly because of what you said already, but also because she was seen as the poster child of corruption in politics by anyone with half a brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for 2020 I think trump wins again most likely due to how polarized against liberals a lot of people have become. The center hasn't so much moved right as the left has moved away from them.  2024 is too far away to call but I too subscribe to the pendulum theory. People get sick of whatever group is in power and seek to go another direction particularly when you have a 2 term presidency.

       Right now, we would be on the third impeachment trial of Hillary, things would be basically stalemated like they were in the third through eighth year of Barack Obama, There would still be eight Justices on the Supreme Court and Anthony Kennedy would not have announced his retirement.

       I'm not going to try and argue with this one, because party affiliation is the one identity which has been consistently woven into identity politics in America longer than any other, I'd say since the founding of our nation. I just assumed we were exempting this since virtually no president has ever been elected without it.

       Not considered a part of identity as framed within identity politics. Type of occupation, yes. Whether you abuse welfare or not isn't really an identity, which is how that was articulated in his campaign.

       Status as to whether you are a legal resident in our country is not an attribute of identity politics, which is how this was articulated in Trump's campaign. Politicians are only tasked with appealing to their constituents. In this case, citizens of the united states of America, not of Mexico.

       Christian identity was definitely also a component of Trump's campaign and optics, as identity politics formally, but I would argue this was the least focused on component of all. It was pushed more than Democrat representatives push it, but compared to the typical Republican bible thumping, it was very modest IMO. Put the Trump and Bush campaigns side by side in this regard. Incomparable.

       Those also aren't the reasons why Hillary wasn't elected. She wasn't elected because she didn't have a well articulated platform with substantiated policy stances. She was very transparently nothing more than the highly marketed face of business as usual-sitting idly by, while lobbyists run congress, while generals usurp foreign governments for geopolitical advantage, while psychopathic intelligence types turn the world into an Orwellian nightmare, and while advisers inform her of when to sign off on predatory international trade agreements.

       I think a dem could be centrist on some issues and still be credible. The problem is Hillary went left on all the superficial issues like identity politics, but kept her Washington Consensus views on everything else, especially with foreign policy. The left wasn't buying it either.  It seems logical someone on the left could make waves by saying they intend to reallocate some military budget towards other programs and do easy shit like legalize weed, and it won't cost anything. There's also actual solutions that can be made to immigration aside from the ridiculous "abolish ICE" crap which is laughably not even targeting the correct agency (CBP).

She describes herself as centrist but her platform is extremely left and brazenly progressive. 
It’s like saying trump is a moderate republican. The point is you think using a pendulum of extremes to correct issue you see. I must vote for extreme policy change for the this issue using far right or left politicians. Centrist only works when people are happy with the situation on both sides but have only a few issues they want corrected. Society is fractured after Obama’s presidency not because he wasn’t a good or bad president just that POC/women believed that now only women and POC are going to be president based off merit and not have to earn that spot. The reality is these leftists are acting crazy and spazzing out while people didn’t like Obama’s policies voted to change them. Obama’s has some forced ideas that didn’t work like universal healthcare and he did some good things too.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The sad thing about this all is the child like behavior of both the left and the right. Obama’s years had been as smug and pompous as you can get towards the other half of the country. Now the right is acting the same way while the left collectively loses it mind point is if you dish it out you should be able to take it!

       Almost everyone is fed the fuck up with this "everything is racist/sexist/problematic" garbage. Racism exists, but wanting secure borders isn't racist. You can debate how much of a problem border security actually is that's fine, but acting like a sovereign nation has no right to police its own borders and that doing so is somehow racist is beyond stupid. Go sneak into Canada and set up shop and see what happens when you get found. Think they will just let you stay because you're white?

       No one is implying that securing our borders is racist, or at least I haven't heard anyone spin it that way. Not a single American should be against securing our borders, and I don't know any Democrat who is personally. Building a wall with taxpayer money after running on the idea that Mexico would be paying for it isn't racist either (although ridiculous), but calling out Mexico saying they are "sending" rapists and drug dealers into our country is racist. It is taking a race and implying that they are drug dealers and rapists, like we don't have white Americans who do the same.

       I see what you are saying, but two things.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Yes people are saying that securing borders is racist. I have personally encountered this viewpoint on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Implying that many of the people who come to the US though the southern border may have criminal records isn't racist. Many of the people coming from the south are coming from places like Honduras and Guatemala, places that have incredible crime rates. Now if someone is actually racist (and I agree many of Trumps base fit that description) hears this the very simplistic racist version gets twisted into "Mexicans are rapists". Obviously its absurd to make a blanket judgment against entire ethnic groups. I don't think Trump is so stupid that he actually thinks everyone south of the border is some kind of criminal. The problem is when people come in undocumented we have no idea who is here and what their criminal background is. This is a problem for obvious reasons.

       I agree with your comment, but I disagree on the choice of words used. I have never in my lifetime heard anyone in person or in the media say that securing our borders is "racist". Not now and not when other Presidents did so. Whoever is making this claim (not the MSM) is stupid. Securing our borders is necessary, the way Trump is going about it I can see being labeled as racist, but not the actual act of securing our borders. That's asinine to think so.

       So why is there any debate at all about the merits of securing the border? I mean a wall is a bad idea but what are the talking points against stopping and deporting people crossing the border illegally? The only one I have heard is its racist.

       I'm not sure. I agree the wall is a bad idea, but there is more we can do besides separating families and children from their parents. We can see it doesn't stop people from crossing the border. Where did you hear that?

       We have stopped separating families already. The public didn't like the application of the law so Trump stopped it. Personally I think some amount of separation would be good to afford an attempt at finding out if the adults are actually their parents or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Policing the border better would stop people coming over due to catching more of them and discouraging others from even trying. If it was me I would use a network of drones to constantly monitor every inch of it. Dispatch teams to round up those seen crossing.

       I agree with all that you recommended. I know the separating children policy was because of the chance that the child could be in danger, and there are instances where that is necessary, but not EVERY child as Trump was doing. That was a bit extreme, and he allowed it.

       I think the point of enforcing the separation the way they did was to discourage people bringing kids specifically to avoid being detained. What
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       happening in many cases is when you got caught crossing with a child you'd be released
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       the US and given a court date. So guess how many people decided to show up to that court date? So the idea was to remove the incentive to bring children because it makes them into a commodity. This is also why there was so much speculation about adults bringing kids that aren't theirs.

       I get the point. I just believe there are ways that we can properly vet these migrants to ensure that the kids are in fact their kids like DNA tests. I think that would have been a lot cheaper than splitting them up then having to use funds to reunite them back together. Also, it's just inhumane.

       They are doing DNA tests. I agree though splitting them up was a shitty thing to do. Like I said though they actually listened and stopped doing it after only 2 weeks.

       I know, but only after they were caught. They didn't care about those families one bit, that's the sad part. And the admin was going around blaming their policy on Obama. Now I was never an Obama supporter, but this admin needs to take some responsibility and quit blaming everything they do on him. It's getting ridiculous. Take some fucking accountability already. His supporters don't care so it's not like he'd lose his base.

       Do you really think any administration cares about anyone on a personal level? Personally I thought it was less than ideal but its also not as if the kids where in some kind of hell hole. How about don't try to bring children on a dangerous and illegal journey to another country? If you want actual asylum all you have to do is present yourself at the border and plead your case. That system is not ideal at this time as well, but its better then the alternative.

       There are all kinds of cases and no blanket situation exists that describes everyone trying to come to the US. Some are economic migrants who think there are better opportunities here some may actually need asylum, others might be criminals working for cartels... we don't know anything about them if they cross in secret. Sneaking in is a crime so automatically your first interaction with the US gov is breaking the law.... not a good start. What I am saying is present yourself to border security if you have a valid claim for asylum. Do not attempt to cross in secret with kids in tow.

       They are not in the same world as us, no. He ran on opposing identity politics and intersectionality in general, which the left's identity politics are based off of. Racism isn't an identity, sexism isn't an identity, and xenophobia isn't an identity. Trump's platform was not racist. It was not sexist. It was not xenophobic. Trump objectifies women heavily, I'll concede that. He has some serious character flaws. A lot of conservatives were actually upset about Trump's travel ban for the middle east. It didn't go far enough and didn't include some of the most radical countries in the middle east, because we're allies with those backwards countries. It's not xenophobic to recognize that the most radical variants of Islam exist in the middle east, and to want to keep violent religious fundamentalists out of our country. It's not sexist to conform your views on feminism to scientific literature. The wage gap is not scientifically supported. It is not racist to not support Black Lives' Matter, or to oppose measures like affirmative action etc. Trump is many things. He's got no tact, and he is obviously ill prepared to address many issues which face our nation. I didn't vote for the guy, but to say he ran on racism, sexism, and xenophobia, is propaganda.

       Belligerent morons are attracted to all kinds of people, but that doesn't make those people they are attracted to, racist, xenophobic, or sexist. There are belligerent idiots the world over, and yes, many of them voted for Trump.  That does not make Trump's platform belligerent and racist. Many of them voted for Hillary, too, and unlike Trump, she was very outward with her platform's alignment with those belligerent idiots and the intellectually bankrupt ideologies they espoused.

       Gee, I wonder why feminists, gender studies students, and intersectionality professors don't appeal to sexists and racists? Well, I suppose sometimes they do, like when Drexel AP George Ciccariello-Maher asked for white genocide for Christmas. The left has different kinds of belligerent people, mostly people that reject science wholesale when it contradicts their ideology, as well as the very fundamental philosophical foundation of western philosophy. Truth doesn't matter to the liberal side of America. Truth has been obfuscated and replaced with divisive rhetoric and declarations of the death of God, a post modernist inquiry into what extent mankind can be molded to the exclusion of logic and science.

       come out and say black people are bad. During the campaign he tweeted a totally fake "black crime stats" graphic that totally smeared all black people. One political outlet traced the graphic back to its source, it was created by an actual, avowed neo-Nazi. And Trump shared it.

       saying the crime rate in black communities is higher than it should be isn't racist. Facts aren't racist, how someone chooses to interpret those stats could be though. Its like substance abuse... if you cant even admit there is a problem then how can you start to address it? everyone knows crime in black communities is higher than it should be. Its not because of some genetic predisposition towards crime though its a combination of poverty due to generations of institutionalized racist policy and disproportionate policing. Now having said that does that make it less of a problem? How do we fix it?

      <p>
       As for the source who cares? Unless the stats were fabricated what does it matter? Do you think he was surfing neo-Nazi webpages looking for things to tweet to disparage black people?

       The stats weren't numerically misleading. They were factually false. 100% false. Period. It was meant to drive the point of "white genocide" home with pure unadulterated lies.

       I never saw the tweet in question, but you are reading way too much into it regardless. Why do people always attribute malice in place of simple incompetence? It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       true that crime is higher in black communities, weather or not the stats were correct. I agree on it being a good idea not to tweet false things, but I don't jump to "white genocide" nonsense.

       Because I don't see "blatant racism" in everything like you do. I don't particularly care for Trump for multiple reasons, but I don't think hes a racist. I think screeching racist causes more harm than good so that's why I'm defending it I guess. There are racists and there are instances of institutionalized racism still in the US in 2018. We should be aware and work to correct unfair situations, but acting like every transgression is some secret nod to the KKK is disingenuous at best.

       The only thing changed from reality on the crime stats chart was white victims of black violence and vice versa.

       This actually has a good shot because most millennials, from what I've seen, take a lot of issue with The Republican party and mainstream conservative politics in general. I always vote outside of the Democrat-Republican monopoly on principle, but I know plenty of millenials that vote Republican that would switch in a heartbeat if the Democrats cut the extreme shit out.

       I see your point, but the left became hyper radicalized in just two short years leading up to Trump's election, and in the year since he took office. I don't see how the Dems can recover from this one. They've pissed off both the far left for what they did to Bernie, and the right and moderates for kow towing to identity politics and radical beliefs.

From the other side, I see neo nazis marching with tiki torches and a president who ran on a muslim ban and building a giant wall to keep out drapey Mexicans. So both sides these days seem to point to the other team and day oh my lordy, look at how radical that team has gotten.

       Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia (IMO not far enough). These are all countries with large populations of what I would consider very conservative Muslims with beliefs and worldviews incompatible with the West. These Muslims are nothing like the Muslim populations which have been in Europe for hundreds and in some cases thousands of years. These countries also have large refugee populations, of just about every demographic mix you can think of;young people, old people, skilled laborers, unqualified workers, criminals, good citizens etc. it's a mixed bag, an unvetted mixed bag.

       Drones would have probably been more cost effective, but there's nothing wrong with securing the border, especially when you have mass illegal immigration like we do in the U.S. I love most Mexican immigrants, illegal or not. They're such hard working people, and they come from a rich, beautiful culture. I'd like to make room for as many of them as possible, legally, in a way that is controlled and regulated, like how most developed countries operate. There are criminals from all over the world getting into our country (mostly central and south America, but not exclusively), and they are extending the arm of dangerous cartels into America, which should alarm you. People living in the border states already know what this is like.

       It's not only far left people who like Bernie. His policies themselves were European centrist/American slightly left (social democracy), which is waaaaay better than the extreme right NEOliberalism/corporatism economics of the modern Dems/Repubs who are pushing for an fascistic NWO. 
Anyone who hasn't fallen for corporate media's "hurr durr he's a stalinist"
bullshit and noticed the sharp decline in the middle class, would see trickle down Reaganomics is bullshit and we need to shift back to FDR/JFK style range of economics. Less economic extremism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think we should all stop saying "THEEEEEE LEFT". I'm left wing, yet
some moron would associate me with Clinton (far right secretly pro-TPP NEOliberal).
We have to fight this bullshit propaganda, not let it slide.

       I didn't say, "THEEEEE LEFT" I said "the left". You're exactly what I imagine when I think of "the left". You're one of two kinds of people that self identify as being "on the left". There's Clintonite morons and then there's social democrat morons. Social Democracy is as close to Democratic Socialism as Libertarianism is to anarchy. In principle there's a big difference, in practice all it takes is time and the right crises to devolve. There's a problem with pinning your place down on a one dimensional political spectrum. A person's mode of being should be far too complex for those kinds of simple classifications.

       No it's not. EU is center right at best, corporatist shit, just not as insane as the U.S. NEOliberal NWO battleground. "Communist China" you mean state capitalist dictatorship.  Just like USSR and NK. Workers didn't control shit.

       Saying "THEEE LEFT" is exactly the same as Saying "THE LEFT".
I don't get what point you're trying to make. 
Let's put all people who identify as left wing (even if they aren't)
in one group....what do you get? A stupid situation. 
And divide and conquer.

       What the heck?? 
Clinton isn't remotely economically left wing, she was secretly pro-TPP and an obvious corporatist wallstreet shill.

      <p>
       Why are you calling social democrats morons? Social democrat FDR essentially created the middle class. NEOliberalism then destroyed much of it.  Also, true anarchism tends to be left libertarian, not that horseshit far right libertarian "Libertarian party" garbage ideology (gutting social programs + muh "all tax is theft" trojan horse and lol @ pro-TPP Gary Johnson).

       No one is claiming the political spectrum is perfect (old one axis version sucks ass, two axis one is decent). Why so hostile and pushing strawmen?

      <p>
       Stop calling it radical left when you really mean SJW.
Third wave feminists cheered on by the NEOliberal establishment are not "the left" or "radical left",
they're just brainwashed SJW morons.

       If you notice we've generally been in a trend since Truman where we switch parties between every new President elected, as everyone gets mad at the fuck-ups of whichever party is in power, so we vote in the other party, they fuck something up, we vote in the other party instead next time. It's kind of weird and funny. It's even funnier that we do it even when we keep the same person for two terms.

       Isn't it just lovely how the United States goes from a Democrat president, straight into a republican president. Over and over again. Nothing ever really gets done. Nothing ever really gets solved. It's just fucking theater and the main tool to keep Americans divided.

       So true! I constantly get called a libtard just because I'm moderate. I didn't vote for either candidate in 2016 because neither aligned with my beliefs and both candidates were ridiculous tbh. I haven't even voted for a Dem candidate for President except Kerry in 2004 because I was opposed to the Iraq War. People on the internet are just mean and need an outlet to let out their anger so I don't take anything on the internet personal.

       Yes, yes I do think you're stupid lol. I've talked what I dont like a bout communism/communists before, I've clearly stated my views on where I stand on issues, and none of that lines up with being an extreme leftist. You likely took a peek, saw I didn't like trump and got puffy about that.

       Presidential politics is a Hegelian dialectic.

      <p>
       The Hegelian dialectic used between agenda and controlled opposition is where the manipulation lay. It's providing the illusion of choice, and each synthesis gives rise to a new thesis. I wonder what an Obama/Trump synthesis will bring us?

       I don't know about that, if this white genocide is really taking place then the democrats will be a growing party. The left sows racism into the minds of all of its supporters. The boogyman they use is all white people. The boogyman the right uses is muslims/terrorists..

       Absolutely. You can tell who the shills are when they pretend modern Democrat politicians are left wing (they're actually corporatists similar to the modern Republicans).
      </p>
      <p>
       They also deliberately conflate left wing with SJW when these are clearly as different as right wing and racist.

       What a hilariously bad leap of logic that is. Misrepresentation aside, saying "don't do something" isn't --
       <strong>
        at all
       </strong>
       -- proof of the opposite. You could use that logic to prove anything. This is beyond dumb.

       It seems that the liberals here have decided to try a new tactic of pretending that they are non-partisan and just being 'objective'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed that the only people that ever claim to be independent or non-partisan are liberals. Not just liberals, but the most extreme of the liberals. The communist and socialist supporters. The anti-fa violence supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       and yet, here they are gaslighting everyone and pretending as if they are non-partisan. Go check out their comment history.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say one thing for conservatives: you likely won't ever hear one claiming to be non-partisan because that is dishonest. Dishonesty comes naturally on the left. They justify lying as a means to achieve their goals. They lie as if it is second nature.

       Everyone is partisan. Expecting people to be unpartisan is unrealistic and if someone claims to be non-partisan, they are lying.

       I don't trust liars, therefore I don't trust people claiming to be non-partisan. And for some reason, that claim always seems to come from the left in an effort to manipulate and be deceptive.

       I'm not going to try and argue with this one, because party affiliation is the one identity which has been consistently woven into identity politics in America longer than any other, I'd say since the founding of our nation. I just assumed we were exempting this since virtually no president has ever been elected without it.

        Us workers vs those damn welfare queens

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not considered a part of identity as framed within identity politics. Type of occupation, yes. Whether you abuse welfare or not isn't really an identity, which is how that was articulated in his campaign.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Us true red blooded Americans vs those damn Mexicans
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Status as to whether you are a legal resident in our country is not an attribute of identity politics, which is how this was articulated in Trump's campaign. Politicians are only tasked with appealing to their constituents. In this case, citizens of the united states of America, not of Mexico.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Us Christians vs those scary Muslims
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Christian identity was definitely also a component of Trump's campaign and optics, as identity politics formally, but I would argue this was the least focused on component of all. It was pushed more than Democrat representatives push it, but compared to the typical Republican bible thumping, it was very modest IMO. Put the Trump and Bush campaigns side by side in this regard. Incomparable.

       We’re talking about a legal definition, so it’s not semantics. It actually means something. No one realistically will say that being turned around at the border is being deported. The definition was changed, most likely to raise the “deportation numbers, which it ended up doing.

       I get the point. I just believe there are ways that we can properly vet these migrants to ensure that the kids are in fact their kids like DNA tests. I think that would have been a lot cheaper than splitting them up then having to use funds to reunite them back together. Also, it's just inhumane.
