        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There have been some posts here in the sub over the last year or so, about a rising anti-White Sentiment from the left. Some know about this, but others refuse to believe it is happening and argue that it&#39;s not true.</p>

<p>For me it culminated when a Professor (jewish) tweeted that &quot;All I want for Christmas, is White Genocide.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/4/professor-called-white-genocide-scholar-new-york-u/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/4/professor-called-white-genocide-scholar-new-york-u/</a></p>

<p>Also if you are on twitter, you can search the term &quot;white genocide&quot; and find thousands of posts and <a href="https://i.redd.it/q9e989uonv811.jpg">it also exists on reddit as well</a></p>

<p>Well, this is now fully confirmed to be a rising sentiment on the Left, because Obama spoke out about it. He knows white males are leaving the Democratic Party in droves because of this Sentiment and because of all the SJW&#39;s:</p>

<p>And this will cost the Democrats the 2020 Elelction. Obama knows this, so he had to tell the Left to chill the fuck out with the Identity Politics by telling his base not to silence White Males:</p>

<p>Obama also said this recently.</p>

<p>&quot;In the West’s current debate around immigration, for example, it’s not wrong to insist that national borders matter; whether you’re a citizen or not is going to matter to a government, that laws need to be followed; that in the public realm newcomers should make an effort to adapt to the language and customs of their new home.”</p>

<p>The definition of “deportation” was changed under the Bush administration and was later expanded by the Obama’s administration. 2/3 of people who were “deported” in 2013 were actually either turned away at the boarder or were caught within 100 miles and brought back after they had recently entered the country. If you extrapolate that 2/3’s across his presidency, only 850,000 people of the 2,500,000 he “deported” were actually legitimately deported. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We’re talking about a legal definition, so it’s not semantics. It actually means something. No one realistically will say that being turned around at the border is being deported. The definition was changed, most likely to raise the “deportation numbers, which it ended up doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So stopping someone crossing the border or catching them just after they crossed and sending them back is fundamentally different than catching someone who&#39;s made it past a certain mile marker and sending them back? I understand everyone is a lawyer on reddit and everything, but for the sake of not being a lunatic yes it is semantics. You know what else happened under Obama? Work place raids were every single person who was in the US illegally would get rounded up and deported from a work place. Now correct me if I am wrong but under Trump the people being targeted for deportation are specifically those who have a criminal record or commit crimes in the US? Is that not the case?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely false, or at least VERY misleading, and it’s a shame that this is being upvoted so heavily here. The only reason why Obama’s deportation numbers were so high was because they included those turned away at the boarder as “deportations”. The definition of what a deportation is was changed during Bush’s administration</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-deported-more-people/">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-deported-more-people/</a></p>

<p>Not a fan of Snopes at all but they actually did a good job at adding legit sources in here. It’s reported that Obama “deported” roughly 2.5 million people. But in 2013, almost 2/3 of deportations were people who were turned away at the boarder or were caught within 100 miles and brought back. If we extrapolate that to cover his eight year as president, that would mean 1,650,000 people fit the new description of “deportation”, meaning only 850,000 were really deported in what the true sense of the word is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you mostly.</p>

<p>When I say &quot;move right&quot; I mean on specific issues like immigration reform for example. This whole &quot;abolish ICE&quot; thing being spouted by some dem leadership is not winning them any favor with anyone but the open borders hard left... they aren&#39;t a big enough voting block to win with.  </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t really mean move right of Hillary I just mean move right on some things. Hillary lost partly because of what you said already, but also because she was seen as the poster child of corruption in politics by anyone with half a brain. </p>

<p>As for 2020 I think trump wins again most likely due to how polarized against liberals a lot of people have become. The center hasn&#39;t so much moved right as the left has moved away from them.  2024 is too far away to call but I too subscribe to the pendulum theory. People get sick of whatever group is in power and seek to go another direction particularly when you have a 2 term presidency.   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Republicans vs those damn Democrats</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not going to try and argue with this one, because party affiliation is the one identity which has been consistently woven into identity politics in America longer than any other, I&#39;d say since the founding of our nation. I just assumed we were exempting this since virtually no president has ever been elected without it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Us workers vs those damn welfare queens</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not considered a part of identity as framed within identity politics. Type of occupation, yes. Whether you abuse welfare or not isn&#39;t really an identity, which is how that was articulated in his campaign.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Us true red blooded Americans vs those damn Mexicans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Status as to whether you are a legal resident in our country is not an attribute of identity politics, which is how this was articulated in Trump&#39;s campaign. Politicians are only tasked with appealing to their constituents. In this case, citizens of the united states of America, not of Mexico.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Us Christians vs those scary Muslims</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christian identity was definitely also a component of Trump&#39;s campaign and optics, as identity politics formally, but I would argue this was the least focused on component of all. It was pushed more than Democrat representatives push it, but compared to the typical Republican bible thumping, it was very modest IMO. Put the Trump and Bush campaigns side by side in this regard. Incomparable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a dem could be centrist on some issues and still be credible. The problem is Hillary went left on all the superficial issues like identity politics, but kept her Washington Consensus views on everything else, especially with foreign policy.

It seems logical someone on the left could make waves by saying they intend to reallocate some military budget towards other programs and do easy shit like legalize weed, and it won&#39;t cost anything. There&#39;s also actual solutions that can be made to immigration aside from the ridiculous &quot;abolish ICE&quot; crap which is laughably not even targeting the correct agency (CBP). </p>

<blockquote>

She describes herself as centrist but her platform is extremely left and brazenly progressive. 
It’s like saying trump is a moderate republican. The point is you think using a pendulum of extremes to correct issue you see. I must vote for extreme policy change for the this issue using far right or left politicians. Centrist only works when people are happy with the situation on both sides but have only a few issues they want corrected. Society is fractured after Obama’s presidency not because he wasn’t a good or bad president just that POC/women believed that now only women and POC are going to be president based off merit and not have to earn that spot. The reality is these leftists are acting crazy and spazzing out while people didn’t like Obama’s policies voted to change them. Obama’s has some forced ideas that didn’t work like universal healthcare and he did some good things too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sad thing about this all is the child like behavior of both the left and the right. Obama’s years had been as smug and pompous as you can get towards the other half of the country. Now the right is acting the same way while the left collectively loses it mind point is if you dish it out you should be able to take it!</p>

<p>1) Yes people are saying that securing borders is racist. I have personally encountered this viewpoint on a regular basis. </p>

<p>2) Implying that many of the people who come to the US though the southern border may have criminal records isn&#39;t racist. Many of the people coming from the south are coming from places like Honduras and Guatemala, places that have incredible crime rates. Now if someone is actually racist (and I agree many of Trumps base fit that description) hears this the very simplistic racist version gets twisted into &quot;Mexicans are rapists&quot;. Obviously its absurd to make a blanket judgment against entire ethnic groups. I don&#39;t think Trump is so stupid that he actually thinks everyone south of the border is some kind of criminal. The problem is when people come in undocumented we have no idea who is here and what their criminal background is. This is a problem for obvious reasons.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with all that you recommended. I know the separating children policy was because of the chance that the child could be in danger, and there are instances where that is necessary, but not EVERY child as Trump was doing. That was a bit extreme, and he allowed it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point of enforcing the separation the way they did was to discourage people bringing kids specifically to avoid being detained. What <em>was</em> happening in many cases is when you got caught crossing with a child you&#39;d be released <em>into</em> the US and given a court date. So guess how many people decided to show up to that court date? So the idea was to remove the incentive to bring children because it makes them into a commodity. This is also why there was so much speculation about adults bringing kids that aren&#39;t theirs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are all kinds of cases and no blanket situation exists that describes everyone trying to come to the US. Some are economic migrants who think there are better opportunities here some may actually need asylum, others might be criminals working for cartels... we don&#39;t know anything about them if they cross in secret. Sneaking in is a crime so automatically your first interaction with the US gov is breaking the law.... not a good start. What I am saying is present yourself to border security if you have a valid claim for asylum. Do not attempt to cross in secret with kids in tow.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not in the same world as us, no. He ran on opposing identity politics and intersectionality in general, which the left&#39;s identity politics are based off of. Racism isn&#39;t an identity, sexism isn&#39;t an identity, and xenophobia isn&#39;t an identity. Trump&#39;s platform was not racist. It was not sexist. It was not xenophobic. Trump objectifies women heavily, I&#39;ll concede that. He has some serious character flaws. A lot of conservatives were actually upset about Trump&#39;s travel ban for the middle east. It didn&#39;t go far enough and didn&#39;t include some of the most radical countries in the middle east, because we&#39;re allies with those backwards countries. It&#39;s not xenophobic to recognize that the most radical variants of Islam exist in the middle east, and to want to keep violent religious fundamentalists out of our country. It&#39;s not sexist to conform your views on feminism to scientific literature. The wage gap is not scientifically supported. It is not racist to not support Black Lives&#39; Matter, or to oppose measures like affirmative action etc. Trump is many things. He&#39;s got no tact, and he is obviously ill prepared to address many issues which face our nation. I didn&#39;t vote for the guy, but to say he ran on racism, sexism, and xenophobia, is propaganda.</p>

<p>Belligerent morons are attracted to all kinds of people, but that doesn&#39;t make those people they are attracted to, racist, xenophobic, or sexist. There are belligerent idiots the world over, and yes, many of them voted for Trump.  That does not make Trump&#39;s platform belligerent and racist. Many of them voted for Hillary, too, and unlike Trump, she was very outward with her platform&#39;s alignment with those belligerent idiots and the intellectually bankrupt ideologies they espoused.</p>

<p>Gee, I wonder why feminists, gender studies students, and intersectionality professors don&#39;t appeal to sexists and racists? Well, I suppose sometimes they do, like when Drexel AP George Ciccariello-Maher asked for white genocide for Christmas. The left has different kinds of belligerent people, mostly people that reject science wholesale when it contradicts their ideology, as well as the very fundamental philosophical foundation of western philosophy. Truth doesn&#39;t matter to the liberal side of America. Truth has been obfuscated and replaced with divisive rhetoric and declarations of the death of God, a post modernist inquiry into what extent mankind can be molded to the exclusion of logic and science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, but the left became hyper radicalized in just two short years leading up to Trump&#39;s election, and in the year since he took office. I don&#39;t see how the Dems can recover from this one. They&#39;ve pissed off both the far left for what they did to Bernie, and the right and moderates for kow towing to identity politics and radical beliefs.</p>

<p>and a president who ran on a muslim ban</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Countries where travel was banned:</p>

<p>Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia (IMO not far enough). These are all countries with large populations of what I would consider very conservative Muslims with beliefs and worldviews incompatible with the West. These Muslims are nothing like the Muslim populations which have been in Europe for hundreds and in some cases thousands of years. These countries also have large refugee populations, of just about every demographic mix you can think of;young people, old people, skilled laborers, unqualified workers, criminals, good citizens etc. it&#39;s a mixed bag, an unvetted mixed bag.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>building a giant wall to keep out rapey Mexicans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drones would have probably been more cost effective, but there&#39;s nothing wrong with securing the border, especially when you have mass illegal immigration like we do in the U.S. I love most Mexican immigrants, illegal or not. They&#39;re such hard working people, and they come from a rich, beautiful culture. I&#39;d like to make room for as many of them as possible, legally, in a way that is controlled and regulated, like how most developed countries operate. There are criminals from all over the world getting into our country (mostly central and south America, but not exclusively), and they are extending the arm of dangerous cartels into America, which should alarm you. People living in the border states already know what this is like.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No I&#39;m talking about the brainwashed propaganda you espoused above about Trump. Hillary use the same identity politic tactics on Trump and Bernie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So both sides these days seem to point to the other team and say oh my lordy, look at how radical that team has gotten.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of radicalization actually happening and it is a real issue. Look at Iowa&#39;s abortion laws. That shit should concern anyone moderate.</p>

You&#39;re one of two kinds of people that self identify as being &quot;on the left&quot;. There&#39;s Clintonite morons and then there&#39;s social democrat morons. Social Democracy is as close to Democratic Socialism as Libertarianism is to anarchy. In principle there&#39;s a big difference, in practice all it takes is time and the right crises to devolve. There&#39;s a problem with pinning your place down on a one dimensional political spectrum. A person&#39;s mode of being should be far too complex for those kinds of simple classifications.</p>

<p>What the heck?? 
Clinton isn&#39;t remotely economically left wing, she was secretly pro-TPP and an obvious corporatist wallstreet shill. </p>

<p>Why are you calling social democrats morons? Social democrat FDR essentially created the middle class. NEOliberalism then destroyed much of it.  Also, true anarchism tends to be left libertarian, not that horseshit far right libertarian &quot;Libertarian party&quot; garbage ideology (gutting social programs + muh &quot;all tax is theft&quot; trojan horse and lol @ pro-TPP Gary Johnson).</p>

<p>No one is claiming the political spectrum is perfect (old one axis version sucks ass, two axis one is decent). Why so hostile and pushing strawmen?</p>

<p>Stop calling it radical left when you really mean SJW.
Third wave feminists cheered on by the NEOliberal establishment are not &quot;the left&quot; or &quot;radical left&quot;,
they&#39;re just brainwashed SJW morons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that the liberals here have decided to try a new tactic of pretending that they are non-partisan and just being &#39;objective&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that the only people that ever claim to be independent or non-partisan are liberals. Not just liberals, but the most extreme of the liberals. The communist and socialist supporters. The anti-fa violence supporters.</p>

<p>and yet, here they are gaslighting everyone and pretending as if they are non-partisan. Go check out their comment history.</p>

<p>You can say one thing for conservatives: you likely won&#39;t ever hear one claiming to be non-partisan because that is dishonest. Dishonesty comes naturally on the left. They justify lying as a means to achieve their goals. They lie as if it is second nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Republicans vs those damn Democrats</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not going to try and argue with this one, because party affiliation is the one identity which has been consistently woven into identity politics in America longer than any other, I&#39;d say since the founding of our nation. I just assumed we were exempting this since virtually no president has ever been elected without it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Us workers vs those damn welfare queens</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not considered a part of identity as framed within identity politics. Type of occupation, yes. Whether you abuse welfare or not isn&#39;t really an identity, which is how that was articulated in his campaign.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Us true red blooded Americans vs those damn Mexicans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Status as to whether you are a legal resident in our country is not an attribute of identity politics, which is how this was articulated in Trump&#39;s campaign. Politicians are only tasked with appealing to their constituents. In this case, citizens of the united states of America, not of Mexico.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Us Christians vs those scary Muslims</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christian identity was definitely also a component of Trump&#39;s campaign and optics, as identity politics formally, but I would argue this was the least focused on component of all. It was pushed more than Democrat representatives push it, but compared to the typical Republican bible thumping, it was very modest IMO. Put the Trump and Bush campaigns side by side in this regard. Incomparable.</p>
