       The reason we don't have a rover on the moon but we have one on mars is because Greenland looks a lot more like mars than the moon.

       I don't know if we landed on the moon, and I don't claim to know either way. All I say is that... With JFK delivering a speech stating that the US would go to the moon by the end of the decade, while in a tense race with Russia... There MINIMALLY had to be a contingency plan to fake it, if they needed to.

       No. Not on it's own.

       The landscape of the first landing site was identical in topography to a recent Japanese 3D map from an orbiter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't seem likely that the Japanese faked their mission and data just to cover for the US?  I guess it's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe that Kubrick could have had detailed topographical foreknowledge of the landing site, nor anyone else at the time, except maybe .. Aliens? =:)

       Good question. Does this alone make you think we must have landed on the Moon? So you think Russia announces publicly all the other secrets / lies they know? Curious to understand your reasoning here.

       How does NO one find it interesting how there is an obvious lack of critical data which SHOULD have tracked those persons whose body left our atmosphere. One might consider these persons travelled there nearing 60 years ago, and I do not recall any reports regarding bone density, carcinogenic radiation exposure, or how 30/40/50/60 years have treated persons who stepped foot on another interstellar landmass.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been regarded how moon dust is near catastrophic (itâ€™s said even the fake stuff will give you cancer....yet the government gave some to a shit ton of people and nations....then when some of it started to be understood to be fakes, they want it back); yet not much to nothing is readily found reflecting the bodies and the after effects of leaving Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       No....nothing fishy at all.

      <p>
       The problem with seeing the footprints and flag is that the telescope can see very well, but the resolution Hubble offers is still much bigger and can't render the surface items very well, and they appear pixelated af. The smallest thing the Hubble can look at is something like 30 square meters or so, so you can imagine the visibility is pretty bad. We have the LRO to take pictures (link above).
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't see a flag from Apollo 11, as the astronauts that went have claimed it was blown over by rocket exhausts upon them leaving.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also loads of stuff sent up there, including Lunar Laser Ringing experiment reflectors.

       Yes, I think the point was not that Hubble specifically should deliver such images but rather that today's technology should be more than capable of doing so. The link you provided actually had shots of landing sites and you can even look at different lighting, very interesting!

       Yeah, as I said, it's powerful as far as telescopes go right now, but it's still too far away to give a good rendered image - 30square meters is the minimum that it can visibly recreate, i.e. anything smaller is very jpeg in quality.

       I asked because I was genuinely curious.  Just because we are in a conspiracy subreddit doesn't make the question
       <strong>
        ANY LESS VALID
       </strong>
       ... 
.

       I have seen these pictures and they
       <strong>
        do not
       </strong>
       confirm anything.  They can read my license plate on google maps.  So easily they have to blur it.  The greatest achievement in the history of mankind (that we know of, the pyramids are pretty awesome) only has these shitty photos as proof??

       Also, something else that is bugging me... You need to get off your high horse.  You
       <em>
        are in the conspiracy
       </em>
       subreddit. You complain about biased responses before any responses have come in... You are making assumptions about the sub and the people all the while you're complaining the sub is biased... Do you not see the problem with that?  The first reply that doesn't like your reply probably confirms your suspicions, it's called

       First off my friendo, relax. It wasn't anything to do with confirmation bias or any kind of high horse, I've just lurked enough around here to know this will get downvoted because it differs from the general opinion, and that's how it works (here and
       <em>
        everywhere else
       </em>
       on Reddit), I've accepted it, it wasn't aimed to be a complaint per se, more of an observation. Just like this will (if anyone sees it because actual days have passed).
      </p>

       Second off - saying "they can read my license plate on Google Maps, but can't see the moon from up close" is kind of redundant - it is probably because Google Maps have a bunch of cars with actual cameras going around taking pictures, and the Moon is rather further away and has no cars going around it. The link provided above shows much clearer pictures. Google Earth's photos are taken from satellites around Earth, which we don't have around the Moon.

       The LRO operates at an altitude of 50km and returns images of resolution 0.5 metres/pixel. The privately owned GeoEye-1 satellite for example has perfectly resolved cars and even individual people at 0.5 m/pixel, in colour, through an atmosphere, and from an altitude 14 times higher up than the LRO. If NASA had installed a similar camera we would be seeing a resolution of 3 cm/pixel and this would allow us to see the hardware in great detail â€“ assuming that itâ€™s there. We would also be able to see the landscape in great detail and compare it to the Hasselblad images. Since the landscape had never been officially photographed at that resolution prior to the Apollo missions, a match between the two sets of images would provide a good test of Apolloâ€™s authenticity. Cant do that or people would see the fakery. We've got satelites now that can read your drivers licence from space. NASA puts a potato camera around the moon and smudges and blocks are said to be the apollo landers, especially with todays photoshop technology.

       Technology was able do it then but can't do it now for a fraction of the cost and effort?

       Sorry, I don't buy it. None of the evidence is convincing, the photos look like bullshit I could make in my freetime, and everything was apparently destroyed in the 70s.

       â€œFormerÂ PresidentÂ Bill ClintonÂ in his 2004 autobiography,Â My Life, states: "Just a month before, Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had left their colleague, Michael Collins, aboard spaceship Columbia and walked on the moon...The old carpenter asked me if I really believed it happened. I said sure, I saw it on television. He disagreed; he said that he didn't believe it for a minute, that 'them television fellers' could make things look real that weren't. Back then,Â I thought he was a crank. During my eight years in Washington, I saw some things on TV that made me wonder if he wasn't ahead of his timeÂ â€œ

       Yes, it would have to be a telescope / satellite / orbiter custom-built to capture the Moon's surface, and it seems like that would be totally doable and scientifically valuable.
