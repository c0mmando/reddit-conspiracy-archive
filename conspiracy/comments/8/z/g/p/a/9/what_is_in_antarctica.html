    <div class="md"><p>Things underground. From prior eras (ages). There&#39;s enough for me to believe something pretty big is there, after reading Byrd&#39;s account/trek, researching all the available science and speculation, studied topography and pics, and of course all the movies/docus &quot;suggesting&quot; similarly some sort of massive network of underground alien/spacecraft bases, all undercover of the white wasteland of mountains, ice fields and runways and large bases. I&#39;d love to spend a year down there with a plane, snowcat, sleds, etc. I&#39;ve been many places.. It would be the trip that I would be the most excited/nervous to do, maybe of all time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny because I&#39;ve been thinking this lately as well. Just think about it like this. Nor you or anyone you know has traversed Antarctica. A geology professor of mine has been there before but they were restricted to a certain area. I think there&#39;s something there that the collective powers of the world don&#39;t want the masses knowing about. Could be anything. Ancient ruins, strange animals, testing for whatever, aliens (terrastrial and extraterrestrial), etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is largely my feeling. It&#39;s so strange that before ww2, all the nations were colonizing and claiming different parts of Antarctica, but after ww2 it was set aside and colonization was banned. Did they find something? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, sorry my dude, I meant that the guy who wrote the journal has to prove the stuff he&#39;s saying. </p>

<p>If we consider things the other way around, that the burden of proof is on those who claim fakery on an account, this can dangerously lead to accepting non-sense. 
For example, if I write a book about how I discovered unicorns or won the lottery, but don&#39;t have any proof behind to support it, don&#39;t you think claiming it to be false until sufficient proofs are gathered to be the most sensitive way to go? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reasons any of the colonial nations would just leave any area on earth untainted are:
1) Antartica is a wasteland of ice and snow with no valuable natural resources.</p>

<p>2) Whatever or who ever there is too powerful and advanced for them to take over. Like they did the rest of the known world.</p>

<p>If Exxon wants knows there is oil to be fracked in your backyard, they will be able to get to it eventually via imminent domain or just buying you out. None of the corporations have even tried to get the governments to let them go to Antarctica. If they try they will be turned back by the joint naval forces stationed there. Antarctica is the only land in the world not claimed by a nation or private company/individual. Why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what sometimes blows my mind like there is a guy just walking around somewhere who knows antarcticas deepest secrets, like whatever is happening in Antarctica isn&#39;t just some imaginary internet land thing it&#39;s actually there right now.</p>

<p>Same with 9/11 there are people that know, I bet some of the people trapped in the towers seen something weird before it collapsed, like they were right there and know exactly what went down but aren&#39;t here to tell us. Maybe someone who died on the floors that got hit seen a missile rather than a plane.</p>

<p>Even the universe, the most mind boggling thing (more than how did it start imo) is what&#39;s on the other side of our expanding bubble? But whatever is on the other side is there right now. Somewhere a billion light years away is a little planet we don&#39;t even know exists but it&#39;s just there right now orbiting its star as we speak.</p>

<p>Fuck me this whole thing is insane when you actually think about it!</p>

<p>This kind of stuff keeps me awake and I feel like I have no one that will <em>go there</em> with me. I <em>love</em> talking about the 1%; The leftovers of the 99 out of a hundred. I love talking about the one giant skeleton that was 350ft tall, about the Pyramids being a powerplant that could feed the entire world with power, or the evidence of nuclear explosions in the ancient world. </p>

<p>I like the idea but find it hard to believe.  You hear very often that people search for low-background steel (pre-nuclear) that has no nuclear contamination.  </p>

<p>If there were ancient nuclear explosions, they wouldn’t be able to pinpoint ~WW2 testing as the end of los-background steel.</p>

It&#39;s not ice floating on water or a big block of ice that reaches to the seabed and is full of tunnels.

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t talking about being a passenger on a boat, I was talking about hiring your own plane or ship to go there. Yes, it&#39;s hugely expensive, which is why there aren&#39;t lots of people around who&#39;ve done it. But if you have the money you can just sail down there and walk around as much as you want. Or you can fly over the continent. There is no conspiracy to stop people going there; it&#39;s just a very harsh environment that is miles away from major population centres and difficult to get to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please educate me on what TBTB means I&#39;m somewhat of a normie </p>

<p>To play devils advocate, since nazi Germany was somewhat more advanced in technology than the allies, perhaps they were able to make it to the interior of the continent when the allies weren&#39;t able to. Perhaps they had had to wait or did wait until later, perhaps they nuked (or tried) the remaining nazis.</p>

<p>Perhaps they have some sort of agreement with them. The nazis get their aryan ethnostate, the US gets to remain the world hegemon. </p>

<p>I dont believe any of this, I highly doubt the nazis still have a functioning network or bases, I&#39;m just speculating. Its fun</p>
