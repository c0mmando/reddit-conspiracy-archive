Anyways, this is a conspiracy sub so don’t understand how carnism hasn’t been brought up. Someone said “veganism is made up by the rich to keep people poor and to save the meat for them” or something. Seriously. Watch cowspiracy, carnism is the biggest conspiracy there is. Tons of science is paid for by the industries they support, like the egg industry saying eggs are good for you, schools feeding kids cows milk telling them it’s essential, ^ that’s the conspiracy. The government knows what causes cancer, if you think it’s just in the air, or Chen trails, tap water, or whatever, but not in the food that you eat, you should really reconsider things. Go against the status quo. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Meat does cause heart disease. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh, the Inuits, pre-introduction of the American diet had some of the lowest recorded rates of heart disease (and obesity) we’ve ever seen, and they ate meat and animal fat <em>exclusivly</em> upwards of 90% of the year. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s always people who eat animal fat who have heart attacks and stroke. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, it’s the connection between fat, carbs and protein. Fat &amp; protein is fine, carbs &amp; protein is fine, but fat &amp; carbs are not. People who ‘eat animal fat’ tend to also eat a lot of starches, crossing fat and carbs. Carbs are fast processing and get priority in your body, the fat just hangs around until it’s turn or get stored. Without cabs, fat is directly burned as a fuel source. It’s why someone going from the standard American diet can massively lower their risk of heart disease by switching to a keto diet (and even suppress type 2 diabetes completely. </p>

<p>That’s why both low fat and low carb diets work, becaue they isolate out one of the two incompatible types. </p>

<p>That’s not saying there’s anything wrong with a vegan diet, if you follow the same rule of protein + carbs OR fat, you would see the same benefits. But if you were on a vegan diet eating mostly fat + carbs. (Like... a grain and avocado  exclusive diet?) you could see the exact same rates of heart disease the ‘meat eaters’ have.</p>

If we’re simply going by that, then we should all be vegan once again since the SDA haven’t the longest life son ever recorded. Much like how the okinawans lived really long on veggies then really short when westernized. Thanks for the comment though and the details. I do a vegan keto for the most part but I’m not to worried about heart disease all things considered. Plus I don’t use oil - that’s what’ll really get ya as well.  Meat definitely is linked to heart disease we can’t deny that. Even if it wasn’t. There’s still heme iron, and the problems it causes in the bowels.  This isn’t really about the diet itself though, but how the government knows what causes cancer, and how they know the cure. And we all just blindly follow suit </p>

<p>Part I said? We came in, killed their food, then gave them boxes of canned meat, dairy and Coca-Cola. Same thing happended with one specific indiginus tribe in Australia (Sadly don’t know it off the top of my head) and they had the same result. Horrible heath, high heart disease rates and diabetes. Things neither native tribe had ever had before. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And seal. And fish. And elk, and potentially bear, but who knows. If it moved around they ate it. Whale would last longest, just because of how much meat and fat they got per single kill. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can’t respond to that because I don’t understand what you’re saying.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Congrats, as that is <em>extremely</em> difficult (and prohibitively expensive depenging on your locaton) <em>especially</em> without using oils. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that part, I’m just saying that I don’t think anyone on this subreddit is Inuits most people aren’t eating elk and blubber I’m pretty sure Inuits have a different metabolism to digest meat that no one else even has. My buddy lived there for years and his wife is Inuit and his two kids and he’s not in great shape. He’s trying to eat whole plant foods now. They also have horrible high suicide rates there and don’t teach the old school Inuit hunting methods in school anymore. The dynamic is totally changed. I’m not saying those are related, but we’re sort of looking into the pst here. Mic the vegan on YouTube has a good video on this ill link. I’m not passionate about this as a topic because I’m more concerned with American and lower Canadian slaughter houses and western diets. That’s what I think the government is using to keep us down. Diabetes and cancer are a business.   You mentioned they lived long which is sort of an appeal to nature so I was saying by that standard we should just look at the SDA (seventh day Adventist) group as they’re the longest living studied population and are mostly vegetarian and vegan. </p>

<p>And yeah the natural unsalted peanut butter can be expensive. I might make my own at some point. Avocados aren’t too bad I buy them when they’re not ripe so they’re on sale. Just gotta time it right when eating them lol they go bad quick. The rest, plants, I actually live on 50-60 per week so that’s not bad I was actually spending more before I became a vegan cause I ate a lot more sauces, plus I had other habits like smoking drinking drugs etc and vegans typically tend to avoid that too, though the two aren’t at all related. </p>

<p>That’s a conspiracy on its own, as they are the ones who came up with the Standard American Diet, from hallucinations that one of their members (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_G._White">Ellen White</a> ) had (who then worked with Kellogg to make corn flakes to... stop people from masturbating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don’t.  I don’t know anyone who gets it injected. You can take a weekly or daily supplement or you can just eat fortified foods. Like almond milk or vegan chicken, tofu, tempeh, seitan.  You can get b12 only from animal products now because it is from a bacteria in soil that eats cobalt. That’s the only source. Animals are injected with b12 as well. And their food is fortified. Plus doctors recommend that all humans over the age of 50 regardless of diet take a b12 supplement. Gary yourofsky for example has been vegan for about 15 years and doesn’t supplement at all and posts his blood tests online and has above average b12.  He gets it by not washing his vegetables. I supplement just to be safe. The only reason we don’t get it is because of the pesticides we use, and the pressure washing of vegetables. We also use toilet paper, before toilet paper people would get b12 from cross contamination. </p>

B12 wasn&#39;t even named until 1948 and not synthesized until the 70s.  So it&#39;s not so much a &quot;eat meat or how else can you avoid deficiency&quot; since it was first meat eating people who were the early deficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason is, B12 is created by bacteria in the dirt. because our food is sterilised, the b12 bacteria is killed off and we don&#39;t get any b12 from it. The thing is, this is also true for the food animals eat, and so they are given b12 supplements.

    <div class="md"><p>eating vegan isn’t as always as healthy as it’s advertised. all of their ‘replacement meats’ are full of gmo soy and shit. eating raw, with plenty of fruits and vegetables and locally sourced- or especially- ethically sourced meat of different varieties including deer and elk is probably the best option if you struggle to maintain veganism and rely heavily on processed garbage fake meat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. A properly planned whole food diet is obviously better than eating only fake meat.  Most gardein fake meat is always non gmo, almost every ingredient. You get a lot more soy by eating beef. 80% of soy grown goes to cows, not humans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man totally. Also the way the animal is slaughtered can affect the meat directly as when they’re afraid they release a chemical to make their meat taste bad. Check it out. This isn’t a vegan site either is the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations.  So even if the animal was “ethically raised”, how could we possibly kill them in a way that wouldn’t affect the meat on a mass scale like how cows are slaughtered.  I’m not saying we should, I actually think we should let them live.  But check out the article it’s pretty interesting:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the major dietetics and health organizations in the world agree that vegan and vegetarian diets are just as healthy as, and probably healthier than omnivorous diets. Here are links to what some of them have to say on the subject:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian">Harvard Medical School</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf">British Dietetic Association</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Well planned vegetarian diets (</em>see context<em>) can be nutritious and healthy. They are associated with lower risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers and lower cholesterol levels. This could be because such diets are lower in saturated fat, contain fewer calories and more fiber and phytonutrients/phytochemicals (these can have protective properties) than non-vegetarian diets. (...) Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life and have many benefits.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704/">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.dietitians.ca/Downloads/Factsheets/Guidlines-for-Vegans.aspx">Dietitians of Canada</a></strong></p>

<li><em>Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. With good planning, those following a vegan diet can cover all their nutrient bases, but there are some extra things to consider.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians">The United States Department of Agriculture</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Vegetarian diets (</em>see context<em>) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines1.pdf">The National Health and Medical Research Council</a></strong></p>

Idk what even happened I think it was a false alarm.  I think most vegans are probably pro choice because a lot of them are liberal. I’m a bit more conservative I guess. The bible says almost nothing on it. I would say it depends on the science. Like at what age is the baby alive. 1 month, 1 week, 2 months?  I just don’t know 100% so I remain quiet on the issue.

I was raised in a super pro-choice family and never thought twice about it, but ever since hearing more from the opposing side I’m firmly in the middle now, but still lean towards being pro-choice.</p>

<p>What was your last point about Crowder? He doesn’t seem to be very quiet at all on this topic lol. He’s one of the people that actually got me to start realizing the validity of the pro-life argument (if one believes it is indeed a human life, and not just a parasitic organism of the female body).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah totally ahah. As for my last point I just meant I agree with his way of thinking. He considers the woman’s rights but also the baby’s rights, he says at what age can the baby be considered a baby, when does life start, is it immediate, 1 week, 1 month etc. Since there’s no right answer he says we shouldn’t risk it and is pro life. I agree with him so far as that, but if someone showed me the science of “it’s ok up until X weeks” then I wouldn’t be against it.

    <div class="md"><p>Right?? I find the whole thing super interesting, but it&#39;s become such an emotional issue that most people can&#39;t even handle having a calm and reasonable discussion about it. </p>

<p>The science argument is what really got me. If a baby wasn&#39;t able to survive outside the womb at 7 months not too long ago, and then 5 months, and now even earlier... extrapolate that 30 years from now. What do we do when we have fully artificial uteri/wombs, where a fertilized embryo can be placed into an artificial environment (outside anyone&#39;s body) and a baby can grow and survive until &quot;birth&quot;? What then? </p>

<p>The fact that it&#39;s such a nuanced and difficult question to answer is why it is one of the most hotly debated topics in politics for decades now.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your take on people choosing to abort pregnancies of children they know will have severe mental or physical illnesses? That scenario is even trickier to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I honestly don’t know that’s a good question.  Like I know you can detect early on if your child will have Down’s syndrome so you can do something to fix it. Honestly if they couldn’t and it was just something like that, I wouldn’t have an abortion because they can still have a great quality of life. However, I have a cousin with severe autism like he can’t talk and doesn’t know what’s going on around him. It’s like being in a walking coma. There is no quality of life for him or his parents and hey had to send him to a special full time care place and it removed from their quality of life too and caused a lot of heart ache. So for something like that, yeah I probably would. </p>

<p>What you were getting at though about the embryos and stuff,  like hats precisely what kind of freaks me ou about AI. I don’t think a computer will ever be able to like. Feel or be a human, bu or scientists recently grew a neutron apparently, which is crazyyy. Hopefully it’s only used to help humans with brain damage and stuff like that.

<p>The real conspiracy is sugars and carbohydrates. They are in 95% of the foods in supermarkets, and the constant insulin spikes on a daily basis for your entire life starts to damage the microtubules, which can lead to most of the inflammation based health issues we are seeing more and more in old people.</p>

<p>Through all of my years of extensive research into just about every type of diet out there, the ketogenic diet made the most sense to me by far. Essentially, eat like cavemen. Evolution doesn’t change as fast as modern agriculture has changed our society. Cruciferous vegetables and meat. Plain and simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t support that kind of direction action activism and no real vegan should.</p>

<p>Veganism is a philosophy though. Learn the definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word &quot;vegan&quot; was invented because &quot;vegetarian&quot; was corrupted, as it now refers to a diet which includes all animal products except meat, and may or may not have any ethical implications.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to answer any of your questions as I know a bit about the issues, although I don&#39;t really advocate any more. This is a rare vegan conspiracy thread, so it really shouldn&#39;t be such a bother to discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that&#39;s called &quot;vegetarianism.&quot; It&#39;s still animal exploitation that results in the death of sentient beings, which runs contrary to the principles of veganism (why the word needed to be invented in the first place).

They&#39;re all bled out and tortured while they die, as you need the heart pumping to drain the blood.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about the vegan community as most of the advocacy groups work hand-in-hand with the industry they supposedly are fighting against. Direction action is equally worthless as you&#39;ll never get rid of the demand for these products by attacking the producers.

<p>The article is referencing multiple epidemiological studies, and even what happens when you simply cook meat. You can even just look for studies on heme-iron in relation to cancer if you want to be more specific.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>still two wrongs though.   </p>

<p>As someone who is feeling great on a keto-carnivore diet right now and having eaten vegetables their whole life, I strongly believe that the &quot;fat-free sugar fake food&quot; is why the US is so bad off health-wise.  Yet veganism still keeps an open door to the &quot;fat-free sugar fake food&quot;, were carnivory seems to push &quot;real meat is all you need&quot;.  So I think it&#39;s just two sides of the same coin.  </p>

<p>Do i think veganism is more humane in our current situation? Yes.  Do i think vegetable proteins are inferior to animal proteins? Yes.  </p>

<p>Whatever diet though, people get tired of &quot;victims&quot;, and vegans love to play that card just sayin&#39;.</p>

There’s a lot of vegan athletes too, I go to the gym but I’m nowhere near their level. Cardio wise I really like Rich roll I think he was the first person to do 5 iron mans in 6 days, for straight up beast mode I like hench herbivore because he’s also a nutritionist. There’s a lot of examples on YouTube, patrik baboumian is another good example, and 2014’s mr universe. They all just eat whole plant food based. I’ve tried vegan keto too it’s not bad. 
Fasting wise, for me depends on my work schedule really. When I do fast, I do 8:16 or whatever, like IF.  Sometimes for spiritual reasons I’ll just fast an entire day, but that’s not very common. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a bit on Rich Roll.  Super Vegan to the max.  He&#39;s a good example how genetics, good diet, and drive can do wonders.  The drive part is probably majority of dieters struggle with.  I&#39;d like to think that drive will allow you to have success in a plant-only or even a meat-only diet.  If there could ever be a square off between all natural plant-only&#39;s vs all natural meat-only&#39;s.  I&#39;d pay to see that. </p>

<p>I think my main gripe is there is just too much noise when it comes to discussing diet.  Fabricated, generic, funded, unfunded, colluded, biased, and they all scream &quot;hey this is the best&quot;.  I&#39;m just for people finding their own truths.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been able to do a 36hr and 72hr on the carnivore diet and that was surprisingly easy.  I just don&#39;t see myself being able to be satiated as long on a plant-based.</p>

I’m more doing this for the animals but for health benefits I’ll take what i can get.  I generally am the same as before.

<p>Another thing that mature r/conspiracy people should consider is the black magic/ritual sacrifice aspect of eating meat. Usually the animals are tortured in the extreme before being consumed. This adds to the evil nature of the sacrifice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Vegan&quot; can still include (and often does) LOTS of processed foods. I feel we need to be more specific: organic, plant-based -- as much of that raw as possible. I personally think eggs are on the menu as well, but... hate to admit it... they should probably be raw too. That&#39;s the ideal ancient diet, IMO. </p>

<p>Then you temper that, split the difference, with what your more recent ancestors ate. Like, ask your grandparents what their grandparents ate. And include some of that in your diet. For me, it&#39;s fish (Scandinavian) and potatoes (German/Russian).</p>

<p>Then learn about food combining / food sequencing. Don&#39;t try to digest two radically different types of food at the same time -- fats &amp; proteins + starches. It takes a completely different digestion for one vs the other.</p>

He has been eating more meat and probably had some success because of ketosis but that doesn’t mean that his heart is in good shape. I also wish he knew how to pronounce vegan. He says vagan. Additionally, there’s a guy joe Rohan had on who’s a “doctor” he’s actually an orthopedist who lost his licence and he did all meat and published his blood test and is literally dying.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure Jordan was doing keto for a few years before trying his new carnivore diet, which is what first piqued my interest (because I would have thought exactly what you did, and just chalked it up to him finally reaching ketosis). I&#39;m interested to see what his test results look like when he gets his blood work done and shares it on Rogan.</p>

<p>As for the other guy, I remember that podcast and also thought the guy was a little out there, but didn&#39;t really discredit his info. Personally, someone losing their medical license is no longer a deal breaker with me, once you realize how full of politics and bull shit the entire medical community has become lately. Not following the mainstream scientific dogma can have you cast out of medicine and academia.</p>

<p>Also, are you familiar with the recent research into LDL particle size as it relates to heart disease and similar cardiovascular illnesses? It&#39;s really interesting stuff. New research suggests that LDL particle size is a much more accurate identifying factor for being at risk of heart problems. The smaller the particles, the more at risk you are. With a ketogenic diet, even though your LDL levels may read high on the conventional cholesterol tests, your LDL particle size will be much larger than that of someone not in ketosis.</p>

<p>Fascinating stuff. <a href="http://www.edbatista.com/files/LCHF/1-s2.0-S0167527305011666-main.pdf">Here</a> and <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/intphys/Class/IPHY3700_Greene/pdfs/atkins/sharman.pdf">here</a> are two studies that go into it, but I didn&#39;t find the one I was looking for (on mobile). If you are at all interested, I can find it for you later. It&#39;s a much easier study to digest.</p>

<p>Also interested in any arguments you know of refuting the claim as well. Always looking for different perspectives.</p>

<p>Thanks for the links! I&#39;m checking them out now. I&#39;m also interested to see what his results are. For me, personally, it&#39;s always been about keeping as many animals alive as possible. But, there are a lot of people who know a lot about the health aspects and it seems that eating a proper whole foods diet is undeniably healthy. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible to be healthy on almost any diet though the body is crazy versatile. I agree there is a shit load of politics I work for a doctor and its unreal. That&#39;s like 80% of what they do lol. I had read its because his colleges thought he was way out there too, but whatever most people think that about anyone they disagree with.</p>

<p>I have also hear, mostly from the Drs who push keto (though Dr. berg and the other guy are both chiropractors so I take it with a grain of salt, and people like thomas delauer that it is the oxidization of ldl that causes heart disease). Anyways, lots of things cause heart disease, like high omega 6 vegetable oils. So, I try to do sort of a vegan keto, with no oils. But again, I&#39;m not like super concerned about the health aspect. I would say &quot;mic the vegan&quot; on youtube would be a better source, plus he cites everything he says and even presents the other-side (as unbiased as possible for him) if there is one. I&#39;m always going to be a little biased because lives are on the line</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not see those illuminati cards and veganism in it? Veganism is a ploy to further divide people, cause chaos, and cause severe nutrient deficiencies. The human body is not made to consume only fruits and vegetables. Most vegans quickly go back with most only last 4-5 years. It is not sustainable and people have become so mentally ill from it, they defame and destroy butcher shops, without so much as making any effort to improve farming conditions or farm practices regarding crops or animals.</p>

<p>No one should stuff their faces with meat. That&#39;s unhealthy and hurts the environment. People should eat a lot of fruits and veggies , eggs, and a little bit of meat/fish and dairy. That&#39;s a healthy and balanced lifestyle.</p>

<p>The NWO doesn&#39;t want anyone to be balanced and healthy. They want them mentally ill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love those cards. Lol bro I get every macro and micro nutrient I need every day. I just use crono meter and it breaks everything down. It’s not a hard diet. What makes more sense. The government wants people fat and unhealthy with cancer and diabetes on the standard western diet they market and shove down your throat? That they make billions of dollars per year and want to protect and pump out literal food triangles with meat eggs and milk on? Bro that’s the illuminate right there. Vegetables aren’t bad for you and they don’t subsidize them like they do with meat, to keep people down. If they wanted us to eat vegan every fast food restaurant would have vegan options. The human body is made to consume plants, not meat. Here is a peer review journal breaking it down. If we were made to eat meat why does it give us cancer and why do vegans live longer on average with a better quality of life. The card game got a lot right but just because something happens during the end times doesn’t mean it’s evil. It also predicted a lot of technology that isn’t evil, an increase of joggers, how is that something that’s meant to keep people down.  If you use veganism to keep people unhealthy then yeah it’s bad. But no one is advocating for an unplanned vegan diet. You can’t just eat potatoes and nothing else (though some guy on YouTube did lol) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s lots of studies that show the opposite. There’s lots of Japanese sumo wrestlers, but yeah they didn’t get that way from just meat obviously. They could eat potato and be equally huge. Meat can very easily lead to obesity. Have you not looked around you everyone’s obese. Sure it might be in huge part from the soda, the buns, and the fries too, but that isn’t the main focus of this post. Even wasn’t linked to obesity in any way, it’s still linked to cancer, and the death of animals.  Send me some articles suggesting otherwise and I’ll take a look. I’d love to see it.  I can understand why you’d say that what with people losing weight from keto, but that doesn’t mean it can cause someone to be obese. You can be obese on anything just like sugar. I know obese vegetarians. Like I said, I don’t really have a “beef” with meat, I’d probably eat lab-grown meat. My problem is people who push false narratives, if vegan can’t be some super diet,  I can’t see how meat is exempt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never once said “all meat is bad” you may interpret it that way out of context though.  I’m talking about the western diet. You’re acting like everyone is eating elk meat. It’s not all or nothing, but if you want animals to live, then yes it has to be all or nothing. Then we’ve got the other factors like cancer that hasn’t been responded to. Anyways, you are right about the quality thing. The reason why I said that you said all meat, is because you said “you can’t say meat leads to obesity” which blankets all meat, not just the high quality stuff. So to be specific then, lean meat won’t lead to obesity. Meat though has a lot of estrogen that does lead to obesity, and obesogens (and other endocrine disrupters) from toxins in the meat. Babies are being born with more toxins in the umbilical cords now and 95% of it is coming from animal food.   Ok, so again you are right, and I agree with you on the distinction. I just want to make that clear, I never denied that to begin with and for me again, it’s about the animals. Their lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not see those illuminati cards and meat eaters in it? The meat industry is a ploy to further control people, cause obesity epidemics and cause severe vascular diseases and cancer. The human body is not made to consume so much fat and cholesterol.

It is not sustainable and people have become so obese from it, they develop vascular diseases and cancer, destroy public health costs and the entire planet without so much as making any effort to improve farming conditions or farm practices regarding crops or animals. </p>

<p>No one should eat meat or animal products. That&#39;s unnecessary and hurts the environment. People should eat a lot of fruits and veggies, no eggs, no meat/fish and especially no dairy. That&#39;s the healthiest, most sustainable and most balanced lifestyle.</p>

<p>GMO&#39;s themselves are not dangerous at all, we&#39;ve been making GMO&#39;s for thousands of years by cross-breeding. Lab GMO&#39;s is doing the exact same thing; making an improved version of a plant by changing its genome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the human body needs more than just fruits and vegetables; it also needs grains and legumes. But if you balance that all out, you can have an ideal diet, at low cost, which tastes great and is good for the Earth.   </p>

<p>Now I eat lots of eggs, and butter, but staying vegetarian has been very easy for me. There is no rational argument for eating meat that makes sense; sure, people say it tastes good, but just because something pleases your senses and feelings isn&#39;t a valid reason to ingest it. If it were, heroin and crack would be good. There are a lot of things people enjoy that are bad for them, but if enough people around them do it, it somehow feels socially acceptable. We have a social tradition of eating meat, so the bulk of our population accepts it as normal without critical thought. And for people in developing nations, I understand the physical need for the nutrition meat provides; they don&#39;t have significant alternatives. But the developed world needs to outgrow its lust for flesh (and sweets); it&#39;s not sustainable, and our obesity and heart disease rates prove it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chickens make about 20 per year and sometimes eat them to regain nutrients because it takes a lot of calcium.  The hens we’ve selectively bred to be laying hens lay about 320 per year. That’s not natural bro and ones the demand for the chickens drop so will the supply. I could see a world in which let’s say there is 10 billion ppl, and there’s 5 billion chickens. If they were just chilling and not factory farmed like they are, and weren’t laying hens (the latter kind). Then sure we could eat eggs. But you’d only get 5 each per year. That makes them a commodity driving the price up. Where there’s greed there will be people bending the rules / nature. So we’d probably see the same thing happen.  These chickens are almost pumping out 1 egg per day. That’s crazy bro. Their ovaries get destroyed. The eggs get stuck often which causes cancer. And a lot of these chickens are spent after about 2 years. They normally live 10-20 years. Plus the baby chicks if they’re male get ground up in a macerator because they are of no use. There’s also a lot of inhumane unnecessary practises like burning and cutting the chickens beaks off, live defeathering, and they’re living in literal shit. There’s videos of chickens who have drowned in their own shit because the conditions are so bad. It’s not like we’re living in some vegan utopia right now where every house has their own chicken and a constant supply of some eggs. That might be something to aim for in the future, but the bigger question at hand is the way that were treating the animals right now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not read my comment lol?  The ones who make 300 per year are selectively bred to lay that many. We also feed them super high grain diets and take the eggs away to trigger them to make more. Normal hens “wild hens” lay way less than that. Like 12-20 per year.  I’m not saying that it’s totally out of this world, we’ve selectively bred a lot of stuff. Brocoli and bananas as we know them didn’t exist a few hundred years ago either.  But, that doesn’t make it right or wrong. What I’m against is the way they’re treated, the cancer that they get, and ultimately their death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes....When was the last time there was a significant population of &quot;wild hens&quot; that lay 12 eggs a year. People have been domesticating chickens for fuckin millennia. Who cares that they selectively bred them to make them more productive. You wouldnt have all these adorable dog breeds or varieties of delicous fuckin melons without it. Chickens are inferior creatures, a delicious bird that cant even fly and lays 300 eggs a year that are also delicous... most of which are not even fertilized and have no chance of becoming another chicken.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree on the taste lol I ate it for like 22 years, it&#39;s more of a psychological disgust. To paraphrase Dr. Melanie Joy &quot;Imagine you&#39;re eating a soup, and you say &quot;wow this is really good, what&#39;s the secret ingredient&quot; ... It&#39;s hearty, and tasty, you love it. The guest replies &quot;you take a cup of chopped carrots, some broccoli, some broth, and a pound of golden retriever meat&quot;. Now at this point you&#39;d (probably) spit it out in disgust. The taste hasn&#39;t changed, but you&#39;re turned off by the meat. This is what happens to vegans for ALL animals when they watch their food get slaughtered. Once I seen enough cows getting their throats slit and pigs getting gassed to death, I made the connection that none of these animals want to die, and that they are all in fact quite similar to dogs. The connection may be harder for some people to make, like those in Yulin who kill dogs already for their lychee dog meat festival. I would suggest watching Earthlings, so you can at least see what I mean. The vegan cheese fortunately is getting better. The daya stuff im not crazy about but theres a lot of good ones now, and I even make my own nut-based cheese. Cheese has casein in it, which vegan cheeses do not (intentionally) which is an addictive chemical that reacts to the same spot of your brain as heroin, so it makes sense why so many people can&#39;t give up cheese lol.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve seen the documentaries. Food inc, Cowspiracy, ect. and I get what your saying about our associations of meat. But I think we can agree that cows and dogs are different. Humans and dogs have literally evolved side by side. We have a physical connection with dogs. We dont really have that with cows, as they were largely domesticated to serve as food. But the main issue I have with veganism is that it claims to be this all natural from the earth kind of deal, but eating animals <em>is natural</em>, it&#39;s the most natural thing. Animals eat other animals all the time. Since humans are at the top of the food chain, why shouldn&#39;t we eat animals too? Granted, I defintly do not agree with mass production of meat (or non meat items for that matter),but  unless you have a decent income it is really difficult for the average family to eat an entirely organic, naturally grown, GMO free vegan diet. Add to the fact that I cannot have soy due to a medical condition and I dont really have a ton of options for meat substitutes. All in all, I really don&#39;t care that you, or anyone else is vegan. More power to ya! What I do care about though, is anyone else assuming they know what is best for me. Which, unfortunately, has been the majority of my experience with vegans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man I can definitely see it being difficult with an allergy to soy. I’m surprised meat doesn’t affect you considering they eat like 80% of the soy grown? Maybe it’s been metabolized enough that there’s no enzymes left though. Or perhaps you’re not allergic to the enzymes, just directly eating a fibre in the bean. Anyways, I don’t assume what’s best for you, but yeah I’m sure some vegans will just like tons of meat eaters do for me so I feel you on that one. For me it’s all about the animals. I grew up with the same split of love some eat the others. I just can’t bear to watch them die so I don’t think it’s my right to kill them. Some animals hunt yes but a lot are also herbivores. (That is an appeal to nature fallacy btw) because you’d also be justified in sniffing a stranger ass when greeting them, and raping people.  Humans aren’t really animals in that sense because we drive and fly planes. We’re not even psychologically similar to omnivores or carnivores. If eating meat was really natural we wouldn’t cringe at death. We’d also eat more raw meat too. We also are only on top of the sociological food chain. We have guns, that’s a societal thing, we couldn’t win against a bear in a fist fight. So it’s kind of weird to so animals kill each other so it’s natural, and then to say that we’re on the top of the food chain, when that’s only true if we’re armed. Hopefully that makes sense. I’m not trying to shut on your comment, just rebutting that point</p>

<p>Here’s a peer reviewed article explaining our physiology: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1312295/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1312295/</a></p>

<p>I wish it was cheaper man for everyone. I live on $60 per week which is extremely really cheap for me, cheaper than when I ate meat. Granted I do eat some tofu but I eat mostly fruits veggies and nuts man. There’s also lots of “raw vegans” but they don’t even cook or use spices which lol - not for me. I’m not eating a raw potato. That’s the government at fault, so we gotta create the demand. They subsidize animal feed which makes meat cheap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not actually allergic to soy, I have a reproductive disorder and soy really throws off my female hormones. Also, interestingly enough I&#39;m not a huge meat eater to begin with.  I&#39;ll have to disagree with you about the nature fallacy. Can&#39;t be a fallacy if it&#39;s true. Psychologically and instincually we are not like animals, you&#39;re right. But, I would argue that physically we are still pretty similar. Similar organs, similar digestive tracts (although I&#39;d like to point out that the digestive tract of a human more closely resembles that of a carnivore/omnivore than it does an herbavore) Also, I dont cringe at death. I was raised with A LOT of animals. Chickens, dogs, cats, goats, horses, fish, ect. and I was raised knowing that death is a natural part of life. That&#39;s not to say that I didn&#39;t mourne when my animals died, but I definetly understood that there is a cycle to nature. Also, I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re from, but I find it nessecary to mention that I&#39;m from Texas and I&#39;ll admit that my views have probably been shaped in large part to the community I&#39;ve grown up in. I also know plenty of guys who prefer their meat as raw as possible (my husband, FIL, and many friends eat their steaks still bloody) As humans, through our evolution (evolution that was fueled by distant ancestors eating meat) we have in a sense <em>won the right</em> to have an advanced society with guns, airplanes and cars. It is now through our advanced society that we are able to maintain our place at the top of the food chain. 
I buy and eat as healthy as I can. We grow a few veggies and have pet  chickens to get fresh eggs. I buy only local produce and meat when I can, I try to buy organic where it counts most but it&#39;s still an awful lot of money. I also have to partially blame that on veganism/vegetarianism becoming so mainstream. The citizens created a demand, and the producers now know that can pretty much charge what they want and people will still buy it. Side note: I really do appreciate your links and also that we are able to have a civil debate about this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahah yeah I couldn&#39;t imagine growing up in texas and then becoming a vegan. It definitely happens, but it&#39;d be a culture shock. I always picture an old king of the hill episode where Bobby eats like a 5 pound extremely rare steak and everyone cheers him on. </p>

<p>I have no problem with you having your own thoughts on our spot in the food chain, and I agree that the industries and society isn&#39;t perfect in regards to certain things. If we lived in a &quot;vegan&quot; world, as I commented somewheres on this thread idk where, maybe we could have all backyard chickens, that&#39;d be a lot better than whats going on. But thats a whole other debate and most vegans wouldn&#39;t agree with that I just want animals to stop dying. As for not cringing at death, I don&#39;t either, however when you see a cow&#39;s throat being slit surely you don&#39;t get hungry. Omnivores and carnivores would. If you can honestly watch Earthlings without looking away or pausing, then I applaud you. Or better yet, watch Dominion the new documentary. </p>

<p>As for one thing you said, it sort of goes against the article I&#39;ve been posting .</p>

<pre><code>    &quot;But, I would argue that physically we are still pretty similar. Similar organs, similar digestive tracts (although I&#39;d like to point out that the digestive tract of a human more closely resembles that of a carnivore/omnivore than it does an herbavore)&quot;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The truth is our digestive tract is way more similar, compared to our trunk size (shoulders to hip) to harbivores, and not omnivores/carnivores. It is about 10 times longer than our body instead of 3. This is why people with bowel cancer, crohns, ibs, and other stomach diseases are told not to eat meat. It stays in the stomach too long an even WHO acknowledges this in their section on meat and cancer. Physiologically we are closer to herbivores than anything else. However, I&#39;m not arguing that&#39;s why we should eat meat. My main point is not wanting the animals to die, so again I&#39;d refer you to watch Earthlings before closing the book on this discussion. Thank you as well for the civil debate I appreciate it.</li>

<p>Is atherosclerosis a disease affecting all animals or only certain animals?</p>

<p>Atherosclerosis affects only herbivores. Dogs, cats, tigers, and lions can be saturated with fat and cholesterol, and atherosclerotic plaques do not develop (1, 2). The only way to produce atherosclerosis in a carnivore is to take out the thyroid gland; then, for some reason, saturated fat and cholesterol have the same effect as in herbivores.</p>

<p>Are human beings herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores?</p>

<p>Although most of us conduct our lives as omnivores, in that we eat flesh as well as vegetables and fruits, human beings have characteristics of herbivores, not carnivores (2). The appendages of carnivores are claws; those of herbivores are hands or hooves. The teeth of carnivores are sharp; those of herbivores are mainly flat (for grinding). The intestinal tract of carnivores is short (3 times body length); that of herbivores, long (12 times body length). Body cooling of carnivores is done by panting; herbivores, by sweating. Carnivores drink fluids by lapping; herbivores, by sipping. Carnivores produce their own vitamin C, whereas herbivores obtain it from their diet. Thus, humans have characteristics of herbivores, not carnivores.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Workers in these industries have higher rates of ptsd than any almost any other job, plus there’s a lot of human rights issues as well. 80%-90% of crops go to animals and about 25% of them are harvested by children. So for us to all eat meat, we’d all need to raise and kill our own.  Granted, some people may be able to do this, but if we do then we have no right to point the finger at the Chinese dog meat trade, yet most people are against this. </p>

<p>I’m not calling you out, but I’d like to challenge you. Since you say you’d have no problem either shooting and animal or hitting them with a sledgehammer, then it should be extremely easy for you to watch someone else do it. When you have time, watch this documentary. If you look away, pause the video, or cringe, then I would suggest that you stop and reevaluate if it’s really your right to take their lives or to pay someone else to do it for you. For these animals, there is no pause, there is no look away. For the 60 billion land animals we kill every year through gassing, throat slighting, and more, this is their constant reality. There’s a documentary called Earthlings. This footage is older but is still the current practice. For brand new footage of basically the same thing, please check out “Dominion”.  I can get a copy to you if you will watch it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am very familiar with the chinese dog meat trade ( i am korean). I am all for these guys to eat dog meat. it&#39;s a part of their culture. hell i&#39;ve even tried dog before, but what bothers me is that especially in china, many of these dogs are stolen from homes and are not bred and raised for meat. secondly, there is this myth in asia that if you torture the dogs before killing them the meat tastes better. this is my problem with it. beating them to death, throwing them alive in boiling water, you name it they do it. Humans will always eat meat, all i want is for us to go and take the extra step to make sure these animals can at least die quick with the least amount of pain possible as ironic as it may sound.<br/>
I respect the fact that you want to challenge me, but i&#39;m a pretty avid follower in <a href="/r/watchpeopledie">/r/watchpeopledie</a>. death is something that interests me so i won&#39;t be looking away or pausing videos. i won&#39;t watch kids though, that&#39;s where i draw the line. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I’m against all of that too. Though death happens, there is no guarantee that we will always eat meat. Beyond death we can’t guarantee something like that. I have no problem with eating meat anyways, just the way it’s obtained.  If the animal died or if we had a way of cloning, so be it, but as it stands it’s a very cruel practice much like you’ve pointed out. I’m glad you’re against at least that part, I’ve spoken with many people who don’t care at all. I think you’d see death a little different if you watched earthlings that I linked and put yourself in their shoes. Humans usually aren’t innocent. That doesn’t mean they deserve to die, but that and your own impending death may be the reason for your interest. Animals however are innocent. They can’t understand morals the way humans do, and they can’t understand why we’re putting them through pain, dogs, pigs, any animal. I wish you the best and i hope you can see where I’m coming from, for the sake of the animals. Because their slaughter, is something we can control, and stop. That is power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you look at the subreddit, the comments usually consist of people being grateful that they are born in a first world country where a lot of these atrocities will never take place. i watch some of these stuff because yes it does fascinate me but also to know that there are parts of the world where human rights do not exist. we have come so far as humans but we have so much left to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Inuits have terrible health now bro. You’re talking about whale blubber. Are you an Inuit? If we’re simply going by that, then we should all be vegan once again since the SDA haven’t the longest life son ever recorded. Much like how the okinawans lived really long on veggies then really short when westernized. Thanks for the comment though and the details. I do a vegan keto for the most part but I’m not to worried about heart disease all things considered. Plus I don’t use oil - that’s what’ll really get ya as well.  Meat definitely is linked to heart disease we can’t deny that. Even if it wasn’t. There’s still heme iron, and the problems it causes in the bowels.  This isn’t really about the diet itself though, but how the government knows what causes cancer, and how they know the cure. And we all just blindly follow suit </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;loud-mouth vegan&quot; I call them first year vegans. Veil has been lifted and they see our entire food industry for what it is. It&#39;s absolutely disgusting and deplorable and you can&#39;t help but scream about it and hope others will see the awful reality. Check out Tom Robbins diet for a new america if you want. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTvrhQIKanc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTvrhQIKanc</a> - never read the book though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never met a single person in my entire life that goes around talking about how great meat is and how much they love it and how much everyone should conform to their personal diet. They just eat what they eat and go on with their life instead of making their diet a part of their identity. It wasnt even necessary to mention until vegans came along and stared shaming everyone for being a part of the food chain</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s lots of studies that show the opposite. There’s lots of Japanese sumo wrestlers, but yeah they didn’t get that way from just meat obviously. They could eat potato and be equally huge. Meat can very easily lead to obesity. Have you not looked around you everyone’s obese. Sure it might be in huge part from the soda, the buns, and the fries too, but that isn’t the main focus of this post. Even wasn’t linked to obesity in any way, it’s still linked to cancer, and the death of animals.  Send me some articles suggesting otherwise and I’ll take a look. I’d love to see it.  I can understand why you’d say that what with people losing weight from keto, but that doesn’t mean it can cause someone to be obese. You can be obese on anything just like sugar. I know obese vegetarians. Like I said, I don’t really have a “beef” with meat, I’d probably eat lab-grown meat. My problem is people who push false narratives, if vegan can’t be some super diet,  I can’t see how meat is exempt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meat is meat bro.  If it’s loaded with saturated and trans fat you’ll get obese like anyone else.  If it’s super lean, yeah I don’t know if that would cause obesity, I haven’t seen any studies.  Still has heme-iron in it, isn’t great for the bowels, and leads to atherosclerosis. You can’t claim all meat is good and then directly say that people should only eat certain types or qualities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t even about the health.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that meat and dairy companies actively lobbied and practically controlled all studies and commercials on meat and dairy. Of course those companies want to make the public believe meat and dairy are not only healthy, but &quot;an essential part of a healthy diet&quot;. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why so many people still eat meat and dairy, it&#39;s one of the biggest conspiracies there are.</p>

<p>And no, GMO&#39;s and pesticides don&#39;t cause people to be obese. GMO&#39;s aren&#39;t even unhealthy, do you even know what they are?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that&#39;s called &quot;vegetarianism.&quot; It&#39;s still animal exploitation that results in the death of sentient beings, which runs contrary to the principles of veganism (why the word needed to be invented in the first place). They can call themselves and do whatever they want, but there is no moral distinction between eating meat, eggs, or dairy—all these animals end up in the meat grinder. They&#39;re all bled out and tortured while they die, as you need the heart pumping to drain the blood.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about the vegan community as most of the advocacy groups work hand-in-hand with the industry they supposedly are fighting against. Direction action is equally worthless as you&#39;ll never get rid of the demand for these products by attacking the producers. You&#39;re just straw-manning by finding extreme and hypocritical examples of a thing you don&#39;t seem to understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am very familiar with the chinese dog meat trade ( i am korean). I am all for these guys to eat dog meat. it&#39;s a part of their culture. hell i&#39;ve even tried dog before, but what bothers me is that especially in china, many of these dogs are stolen from homes and are not bred and raised for meat. secondly, there is this myth in asia that if you torture the dogs before killing them the meat tastes better. this is my problem with it. beating them to death, throwing them alive in boiling water, you name it they do it. Humans will always eat meat, all i want is for us to go and take the extra step to make sure these animals can at least die quick with the least amount of pain possible as ironic as it may sound.<br/>
I respect the fact that you want to challenge me, but i&#39;m a pretty avid follower in <a href="/r/watchpeopledie">/r/watchpeopledie</a>. death is something that interests me so i won&#39;t be looking away or pausing videos. i won&#39;t watch kids though, that&#39;s where i draw the line. </p>
