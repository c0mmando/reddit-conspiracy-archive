       All you Americans worried about "Nazis" &amp; "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States">

       ", all I have to say is "Operation Paperclip". This is how "lies", "secrets" &amp; "compartmentalization" was developed in the 1st place IMO. 😜
      </h1>
      <p>
       Operation Paperclip was a secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely carried out by Special Agents of Army CIC, in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were recruited in post-Nazi Germany and taken to the U.S. for government employment, primarily between 1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders, of the Nazi Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary purpose for Operation Paperclip was U.S. military advantage in the Russo–American Cold War, and the Space Race. The Soviet Union were more aggressive in forcibly recruiting (at gunpoint) more than 2,200 German specialists - a total of more than 6,000 people including family members - with Operation Osoaviakhim during one night on October 22, 1946.

      <h1>
       To be fair, the Russians also had a similar operation called, "Operation Osoaviakhim"
      </h1>
      <p>
       Operation Osoaviakhim was a Soviet operation which took place on 22 October 1946, with NKVD and Soviet army units forcibly (at gunpoint) recruiting more than 2,200 German specialists - a total of more than 6,000 people including family members - from the Soviet occupation zone of post-World War II Germany for employment in the Soviet Union.[1][2] Much related equipment was moved too, the aim being to literally transplant research and production centres, such as the relocated V-2 rocket centre at Mittelwerk Nordhausen, from Germany to the Soviet Union, and collect as much material as possible from test centres such as the Luftwaffe's central military aviation test centre at Erprobungstelle Rechlin, taken by the Red Army on 2 May 1945. The codename "Osoaviakhim" was the acronym of a Soviet paramilitary organisation, later renamed DOSAAF.

       Yes... this is really great for people that think that trump is a Nazi along with his party when this was actually a de-classified project that had literal nazis haha now the left calls anyone who doesn’t want to say there’s more than two genders a Nazi....jeez.

       I agree, this country has been dumb downed a lot, that's how Trump was elected, Trump said it himself, he loves the

        poorly educated

       , the poorly educated bought the snake oil he was selling they actually believed Mexico was going to pay for a wall and low skilled good paying jobs were coming back to America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to be a grammar nazi, it's "no coming back", not "know coming back". If you're going to insult the intelligence of a populace the least you can do is not make simple grammatical errors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over a year in office, no wall, no low skilled high paying jobs coming back to America, sad.

       Eh we’ll have to see, some things take time I mean the wall thing I’m not a fan of or of trump but I believe America will get some good jobs out of it indeed and yes sorry, autocorrect on mobile. Some things he promised had to go through the senate, house or congress so he can’t possibly do everything and yeah I agree if someone voted him in thinking he’d be able to do all of those things by himself then yeah that’s the ‘ole snake oil salesman talk like you said

       Trump is blunt &amp; brash in style but keep in mind that he's a Master Sales &amp; Marketing businessman. That said, luckily like a successful businessman, he has demonstrated that he can be reasoned with &amp; can change course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once everyone gets passed the "shock" of this new style of "Freedom of Speech", stops insulting &amp; bashing one another for simply being on the other side, and has rational &amp; open discussions, that will make the USA much stronger &amp; united in the long-run IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fight to urge to be "divided, conquered &amp; controlled". The POTUS is not the only one that sets examples. The entire USA &amp; its people sets examples that other nations can choose to follow or not. Lead by example. Be a good example.

       Yes, hopefully this will end all "Nazi" baseless &amp; incomparable accusations at one another. I'm sure the German people are uncomfortable about their past mistake being mentioned over &amp; over again. Also, the Jewish people I'm sure don't find it amusing that people can compare the horrors of the "The Holocaust" with Trump &amp; friends words &amp; actions that are incomparable based on severity IMO.

       17 million died in the Holocaust, out of them 6 millions were Jews(not entirely sure). A lot of people died in WWII, seems to me like many people think that the war was just a hunt for Jews. Middle of the pack estimate is that over 60 million people died in the war.

       Thanks for sharing. It's lucky the Nazi's were stopped by the Allies or they would've committed even more horrific atrocities against everyone in the world that was different from they're plans to create a "Master Race". They even used "Eugenics" to murder their own that had undesirable traits or disabilities.

       Divvy them up? Seriously? Nazi scientists went to work in the US or the Soviet Union depending on which force occupied the region of Germany they found themselves in at the end of the war. Most German scientists were at great pains to surrender to the Americans and British and thus flocked to the west as both fronts collapsed in the spring of 1945. What evidence do you have that former Nazis worked to develop MK ULTRA?

       I read the wikipedia article, which while interesting only really related that it was a former Luftwaffe interrogation center that was taken over by the US following the war. That's not at all uncommon— it's exactly what we did with Abu Ghraib. What does that have to do with MK ULTRA?

       LOL ... just trying to be "humorous" about the "draft picks". With regards to "MK ULTRA" that's just another Conspiracy Theory in a long list of Conspiracy Theories IMO. For example, another Conspiracy Theory is the Nazis assumed control of the CIA &amp; assassinated JFK. Anyway, check out Alex Jones tweet &amp; dig deeper if you're interested enough:

       My post on  "Limiting Excessive GREED will Solve The Worlds Problems"  was taken down from the "r/greed" sub without a reason, so I re-worded &amp; added the contents to my own "u/extriniti" sub post "The Next Golden Age". If it gets taken down again, I will simply create a website with "IP Tracking" &amp; other tracking bots. This is why anything controversial needs "redundancy", so there is always a copy that exists.

       Well done. Since Paperclip has a paper trail it is harder to dispute. And oh, what a story. We paid Nazis to continue their research and shape our country? Some "victory."

       Thank you &amp; I agree that knowledge should be taught in a unbiased &amp; learning manner, so future generations learn to do better. Also, it would be nice to add some "Russian-Nazi" Conspiracy Theories to balance it out but the fact they took the Nazi scientist &amp; their families by "gunpoint" makes me think it was more "contained".

       Germans are definitely hard working &amp; intelligent in general IMO. However, an high IQ doesn't mean you're Wise. They were easily brainwashed by an Occult Cult (Thule Society) to create Hitler &amp; the Nazis. Hopefully, they have taught their children to be more loving &amp; humane, so they don't make the same mistakes.

While I like to keep an open mind, there's only so much that I really want to be truly "disturbed" about. Of course, this information should be available to everyone that wants to study it, so they can help mankind learn from their mistakes &amp; make a better future going forward.
