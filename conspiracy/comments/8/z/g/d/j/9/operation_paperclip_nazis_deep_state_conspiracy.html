<h1>All you Americans worried about &quot;Nazis&quot; &amp; &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States">Deep State</a>&quot;, all I have to say is &quot;Operation Paperclip&quot;. This is how &quot;lies&quot;, &quot;secrets&quot; &amp; &quot;compartmentalization&quot; was developed in the 1st place IMO. 😜</h1>

<p>Operation Paperclip was a secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely carried out by Special Agents of Army CIC, in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were recruited in post-Nazi Germany and taken to the U.S. for government employment, primarily between 1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders, of the Nazi Party.</p>

<p>The primary purpose for Operation Paperclip was U.S. military advantage in the Russo–American Cold War, and the Space Race. The Soviet Union were more aggressive in forcibly recruiting (at gunpoint) more than 2,200 German specialists - a total of more than 6,000 people including family members - with Operation Osoaviakhim during one night on October 22, 1946.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip</a></p>

<h1>To be fair, the Russians also had a similar operation called, &quot;Operation Osoaviakhim&quot;</h1>

<p>Operation Osoaviakhim was a Soviet operation which took place on 22 October 1946, with NKVD and Soviet army units forcibly (at gunpoint) recruiting more than 2,200 German specialists - a total of more than 6,000 people including family members - from the Soviet occupation zone of post-World War II Germany for employment in the Soviet Union.[1][2] Much related equipment was moved too, the aim being to literally transplant research and production centres, such as the relocated V-2 rocket centre at Mittelwerk Nordhausen, from Germany to the Soviet Union, and collect as much material as possible from test centres such as the Luftwaffe&#39;s central military aviation test centre at Erprobungstelle Rechlin, taken by the Red Army on 2 May 1945. The codename &quot;Osoaviakhim&quot; was the acronym of a Soviet paramilitary organisation, later renamed DOSAAF.</p>

<h1>To be honest, I can&#39;t blame both USA &amp; RUSSIA for wanting the Nazi Knowledge but it does explain many things about what is going on in the World today IMO.</h1>

<p>I agree, this country has been dumb downed a lot, that&#39;s how Trump was elected, Trump said it himself, he loves the <a href="https://youtu.be/V0Od7TcejvA?t=9">poorly educated</a>, the poorly educated bought the snake oil he was selling they actually believed Mexico was going to pay for a wall and low skilled good paying jobs were coming back to America. </p>

<p>Not to be a grammar nazi, it&#39;s &quot;no coming back&quot;, not &quot;know coming back&quot;. If you&#39;re going to insult the intelligence of a populace the least you can do is not make simple grammatical errors. </p>

<p>Over a year in office, no wall, no low skilled high paying jobs coming back to America, sad. </p>

Some things he promised had to go through the senate, house or congress so he can’t possibly do everything and yeah I agree if someone voted him in thinking he’d be able to do all of those things by himself then yeah that’s the ‘ole snake oil salesman talk like you said</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is blunt &amp; brash in style but keep in mind that he&#39;s a Master Sales &amp; Marketing businessman. That said, luckily like a successful businessman, he has demonstrated that he can be reasoned with &amp; can change course.</p>

<p>Once everyone gets passed the &quot;shock&quot; of this new style of &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;, stops insulting &amp; bashing one another for simply being on the other side, and has rational &amp; open discussions, that will make the USA much stronger &amp; united in the long-run IMO.</p>

<p>Fight to urge to be &quot;divided, conquered &amp; controlled&quot;. The POTUS is not the only one that sets examples. The entire USA &amp; its people sets examples that other nations can choose to follow or not. Lead by example. Be a good example.</p>

<p>Like that time when he stole money from Americans and had a judge literally force him to give 20 million dollars back to the people the crook stole it from.  </p>

<p>Mmmmm, I also love myself some thieves, crooks and conmen &lt;3. I hope Trump, his family, his friends, his business partners, I hope all of them continue to steal as much as they can from Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divvy them up? Seriously? Nazi scientists went to work in the US or the Soviet Union depending on which force occupied the region of Germany they found themselves in at the end of the war. Most German scientists were at great pains to surrender to the Americans and British and thus flocked to the west as both fronts collapsed in the spring of 1945. What evidence do you have that former Nazis worked to develop MK ULTRA? </p>
