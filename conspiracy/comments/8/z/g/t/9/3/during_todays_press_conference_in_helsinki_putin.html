       TMOR countless anti-trump leftist/commie nonsense subs saw the main conspiracy sub trending against their bullshit narratives the MSM says on Nazis deny, and they couldn't take it. So they had to try and come brigade and spread propaganda from "real sources" like fucking politifact lmao.

       It would be sad if it wasn't so obvious. Not to mention the CTR astroturfing. At least they're too dumb to do so subtly.

       At some point there will be too many coincidences. Q: "Castle Arrival Good" then the next day the Potus_Schedule twitter says at the bottom "Good to be back at the castle!". People want to take jabs about thinking critically when at the very least cant even admit that some of these things are suspicious as hell.

       When you make 10+ vague claims a posts you’re going to get one right eventually. Not impressed and I wouldnt think real conspiracy theorists would be either. Call him QStradamus from now on because that’s his equivalency, just a fraud.

       I’ve yet to see a claim that isn’t incredibly vague and seems like a stretch of connecting the dots. Not one. The Q guy posts so much shit that never leads to anything then occasionally loosely resembles something that seems like a cryptic hint, everyone hunks it’s proof he’s the real deal. I want to see some actual solid hits that are less cryptic than bible revelations of the future.

       Let me guess. You came to that conclusion completely on your own, and it had
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to do with the echo chamber here at r/conspiracy robotically chanting "Q is a LARP".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's painfully ironic how everything every conspracy theorist could have every hoped for is coming true right now, and THE conspiracy sub wants nothing to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's okay. The one's who have been waiting for years know what's going on.

       I guess r/conspiracy wasn't meant to know until the rest of the world learns.

       Ive never seem anyone mention Q on here unless they’re praising that stupid shit. I had to go to 4chan to see it myself and saw how vague and retarded it was. It’s a fucking white house staffer that created an anonymous account to rile up trumptards😂 it’s hilarious.

       Maybe because Putins claim was hilarious bullshit. Hillarys campaign in total only raised around 500 million. And 400 million of that was from some Russian guy? It was a silly statement that  it many people cared about because its drastically untrue. Meanwhile, many people were very much more concerned with Trumps actions today. These two stories are not equal.

       Not accusing you of being CTR. Part of their effectiveness is to spout arguments and logical fallacies that are then parroted by other people (similar to what the left has accused Russian bots and Cambridge Analytica of doing).

       suspicion, maybe. But how many fucking investigations has Hillary Clinton had in her name and how many turned into legitimate massive wrong doings, not even money laundering?

       I can count them on one hand, which is missing all of its fingers. It's the same amount of reasonable and legitimate evidence we have of OP being a pedo.

       with more than questionable founding are ignored because it's Daddy Trump and he cant do no wrong apparently.  And there are dozens of stories of his towers (which rich russians use to get "american" children", his casinos which somehow went bankrupt (how do you do that as a stable genius business man with a fucking casino) and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all very fishy and considering the current state of affairs of him and his public relation(s) with Russia, it looks even worse.

       No, they are ignored because Trump had absolutely zero political power at the time... compared to Hillary who was FUCKING SECRETARY OF STATE and Bill who was THE FUCKING EX-PRESIDENT OF THE US.

      <p>
       Jesus Christ, again with the false equivalencies! And again with the baseless accusations, as I'm very critical of Trump for many different reasons. But as is typical for such small minded individuals, everything is either black or white. "This guy said accurate and damning things about Hillary! = DADDY TRUMP CAN DO NO WRONG REEEEE!!"

       So what, 20 investigations or so and she always could totally controll them because of political power? But sure you got the smoking gun right there with QAnon or something. lol

       But ... right now Trump is president (maximum political power) and Hillary is literally nothing (0 political power). So it should be investigated right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if he turns up "clean" (12 indicted russians say lol'd) , he was only clean because of his insane political power, right? That's your own argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has power = must be guilty because he manipulated everything because of his political power (everything is Republican controlled!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Has no power = irrelevant, dont investigage
      </p>
      <p>
       So ... you totally fucking proved your own argument to be hilarious nonsense. You tried tho. It's the typical right wing bullshit "my enemy must be all powerful AND hilariously incompetent at the same time".

       It’s about priorities. Making it back page news isn’t the same as making it front page news and promoting it. It’s like when the media claimed to have reported on all of Bernie’s record breaking rallies. While technically true, it’s not the same when it’s a brief mention linked on the side bar for a few hours while Clinton gets plastered all over the front page.

       It is though. You can literally just google "putin 400 million" and you'll see several pages of media sources talking about it. I don't know where OP is searching from or what engine he's using, but East Coast Google is just showing me news articles and it makes me think he may be trying to stir up shit.

       I mean, there is undeniable evidence laid out that Russia has indeed attempted to undermine American democracy and to interfere in elections. And Trump still had a meeting alone with the person suspected of ordering it.

       You need to get out of your bubble more. The evidence isn't undeniable, mostly because the public hasn't seen the evidence. And if Putin is suspected to have "ordering it" he wouldn't publically invite Muller to come interview his suspected Russian hackers.

       An older example: “IP addresses can be invented, a child can do that! Your underage daughter could do that. That is not proof,” Putin said, referring to (Megan) Kelly’s five-year-old daughter. More bizzarely, Putin also compared the accusations of Russian interference in the election to “anti-Semitism and blaming the Jews.” Asked about Trump’s decision to leave the Paris agreement, Putin quoted Bobby McFerrin, saying, “Don’t worry, be happy.”

       Some more questions?

      <p>
       What are you, twelve? The evidence is in the indictments by a special investigator - one that is known to do amazing case work, with incredible integrity and success. Do some research and look at the success rate of indictments like this. They aren't just thrown around willy-nilly. They are used when there is an air tight case. Even still, you can still look at independent research done by journalist from around the world that back up every claim made in each indictment. For someone who subscribes to conspiracies, you seem oblivious and ignorant to what will go down as one of the biggest political conspiracies in world history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what bubble do you think I'm in? I live in rural Alabama, where the only local radio stations I have are conservative ones that only give information from a conservative point of view. And I still listen to them.  I still read any conservative news organization I can. Why? Because I'm an American first and always. I've never registered under a political party for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you really thing Putin is such a stand up guy and wouldn't 'troll' the world by inviting Mueller to come interview these hackers, well then, I've got a bridge you might be interested in buying.

       First off, the extent of Russian interference with America wasn’t known during any of Obama’s meetings with Putin. This was still a time where there was hope that Russia might be willing to play fair on the world stage. After the invasion of Crimea, I don’t think Obama had many meetings with Putin one on one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, he never had a one on one meeting alone with him without any other Americans present during said meeting. Hell, the CIA even has a rule against meeting KGB/former KGB alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And last, Obama never once praised Putin while denouncing America. That’s the big issue here for me. For a president who loves to say “America First!”, Trump sure as shit doesn’t follow through with it.

       You aren’t even saying anything. You’re either throwing strawmen around, deflecting, or what-abouting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, anything you’re saying now isn’t even relevant to this thread. No one mentioned Obama, and no one mentioned the fact that America interferes with things too. You did.

      <p>
       So maybe if you want to talk about how Trump has refused to defend this country and instead praise someone who likely has a large part in attacking this country, we can do that.

       I realize you're likely trolling, but I'll engage with you. How are worse relations with Russia, who controls a large nuclear arsenal, a bad thing? Less enemies who can destroy us seems like a win. We also know they are very good at cyber-intelligence, a tool that needs to be tightly controlled in much the same way the US and partners are currently controlling who is allowed to develop nuclear capability. Another factor is the race between China and the US to develop AI. China has a huge population to data-mine, Russia could be a valuable ally. Not a fan of Putin, he's a liar and a dictator and his people should overthrow him and install some form of democratic government.

       I'm not trolling at all actually. I dont want worse relations with Russia. O want them to stay the fuck out of our elections and stop trying to show discord in our public. If they stopped doing that, then I wouldn't have a problem with them at all. But since Trump only encourages them, here we are. Nothing will be done to stop them. Trump got more than they could have ever imagined with him. A guy who tears down our european allies, trashes NATO while propping up Russia. They must be ecstatic.

       I'm sure they are. Are you aware of how dangerous the situation in Syria was becoming before Trump was elected? The other candidate was in favor of a no fly zone, which Russia would have immediately violated. I am convinced we were headed for a conflict with Russia, Trump was just the right tool for the job. I don't like Trump or the members of his administration, but I think he wants to end our adventure in the Middle East, one way or the other. Russia can help militarily. Unfortunately, Trump is pro-export, he wants to become the world's arms dealer. NATO is basically the US protecting Europe at this point, those are potential customers if the US drops out. They aren't going to like it, but each country would be forced to purchase the weapons necessary to defend themselves. I'm curious how the tariffs would work out at that point. Are they going to purchase weapons from Russia? China? Trump's an asshole, but he knows how to leverage a strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust the intelligence agencies. They were willing to spy on US citizens without legal justification. They should be dissolved. That's not going to happen, but as they continue to try to control the narrative and manipulate behind the scenes they are going to expose themselves.

       Oh no! A no fly zone? Mea while Trump bombed Syria twice. I dont trust Trump anymore than our intelligence agencies. At the end of the day those agencies are working to further American interests. Sometimes that doesnt look pretty. But Trump is only out for himself. And that's why hes cool to side with Russia over his own country because Putin says nice things about him.

       Russia has been helping us in Syria, you think there's no method of communication regarding air strikes that were done to appease the public? Why would Syria gas it's own people when the entire world is watching?

       Trump has given me no reason to trust him, again he's a useful tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think Trump's stupid. I get it, he acts pretty stupid. He has some useful skills, primary among them is his ability to tell people what they want to hear. He also has no qualms about going back on his word, which makes it difficult to tell what he's thinking. That's a benefit in negotiation. He's interested in the long term economic security of the US. What are the intelligence agencies' goals? Aren't they supposed to do as the government directs? I don't agree with Trump's methods, but he isn't going to be in charge forever. He also pisses a lot of people off, which should lead to more participation in the elections.

       We dropped 12,192 bombs in Syria and 26,171 total in 2016. Two bombs I can think of specifically was the MOAB which supposedly was for ISIS I believe, but I cant be too certain about the purpose of that one tbh and the other one was a supposedly chemical weapons facility. A no fly zone would of def escalated things with Russia.

       Didn't he say specifically "I trust my Intel people." And when he said that I doubt he was talking about the FBI. There are 16 or 17 total Intel agencies in the US. How many other agencies have followed suit and stood with the FBI's position? Wouldn't you expect Military Intel to know a decent amount of Foreign countries yet they seem to be in Trump's corner IMO. Think about it Logically....why isn't any other Intel agencies publicly standing by FBI? If that doesn't strike you as odd then I don't know what would.

       No I saw the post about "my intelligence people" and you also used Qs slogan think logically. You guys out yourself when you try to speak like he does. I know you guys think the military recruited him to take down the deep state. I dont believe any of that stuff. The military is just as corrupt as any other agency.

       I mean you can pretty easily see if what trump does benefits America or Putin. Withdrawing out of trade deals that help us and our allies...helps putin. Threatening to withdraw from UN...helps putin. Calling NATO a foe...helps putin. Tarnishing relationships with our allies...helps putin. I’m just not sure how trump supporters dont see what putin is doing to us. If we are isolated and hated like russia, russia has someone who is on their side. Two strongest nuclear powers on the same team against the rest od the world would be unstoppable. What’s more likely? Trump is indebted to putin and he praises everything putin does to appease him and not get his blackmail into the open? Or putin is just misunderstood and The world unjustly hates him and that annexation of crimea was a misunderstanding, poisoning people is just accidental, opposition to putin dying is just confidence? Like I seriously don’t understand how republicans fail to see what’s going on.

       Exactly.  Nobody brings up how he refused to sign the TPP(that is a good thing).  He also just tried to stop the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger from happening, which everyone should be praising him about.  It's been proven that when monopolies like that merge, it's never good for the consumer.  CNN even hopped on board and started critizing Trump about trying to prevent the merger.

       Stop going to this shit every time. Nobody wants a fuckin war with Russia. We want a president who doesnt suck Putins dick so hard that he will stand next to him and side with him over his own intelligence agencies.   If Putin would listen to anyone, it might be him. But he would rather stand there and talk shit about our country and encourage Putin for interfering in our elections.

       exactly, i was skeptical of a cover up of him saying it but its everywhere just being claimed bullshit. lol either way sure they should talk about it but i'd see it as a way of fighting back against those trying to opress the US people. creating a shit show, you could tell they wre on cue with eachother because trump brings up the server and the emails as if it was relevant to what anyone wants to hear about.. he won, he doesn't get to keep beating a dead horse over this the american people deserve transparency not partisan agenda pushing. not answering is insulting to all citizens intelligence just sucks the trumpers are dimwitted enough to fall for it lol

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mr. Putin on Monday detailed on television a variation of some of the allegations that the lawyer, Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, brought to the Trump Tower meeting — namely that some of Mr. Browder’s associates had funneled $400 million to the Clinton campaign with money illegally moved out of Russia.
“Business associates of his have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia,” Mr. Putin said. “They never paid any taxes. Neither in Russia nor in the United States. Yet the money escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amounts of money, $400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton.”
Additionally, Mr. Putin declared, “we have solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions.”
Mr. Putin offered no evidence to support his claims about money moving to the Clinton campaign, let alone with assistance from intelligence officers.

       something like this? Have Hillary show all of her accounts and donors to the penny? If they didn't pay taxes on 1.5b in both Russia and in US, the only way to trace it is directly through her accounts.

       <p>
        So far, there’s no evidence that Obama’s 2012 campaign is accepting illegal online donations that exceed federal limits or that come from foreigners. He has returned high value checks from at least three people suspected of links to criminals.
       </p>

       It's all circumstance and assumptions. It's an interesting topic and consideration, but to walk around "Obama accepted millions from foriegn entities" is beyond absurd.

       it sounds like he's talking about this money laundering case.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Veselnitskaya#Advocacy_against_the_Magnitsky_Act">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Veselnitskaya#Advocacy_against_the_Magnitsky_Act
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On June 9, 2016, Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner in Trump Tower, which they scheduled after Emin Agalarov's publicist, Rob Goldstone, told Donald Jr. that she was a "Russian government attorney" offering incriminating information on Hillary Clinton due to "its government’s support for Mr. Trump". Regarding the meeting, Trump Jr. initially exclaimed, "I love it" but, in July 2017, said the meeting "was a waste of time".[16][17] Donald Trump Jr. said that Veselnitskaya used the meeting to criticize the Magnitsky Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also on or around June 9, prior to and following the Trump Tower meeting, Veselnitskaya met with Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn R. Simpson, ostensibly related to hearings that involved their mutual client Denis Katsyv, concerning charges of Russian tax fraud and money laundering originally uncovered by Magnitsky. The Simpson–Veselnitskaya meetings were denied by Veselnitskaya herself but confirmed by Simpson's lawyer. This has led to speculation from Trump allies linking the meetings to Fusion GPS's concurrent work assembling opposition research against then-candidate Trump.
       </p>
       <p>
        Veselnitskaya represented Pyotr Katsyv's son, Denis, when Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, charged him with money laundering.[9] Federal prosecutors accused Katsyv of using Manhattan real estate deals to launder money stolen from Browder's Hermitage Capital Management.[22][23] The Russian government then banned Bharara from traveling there

       They presumably have evidence that backs up the accusation it was those specific people. Perhaps it has something to do with our ally who claims to have watched them hack us.

       Primaries are a private party affair, not public. Second, if Bernie was so popular, why didn't he win the most votes in the primary? Third, Clinton's been a member of the Democratic party for decades while Sanders switched over for the election. Of course the party is going to be weary of someone who only became a Dem to win the nomination.

       It's false in the sense that with fracking, you're talking about something US scientific studies have proven has negative side effects including earthquakes.  THis is american studies... its scientific fact.  SO if RT covers it, it's impossible for it to suddenly be an attempt to undermine the US... that's simply rediculous.

       And giving third party candidates air time is equally retarded.  For them to insert that in an official document attempting to prove the russian conspiracy will always remain a red flag.

       Right, but what I mean is the indictments are treated as fact by the media and the public even though no evidence has been provided whereas Putin’s claim about campaign donations to Hillary is treated as false. In my opinion, both claims should be treated as false until the evidence has been presented.

       There's a difference between the two things that lends more weight to the indictments.  Unless I'm incorrect, there needs to be a reason for the indictment in the first place.  They weren't proven correct, but there was evidence presented in the first place to suggest a crime may have taken place.  Putin just made a claim with no backing, which doesn't require anything except a microphone.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During the course of the pretrial discovery, Simpson alleges that he began to learn about Browder’s history of “tax avoidance in Russia and we began to deconstruct the way that his hedge fund structured its investments in Russia and, you know, we gradually accumulated through public records, not all from Russia, that he set up dozens of shell companies in Cyprus and other tax havens around the world to funnel money into Russia and to hold Russian securities.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The pretrial discovery also found that Browder “set up shell companies inside of Russia in order to avoid paying taxes in Russia. In fact, William Browder famously said in 2005 at Davos everybody knows under Putin you have to pay your taxes, which is ironic because at the time he was being investigated for not paying taxes.”

       I think the concern is that last line "Mr. Putin offered no evidence to support his claims." If they want this claim to be highlighted, they need to back it up with evidence. At least enough evidence to warrant an investigation by the press. It's also possible that they have already investigated this angle and found nothing.

       I get what you're saying but correct me if i'm wrong dont all Intel agencies share info in one way or another? Meaning that there is a legal way for them to request info and share info back and forth. I think it would be naive to think CIA and FBI don't have access to PRISM or similar programs. The CIA drop a few years back showed similar capabilities.

       what are you even on about dude. the history of Google is available all over the place in black and white, if you have to spend all night searching for one single source the confirms what you already believe, that's not research, it's cherry-picking.

       might have been the sort of thing you were thinking of but it definitely doesn't suggest that Google was invented by the government, it suggests that obviously the wealth of information already held by Google is valuable to the government.

       Well....As an overnight ISP ENGR on a quite night I don't have much to do. TBH I personally am not convinced its a CIA/NSA created company but I do believe they have complete access to pretty much any tech companies. I was simply sharing a thought to strike conversation/discussion based off something I read in the past.  I was honestly hoping someone would of posted a similar source since the original person's comment caught my interest. Sucks that you cant even have a discussion anymore online without someone jumping down your throat. Whatever enjoy your day man. Nice talking with you.

       Also this article is an interesting read...since they are well documented some of the info in here does raise a few questions. Looks like googles early investors during their first year were connected to DARPA. I think that info is enough to at least spark a conversation about it. But again its speculative thinking.

       It’s pathetic that they’ll just toss aside how he is former KGB, murders political rivals, shot down a civilian airliner, invaded Ukraine, committed cyber warfare against us. But he mentions one bullshit lie against Clinton so hey, I hate Clinton so he must be telling the truth this one time. Lol, anyone who can seriously believe a word out of Putin is brain dead.

       Putin managed to out smart and outmanouver Obama every time they were at odds, even though Obama had 10x the resources at his disposal. He also emerged from those conflicts more popular, more powerful, and with greatly strengthened alliances to India and China.  He even got the second largest NATO military to cooperate in Syria and on a pipeline deal.  He's probably not retarded.

       Yeah Putin is an incredibly talented politician and at this point I dont mind. Probably Trump and Putin both understand that they have a higher chance of outmanouver alot of people by working together. Trump likes the Military and its power and Putin is licking his tongue for that world domination. If Putin shows he can work with Trump and the US then maybe EU might accept him and a collaboration might take place. Who knows, maybe Putin is our next world leader.

       That is why diplomacy is so important! And if Trump and Putin likes eachother it is not that far to imagine a collaboration betwen Trump and Putin, if they see they value of combining their Power that is a way for Putin to gain more Power and a way for Trump to exxert his will for Control and tradition.

       Probably not.  Russia has only the 5th largest army, and of the 21 major aircraft carriers on planet earth, Russia has 1!  The US has 11.  Russia could barely handle rotating troops in east Ukraine and Syria at the same time.

       China is much more likely to go for world domination.  They are spreading influence across the globe with their new silk road and  massive infrastructure projects.

       Yet Putin walked all over Obama 10x more and outsmarted him by 48.3%!  If we can assume that Obama is not retarded, then it stands to reason, using the numbers I provided, that Putin is even less retarded than Obama.

       Because if the News called out every lie a foreign leader spewed out there would be no end to it. Clinton's done. There's no need to defend her. Even now, whenever Trump mentions her they won't go any further than commenting how he's still in campaign mode or looking for some Democratic symbol to bully.

       What benefit is the lie?  You don't think FBI/DOJ  Mueller and team would ask to see evidence before agreeing to take them up on the offer? Even if they find him guilty they still need to extradition agreed upon.  Therefore what value is it for Putin to make up this lie?

       I meant Trump's cult. He literally has nothing to lose from this lie. He lies all the time. You talk about him like he's a fucking consummate, always-truthful statesman. Didn't he just get done saying he didn't interfere in the us election? Fucking christ you guys are desperate.

       Did you read Nunez "partisan" report that Democrats didn't want the public to see?  It's the report of the 12 hackers phishing politicians.  Mueller stole that information but do you know what he omitted?  That Russia phished prominent Republicans and Democrats.  Mueller took info from Nunez edited it and used legal language verbatim from George Webb's lawsuit against the DNC and Arwan.  The day Trump met with Russia they decided to have a briefing on national TV about things we learned about 6 months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats are angry at Russia and they should be.  They claim foreign interference in our democracy.  Then they want to allow illegal foreigners to vote in our elections.  Did you know Mexico citizens had manipulated more votes than Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, would you sacrifice your life to fight Russia over some bullshit politics?  See some of us are in service or have family in active service.  We don't want wars for profit.  We learned NOT to trust Intelligence Community since they lied about WMDs.
      </p>

       Browder will go down because of anti-money laundering bank regulation.  If he is truly guilty which most billionaires are frauds.  I'm not taking Putin's word.  I am saying the name on national TV with accusation alone will cause a massive sniff test.  Banks have to pay billions if the FBI find put he was laundering money and the bank did nothing about it.

-DNC stole bernie’s nomination in favor of hillary
-DNC sent bernie’s donations to hillary’s
-DNC colluded with msm to favor hillary, cause violence at trump rallies, get hillary questions before the debate.

        William Browder's AVISMA (Aviation Special Materials) scam:
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Documents in a little-known case suggest that Browder did what he decried at Columbia — stole profits. Letters, affidavits and other court documents show that Browder and his fellow investors obtained funds that were diverted via an Isle of Man shell from a Russian enterprise in which they had purchased a controlling interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The company, AVISMA (Aviation Special Materials), produced titanium sponge for a product used by Boeing airplanes. With partners Kenneth Dart, American billionaire and Dart cup heir, and Francis Baker, C.E.O. of the Andersen Group, a publicly-traded New York manufacturing and investment firm, Browder bought into AVISMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time of the American investors’ purchase, a large portion of AVISMA’s profits were being siphoned-off to the controlling stockholders through a “transfer pricing” scheme, documents in a subsequent court case show. A shell company sold raw material to AVISMA at inflated costs and purchased the finished product at below-market prices. The shell company then resold the products on the world market, collecting the difference for the majority stockholders. Browder and the other investors knew about the scheme; their lawyer in an affidavit later said it was what made the AVISMA transaction profitable.

       Clinton spent around $600 million on her campaign, so the $400 million claim is pretty silly.  If he was going to make up a story he should have claimed a more believable number like $10 million.

       eh in my experience they really really really really hate hillary clinton, so tying browder to her with a conspiracy they'll believe with no evidence, because its hillary so of course she did it whatever it is, is a smart move in trying to legitimize the maginsky act

       Conservatives are angry all over Facebook from what I can see. A lot of easily disproven lies are being paraded about to. And when you disprove them they move to personal attacks that are pretty unfounded.

       If this were true: Maybe it's deliberate. Maybe they're refusing to give Putin's bullshit unwarranted airtime. Maybe the US wouldn't be in the mess it's in if they didn't broadcast every lie Trump sharted into the public sphere in the lead-up to the election.

       I found this article by Bill Browder:
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin’s latest allegation that I donated $400 million to Hillary Clinton is so ludicrous and untrue that it falls into delusion. I’ve never made a political donation to Hillary Clinton or any other political candidate. It’s in the same category as other Russian government allegations against me: they accused me of being a serial killer; they accused me of being a CIA/MI6 agent determined to destroy the Russian government; and they accused me of somehow stealing $4.8 billion of IMF money back in the 1990s that was destined for the Russian Treasury.

       I recommend reading the articles I have posted as these answer the question better than I can.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So what really happened with Magnitsky?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See the above, the devil is in the details. Remember that the real world is messy and it's not a simple battle of Browder Evil, Putin Good, it's shades of grey.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Was he not Browder's lawyer?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He was his accountant for over a decade, not a lawyer. The devil is always in the detail.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Was he not imprisoned, tortured, and killed? And if so, why?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He was imprisoned and did die in prison but he was not tortured and killed on purpose:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A report by the Russian Public Oversight Commission for Human Rights Observance, which Browder links to on his website, does not echo all Browder's charges, but confirms that prison conditions were
        <strong>
         bad for everyone
        </strong>
        , not Magnitsky alone
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Prison conditions are not election winner or a high priority in many countries on Earth, just google "[Insert Poor Country Name] Prison" into google images.
His treatment
       <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/magnitsky-report-july2011.pdf">
        was awful
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mr. Magnitsky received inadequate medical attention and evaluations for the
differential diagnoses of his ongoing symptoms.  The neglect was calculated,
deliberate and inhumane.  He received inadequate medical evaluation and
treatment throughout his detention and on the day of his death this continued.  
There were significant delays on obtaining medical evaluation and treatment by
the prison authorities.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But one must remember the conditions were awful for all prisoners, this is what happens to a country after years of "shock therapy" following the fall of communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was arrested for taking part in tax fraud:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A central charge by Russian tax fraud investigators is that Hermitage's shell companies falsely claimed they employed disabled workers and invested in the local economy. Ponomarev said the two claims would cut a company's taxes by 40 percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2001, Hermitage shell companies Dalnaya Steppe and Saturn Invest declared on tax returns that a majority of their Kalmykian employees were disabled, complying with a law aimed at social rehabilitation of the disabled. But they hadn't
        <strong>
         hired anyone
        </strong>
        , since they were just stock holding companies...
       </p>
       <p>
        An important point, Ponomarev said, was that other companies had lowered taxes this way, but had actually hired disabled workers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If going for a tax rebate, make sure that you actually do the thing you are meant to do. If not, don't expect the tax-man to not hunt you down asking for their money, as well as breaking other laws.

       He's a sociopath businessman, you don't become a "protest investor" after making about $100 million. He's not Greenpeace or some Vegan activist. I'm just amazed so many believe his lies, I guess this is why propaganda works so well. Repeat something enough times and it will stick.

       Putin is even more of a liar and someone that will murder his enemies. He is literally what people suspect Hillary and Bill are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have two liars and you want to trust the one that gets far more mileage out of spreading confusion?

Or will you dismiss something 40 minutes after posting because you haven't look at the particular details of this case.

       No, here is the deal. I'm not doubting your claims. It doesn't change my view if Browder was a capitalist cut throat who took hundreds of millions from Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he was a total thief and scumbag that doesn't mean Putin and his oligarchs aren't equally thieves and scumbags.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the accusation about the $400 million in donations; there is no evidence either way. If something is produced then we can proceed from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The money being untaxed is a problem legally but not one that really makes or breaks the issue to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm unclear on how he supposedly donated and if he did if it was illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The overall point I am making though is they are both liars and to trust either one isn't spinning this to further their own agendas is naïve.

       They laid out the procedure, timeline, and methods they used to hack the DNC and others in the indictment. They have to show some evidence to even get an indictment from a grand jury.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a huge difference between we don't have the classified information that backs up the accusations and Putin just mouthing off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, even Putin said he wasn't sure if the donations were illegal or not. He just knows it'll get all the Trumpists riled up and distract from anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know Trump just walked it back and said he DOES accept that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

       Putin has alleged donations to Clinton, if you dig around there is some outline of how (procedure / method) and when (timeline). There's no evidence available to the public.

       Where did he lay out how and when it was done? Like I said Putin didn't even claim the donation was illegal. How is that exactly the same in your mind?

       I find Putin's "accusation" shallow and of little use. The indictments give the public a glimpse into what was done and how for the first time. Of course further evidence is needed; but this isn't the end of the investigation. So it isn't time to show all the cards yet.

       Just wanted to ask, what type of proof will it take from Mueller? Is there anything more he could have added to indict the 12 Russians? I am not trying to argue about anything, not trying to prove a point either. Truly just a question.

       It's a very tricky one to answer as well :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Amongst other things Mueller has done .. Bear in mind that on Iraq Mueller testified in congress (on oath I believe) that "Baghdad has failed to disarm its weapons of mass destruction, willfully attempting to evade and deceive the international community" which I believe he knew was a lie at the time. That didn't just kill a lot of Iraqis, it put US service men and women in danger as well, and some of them came home in boxes. But it furthered the then neo-con aims of the day so he testified.
      </p>
      <p>
       That raises the burden of proof fairly high against equal allegations that the DNC servers couldn't have been hacked, but were copied via a drive by an insider (because the data transfer rate was so high). That Assange almost had a deal to prove Russia didn't hack the DNC computers before the US stopped talking to him and shut the deal down. Assange (like him or not) has a very high reliability in releasing uncontested truth. Mueller doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since the DNC "hacks" all we've had to go on from US intelligence / Mueller etc is "Trust us", despite even former NSA staff saying "it couldn't have been a hack".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also an indictment against 12 Russians which is almost certainly never going to be tried. There's no extradition agreement with Russia. So announcing an evidence free and probably never to be tested indictment just as Trump is about to meet Putin looks highly politically motivated, from the same agencies who supported the likes of Peter Strzok and his highly partisan anti-Trump stance. But .. "Trust us".
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks dodgy as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under current conditions, no there's nothing he can add to it because anything he did add may undermine any on-going investigations. That's the official line.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I can't give you a straight answer. Only point out that it would take a lot more than the "Trust us" we have at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record. Before the downvotes flood in. I don't like Trump either. I'm not supporting or endorsing him, but if you want to knock down a President, do it legally with hard evidence, not innuendo and unfounded allegations. It worked for Nixon. Trump can brush all this off as "false news" precisely because there's nothing really convincing behind it all after 2 years+ of investigation. "Trust us, but we can't tell you facts or details yet because there's still an investigation". Hit him with something tangible. End the investigation and put the cards on the table. You'd think by now there would be enough to bury him judging by the beliefs the mass media has and the allegations flying around.

       Yes it was for you.  Yes.  In fact many aspects are verbatim.  I have no idea why they did it but the portions that are verbatim are tied to cyber security which has evolved.  I have no idea why high paid attorneys would do this unless they were asked to throw something together at the last moment.

       What document are you referring to? I have tried to look up any reporting on this but it is just bringing up the history of the alleged scandal Webb was investigating into Imran Awan.

       Was it a document discussing the security of the DNC? Perhaps they hadn't updated their security protocols? I feel like you aren't really painting a very clear picture of what you are hinting at.
I doubt the attorneys were asked to put something together at the last moment.

       Also of note, most of the people working for Mueller are making anything close to what they could make working for private agencies. They are not doing it for profit.

       Perhaps because Trump had a scheduled meeting with a hostile nation's leader despite being under investigation about that same leader and his relationship.

       Just for the sake of argument, just pretend for a moment Mueller's team is actually investigating things properly and is actually finding concerning information. Would their actions be different than they are now or the same?

       I don't see any dispute written between the two.  I see the same data and language but what is interesting is the way Nunez received his information through agents who were not being called in for questioning at the time.  I don't find this information a "national security threat" like it was claimed to be.  Both same phishing "attempts" with some success.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel you on WikiLeaks.  They may not have received the Republican emails from the Russians.  I do think Republican Intel will come out.  I mean if you get content - from hackers.  You can't always get both sides.  Naturally that pisses off 1 side so I can understand your frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rod Rosenstein said multiple times there is no investigation with Trump and Russian collusion.  Obama met with Russia after knowing of Russian hack attempts with the DNC.  I think the craziness is to create hysteria for midterms.  Like Obama meeting with Iran and Cuba - the right went crazy.

       I believe Mueller and team are making an effort to investigate properly.  They are handed compartmental information that the media has tried to manipulate as proof of Russian collusion.  I never trusted Mueller since 9/11 and WMDs.  He covered for Bush and Cheney.  Every action taken by Mueller is spun so heavily by left and right outlets making it difficult to know what is really going on.  I don't know if their actions would be different if they found concerning information.  I do believe Russia knows a lot about our corruption so that alone probably scares a lot of politicians.

       But there's still just as much evidence for Putin's claim as there is for the indictments ... why did you think I was taking it personally? Why jump up and down with joy about one fact free claim and deny the other? That was my point.

       Putin is a massive liar, a crook and a killer. In one stroke, he's trying to divert attention from his hacking and to the guy who got his ass with the Magnitsky Act, which he's been trying to get thrown out. Why would a conspiracy minded person believe him? Who's been pushing his narrative in this sub?

       You are using the Magnitsky Act over the accusation.  He offered Mueller and team access to investigate the 12 suspect.  In return he asked to investigate the 400k laundered and donated to Clinton.   You think he doesn't have the same level of evidence as Mueller and team? That he would make up such a lie to what? What benefit?

       I'm using critical thinking skill. Putin sent his lawyers to fight the Magnitsky Act, she talked about it to Trump's son at their meeting, Trump​ lied about it, Trump ​met with Putin alone for 2 hours, they come out and Putin sling an accusation against the guy who got that act passed to hurt Putin and his cronies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin offerred to have his people be involved in Mueller's investigations, now imagine Hillary​ is guilty of whatever you want her to be guilty of, and there's an investigation going on with 12 of her campaign staffs having been indicted and she says "fine, you can question my people but you have to let my other people be there and share everything you have with me", yeah right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't act like Putin is separate to the hackers. Putin, via his subordinates, ordered the hackers to hack the DNC and Podesta and the States voter registrations. Around late 2016 and early 2017, when the Steele Dossier came out, a bunch of Russian diplomats were killed, there's speculations they were sources for the dossier, I won't say I believe either way until there's more proof, but it would idiotic to trust Putin or any Russian working for him with how Mueller got the evidence to indict the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I think he would make up a lie on the fly, just to fuck with people in the West, especially the journalists and politicians. He's a master troll. But in this case, it's to turn the spotlight away from his hacking team and create a story about Browder, which are then pushed by his trolls, liberally garnished with misinformation. He has nothing to lose but everything to gain. If he wasn't such a cutthroat authoritarian asshole, I would totally respect his cleverness.

       You are missing critical thinking.  This is a country making accusations about another country and the accusing country has named government employees as suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't Clinton or some domestic or international country with good foreign relationships.  This is Russia a country where we have done shitting things to them and they have to us.  Trust is not great and if you ask for something you must expect to do something in return until trust has been established.  What Putin did is say, show us the evidence...let us examine and we will do the same in regards to Browder.  To me it is a win for Mueller.  2 crimes solved if all goes well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mueller doesn't even have the fucking server and his indictment comes from IC when we already saw those same tools exposed in Vault 7.  Not to mention these 12 suspects were known 6 months ago so why have a national breifing on a pointless update?
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of your comment is total speculation.  However if I were Putin and some political smear campaign in a country I didn't trust was questioning my intel community.  I would be suspect of their purpose and would hack into DNC to get clarity if lies are being fed.  You have no proof any of them died because nobody in the dossier from Russia has been unmasked.  It is the biggest crock of shit.

       Mueller and Dems want Russia to handover the suspects (see John McCains tweets).  That's a win but they have to see if Putin has good evidence for Browder before agreeing to those terms.  If good evidence then they could take another money launderer off the streets.  That is a win win especially with FCC laws that may require any bank doing business with Browder to investigate anyways.

       All politicians steal money from the people.  Did you know a percentage of every dollar we made from 2013-2016 went to protect Russias pipeline to Germany that is owned by the former German chancellor? That pisses me off when we have homeless and healthcare issues.  Putin may be dirty but he is a part of a big club.  Venezuela is a great example.  I say we let Russia be Russia but if we can find peace and bring mutual trade that brings economic benefit  we should do it.  I could care less how bad they are to people.  I can name many countries that are worse than Russia.  I damn sure won't support or spill blood over some billionaires wanting war to make money.

       Maybe because Putins claim was hilarious bullshit. Hillarys campaign in total only raised around 500 million. And 400 million of that was from some Russian guy? It was a silly statement that  it many people cared about because its drastically untrue. Meanwhile, many people were very much more concerned with Trumps actions today. These two stories are not equal.

       I find Putin's "accusation" shallow and of little use. The indictments give the public a glimpse into what was done and how for the first time. Of course further evidence is needed; but this isn't the end of the investigation. So it isn't time to show all the cards yet.

       Haha, Putin would love that. Putin is just pissed that Browder got the Magnitsky Act through, he would love to "take him off the street", but Putin, one of the biggest crook, who steals money from the Russian people, what do you think ought to be done with him?

       That is why diplomacy is so important! And if Trump and Putin likes eachother it is not that far to imagine a collaboration betwen Trump and Putin, if they see they value of combining their Power that is a way for Putin to gain more Power and a way for Trump to exxert his will for Control and tradition.
