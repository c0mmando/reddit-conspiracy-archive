       I made a statement suggesting, like Kissinger for the 9/11 commission getting kicked out, that mueller, who seems to be Kissinger replacement will eventually meet the same fate. And he'll be replaced by another shadow government stooge

       Mueller has classically been a guy
       <em>
        who doesn't find anything

       - and I'm betting what happens with the current investigation is a few Russian assets will be given up and Trump will be completely exonerated... I don't know why people think Trump and Mueller are on different sides. They work for the same people.

       Interesting fact: Kissinger was the first person selected to head up the 911 investigation. Until the family of the victims pointed out that as an investigator that he'd have to disclose the names of his clients; which included the Bin Ladens.
       <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/13/kissinger.resigns/">
        He resigned that same day.

       Mueller was in charge of the FBI during the anthrax investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Lambert was the lead FBI investigator in the Amerithrax case. [He sued Mueller and others in the FBI in 2015 for obstructing and impeding the investigation and then firing him when he complained](

       </a>
       ). Lambert doesn't believe there was enough evidence to conclude that Ivins was a lone anthrax killer. Lambert's complaints included:
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; (a) WFO’s [Washington Field Office's] persistent understaffing of the AMERITHRAX investigation; (b) the threat of WFO’s Agent in charge to retaliate if Plaintiff disclosed the understaffing to FBI Headquarters; (c) WFO’s insistence on staffing the AMERITHRAX investigation principally with new Agents recently graduated from the FBI Academy resulting in an average investigative tenure of 18 months with 12 of 20 Agents assigned to the case having no prior investigative experience at all; ...
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; (e) FBI Director’s Mueller’s mandate to Plaintiff to “compartmentalize” the AMERITHRAX investigation by stove piping the flow of case information and walling off task force members from those aspects of the case not specifically assigned to them...
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; (f) WFO’s diversion and transfer of two Ph.D. Microbiologist Special Agents from their key roles in the investigation to fill billets for an 18 month Arabic language training program in Israel; (g) the FBI Laboratory’s deliberate concealment from the Task Force of its discovery of human DNA on the anthrax-laden envelope addressed to Senator Leahy and the Lab’s initial refusal to perform comparison testing; (h) the FBI Laboratory’s refusal to provide timely and adequate scientific analyses and forensic examinations in support of the investigation;...
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; (j) the FBI’s fingering of Bruce Ivins as the anthrax mailer; and, (k) the FBI’s subsequent efforts to railroad the prosecution of Ivins in the face of daunting exculpatory evidence. Following the announcement of its circumstantial case against Ivins, Defendants DOJ and FBI crafted an elaborate perception management campaign to bolster their assertion of Ivins’ guilt. These efforts included press conferences and highly selective evidentiary presentations which were replete with material omissions...
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; After leaving the AMERITHRAX investigation in 2006, Plaintiff continued to publicly opine that the quantum of circumstantial evidence against Bruce Ivins was not adequate to satisfy the proof-beyond-a-reasonable doubt threshold required to secure a criminal conviction in federal court. Plaintiff continued to advocate that while Bruce Ivins may have been the anthrax mailer, there is a wealth of exculpatory evidence to the contrary which the FBI continues to conceal from Congress and the American people. The FBI vehemently opposes Plaintiff’s position.

       <p>
        On May 6, 2004, the FBI arrested Mayfield as a material witness in connection with the Madrid attacks, and held him for over two weeks.[1] Mayfield was charged, and an FBI internal review later acknowledged serious errors in their investigation. Ensuing lawsuits have resulted in a formal apology from the U.S. government and a $2 million settlement. An initial ruling declared some provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act unconstitutional, but the United States government appealed, and the ruling was overturned.

       I worked for a chemical company for 14 years and we created a spray that allowed you to see through envelops. The government weren't interested in it and neither was anyone else. It was at that point i realised Anthrax being posted was all bullshit and no one gave a fuck.

       An early "WTF?" moment for me that hit my cognitive dissonance hard. Why would they be sending anthrax to Daschle and others who were fighting
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the patriot act, which would presumably be an asset against the WoT? Made no sense. But I pushed it down for a couple more years.

       Patriot act turned into the NDAA (national defense authorisation act) which gave the president ungodly powers to illegally detain anybody and incarcerate them without having to state a reason. It was also hidden in there that he could send them to foreign prisons to be tortured. Fucking horrifying man.

       Leaves things wide open for “legal detention” of political prisoners. Several have already died while in custody as political prisoners. One had written a book, can’t remember his name, though. Read about it a few years back.

       Yes you would be correct. They snuck it into the NDAA while people were busy waiting for the Mayan end of times bullshit and distracted by various false flags and holidays... Normal things am i right? But yes because of the Patriot act and freedom act, and the fact they put it in a 12,000 page thing hours before the voting started and they had barely enough time to even agree on the military budget, it was passed. Fucking politicians are such scum.

       Because Bush and Cheney did 9/11. They needed the Patriot Act in order to be able to cover it up. When they could track and spy on everyone, they could target anyone who was talking about the stuff they wanted to be kept silent. It was actually pretty effective, wasn't it? They are not in prison, they got away with it so far.

        The 2001 Anthrax Deception: The Case for a Domestic Conspiracy
       </a>
       is well worth reading, just like various people have demonstrated that the official 9/11 narrative simply can not be true, Macqueen demonstrates that the anthrax had to have been made in a US chemical weapons laboratory.

       Don't quote me on it, but I'm pretty sure they traced that anthrax back to a government lab. Something about the spores matching another sample. Good jump off point for research!

       People make this comment in ways that seem dishonest to me sometimes...the man overdosed on codeine. He was never formally charged before his death (or subsequently) and a multitude of non-FBI sources concluded that there was simply not evidence that he did it at all, much less
       <em>
        alone
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe his suicide was intentional after realizing that he was going to be the only patsy for whatever went down.

       With as many reported cases of suicide by bullet wounds to the back of the head, that's the go-to response when a suicide wraps stories like this up just a little too neat.

       He's like the first dude to ever od on codeine.. What a terrible, awful slow way to go. At least od on some percocet or something that'll get you high enough to kind of offset the pain.. As a reformed addict whose dosed and nearly overdosed every type of painkiller.. Nobody.. Especially somebody with access to shit like anthrax.. Is gonna skip over the real shit to of on glorified Tylenol. This is the most unbelievable part of all of this to me.

       Well, My comment refers to how google decides the ranking of the results to show you.  Google tends to hide some true factual information and give many misleading news articles or whatever first and you have to go down a few pages to find the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not talking about finding a cnn artles first and finding the "truth" on a conspiracy website. Specifically theres been stories I had come across 15years ago and I knew were true. i try googling them, and The results seem to suggest its false.  Normally I would give up and chalk it up to having bad information, but I knew my source was like BBC or Reuters or something respectable. So I go past the first few pages of results suggesting its false or doesnt exist, to eventually come across the legit article I knew existed and was clearly the most relevant result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying google does this on purpose, tho they may.  Facebook censors their news, google could do something similar. It could also be other organizations such as the CIA or internet scrubbing companies that may be working to manipulate the results of google to hide or promote whatever their goals align with.

       Google most definitely does it on purpose in order to be allowed to continue their illegal data mining and then selling that to corporations so they can market more effectively to you and to politicians so they microtarget you for your vote. Lots of money for them and FB in this.

       Yes choked on a bottle on Tylenol 3. Im told it is impossible to die in the same night as taking a bottlenof T3, and that its typical for the lover to shut down a week or 2 later.

       It would take an insane amount of tylenol 3. It would be overdosing on both Tylenol and codiene. You would likely be super sick before you OD'd from the weak opiate.

       Yep. My Mom is a nurse and that was her opinion, that it would shut down your liver after 2 weeks, if they couldnt save you that is. You may not even die. So the death of the Ft. Detrik scientist was a very suspicious moment in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more, is the state of emergency for Anthrax suddenly made rhe anthrax vaccine shoot from a dollar something per injection, to a hundred or thousand times that (can't recall). A US Senator who owned the vaccine company, made a lot of money off of that, and was involved in the vote on the matter. When his friend Senators were asked about that, they said they had no idea he owned such a company.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more, is the State of Emergency on Anthrax made sure the company had no liability for any problems that occur like if somebody dies. The anthrax vaccine was one of two said to possible and likely be responsible for Gulf War Syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself nearly died when the Anthrax vaccine was administered to me, before a deployment, and the military swept it under the rug. So suffice to say I'm peeved. I reported it to VAERS but what does that accomplish? They don't treat the data as verifiable and upon an incident taking place, I have evidence that they try as hard as possible to NOT identify the cause of the symptoms. See my story here,

       I have my doubts about the relevant facts used to pin the blame on these scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Iowa State University's FBI sanctioned destructon of anthrax samples; prior to the attack seems like the logical place to start. The evidence was destroy before the materials were deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the FBI (Mueller) "identified" the anthrax as the "Ames Strain".  ISU in located in Ames Iowa. There is a national nimal disease lab in Ames that is indirectly affiliated with ISU, as well...

       Yeah there are some very interesting podcasts and documentaries about the entire Anthrax situation. IIRC it was never fully conclusive because the main person of interest committed suicide. The story is pretty wild. When I’m back on my desktop I’ll edit this post with some links.

       He could order it and order everyone to remain silent. How could it be any easier? Both Bush and Cheney were talking the antibiotics before anyone else knew anything about it. I'd call that a smoking gun regarding their guilt in the matter. They  were the ones who wanted the Patriot Act so that they could spy on everyone especially congress.

       How else were they going to effectively be able to cover up 9/11? The whole thing was very well planned in advance.

       There was a video on here a while back that talked about the uniformity of the spores and the silicone binding agent it was mixed with was manufactured on the nano scale. Such precision was determined to be impossible by a single resource let alone gone undetected by colleagues.  IIRC a 500k electron microscope would have had to have been extensively used to refine the powder too.

       I would also like to mention that this program spawned the notion of collecting healthcare data from hospitals under the guise of bioterrorism monitoring. Most states have a program patients can't opt out of that requires hospitals to send ER data to state level health departments, which eventually makes it's way to the CDC.

       So you don't have to believe me, but the guys brother was a patient at the dentist office where my mom used to work. I think the guy did work in a government lab. But other than that I have no clue. I also remember being a shit little kid and filling someones mailbox with fake snow around the time of the attacks then later driving by and seeing a cop with it in a ziploc baggie lol

       One thing that always stuck with me was when my Micro Biology professor said you need some serious high end laboratory equipment to create anthrax spore concentrations high enough to kill someone. Its a big enough operation where a rogue scientist couldnt just be using the equipment without any notice.

       People in the media were also targeted, including Tom Brokaw who was a prominent news anchor at the time and the National Enquirer offices. I wonder looking back on it if the Enquirer was about to break a story of some magnitude, like when they later broke the story about then VP Democratic candidate John Edwards and his affair and extramarital baby.

       The anthrax was mailed two blocks from my home using a corner freestanding mailbox that I walked by often in Princeton. So yeah, I remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also remember not getting mail for four weeks because they had to hastily install screening equipment at major mail hubs. I was thankful most of my big writing clients like Showtime paid me by direct deposit, because my physical checks for work were delayed a month.

       Oh my sweet summer child, this goes back to the beginning of time but just in the last century, off the top of my head:
      </p>
      <p>
       FDR knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor and allowed to happen. Clinton deliberately bombed Afghanistan after his affair was discovered to deflect negative media coverage. There are hundreds more.
      </p>
      <p>
       And other countries are no better unfortunately because
       <em>
        people are the same everywhere
       </em>
       especially when they get power. And that rarely ever ends well for the little guys, the pawns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also hate the current trending overuse of the word "fascism" but that's just a personal pet peeve.

       And a way to end the ENRON investigation, steal some gold, etc. It was a multi-purpose event used for multiple effects. That took a LOT of planning and coordination with the people who were in charge. Like Rummy out on the lawn making sure all the right people got killed.

       We know Bush and Cheney were involved in the anthrax poisonings because they were taking the antibiotics. They had a clear motive, access to the anthrax, etc. No one else is anywhere near as obvious a suspect as they are.

       The role of the neocon thinktank Project for a New American Century in this is particularly interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       PNAC published the paper
       <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf">
        Rebuilding America's Defenses
       </a>
       in September 2000. It laid out plans for colossal increases in military spending and a "core mission" to "fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theater wars." But PNAC worried that their ambitions plans might take a while because "the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor."
      </p>
      <p>
       (Listen to General Wesley Clark explain how he was told right after 9/11 that the Secretary of Defense had a plan to take out
       <a href="https://youtu.be/9RC1Mepk_Sw">
        7 countries in 5 years: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran
       </a>
       . It seems that plan is still underway, though the time frame was a little ambitious.)
      </p>
      <p>
       June 22-23, 2001, three months before the anthrax attacks there was a bioterror drill at Andrews Air Force Base called Operation Dark Winter that simulated a large-scale bioweapons attack on the US. Just like the real attacks, the
       <a href="http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2001_dark-winter/Dark%20Winter%20Script.pdf">
        script
       </a>
       mentioned letters being sent to media and a threat of using anthrax. The June drill included
       <a href="https://youtu.be/we7Map5Pho0?t=146">
        fake news broadcasts
       </a>
       played to the participants in the drill that were almost identical to
       <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92270&amp;amp;page=1">
        ABC News stories
       </a>
       that attempted to blame Al Qaeda and Iraq after the anthrax attacks, which were later proven false.
      </p>

       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "NCN has learned that Iraq may have provided the technology behind the attack to terrorist groups based in Afghanistan."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       PNAC member and former CIA Director James Woolsey played the CIA Director in the drill.
      </p>
      <p>
       On September 12th, 2001, the day after 9/11, and three weeks before the first anthrax attack infection, PNAC member Donald Kagan and his son Fred Kagan went on the Milt Rosenberg radio show and spoke about the supposed need to retaliate for 9/11 by attacking Palestine and Iraq. Incredibly, they also mentioned anthrax, saying
       <a href="https://youtu.be/G9VdaB8b-es">
        "what would have happened, if instead of just having jet fuel on those planes, they had had anthrax bacilli?"
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       On September 16th 2001, two days before the anthrax letters were mailed, Richard Perle, Chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee and a member of PNAC,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/0PqU7dXEirU?t=31">
        appeared on CNN to warn that the next attack might be biological.

       And also check out this interview with jailed drone analyst and whistleblower Matt Dehart who says he received sensitive files relating to the anthrax attacks that, among other things, showed there was a Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigation following a cobalt radiation trail (radiation is used to neutralise anthrax) that led to the CIA. The investigation was quashed by Cheney.

       Cheney did 9/11. He was in charge of it. Bush knew about it and the two of them did it together. With lots of help, of course. It was a big team effort.

       I used to drive by the Belle Glade FL airport daily, which was where the “terrorists” were trying to buy a crop duster, seemingly in order to spray Florida with Anthrax. I ended up buying all kinds of stupid shit that I still have to this day. Gas masks, gasoline containers, camping supplies, etc.

       I joined the Navy at the beginning of 2001 and my dad was in the Navy Reserves. While I was in A school i got a call that my dad was hospitalized with what became a terminal disability which was later linked to him taking the anthrax vaccination. A few years later when i was told it was time for me to take it, I refused. They were going to send me to Captains Mast until I provided my dads paperwork including a letter from a specialist @ Walter Reed stating that the vaccination was the probable cause. They dropped the case against me, but restricted me to the ship to prevent me from catching anthrax... right, like anthrax is just hanging around in foreign ports. Luckily, the FDA stopped the military from administering it and I was able to leave the ship after only 4 months of being on a steel prison.

       My stepsister was in the Army Reserves and had to get that vaccine before taking an overseas assignment. Two years later she was diagnosed with Type 1 insulin dependent diabetes. No family history of it, in her mid-thirties and very healthy and fit.

       I joined the military in 1997 and thankfully, I think I just managed to miss that one being introduced so I never had it.

       I don't see why the full fledged support. Sure, there are some crazies out there but you should always be cautious when someone is suggesting you inject some chemical into your body (which you don't actually have a clue what it is). Especially when some of them are relatively new, untested and the long-term effects are unknown.

       The Patriot Act was going to pass regardless of Amerithrax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Amerithrax wasn't that big of a deal. It should have been a bigger deal than it was, but everybody was focused on 9/11. Amerithrax needed a better publicist.

       Anyone ever try to read the Patriot Act?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of it consists of lines similar to this -- In Us Code ##, the word 'might' is to be replaced with the word  'will'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basicly,they rewrote a lot of laws one word at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way that they could have rewrote laws one word at a time in the three weels between sept 11 and the day the Act was signed into law.
      </p>
      <p>
       No fucking way.

       Anthrax was an interesting but perhaps lesser known conspiracy.  It actually involved Zionists at Fort Dedrick and they tried (in vain) to frame the crime onto a Muslim scientist working there

       Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does all this say about the American mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:
      </p>
      <p>
       De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That's $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don't believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">
        https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle."
      </p>
      <p>
       He went on to say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks."
      </p>
      <p>
       He further goes on to state:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word."
      </p>
      <p>
       You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don't know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don't have the courage to do it, because you're a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don't have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it's too big to stop.

       What's more, is the state of emergency for Anthrax suddenly made the anthrax vaccine shoot from a dollar something per injection, to a hundred or more times that (can't recall). A US Senator who owned the vaccine company, made a lot of money off of that, and was involved in the vote on the matter. When his friend Senators were asked about that, they said they had no idea he owned such a company.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more, is the State of Emergency on Anthrax made sure the company had no liability for any problems that occur like if somebody dies. The anthrax vaccine was one of two said to possible and likely be responsible for Gulf War Syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself nearly died when the Anthrax vaccine was administered to me, before a deployment, and the military swept it under the rug. So suffice to say I'm peeved. I reported it to VAERS but what does that accomplish? They don't treat the data as verifiable and upon an incident taking place, I have evidence that they try as hard as possible to NOT identify the cause of the symptoms. See my story here,

       Thanks! I was on Camp Beuhring and am told they had constant burn pits. I checked the box on the paperwork and recently got emailed for am appointment at the VA in what they call the Environmental Exposure Clinic. They told me I have a right to make a claim so I will. My lings have not been the same since I got back. It feels like they shut down when I smell cigarettes, or certain kinds of chemicals (I work in a science lab).
      </p>
      <p>
       If I die at least I'll go out having told my story. What more can I do? Not even our military can protect the people from the force of tyranny that is poised to control their bodies and their minds.
