<p>Hillary Clinton called for a no fly zone over Syria. What that means is that the American military would shoot down any aircraft in the no fly zone, including Russians. Hillary and her Zionist deep state mafia would gladly have started WW3. Ask yourslef, &quot;what does America gain from overthrowing Assad in Syria? NOTHING.
What did America have to gain from invading Iraq? NOTHING. Lybia? NOTHING.&quot;
So why are Hiallry, DNC, and deep state never trumpers willing to risk WW3 when America has nothing to gain from it? THEY ARE ALL FUNDED AND CONTROLLED BY A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.
Russiagate is nothing more than a deep state gaslighting campaign. The same deep state players that brought you the false flag on 9/11 are now promising that some super secret evidence of Russian collusion exists, but we can&#39;t see it. Just like WMDs. Just like the Anthrax. Just like when Seth Rogans movie was hacked by the North Koreans. Jewish media is a threat to America. If you need anymore evidence than the entirety of the past 15 to 20 years, you might be asleep.
Propaganda/spin is to be expected, but to fabricate conspiracy theories in an attempt to deligitimize a valid election really does cross the line. What the Jewish media and Zionist deep state are engaging in is close to an act of war, in my opinion. Jewish media framed Muslims for 9/11 and still do to this day. Now they want to frame our president. Were they looking out for the average American when they went to war in Iraq? No. Are they looking out for the average American by trying to invalidate/overthrow trump? No.
All media owened by jews exists to further Jewish interests. From JFK, to 9/11, to the moon landing to Russiagate, from CNN to Fox and from Vice to Reddit. All fake news created by foreign governments in order to meddle in EVERY AMERICAN ELECTION</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good submission and interesting questions, but I have a few counter-arguments:</p>

<p>Russia has been an antagonist and competitor of the US since the end of WWII.  This is not an invention of the media.</p>

<p>The situation in the ME, did not cause the conflict between Russia and the US.  The conflict between Russia/US caused much of the troubles in the ME.  </p>

<p>The ME has entered a mini cold-war with Israel, KSA and the US against Iran, Syria, and Russia - with many counties caught in the middle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russiagate is nothing more than a deep state gaslighting campaign</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why the US deep state?  Why not the Russian deep state gaslighting the American people to elect DT?  How is it more plausible that the CIA launched a cruise missile at the Pentagon,(or whtvr you believe) vs. The GRU hacked the DNC?  </p>

<p>You believe that Zionists actively do things to promote Zionist interests (duh), but do not believe Russians do things to promote Russian interests?</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin is not trying to destroy the new world order, he is staking out a powerful place within that order!</p>
