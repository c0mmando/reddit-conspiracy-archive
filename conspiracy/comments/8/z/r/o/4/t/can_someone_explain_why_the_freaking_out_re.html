       Can someone explain to me why everyone is freaking out about Trump "colluding" with Russia?  I mean... what did Trump do - SPECIFICALLY - that has set-off such #warcriminals like John Brennon and John McCain (not to mention their supporters, like Anderson Cooper) to describe Trump "the most disgraceful President tin history" ?  (request for non-partisan answers only, PLEASE)

       So they changed the amount and are trying to negotiate with Meuller for the 12 indicted Russians.

       Bill was paid 1/2 a million for a speech after the Uranium 1 deal went through and the Clinton Foundation had a $140 million dollar donation from Russia.

       Seems to be a lot of money coming out of Russia to the pockets of "Not Trump" who is the one being investigated for Russian collusion.

       It isn't anything specific Trump did that set them off; it was the face to face meeting with Putin itself.  For almost two years now they've stated that Trump is in Putin's pocket, so with this press conference and closed door meeting they saw an opportunity to further that narrative and score some points with the public at the expense of Trump.  They're not genuinely responding to his words, the words are immaterial in themselves.  They're playing the outrage card to rally people against Trump.

       You won’t get a genuine answer because there isn’t one. It’s absolutely ridiculous. All of a sudden Trumps a traitor because he didn’t publicly execute Putin? Didn’t co-sign the CIA/FBI bullshit?! These so called journalists got a bone and are running with it. It will eventually bite them all in the ass.

       He stated he trusted Putins word over unanimous American agreement and understanding that the Russians did meddle in our elections. We are no longer arguing if Russia was involved, we are trying to square away why and what they achieved. Prepare for the worst.

       Perhaps I wasn't clear with my phrasing.  I meant the reaction was predetermined, like that woman's march tweet that had the nominee as "XX".  It was the timing and the setting that were important - not what was specifically said at the presser.

       A small minority of the MSM reporting that I’ve seen has revolved around a few sentences that trump said, and the vast majority has been basically high- brow Insults. Saying it is the worst performance of a president they’ve ever seen, saying that he looking like an asset dealing with his handler, and the general complete lack of variation in degree of these claims. Just looking at it from a ratio analysis perspective the majority of the reporting revolves around other people’s interpretation, rather than reporting in full what was actually said. This is not a new phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media really doesn’t even have to listen to what people say, and I’ve found that when you go to the source, you realize how much “spin” (read: lies) you are receiving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I think the greater thing to consider is the escalation of tension between the greatest nuclear powers on earth. It really seems like people don’t realize it will be THEY are sent to slaughter. It won’t be Trump, and it won’t be his kids. It won’t be anyone who actually makes the decision to go to war. It will be the citizens who die. I don’t like Trump, but I appreciate the effort to decrease tension. I don’t want to die in battle over a damn unfounded Russian email hack.

       No. That's not how this works. Calling a politician a war criminal is not partisan because political party has nothing to do with being a war criminal. We've all seen the pictures of John McCain posing with ISIS leaders. Getting in a huff over the accusation may be partisan. Making the accusation is not.

       Whether he is or isn't a war criminal is irrelevant. You're expressing a narrative yet asking for replies to do the opposite. By using McCain as an example instead of the literal dozens of politicians and news agencies saying the same, you're trying to provoke a partisan response because of the recent history between him and Trump. And by labeling him a war criminal, whether true or not, you're painting the narrative of "this obviously very bad guy thinks Trump is doing something wrong, look at how crazy the accusations must then be."
      </p>
      <p>
       You know exactly what you're doing and it's fucking frustrating because all you want is validation, and not a genuine response.

       He literally said he didn't see why Russia would interfere with a the election barely 10 seconds after saying that his guys came to him with Intel and knowing that Russian agents had been inticted for meddling. He might as well have said he believes putin over his own country's intelligence agencies. That's pretty atrocious.

       Considering the track record of these intelligence agencies, remember wmds in Iraq? That war alone probably resulted in the death of half a million people. The agencies have been aligned with special government or military industrial interests for a while now. they will fix the intelligence around the policy.

       The western world is watching as the "leader" of the free world butts heads with his allies and cosies up to his enemies. He has attacked any media portraying him in a negative light. He has fired advisors who disagreed with him and is now practically surrounded with people who act as though everything he does is great. He has disregarded his intelligence agencies and chooses instead to take the word of putin, a long-time enemy of the United States. Obviously it's in putin's interests to at least fracture nato and cause havoc in the eu and trump is doing it all for him. This is why he is disgraceful.

       To be specific, if trump knows that Russia interfered with the election (which he does cos y'know, intelligence) and if he was aware of the interference during his campaign  (which would be collusion) then he is an illegitimate president. The Russian meddling and trumps collusion are two separate things. Trump basically said that he didn't see why Russia would interfere with the election even though that's been proven so his denial is pretty much pointing to the fact that he knew about it the whole time.

        Good meeting with @realDonaldTrump. Your leadership on defence spending is clearly having an impact - Allies are adding billions to their budgets. We are also stepping up the fight against terrorism. In uncertain times we need a strong #NATO.

       Which again, they were doing anyway.  Why did trump feel the need to act like a big bully? The EU and NATO has already spent billions on America's wars in the middle east.

       This is
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       just more of the artificial, virtue-signaling narrative against Trump to distract from the real crimes of the deep state, the wikileaks dumps, Uranium One, CF, and the DNC. It morphed into incoherent mass hysteria a long time ago, but the screech is still intensifying.

       President Trump talked to the Russian president, therefore Russian collusion is proven. I think that's the logic they're going with.

       The narrative since the Start of the COld war is "Russia Bad, America Good"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have a case that alleges the Russians tried to Interfere in US Politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The President who is supposed to be the Poster Child for "America good, Russia Bad" is saying, Hey "Putin is an okay guy"
      </p>
      <p>
       This sets of warning bells and scares people.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL dr: Us and Russia have been enemies for so long, peace between them cannot exist.

       He is a war criminal. Whether it was him ratting out his fellow service men or aligning with Jihadis in the Middle East. He is a war criminal and war monger.  He doesn't have the nickname "song bird" McCain for no reason. Look into it.

       No. That's not how this works. Calling a politician a war criminal is not partisan because political party has nothing to do with being a war criminal. We've all seen the pictures of John McCain posing with ISIS leaders. Getting in a huff over the accusation may be partisan. Making the accusation is not.

       Well, he went to Syria to set up the whole "mercenary" operation. What do you call that? A push for peace? Calling a spade at spade isn't partisan whatsoever.

       These "journalists" wrote their articles about the conclusions of the meeting before the meeting even took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like Women's March already wrote their "racist" attack on Trump's supreme court pick before they even knew who it was.
