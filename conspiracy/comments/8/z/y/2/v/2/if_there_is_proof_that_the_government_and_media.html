      <p>
       Hi guys! First post here! I'm super excited to finally be able to post after waiting for 60 days!!! Here's something that's been on my mind:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschilds's, Hillary clintons daughter, celebrity sacrifices, architecture, and a bunch of other proof that Satan is worshipped by the most elite should make us wonder about God.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these people who know more than we do (I figure through "space exploration" and private meetings) believe that there is a devil then there must be a god.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you already know where I'm going with this: FLAT EARTH DOES NOT SEEM THAT CRAZY TO ME.
      </p>
      <p>
       the bible suggests a firmament and water above it and below it. Since we have supposedly never been to space, we don't know that it is, in fact, air and not water
      </p>
      <p>
       Photos of the other planets are all computer generated, even according to nasa. When independent researchers post photos of these planets using the most high tech gear they always look unclear and wavey, as if they're in water,
      </p>
      <p>
       And why is it really that we aren't allowed to the "center" of Antarctica? Maybe the edge of the world? Where one would find the firmament?
      </p>
      <p>
       (Some even believe there is more past Antarctica. That all of our "space exploration" is actually just the government searching for more life on this giant sheet of ice. That we are just a hot spot on it and that there must be more)
      </p>
      <p>
       And the science behind flat earth doesn't seem all that bad. I mean, we don't have many professionals working to figure it out so we can't compare its complexity to a round earth's science. And if God exists then one thing being round and another thing being flat makes perfect sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a lot of "conspiracy theorists" think that the media and government are trying to belittle us and make us feel dumb and small. They think this is done through fluoride, brainwashing/programming, etc... Would it be a stretch to think that they do this through basically telling us there is no God? (they tell us there is no God by making everything seem like it's rooted in science. The earth and evolution for example). This could be their plan since it is shown that less and less people believe in him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we don't believe in God then we feel there is nothing miraculous about life and we all just submit to science and "whatever the expert says"
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be cognitive dissonance to believe one and not even consider the other.

       People aren't allowed to cross Antarctica. Very very few have done it and they've all been accompanied by a guide. It's hard to believe that it even actually happened. Or if it did, that they crossed the center.

       I don't find it hard to believe it happened.  I sure as hell wouldn't want to do it though, it's super inhospitable.  I like the cold, but it gets silly down there.  And it's massive.

       Ya, they won't drop you off and just let you go wandering.  Probably because you'd die of exposure unless you had like, a full expedition team with you.  Even then, no thanks!

       Well, it's the center of the land mass known as Antarctica. People aren't allowed to explore the continent freely and the countries who have bases there highly secretive. Look into it, lots to discover.

       They don't fly over the south pole for the same reason they don't go over the north.  Safety and the magnetic poles.  If something goes wrong with the plane over Antarctica, everyone is dead, it's as simple as that.  No bases, no airstrips, no nearby rescue operations.

       I didn't say fly over it, I said visit it, be there. And how do you know there aren't any of those conveniences there? I'm sure there's more than we're told, people live there for parts of the year, they need medical help and stuff too, so let's not play dumb.

      <p>
       Perhaps one can find life miraculous even if they don't believe in God. Isn't the mystery of who we are part of what makes it such a miracle?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, "submitting to science and whatever the expert says" is not that dissimilar to submitting to whatever an entity says.

       I'm not saying you have to believe in God to find life miraculous.
Science makes it seem like not much of a miracle. Everything has an explanation. Big Bang, evolution, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't mean believing in God as in submitting to what he says, that would be a religion. I mean believing that there is something bigger out there, like an energy or something. Maybe a god but I don't know.

       I tend to disagree. Anytime we discover something, we often have even more questions. And it's not the
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       that makes life miraculous, it's the
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       , which, when it come to the big bang, science cannot confirm why.

       This I agree with. People can be consumed by other things, such as materialism, but perhaps it's because the why question can never fully be answered in a way that will satisfy people .You have to keep in mind that the people today grow up in a VERY different, and constantly changing world. Facts dominate (or have dominated) belief. And the answer to
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       requires faith, which many people aren't willing to give when a lot of other questions have been answered through fact.

       You make some very good points here. But as you know any mention of flat earth gets you massively downvoted, which is a shame because it is as viable as there being space probes sent to Jupiter, or even Agartha which seem people seem to deem acceptable. But FE aside I wholeheartedly agree with the good god/creator sentiment and if you accept the concept of yin and yang in line with that then a being that is the opposite ie: satan, is possible. But hey, just a thought.. suppose the satanic figure is the good guy :) Anyway, interesting post. Thanks

       No worries my friend. There is a lot of stuff that we should be discussing here without all shouting down each other. Open and interesting dialogue is what attracts most people to this sub in the first place and I find that I have reached a lot of similar conclusions to you independently. So I guess have a lot of others who are maybe perhaps wary of being downvoted etc

       It's the fact that these people who believe in Satan know more than we do. So if they know more and are hiding a lot of it, why wouldn't they be trying to hide God as well?

       you're assuming they believe in satan, you're assuming they know more than we do, and you're assuming whatever they "know" is factual. I could be wrong, but there is no hard proof to any of these claims that I'm aware of

       Flat earth is sectors of earth saved in time. Like blocula or blackula. Old American Indian tales tell off flat disc like America. What do you think that was? A sector of time. Why do you think its PIZZA GATE? What does a pizza look like? Time loop sector with small sectors looped inside of it (always pepperoni.)

       No because its insider info. The Native American story was in a book i read about their folklore. That's the only thing I could think of linking.

       All that proves is that some equally inept people bought into the opposite side of the story. If God exists we have no way to comprehend what it really is.

       I am going to write something really far fetched here, it is not my personal believe but this is what  i picked up in many videos / forums and whatnot:
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything alive has the „godly“ and „conscious“ part in them. You can be positive or negative. Reality is far more then the 3 dimensions we exist in. If a being is positive enough and has mastered his mind he can somehow ascend into higher dimensions. As i understood it, there is a god that created this earth but also gods that created other worlds. Themselfes being created by other beings and so on until you finally reach the one god, the singularity, the whatver that compartmentalized himself snd gave consciousness to these parts, in order to experience creation and creativity and as a kind of test. The singularity god is like pure love/light/wisdom/positivity... in order for the compartmentalized parts to have free will, there is a dire need for an opposite force. So satan(any bad entity is there for a reason. They are there so humans can actively choose between the good and the evil while they exist in human form. In between earthly lives, the soul return to the earths soul (earth god?) and experience oneness. It is there that they can rejoin with their loved ones, access sll the memories from their live, their past lives and all the memories of the conscious-grid they belong to, if the others choose to share them. It is ones own choice to stay in this „afterlive“, „ascend to a higher dimension“ or „reincarnate“ again to test themselves again in an earthly live. While you incarnate on earth you normally dont have other memories but i think it ties in with some people being able to remeber past lives. For the bad entities: while in this afterlive, you can also actively choose to become a bad force, also serving the purpose of „god“ as the ultimate sacrifice to offer free will. Its merely just a role in their incarnation but also another test for themselves. Some fall to lover density dimension, some still ascend into higher dimension, even though it is harder for them to be all positive again afterwards. Demons are just lover density/ dimensional beings, wheres angels are higher dimensional beings or beings with higher frequency then us.

       So if someone wears a cross is it not safe to assume they believe in God? Especially if their actions support that assumption?
      </p>
      <p>
       That was me trying to tell you that they know more than we do. In response to you saying I'm just assuming they know more.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that last thing was me being sarcastic.
