    <div class="md"><p>Cohen means priest in Hebrew and is transliterated into many other languages as one of if not the most common European Jewish surnames meaning &quot;descendant of Aaron&quot; the high priest. </p>

<p>SBC&#39;s brother is also a very famous and highly influential psychologist, researcher, academic and writer on autism funnily enough...autism power has funnily enough featured quite prominently in the Q cult.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Simon Baron-Cohen FBA FBPsS (born 15 August 1958) is an English clinical psychologist, professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.[3] He is the Director of the University&#39;s Autism Research Centre,[4] and a Fellow of Trinity College.[3] In 1985 he formulated the mindblindness theory of autism, the evidence for which was collated in his 1995 book. In 1997, he formulated the fetal sex steroid theory of autism, the key test of which was published in 2015. He has also made major contributions to the fields of typical cognitive sex differences, autism prevalence and screening, autism genetics, autism neuroimaging, autism and technical ability, and synaesthesia&quot;</p>

<p>These people are playing high games indeed. </p>

<p>Milo and Gavin McInnes come to mind. I think even H3H3 have an element of reveling in and bringing to much more prominent attention than they usually deserve some of the more dysfunctional, anti-human losers that creep around the internet who if it wasn&#39;t for H3H3 I would have probably been psychologically better off not knowing about...but they wrap it up in a an oft hilarious, entertaining and unique kind of way so next thing you know you&#39;re more aware of some depraved fringe interwebz idiot than you&#39;d ever previously wanted to be.</p>

<p>Cohen means priest in Hebrew and is transliterated into many other languages as one of if not the most common European Jewish surname meaning &quot;descendant of Aaron&quot; the high priest. SBC&#39;s brother is also a very famous and highly influential psychologist, researcher, academic and writer on autism funnily enough...</p>

<p>&quot;Simon Baron-Cohen FBA FBPsS (born 15 August 1958) is an English clinical psychologist, professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.[3] He is the Director of the University&#39;s Autism Research Centre,[4] and a Fellow of Trinity College.[3] In 1985 he formulated the mindblindness theory of autism, the evidence for which was collated in his 1995 book. In 1997, he formulated the fetal sex steroid theory of autism, the key test of which was published in 2015. He has also made major contributions to the fields of typical cognitive sex differences, autism prevalence and screening, autism genetics, autism neuroimaging, autism and technical ability, and synaesthesia&quot;</p>

<p>These people are playing high games indeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was impressed with the first episode.  There has been a lot of hype about him pissing republicans off and the show didn&#39;t come off as purely a right wing hit job.  </p>

<p>However the GOP and gun nut people certainly came off the worst with the ridiculous support of an arming toddlers campaign.  The classic kids song turned into basically &quot;aim for the head, torso, not the toes&quot; had me rolling on the floor with the context of it being meant to teach 4 year olds where to aim, and yet the gun nuts were all about it.</p>

<p>The &quot;victims&quot; of this show might be pissed off but I think it can hold a much needed mirror up to the state of the modern USA.</p>

<p>In revealing His nature to Moses, God indicates His forgiving nature much more fully than He did in the Ten Commandments. God emphasizes mercy, “carrying sin” and extending lovingkindness far beyond the extent of punishment. Thus, Moses learns that God’s essence is not only His absolute Being and His absolute freedom, but His fundamental mercy. It is not surprising that the passage in which these attributes of God are detailed (Exod. 34:6‑7) became the cornerstone of the liturgy of forgiveness during the High Holy Day season.</p>

<p>In rabbinic Judaism, these ideas evolved into the concept of the two attributes of God, the attribute of justice and the attribute of mercy, the latter being the dominant mode of God’s activity. The Mesillat Yesharim [an 18th century work of ethical literature] suggested that the attribute of mercy means that God gives respite to the sinner, not meting out His full punishment at once, but granting the sinner the opportunity to repent and thus be rid of the power of the evil inclination.</p>

<p>he knows, i&#39;m sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude is <em>over</em>. People don&#39;t like him. He&#39;s a fringe &quot;entertainer&quot; now and his past couple movies, &quot;Bruno&quot; and &quot;The Brothers&quot; whatever, were huge flops. </p>

<p>Another misanthropic asshole--like Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer--Hollywood seems determined to cram down our throat even though no one likes them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, like lampooning poor immigrant ghetto kids as idiots(as Ali G), getting a bar of drunk rednecks to begrudgingly cheer along with his inane &quot;Throw the jew down the well&quot;(as &quot;Borat&quot;), and some other stunt he pulled in Palestine that I can&#39;t remember the details of- - and then there was that anti-Qaddafi &quot;comedy&quot; that came out right before qaddafi was murdered with the help of Clinton.</p>

<p>He is literally the idle rich, who chose a life of art rather than banking, but his high breeding has made him acquiesce to &quot;charity&quot; in his mature years in order to feel useful, so he&#39;s now trying to be some sort comedic ideologue in charge of official demonization. He should&#39;ve stuck to his man on the street capering. </p>

<p>Anyway he probably has regular meetings with Cass Sunstein et al where they discuss their current cultural hit list. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cohen&#39;s business model is as imaginative as Kim Kardashian&#39;s. His trick is he gets people mad enough to want to punch him in the face. The wonder is he does with this some people who aren&#39;t worth suing. I wonder if he knows that in most American municipalities there isn&#39;t really any law against a grown man punching another grown man in the face. I have met more than three Europeans who were very surprised to learn this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s pretty interesting....</p>

<p>I’ve been wondering for a while if the folks behind Q have been documenting their progress from behind the scenes... playing a long game to expose the rise of the various cults of personality in the US. However, I do wonder about what the liability would be... it is literally only a matter of time before one of these crazy fucks finally tries to start the civil war the neckbeards have been talking about for a while now. I assume that they will all continue to hang on to their delusions even when their promised day of reckoning for the “Deep State” doesn’t happen... <em>however</em>, it is quite clear that there are a number of full on schizophrenic individuals who regularly post there; I just don’t see this ending well whether or not the real individuals behind Q go public or not.</p>
