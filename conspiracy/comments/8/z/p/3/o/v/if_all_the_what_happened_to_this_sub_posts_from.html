       I suspected that those posts were to distract from Trumps embarrassing display yesterday on the world stage. I saw multiple people calling out Trump for his support of Putin being labelled “neocons” and “warmongers” to even consider believing the validity of IC evidence that Russia made a coordinated effort to meddle in 2016 election. Now that Trump has once again pulled a 180, claiming he now DOES believe the evidence brought forth by U.S. intelligence, you would think the same people would be calling Trump a neocon and warmonger. I guess we’ll see within the day of those posts were actually organic, or if they were just to distract from Trump being spineless while in the presence of Putin.

       I find it weird how that never used to be an issue when it was all Hillary and Bill and Podesta stuff. But now that the magnifying glass is on the party of Russian traitors, suddenly it's all "They're all the same!" - which is literally a stated goal of russian propaganda, to get the populace to believe there's no difference between the political parties. I can't tell who's a well meaning, but manipulated useful idiot and who is getting paid to push propaganda. Not that it really matters.

       I’d also like a source on the Russian propaganda goal, however, I hope you’re not questioning the first half of the quoted text that you copied. There are users on here enough to see these posts pop up, and it rarely occurs when the democratic party is being discussed, period. If you aren’t on this sub frequently enough to see that trend, now you know, it is a sad reality and very blatant distraction to derail from the criticisms of the GOP and the current administration.

       I'm not sure I agree with the trend you're describing, either. Frankly I sympathize quite heavily with the recent chain of "what happened to this sub" posts. It's asinine lately how many here on a conspiracy forum have had to be reminded that intelligence agencies are in the business of lying and that taking unsubstantiated allegations from them at face value is a bad idea

       I agree that U.S. intelligence has lied before, so if we’re constantly talking about meddling and collusion, maybe instead of taking sides right away we can determine for ourselves who has the motive to lie. What are they getting out of it? Those questions seem to easily be answered when discussing 9/11, WMD’s, etc. If you can’t trust any sources involved, maybe determine for yourself who is benefitting and how?

       Both the American and Russian governments each have motives to lie and a history of doing so. While I like your train of thought regarding
       <em>
        cui bono

       , I do feel that such an analysis is challenging to objectively accomplish as it is subject to considerable influence by ones bias and can be quickly turn into an exercise od speculative mindreading.

       I'd really just prefer that those making allegations show the base of evidence behind them, and people should reserve judgment until we have that testable evidence

       Most evidence in the Russia investigation will come out in do time, but until then, all we can do is speculate I suppose. Speculation in the spirit of conspiracy-minded individuals, so I don’t see how any of the discussion surrounding the investigations is counter-productive.

       I don't mean to say that that sort of discussion is necessarily counter-productive, and this forum is certainly one of the apt places for it. I simply mean that it's not a very conclusive approach, and one that is particularly limited by ones biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW, I think one of the most critical motives for both Russia and the US for a number of recent confrontations have been related to an economic rivalry over pipelines and gas exports. I'm also painfully aware that this investigation into Russian interference has granted an excuse to allow the DNC to avoid any introspection or reform after its rigging its primary in 2016, but as a slighted ex-Bernie supporter I recognize that's some of that bias I was mentioning.

       Trump didn't handle the presser as well as he could have but he hardly did anything worth calling a coup over, which Brennan and certain Congressmen actually did. That shit is insane, dangerous, and needs to stop.

       Not everyone here believes in Russian collusion, but that doesn't make us Trump supporters. There's more at stake here than his Admin and the dreams of the Neolib Corporatists who control the Party at the moment. Let them fight their battles based on lies. Those of us trying to change the Party and the country will continue doing what we've been doing.

       I'm not a Conservative. I'm a Progressive. And we're working to change the Dem Party from the ground up. We've already taken 8 State Parties from the Corporatists, are about to change how Super Delegates work at the Convention, and are already showing signs of strength with grassroots wins from candidates like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.
      </p>
      <p>
       My desired outcome is Social Democracy, not 3rd Way Democratic politics.

       Wow, that is awesome. Pm me if there is anything I can do to lend my support. The democratic party is in shambles, I agree. I also believe that the GOP is too far gone to correct, based on their unflinching support of Trump. A revamp of the DNC seems to be the best shot we have at fighting corruption that most people in this sub are well aware takes place on both sides.

       I would check out r/wayofthebern if you are interested in getting fresh news on the struggle against the Corporatists on all sides. It's a fantastic sub that keeps the spirit that was r/sandersforpresident alive, ever sicne S4P got shut down at the behest of HRC's campaign and then reopened under suspicious circumstances.

       I could be one of those people that "defends" Trump.  Mostly because I dont see proof yet that Trump colluded with the Russians.  I do see allegations that once presented in court and defended by lawyers may turn out to be evidence enough.  But as of now it is a collection of allegations put together by the state in an indictment of Russians that most likely will never see court.  The last ones didnt.  However, if it goes to court I will watch with an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I think he is somewhat of a Neocon.  Bombin Syria with no evidence, twice.  Illegally (just like all presidents) and his move with the Israeli embassy are two disdain able things I can think of off the top of my head.  If the left had the balls to impeach him over illegal bombings and missile strikes I would be all for it.  But every president does that.  So would have Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just cant get onboard with this new religion of Russia hatred.  Its a sideshow.

       Definitely seems like a distraction, over these past few days this sub has been flooded with Trump defense and regurgitated Hillary attacks (which would be fine if they added something new after the 10th repost or sourced their claims).

       What's weird is the amount of people who will immediately call a brigade when it's one side, but then go and support the brigade when another side does it.

       Well yeah if the attack is always the same old unsourced nonsense the defense doesn't change. It really sucks that pointing out an argument has nothing backing it up is considered defending Hillary to some people, plenty of us hate her but also hate seeing this sub parrot lies.

       I think it’s like why are we so political here lately. We are not against each other we are against the establishment and elites who want to poison us, distracts us, indoctrinate our kids, steel our hard earned money,  hide the truth from us, and control our every thought.

       Well, in fairness to the organic users of this sub, we've always questioned IC motivations irrespective of the political party or person at the helm. Can you point to any public info from IC that wasn't eventually proven false or misleading? A lot of us are still rolling our eyes at the Russian narrative and you can see from my history that I'm as far from a Trump supporter as can be. It's the same way I feel when we hear that Assad has inexplicably gassed more citizens... it all reeks of manufactured consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think there's a level of frustration from regular users at the brigading and/or inorganic activity here that's causing a swell of "WTF is going on anymore?" threads. Anyway, that's how I see it. I'm a real user, I'm not pro-Trump, I'm probably more pro-Russian than pro-US at this point just based on what I've learned over the years about our ceaseless imperialism, but I still want the best for my fellow Americans. I would definitely have written one of these posts because it's disturbing to see people lining up for their propaganda feedings.

       You can see how this works out in the mod log, notice how certain users tend to have more leniency and others get banned for very little. Certain users will get 3 day bans after multiple bans and others get insta permabanned. Sometimes you'll see a ban for a reason that isn't even listed as a rule.

       Without replying to any specific comment, I just want to say I’m very glad I made this post. Seeing different opinions on the subject with justified reasoning and without political bias is refreshing, and is honestly the best discussion I have seen on this sub all day. I can’t help but think the reason is because Trump supporters are still getting their talking points together after his 180 flip earlier today, but I suppose that’s not relevant to my sentiment.

       I feel like Trump felt like he had to say he accepts our IAs assessment that Russia meddled in our election, whatever that means. Its so vague that it doesn't really matter. He clearly doesn't believe that their supposed "meddling" was in any way significant, if he even believes it at all.

       But anyway, your conspiracy is that people who question all the shilling in this sub are themselves shills? Sounds a lot like gaslighting to me, which is a common shill tactic.

       I don’t think they are “shills” just misguided trump supporters looking to distract and steer the narrative when Trump does something that even they can’t actively defend. It happens every time he is in the news for something major, like the breaking up families, etc.

       I can tell you from experience that is not a sudden influx. The only reason I still frequent this sub is to see trump supporters get criticized for their tribalistic support. That happens in literally every thread, except for after the summit, which has been very strange. Once I saw that Trump reneged his support of Russia over U.S. intelligence I figured I should mention the odd “both parties are the same” arguments that you only see here when the Trump Administration is massively fucking up.

       No need to be hostile. I’ve been frequenting this sub since I made my 1st Reddit account in 2011. It’s the first time I questioned the official narrative of 9/11 and damn I loved this sub back then, still have love for it (I mention why I still frequent this sub in another comment in the thread) even thought it’s brigaded often by T_D. I’m curious, what leads you to believe my intentions are illegitimate? You are the first person to attack me in this thread, so I assume you think you know something that other people in the thread don’t. Please, do tell.

       As I’m sure you can guess, this sub gets nonstop “wtf is with the sub” from both sides every day. Most certainly every time some “earth shattering news” comes out. And every single one of them are the same accusations depending on the person posting. It resolves nothing. So when I see them posted by a user that is not a regular here, I know the functionality of the sub is not the reason for posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t assume I know anything. I know this sub and I know you are not a regular here. So your “what happened here” post is nothing more than a way for you to dig at the users here that support the president. Creating more divisive rhetoric.

       Let’s start at your last point. There should be zero organic users on this sub that SUPPORT the Trump administration, you should already understand why these two are mutually exclusive.

       To address your previous point, I just said I’m a regular here lol, are you dense? You are the only one in this thread blatantly derailing discussion, so you should stop projecting and go back to T_D where criticizing people for being Trump supporters is forbidden. Otherwise, contribute to meaningful discussion instead of accusing me of different things you have no proof of.

       Assuming this is one of your alts? Because again, you are he only one attacking my legitimacy in this thread lol. It is the only reason I still come here every day, yes. I don’t like echo chambers, I appreciate good discussion. It just so happens that Trump supporters always have their heads up their asses so they are the ones that get slammed with hard evidence of which they have no coherent rebuttal. The constant brigading sucks, but the reason stated above is my favorite part of this subreddit. Why that somehow makes me you think that I’m an inorganic user I have no idea.

       I mean, I really just think that Trump is trying to save face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did russian meddle in our election? Idk. The CIA or FBI is claiming they did. But can you trust what those organizations say? Where's the evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       How many times have they been wrong in the past and given us false information that we found is untrue years later? WMD? False. NSA? False.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are anti-establishment and the CIA and FBI are establishment. They have an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand people hate Trump and want to think that Russia "meddled" in our election. I feel like the bottom line is that information was release (doesn't matter by who) and it was damming to Clinton. Maybe she shouldn't be so crooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are we focused on who released the information rather than why the information was so damming for her campaign?

       Trump isn’t any better than Clinton if you listen to what he says when he speaks, read what he tweets, and analyze his policies. Forget what MSM has to say about him, supporting Trump at this point isn’t justified by any means. There is no arguing that he is somehow anti-establishment unless your support is  unwavering in the face of, well, most things he has done and said since he was inaugurated.

       So people that think this sub should not be political and only be about conspiracies should take a political stance against Donald Trump, a political puppet? I don’t think you understand what those posts are about. One of the biggest conspiracies is our mainstream media and politics are tools that distract people from our real enemies. So no don’t want to see people talking shit on Trump or praising him. That’s the point of those posts.

       That's funny, I also got a funny feeling from the "what happened to this sub" posts. I couldn't figure out what they might have been doing with it though. I've guessed before that shills sometimes themselves openly complain about the obvious shilling, because they actually want everyone to know that they're trolling us, but that's not quite the impression I was getting from those recent ones.

       I agree that U.S. intelligence has lied before, so if we’re constantly talking about meddling and collusion, maybe instead of taking sides right away we can determine for ourselves who has the motive to lie. What are they getting out of it? Those questions seem to easily be answered when discussing 9/11, WMD’s, etc. If you can’t trust any sources involved, maybe determine for yourself who is benefitting and how?
