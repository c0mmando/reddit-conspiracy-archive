<p>Those cancer researchers should lose any credentials they have if they are claiming that diet alone can cure cancer. Especially since no known cure for cancer exists. There is some positive research but it is far from conclusive and is extremely irresponsible of anyone claiming to be a medical professional to tout diet alone or even in combination with CBD to be a cure for anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prob came off the wrong way with saying that but with certain types of cancer and depending on what stages they are at, they do state yes it will, depending on how clean one is eating. Now they arent telling patients this because everyone knows that the medical industry is technology driven and yes they will lose thier credentials. But I bet if the newer attendings were to be diagnosed with cancer, they would stay away from the newest ways hospitals are treating patients. I guarantee the first thing they would do is to seek out a integrative nutritional specialist/dietitian/nutritionist. And with CBD, I bet if you dropped a mass of cancer cells into a bucket of CBD oil, you would see it fall apart and disintegrate.</p>

<p>OP is absolutely justified suggesting a conspiracy here. there are many confirmed medical conspiracies, the syphilis-study on black men in the south USA is only one. </p>

<p>I saw a medical book on &quot;Breast cancer&quot; that had a photo-series that illustrated the &quot;development of breast cancer&quot;; this poor woman&#39;s breasts were photographed looking swollen to literally blossoming with tumors--why didn&#39;t they perform a mastectomy? To document &quot;the progression of the disease&quot; probably. The woman was black, of course.</p>

<p>Cannabis is another medical conspiracy, as noted by other commenters here. Cannabis was recognized by many famous, published physicians in the 19th century for its obvious medical applications, and well, we know what happened...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t necessarily believe it, but supposedly keto is a ‘cure’ for almost all cancers (except for one specific brain cancer that it speeds up), and that’s why the FDA doesn’t want people eating that way. In theory it does slow cancer cells down, but I don’t think you can conclude it ‘cures’ it though.</p>

<p>It does put type 2 diabetes in pure remission though (if done <em>very</em> specifically - they can’t just do normal keto) - , and was the original treatment for it before insulin was synthesized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you’re looking for source context to this you can investigate John Rockefeller and his foundational involvement with the American Medical Association, the Flexner Report of 1910 and its fallout, IG Farben and the FDA. That seems to be where most of the “medical-industrial complex” of the present originates, seemingly, the argument being that JDR PR-wrangled the US medical standards into being supported by his business interests (or: JDR created reliance on evidence-based medical standards). Either way it made sellable cures, that JDR could supply, the standard, and created a gigantic new industry rife for opportunism.</p>

<p>As for controlling academic science to further propagate reliance on these standards, some large corporations have histories of filtering and directing academic and medical research through overt means such as through training sponsorship, board management and philanthropy (that is, philanthropy IF you support a conclusion, ie a bribe). </p>

<p>This is if you see science as something “just,” which IMO already means you are reliant on a symbol as truth without inspection of its realities (being a category as manipulatable as any other). Rationalism has made “science” abstract a catch-all for legitimacy unfortunately - “suggests scientists.”</p>

<p>Also might be worth understanding why someone would suggest humanity is a cancer on the planet organism, the eugenics programs of the 20th century (incl. history of abortion clinics and their business interests like Proctor &amp; Gamble), and inevitably vaccines and chem-trails for further context to this line of thinking, which ends in a perspective of enslavement and intentional handicapping of populations for control, not just profit. I can’t say if that’s true, but it’s easy to see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine how profitable it would be to be a company with a global cure for all cancers. There&#39;s just not a financial argument that makes sense to motivate hiding the panacea.</p>

<p>There are thousands and thousands of people going into work every day in labs, exhausting themselves trying to make just one incremental contribution that will help someone with cancer. Many got into the field after having relatives die. They also die from cancers. Many choose lower paid jobs to stay in research. Cancers are complicated, but we know more about them now than ever before. </p>

<p>Huge progress has been made recently with advances in immunotherapy, built on decades of research and hard work. It&#39;s a hugely exciting time in the field as there is constant news of immunotherapy being successfully used for the first time for various cancer subtypes.   </p>

<p>People looking to profit off of other people&#39;s pain by necessity have to discredit cancer researchers in order to successfully fool people into buying their simple answers. This is the bullshit. It&#39;s the seed of doubt that gets someone with an easily treatable cancer to delay conventional treatment until it&#39;s too late, all while lining the pockets of these soothsayer with tens of thousands of dollars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably possible for a large majority of cancers to be cured &quot;naturally&quot; with just diet and lifestyle changes, and maybe using nutrition therapy. A smaller amount probably requires more aggressive measures like various easily produced drugs. A smaller still fraction is probably difficult to cure altogether. So a majority of cancer patients are probably just being treated to keep the health care industry running.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PhD in biochemistry here. The conspiracy that there is a single cure out there for cancer is bullshit. I don&#39;t really feel like going into a ton of detail in my explanation but the reason for cancer not having a viable cure is that every kind is different. Each type of cancer (skin, breast, etc) generally has its own unique type of insults and within a single type of cancer can have lots of variation as well. This is the reason that certain drugs work on specific cancers and drugs that work for some people do not work for others. So as for a small molecule or drug that cures cancer: you will never see it. There is quite a bit of research into training your immune system to recognize self cancer better. These are mostly in the research stages and some are in clinical trials. This is the best chance at a &#39;cure&#39;. </p>

<p>People who make the claims that we are putting billions of dollars into reseat and seeing nothing are also wrong. We have made significant research and drug gains through this funding. What needs to be considered is that these treatments should not be looked at as a cure, but an extension on life. People may have terminal cancers that don&#39;t respond to treatments, but there is a high proportion that do and the patients get another 5-10 years of life, sometimes longer. Cancer is a combination of mutations and things going wrong in the perfect way. When cancer comes back, it&#39;s usually terminal since not all the original cells were destroyed, spread elsewhere and now have picked up additional mutations and features that are harder to remove or treat. </p>

<p>So yeah, the claim there is a cure is bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its partly true i imagine, however given the vast array of cancers possible within the human body and the various stages and disease cofactors no cure could be a panacea. </p>

<p>On the alternative side Vitamin C in high dose intravenously or liposomal sodium ascorbate (vit c), coupled with d3 along with some other crucial minerals and an expertly selected restriction diet seems like something worth looking at. </p>

<p>Certainly there is plenty of evidence that pharmaceutical companies are not interested in cures if they cannot patent them - they are definitely interested, almost exclusively, in finding methods of relieving symptoms and providing ongoing locked in subscriptions to certain drugs that they have patented.  </p>

<p>For every major disease there seems to be an ongoing schedule attached which just happens to be the most profitable model imaginable with a cure being the least profitable model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I see why the youtube guy from the first post was talking about the two articles as if they tested blood from vegan diets. </p>

<p>When Greger talks about those two studies, he describes them both as testing a &#39;plant-based diet&#39;, although they actually tested blood from an omnivorous diet with high vegetable, low meat (the Pritikin diet). Since he was talking about veganism before, it leads the audience into believing that he&#39;s still talking about studies on vegan diets. It&#39;s definitely presented confusingly enough that the youtuber thought that all the studies were on the properties of vegan blood. So that&#39;s where that was coming from.</p>
