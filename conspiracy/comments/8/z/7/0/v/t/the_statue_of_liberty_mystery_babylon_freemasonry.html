       The Mother of Exiles and the Destruction of Babylon
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always thought Mystery Babylon in Revelations was America. Lots of signs point to that. Inanna/Ishtar was known as the Whore of Babylon and Mother of Prostitutes because she supposedly started the practice of sacred prostitution. Inanna was the goddess of love, beauty, sex, desire, fertility, war, combat, justice, and political power.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_prostitution">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_prostitution
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sacred prostitution, temple prostitution, cult prostitution,[1] and religious prostitution are general terms for a sexual rite consisting of sexual intercourse or other sexual activity performed in the context of religious worship, perhaps as a form of fertility rite or divine marriage (hieros gamos). Some scholars prefer the term sacred sex to sacred prostitution in cases where payment for services was not involved.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But some scholars believe that this practice never existed and has been misunderstood.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The practice of sacred prostitution has not been substantiated in any Ancient Near Eastern cultures, despite many popular descriptions of the habit.[7] Through the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of sacred marriage rite or hieros gamos was staged between the king of a Sumerian city-state and the High Priestess of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, but no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included. Along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers there was a temple of Eanna, meaning house of heaven[8] dedicated to Inanna in the Eanna District of Uruk.
        <br/>
        This will be relevant in my next post about the source of Yahweh's narcissism but for now, I'm just using this to illustrate part of the reason I think America is Babylon.

       The Statue of Liberty is a representation of the Roman goddess Libertas. Which is a goddess that derived from many other goddesses: Inanna, Ishtar, Isis, Aphrodite, Venus, etc. Ultimately this goddess was transformed in a personification of America and liberty called Columbia. And just like Inanna, is it any wonder America seems to have 2 split sides to it? One side that is sexually repressed and all about virtue. And another that is obsessed with sex, violence, war

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the fact that the way Babylon is described sounds a lot like America. Getting the whole world drunk on our luxuries and riches, being arrogant and being fools who know nothing. This sounds like America too.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Sumerians worshipped Inanna as the goddess of both warfare and sexuality. Unlike other gods, whose roles were static and whose domains were limited, the stories of Inanna describe her as moving from conquest to conquest. She was portrayed as young and impetuous, constantly striving for more power than she had been allotted.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Inanna also was depicted as riding a Lion and she associated with the planet Venus.

       Regulus is a part of the constellation Leo and considered "the heart of the lion". Considering Regulus is a very important star in Trump's birth chart apparently, and that star was known as The King in Babylon (known as the little king as well in other places), that would make Trump the King of Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2014, Regulus was eclipsed by an asteroid for 14 seconds right over New York.

        An asteroid will pass directly in front of Regulus, one of the brightest stars in our night sky, next Wednesday — briefly blacking out the star in what astronomers are calling a “once in a lifetime” event. Better yet, New York City falls directly within the viewing path which is literally paper-thin on the earths scale. The event is so small, and so brief, that it will only be visible over a sliver of area. And this area happens to encompass millions of people in New York City, Northeast NJ and Long Island.

       <p>
        On Thursday, March 20 2014, Regulus will participate in a rare celestial event when an asteroid passes directly in front of the star, as seen from Earth. The asteroid in question is 163 Erigone. Asteroid 163 Erigone is about 45 miles (72 km) wide, but its "shadow" slanting to Earth's surface will be 67 miles (108 km) wide.
       </p>
       <p>
        Erigone's shadow will move on a southeast-to-northwest trajectory and will extend from New York City as well as western and central Long Island to Oswego in New York State, and then continues northwest, the length of Ontario to the Hudson Bay shore of Manitoba. Those who are within the shadow path and watching at just the right moment with just their eyes will see an amazing sight: Regulus will seem to abruptly disappear as if a switch had been thrown, blotted out by the tiny invisible asteroid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regulus will remain invisible for up to 14 seconds (for those situated along the center of the path); an incredible, albeit very brief occurrence.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. 4 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. 5 The name written on her forehead was a mystery:
       </p>
       <p>
        15 Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. 16 The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. 17 For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority, until God’s words are fulfilled. 18 The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”

Thankfully, no one pursued that strange promise, which would have led to the odd experience of walking in New York and suddenly hearing the Statue of Liberty “talking.”

       <p>
        The sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi designed the statue to be fully illuminated, a feature that’s suggested in its official name, “La Liberté Eclairant le Monde,” or “Liberty Enlightening the World.” (At first the Statue of Liberty doubled as a lighthouse, given its position in the New York Harbor, but that didn’t last: It was decommissioned as such in 1902.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Originally the lighting scheme was to be red, white, and blue—with a giant searchlight trained on the statue’s face and shoulders. Officials claimed in 19th-century newspaper accounts that they would make the statue so bright as to cast a glow on the clouds of the night sky 100 miles away. The statue’s face was to be lit by a reflector so bright that newspapers described it as “4 million candle power.” Her diadem was meant to sparkle with electric light. These were lofty goals in the dawn of the electrical age, and they carried symbolism that has lost much of its potency now that electricity is taken for granted.

       In the torch, the flames are covered in gold. Looks enough like a cup. Also, in Isaiah 14:12 (another prophecy detailing the fall of Babylon that I didn't bother copying and pasting all of here) it refers to Babylon (or it's king) as "Lucifer, son of the morning". Lucifer means "light bringer" (hence the torch and the statue's original name being Liberty Enlightening the World) or "morning star" which is another name for the planet Venus which is associated with Inanna/Ishtar.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       We're a very diverse country and Lady Liberty represents us taking in people from all countries. We pretty much control the world (for now) as the 7 hills represents the 7 continents, which is literally what is said they represent. Plus she's literally sitting on an island in the water.

       The creator of the Statue of Liberty,  Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, was a Freemason and they placed this plaque at the base of the statue.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Masonic theories abound about the Statue of Liberty’s connection to the masons. Those who do ascribe to the theory cite Bartholdi’s and Eiffel’s membership in the Freemasons, that many original plans for the statue demonstrate the link and that many elements of the statue carry symbolic meaning.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the masons presided over the cornerstone laying for the Statue of Liberty, a moment commemorated in a 1984 plaque in dedication to the masons on the 100th anniversary. In 1884, the grand master William A. Brodie laid the cornerstone with grand lodge members present. Brodie is reported to have said, “Why call upon the Masonic Fraternity to lay the cornerstone of such a structure as is here to be erected? No institution has done more to promote liberty and to free men from the trammels and chains of ignorance and tyranny than has Freemasonry.”

This season is suppose to be bad and FEMA is saying they are completely unprepared. I'm sure that wasn't on purpose or anything. I think maybe a big earthquake might happen soon too in the next month. Seeing a lot of weird shit. A lot of polarity with the planets and asteroids. I think it's all connected to our polarity as the Trump Delusion continues. You seeing these reports and videos of these racist people just saying mean shit to people all over the place now for no reason? They're lashing out because they're scared their delusion bubble might burst so they're acting out. It's only going to escalate until both sides completely lose their fucking minds.

        We have read about it. And now it is here, in front of our faces. And many are IGNORING it.

       <p>
        How we got here is an aside, but here we are. The disease is Hillary, and the medicine is Trump. For most folks, that’s all that matters. Case closed. What most citizens do not realize is that this is all a ruse. A mirage.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is being carried by, “they.”

        “They” are using the illusion, because America was stationary and stubborn.

        “You can’t New World Order me!” Americans said, “…Because we know about you.”

        some of the citizens heard a few radio shows that told them, “we’re gonna win.”
       </p>

        Hegel’s dialectic utilizes the “mirage.” And then steers the people through its house of mirrors with scary monsters. In America’s case, the monster is a short woman with a trucker’s voice named Hillary. Their task is simple. Globalism. But how do they get there?
       </p>
       <p>
        Simple:

       <p>
        Scare them with the Thesis – Hillary / the Enemy of Freedom.
       </p>

        And offset her with the Anti-thesis – Donald the Lion-Hearted / Champion of the People.

       They say this is a double headed eagle, it's not. It's a double headed Phoenix. And it's the symbol of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonary.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “The Double Headed Eagle of Lagash” is the oldest Royal Crest in the World… No emblematic device of today can boast of such antiquity. Its origin has been traced to the ancient city of Lagash. It was in use a thousand years before the Exodus from Egypt and more than two thousand years before the building of “King Solomon’s Temple.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “As time rolled on, it passed from the Sumerians to the men of Akkad, from the men of Akkad to the Hittites, from the denizens of Asia Minor to the Seljukian Sultans from whom it was brought by the Crusaders to the Emperors of the East and West, whose successors were the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “In recent excavations, the city-emblem of Lagash was disclosed also as a lion headed eagle sinking his claws into the bodies of two lions standing back to back. This is evidently a variant of the other eagle symbol”.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The city of Lagash is in Sumer in Southern Babylonia, between the Euphrates and the Tigris and near the modern Shatra in Iraq, Lagash had a calendar of twelve lunar months, a system of weights and measures, a banking and accounting system and was a center of art, literature, military and political power, five thousand years before Christ”.
       </p>
       <p>
        “In 102 B.C. the Roman Consul Marius decreed that the Eagle be displayed as a symbol of Imperial Rome. Later, as a world power, Rome used the Double-Headed Eagle, one head facing the East the other facing the West, symbolizing the universality and unity of the Empire. The Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire continued its use and the symbol was adopted later in Germany during the halcyon days of conquest and imperial power”.
       </p>
       <p>
        So far as is known, the Double-Headed Eagle was first used in Freemasonry in 1758 by a Masonic Body in Paris – the Emperors of the East and West. During a brief period the Masonic Emperors of the East and West controlled the advanced degrees then in use and became a precursor of the “Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Latin caption under the Double-Headed Eagle – “Spes Mea in Deo Est” translated is “My Hope Is In God”.

       So it represented the universality and unity of the Empire of Rome and was later adopted by Germany during their days of conquest and imperial power. For these Freemasons, it represents two emperors, one from the east and one from the west coming together to create one empire. Hmm.. I wonder if that has any significance to today's world.

       </p>
       <p>
        An eagle on a country’s coat of arms is quite common – this bird is as popular a national symbol as the lion. “He is the king of birds; just like the lion is believed to rule all animals, and he is associated with the cult of the sun,” Georgy Vilinbakhov, head of Russia’s Heraldic Council, explains.

         Title of article: Get Ready for the Phoenix
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        THIRTY years from now, Americans, Japanese, Europeans, and people in many other rich countries, and some relatively poor ones will probably be paying for their shopping with the same currency. Prices will be quoted not in dollars, yen or D-marks but in, let’s say, the phoenix. The phoenix will be favoured by companies and shoppers because it will be more convenient than today’s national currencies, which by then will seem a quaint cause of much disruption to economic life in the last twentieth century.
        <br/>
        –
        <br/>
        At the beginning of 1988 this appears an outlandish prediction. Proposals for eventual monetary union proliferated five and ten years ago, but they hardly envisaged the setbacks of 1987. The governments of the big economies tried to move an inch or two towards a more managed system of exchange rates – a logical preliminary, it might seem, to radical monetary reform. For lack of co-operation in their underlying economic policies they bungled it horribly, and provoked the rise in interest rates that brought on the stock market crash of October. These events have chastened exchange-rate reformers. The market crash taught them that the pretence of policy co-operation can be worse than nothing, and that until real co-operation is feasible (i.e., until governments surrender some economic sovereignty) further attempts to peg currencies will flounder.
        <br/>
        …
        <br/>
        The new world economy
        <br/>
        The biggest change in the world economy since the early 1970’s is that flows of money have replaced trade in goods as the force that drives exchange rates. as a result of the relentless integration of the world’s financial markets, differences in national economic policies can disturb interest rates (or expectations of future interest rates) only slightly, yet still call forth huge transfers of financial assets from one country to another. These transfers swamp the flow of trade revenues in their effect on the demand and supply for different currencies, and hence in their effect on exchange rates. As telecommunications technology continues to advance, these transactions will be cheaper and faster still. With unco-ordinated economic policies, currencies can get only more volatile.
        <br/>
        ….
        <br/>
        In all these ways national economic boundaries are slowly dissolving. As the trend continues, the appeal of a currency union across at least the main industrial countries will seem irresistible to everybody except foreign-exchange traders and governments. In the phoenix zone, economic adjustment to shifts in relative prices would happen smoothly and automatically, rather as it does today between different regions within large economies (a brief on pages 74-75 explains how.) The absence of all currency risk would spur trade, investment and employment.
        <br/>
        –
        <br/>
        The phoenix zone would impose tight constraints on national governments. There would be no such thing, for instance, as a national monetary policy. The world phoenix supply would be fixed by a new central bank, descended perhaps from the IMF. The world inflation rate – and hence, within narrow margins, each national inflation rate- would be in its charge. Each country could use taxes and public spending to offset temporary falls in demand, but it would have to borrow rather than print money to finance its budget deficit. With no recourse to the inflation tax, governments and their creditors would be forced to judge their borrowing and lending plans more carefully than they do today. This means a big loss of economic sovereignty, but the trends that make the phoenix so appealing are taking that sovereignty away in any case. Even in a world of more-or-less floating exchange rates, individual governments have seen their policy independence checked by an unfriendly outside world.
        <br/>
        –
        <br/>
        As the next century approaches, the natural forces that are pushing the world towards economic integration will offer governments a broad choice. They can go with the flow, or they can build barricades. Preparing the way for the phoenix will mean fewer pretended agreements on policy and more real ones. It will mean allowing and then actively promoting the private-sector use of an international money alongside existing national monies. That would let people vote with their wallets for the eventual move to full currency union. The phoenix would probably start as a cocktail of national currencies, just as the Special Drawing Right is today. In time, though, its value against national currencies would cease to matter, because people would choose it for its convenience and the stability of its purchasing power.
        <br/>
        …..
        <br/>
        The alternative – to preserve policymaking autonomy- would involve a new proliferation of truly draconian controls on trade and capital flows. This course offers governments a splendid time. They could manage exchange-rate movements, deploy monetary and fiscal policy without inhibition, and tackle the resulting bursts of inflation with prices and incomes polices. It is a growth-crippling prospect. Pencil in the phoenix for around 2018, and welcome it when it comes.

        Anyways, I opened the link (don’t open links from strangers) and watched the video in Youtube, (it’s in Spanish)
       </p>
       <p>
        @limon claims in the video (minute 5) that he actually found a not so well know cryptocurrency (yet) by doing some research on an article from 1988 and he is somehow convinced it’s going to be huge. Yes, @limon saw the writing and thought maybe I should check this and find out which is the coin of the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        As crazy as it seems, finding a cryptocurrency by doing research on a 1988 magazine its quite incredible. Is it a coincidence or is it a prediction? Not even @limon knows, but there’s a few things that can blow up your mind here.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the article from 1988. It claims that there will be a currency (referred as “phoenix”) that will be used by everybody in several countries in 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        So yes, you all might say “the coin is called the Phoenix”. There’s actually a coin called Phoenixcoin but that didn’t seem to convince @limon once he checked it out in
        <a href="http://www.coinmarketcap.com/">
         www.coinmarketcap.com
        </a>
        (it sucked even for @limon who wanted to believe with all his heart)
       </p>
       <p>
        But @limon didn’t give up, he thought what if its hidden? So he decided to take a closer look at the magazine cover.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        He noticed that he could read the letters backward (um…interesting)
       </p>
       <p>

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        He got XIN3ONd NET by reading the cover letter backwards and he said well, XIN is Chinese, and found out in google translator that XIN meant NEW.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then 3ONd he looked at it and thought this is Russian… and it was. That weird word that would not mean anything to someone meant something for @limon so he decided to google translate it.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bHTMmYx_Xq2Xuui5nS3hFg.png">

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Well yeah 3ONd is Russian and means ZOI, but wait is this a coin? @Limon decided to search “ZOI” in
        <a href="http://www.coinmarketcap.com/">
         www.coinmarketcap.com
        </a>
        .

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        WOW, Zoin existed. He ended up with the sentence NEW ZOI NET, in which Zoi was an actual currency.
       </p>
       <p>
        He starting searching now all about Zoin (DYOR) and liked everything he saw. The team, the community and development its very much updated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Got even more carried away when he saw Zoin’s logo:
       </p>

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        And when he researched even deeper, he found out that ZOIN was left by its first developer and got taken over by its community from all over the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes, Zoin emerged from the ashes. What? wait. Zoin is also a Phoenix.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyways, @limon found all the signs of a prophecy from 1988.
       </p>
       <p>
        He couldn’t wait so he joined Zoin’s community and shared his video.
       </p>
       <p>
        By the way he bought some Zoin. After finding the last lost prophecy he had no plans on missing out.

       Notice the year on the coin and at the end of the article, 2018. "Pencil in the phoenix for around 2018, and welcome it when it comes". Trump and Russia both have a double headed Phoenix signifying the union of an Empire. This article talks about a one world currency called "Phoenix" coming in 2018. The number 10 upside down is 01. It's a bit on a coin

       I posted about an Israeli company that can do things with blockchain and DNA  in my previous postings on this topic. I think that this will have something to do with the Mark of the Beast.

      <p>
       Notice the spear tip coming out of the Phoenix's head? Trump. has a spear on top of both of his coat of arm. Trump is the tip of the sphere. I think once he's fulfilled his purpose in wrecking everything and nuking North Korea, I think they might have someone take him out. Then things would get even crazier.

       Pretty complex for a Zoin shill. Haha just kidding, I’m deep into crypto right now and I think the one world currency will be a block chain but I don’t think it’ll be Zoin. This is really in depth, thanks.

       I don't think it will be either. I think the PHOENIX TEN upside that spelled out "NEW ZOI NET" meant New Zion ET. As in there's going to be a new Zion made by extraterrestrials.

England is Babylon
America came out of England remember.

       Lots of the founding fathers were freemasons who knew of the "mystery school teachings" which is what the name "Mystery Babylon" is all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, freemasonry and other Luciferian's have a lot in common Roman Catholicism. Catholicism is just paganism combined with Christianity. Freemasonry just draws more on Gnosticism too. What do you think all that secret knowledge they have in those libraries? Both Jesus and Lucifer are called the "morning star". Both are bringers of light and wisdom. Jesus brought truth and love. Lucifer isnt even a person or entity in the Bible. The term "lucifer" i's only mentioned one time in reference to Babylon being destroyed. It's just another name for the planet Venus. It means "light bringer" or "morning star".

       This whole Lucifer thing has been entirely misunderstood and morphed into something completely on it's own due to a misunderstanding. Lucifer was never meant to be the name of a demon or Satan.

        The term appears in the context of an oracle against a dead king of Babylon,

         [29]
        </a>
        who is addressed as הילל בן שחר (
        <em>
         Hêlêl ben Šāḥar
        </em>
        ),
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer#cite_note-30">

         [31]

        rendered in the King James Version as "O Lucifer, son of the morning!" and in others as "morning star, son of the dawn".
       </p>
       <p>
        In a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase "Lucifer" or "morning star" occurs begins with the statement: "On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!"
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer#cite_note-32">
         [32]
        </a>
        After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:
       </p>
       <p>
        "How you have fallen from heaven,
        <em>
         morning star
        </em>
        , son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Aqraa">
         Mount Zaphon
        </a>

       As you can see, he is referring to a man, not a God, or an angel. Using the name as a metaphor. The brightest star in the sky falling from the heavens because he became too arrogant.  The Latin word corresponding to Greek Phosphorus is “Lucifer”. It has nothing to do with Satan if you strictly go off of the Bible and not what you've been told. This is from the Old Testament too and the Jews don't even believe in a demon named Satan. Satan just means adversary or accuser. It's not one being compassion all evil like he is according to Christians. Plus, Lucifer means "light bringer". Satan is the father of lies. He doesn't bring you real truth or wisdom. He tricks you. Then there's the fact that Jesus calls himself the morning star in the book of Revelations. So both Satan and Jesus are the morning star? No, Jesus is the light bringer. Lucifer is a made up concept in Christianity. The people who practice Luciferianism are being tricked into thinking that Lucifer = Jesus and Lucifer = Satan, so Satan = Good. Only the first part could be considered true, if Lucifer was even a real entity in the Bible.

       Your information is so incredibly inaccurate. Literally over 90% of what you wrote about Jews and Satan is just wrong.  This entire post should just be discarded because it's just misinfo.  Learned Jews are very aware of Satan, which is called HaSatan in Hebrew (wow yes it's originally a Hebrew word).  He has several names including the Yeter Hara (evil inclination), the angel of death etc....He's not a demon.

       Get better sources.  Don't assume things you don't know about the people that received the only Torah/Bible from G-d Himself in a mass national revelation.  Otherwise you are literally empower Satan with your own actions and slander.

        A baron is a nobleman — a member of the aristocracy. Barons are also important, powerful businessmen with huge influence over their industries. In &gt;Britain, a baron is called “Lord,” but in the States, we call them “rich.”
        <br/>
        Barons are members of the aristocracy — wealthy people born into power and influence. How high a baron ranks depends on the country, but the title &gt;always carries respect. Similarly, a business leader who is rich, powerful, and influential is a baron. The term is used in phrases such as oil baron and baron &gt;of industry. You can also call that kind of baron a big businessman, magnate, mogul, top executive, or tycoon

       MYSTERY - "God is a mystery", common saying among Catholic priests
BABYLON - Doctrines derived from ancient Babylon, including observing the birthday of the reincarnated King Nimrod on December 25th, planting trees in one's home and giving gifts. Also Easter = Ishtar, Nimrod's mother/wife
THE GREAT - Perhaps the largest religion ever
THE MOTHER - The "mother church" is what Catholicism is called since it had many, many offshoots which believe many similar things and tend to disagree on only a few points of doctrine. Also, there is a belief among the Vatican that many of the flock will one day return to their "parent". Finally, it could also refer to the "cult of Mary".
OF THE WHORES - There is a kind of prostitution involved-- historically the selling of indulgences was prominent. Today we have bingo and carnivals.
AND ABOMINATIONS - Probably a reference to "The abomination that makes desolate". Literally the world is become a desolation and is bereft of true spiritual knowledge because of preaching the person of Jesus instead of his message.
OF THE EARTH - Who is the "god of the Earth"?

       And why do you think its the Catholics that say this? How can God be a mystery when you're suppose to know God? God is love, is love a mystery? The Catholics and the Secret Societies pretend to be against each other but they aren't. Its pro wrestling.

       The parent is Sophia. The real mother goddess. Yahweh is a crazy narcissist with extreme mother issues which is why we got separated from our mother (Garden of Eden/nature) and all women were cursed to be subservient to men. This is where the push to destroy the Earth and pursue technology to the point where we make ourselves extinct. Separating us further and further from nature, the cosmos, each other and even God. The first step of which was the Neolithic Revolution. The Bible even says it's a curse to work the land with the sweat of your brow. That one change in human lifestyle, is the ONLY reason we are where we are when it comes to the evil and division in this world. Can't create giant governments to control people from hunter/gatherers.

       When Yahweh calls someone a whore, he means worshiping another God.Israel is suppose to be his bride. It's like they're cheating on him and he's super jealous. Like the most psychotic ex boyfriend ever, Even creates these elaborate scenarios just so he can rescue you from them and then hold it over your head for the rest of your life to manipulate you to get you to do what he wants you to do. *cough*Exodus*cough*

       Abomination is just anything Yahweh doesn't like and Satan is the God of this world. Always has been. I'd be wary of anyone who shows up acting like they're going to save us, especially aliens.

       Here. Listen to these two Hitler sympathizers and see if you see any similarities to then  and now with their arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       It starts out with Roger Stone giving a defense to McCarthyism (after the Bill Cosby remark) because the threat from Russia infiltrating and influencing our country was real. And then it switches to a Hitler sympathizer talking about how Hitler wasn't really a bad guy and he was trying to free his country from the worldwide banking institutions and make Germany great again. (No he didn't really say that)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        From the Youtube description:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Short excerpts from an appearance by Roger Stone on Henrik Palmgren's Red Ice Radio broadcast, where he justifies Nixon's anti-dissident program on the basis that there was a real threat of a communist takeover at the time. Stone is a long-time Republican operative, who worked on the election campaigns of Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush in 2000, and managed Gary Johnson's campaign on the Libertarian party ticket in 2012."

         Host:
        </strong>
        "Let me ask you a little more about the detente and what happened with Soviet and US relations around this period and how you view Soviet infiltration of American politics and how real that is. Just like this Nixon view that people have [about his anti-dissident CIA operations], they view McCarthyism as you're a crazy kook that's just running around paranoid and there's nothing to it. Was there a real threat at the time from Soviet infiltration and were they smart to be paranoid about all of this do you think?"
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Roger Stone:
        </strong>
        I do think that there was a legitimate threat of domestic communism and subversion in the this country. I think that McCarthy was on to something. His tactics were sloppy. There's no question. But it's hard to come up with a name of all these people he ruined. Name one. You can't. There isn't one.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Host:
        </strong>
        "Yeah and even what went around in Hollywood at the time. What happened there with the infiltration and plenty of people at the time were being sentenced for being communist spies. Yet in hindsight now, in history, people repeat that footage of McCarthy and kind of laugh at it like there's nothing to it. It's a very one sided view of history."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Roger Stone:
        </strong>
        "Well the Soviets were smart enough to understand the power of movies. The power of communications and they used infiltration of the unions, the electricians union, the stagehands union, the theatrical unions to try to have an effect on the studios. And to try to get movies that showed a more benign and friendly view of the Soviet Union. This is all historically documented. The idea that Ronald Reagan was some king of lunatic because he was trying to ferret out communist subversion in the motion picture industry in the 40s and 50s is nonsense. Reagan was correct. There was a concerted effort to try to make inroads into the control of mass media at the time."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was a mere 4 years ago. When the Republicans remembered that the Russians were our enemies and were always going to be our enemies for the foreseeable future. When they remembered that infiltrating our country by covert means and subverting our democracy was their MO. All of a sudden they pretend like they never believed that and anyone who does is just a silly conspiracy theorist. What exactly changed in the span of 2 years to make them do a complete 180 and deny the reality of their previous positions?

       Here is the conversation with a Hitler sympathizer.

      <blockquote>

        <strong>
         Host:

        "You had a kind of world in Berlin that was filled with debauchery, promiscuity and prostitution. It was kind of a cesspool of immortality with all the drugs and everything else. It was something that was spread all over Germany. Do you believe that was a tactic to break down the German people? Where did all these influences come from and why did this center in Berlin?
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Dennis:
        </strong>
        "Well I think it's a tactic that's going on today. Certainly in Berlin at the time was the center of debauchery in Europe. People would come from all over Europe because it was so cheap. Ten American dollars could buy you anything. Anything in the perverted sex world. Pedophilia, child prostitution, bestiality. You name it. Berlin was the center of it all. Homosexuality, it was a haven. Munich was more of a national socialist right wing type of center. Where Berlin was left wing., more communist. Certainly Hitler said this. "As soon as I come to power, whats going on in Berlin, I will stop". And he did and this kind of drove a lot of people out. Mainly the Jewish people, the nightclub owners, etc. Actors and actresses who left for America. And if you want a comparison today, I suppose Hollywood is the place you'd compare it to. Where Satanism, drugs, prostitution, debauchery goes on in that place. And Hitler was against all that. He cleaned up Berlin and eventually cleaned up Germany. To the point where families could walk the streets of Berlin. Before it wasn't safe. These are not actions of an evil man. This is a man who loves his country and loves the people in his country.

        "He completely severed himself from the "international banking system", and he just took care of the economy from within the country. But was there still trade and things like that, import/export with other countries at the time?"
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Dennis:
        </strong>
        "The problem was as soon as Hitler came to power in 1933, the "International Jewry" declared war on Germany. Much as the same as the sanctions on Iraq, or Iran or Russia at the moment. The point was sanctions were put upon Germany which didn't make his job any easier but even with all that on top, he got the economy going. One of the ways he got the economy going was, as you say, he removed certain bankers from the system. He removed usury from the system which he always felt was abhorrent just like I do and certainly many other people do as well. So by replacing certain elements of that financial machine that the government was taking over more and more, he implements the creation of jobs. Which is unbelievable. Six or seven million unemployed when he came in and after two or tree years, he cleared it up. Simply by building motorways for instance. Motorways in a stretch of a country. You'd have certain workplaces where men could go and work, they'd stock up all week, go out in the weekend, with money in their pockets. The wives would take the money off them gladly, go out, buy a dress, buy shows, buy clothes, food, whatever. The economy got going and quite simply with this kind of shadow of usury and debt over the top of you. Things started to pick up and within two or three or four years by 1936, he was hosting the Olympics. [Germany was] probably the most happy, buoyant country in the world. You've got to remember, the rest of the world was in recession from America and the big myth is that Hitler needed a war to get that recession going. Quite the opposite. America needed that war to get that rid of that recession."

         Host:

        "Very interesting. Think about that people. If this story is correct here, if we look at this objectively, what we're being told here is that [Hitler] is the one who actually broke out of the type of monetary banking system that the world has suffered under for so many years now. Everything that happened with the collapse and the consolidation of more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands. This is actually someone who tried to break out of that. This is, rightly to say, when Judea declares war on Germany in 1933. The Jewish boycott of German good, etc. There were rallies to boycott Nazi Germany at the time. Held at Madison Square Garden and it was sponsored by the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee. A lot of people were involved with this and there was a trade war going on at this place basically."

        <strong>
         Host:
        </strong>
        "Let's just tackle some of the other myths along the way as well. I've heard other stories. That Hitler was basically in on it, he was a Rothschild agent, his mom was really a Rothschild. There were things along the way here that occurred, yes, he was intent on helping to destroy Germany by bringing them into war. There's a number of versions and variations here. Again this stems from an idea that it's an impossibility to assume that he was genuine. So we need to reach for any other explanation we can to wrap our head around the mythology we've been given afterwords. I think that's something that occurs, when you get the false story and you try to fit reality into that false story, you have to start changing the objective to have it make sense. What would you say concerning those rumors and conspiracies?"

         Dennis:
        </strong>
        "I've always said that actions speak louder than words. It doesn't matter what anybody says or what anybody proposed to believe to be done. The fact is, the actions taken and the actions that Hitler took a little bit earlier, were up to this point, to break the Versailles treaty. Everything he did was to break that demonic treaty. As far as the Rothschild's go, he was the only person ever to have jailed a Rothschild. When he entered Austria, I can't remember which Rothschild it was, he actually put him in jail. They ransomed him out at the end of it all. So where they're getting this thing about the Rothschild's, it's misinformation. It's similar to the occult thing you mentioned early on. Which I'm sure we'll be discussing a little bit later. But all these actions speak louder than any words than I can speak. Up to this point, you've got him changing the banking system, you've got him abolishing usury and once the Anschluss comes along, he arrests a Rothschild. What does that tell you?"

       First the video is not emotions.  It is Gematria Code being revealed so that the hidden interpretations of the book of Revelation, Daniel and others can finally be understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gematria Code is not easily interpreted. Only a handful of people have undertaken the enormous work.
What your working diligently at, Bible scholars are just now getting the full understanding of.
So perhaps you need to go back and take a second look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, for starters your putting parts together that don't belong. 
I have never heard Hosea being used as a supplement to the end times, specifically describing the 7 Trumpets and the beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I Kings 18 correlates with Elijah and Ahab.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luke 9 is Jesus instructing His disciples.  And yes, He didn't approve of their solution for that moment.
But don't put Jesus in a box and assume He will or will not do a thing.  The Lord's ways are not our ways, and the Lord's time is completely different than our time.  A day is as a thousand years to the Lord.  The foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

       The details of the visions of the little horn of Daniel 7 and the first beast of Revelation 13 reveal the antichrist of Bible prophecy.
The Beast in Revelation 13 is the same beast as in Daniel 7.
Verses 7 and 8:
7After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way I can explain it to you is, this is one of the presidents of the USA (44) but it was different from all the presidents who ruled before him, that's why it had 10 Horns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The three little Horns plucked up by the roots by this beast were Syria, Libya,and one more country I cannot recall momentarily, but these are the three little Horns plucked up by the (44) beast.
It then skips to where this beast receives a deadly wound and is healed.   I don't know why but I feel this deadly wound is from being shot in the head.
This deadly wound healed, makes many wander after the beast and at the time appointed, when this beast receives his power, so that he is able to deceive many with lying wonders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only encouragement I can offer is:
Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper (2 Chronicles 20:20).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kingdom of God is the power of God expressed in deeds; it is that which God does wherein it becomes evident that he is king.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a place or community ruled by God; it is not even the abstract idea of reign or kingship of God. It is quite concretely the activity of God as King of kings.

       I didn't post it to correlate to the ends times necessarily. Just pointing out that Yahweh describes himself literally EXACTLY how the first Beast in Revelation is described. And Elijah is described bringing fire from the sky and making everyone bow down to worship Yahweh. Just like how the 2nd Beast is described as doing. Catch my drift? Jesus literally says they do not know what manner of spirit they are. And he rebuked them for even suggesting to do such a thing. It's foolishness to not take Jesus's actions and his words as an indication of what he would or wouldn't do. Otherwise, how are we suppose to follow him? That literally makes no sense to say that we shouldn't assume Jesus would or wouldn't do something. That was the ENTIRE point of him coming here. To show up how to live.

       Well, yes, it is.  But the beast of the USA in Rev 6 Daniel 7 third beast is referring to the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force and US Marines.

       I don't think it will be either. I think the PHOENIX TEN upside that spelled out "NEW ZOI NET" meant New Zion ET. As in there's going to be a new Zion made by extraterrestrials.
