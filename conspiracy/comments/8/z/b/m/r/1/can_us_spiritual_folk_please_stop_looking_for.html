        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry for the strong language. But at this point, it is fucking warranted. And whatever, I don&#39;t even care at this point.  </p>

<p>Like seriously, I find it extremely hilarious whenever I see people from the spiritual community attempting to prove themselves &quot;right&quot; in front of the scientific community AND/OR attempting to seek <em>validation</em> from them. It&#39;s like watching someone who is light years ahead of even a PhD looking for validation from a fucking kindergartener. Cute? NOT.  </p>

<p>First of all, science isn&#39;t really all that &quot;scientific&quot; as they claim it to be to begin with. Researchers who even relatively venture out into &quot;offbeat&quot; and &quot;unconventional&quot; areas (that science claims to be too <em>exotic</em> for its liking) get either ridiculed or downright ostracised by the community. Watch the DMT Documentary to see how scientists looking into DMT were ostracised simply because &quot;mainstream science&quot; views psychedelics as <em>delusional nonsense.</em> Or watch Vsauce (your valid &quot;mainstream&quot; science guy, by the way) on the H3H3 Podcast (available on Youtube) wherein Michael Stevens clearly states that the scientists involved in the research upon Ayahuasca (that they filmed for Mind Field series) refused to agree that they had actually consumed any Ayahuasca in real life (that too for actual fucking scientific research) because the scientific community would fucking ostracise them if they said that. <strong>This is not &quot;scientific attitude&quot; AT ALL. This is some regressive, dumb, closed-minded, and foolish crap that belongs to religion AND/OR the middle ages.</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>In fact, REAL scientific attitude (which has you question everything, experiment for yourself and be open-minded about discovering the limitless possibilities within the universe without having <em>ideas</em> about what is &quot;possible&quot; and what is &quot;not possible&quot;) is something that I endorse GREATLY even as a spiritual guy</strong> because <strong>unfounded BS has no place in spirituality</strong> <strong><em>anyways.</em></strong> Besides, all legit scientists have themselves admitted that science isn&#39;t the ULTIMATE TRUTH, given that what has been &quot;proven&quot; today might as well be just as easily &quot;disproven&quot; tomorrow  - a phenomenon that is as common in the scientific world as explosions in a Michael Bay movie.  </p>

<p>Secondly (and most importantly), the evidence of a world that does NOT operate in sync with established ideas within modern science is FUCKING EVERYWHERE. QUANTUM PHYSICS ALONE has trashed Classical Physics in a way that makes things like parallel realities, teleportation and telepathy entirely possible, among COUNTLESS OTHER THINGS. Yep, I&#39;m talking about things that, were you to mention in a casual conversation in a party with the ignorant AF &quot;science-worshipping&quot; crowd, would literally get fucking laughed at and mocked all day all night long.  </p>

<p>What more should I add? The countless experiences that nearly all of us have in our own lives which are entirely unexplainable? (Yeah, nearly everyone has had AT LEAST <em>ONE</em> unexplainable experience in the course of their lives that seems logically impossible. People either deny these experiences even to themselves or brush them off with some made-up &quot;logical&quot; explanation for their mind to make sense of, which they then never share with others because everyone will think they are psychotic AND/OR drunk AND/OR on drugs. And then, someday they get the guts to share these experiences on AskReddit supernatural experience threads or r/GlitchInTheMatrix or r/Spirituality.) Or add to that the many accounts of people witnessing spirits or getting communications from them after a loved one passes away and so much more. Or the countless examples of synchronicity (or should I use the &quot;scientifically validated term&quot; the &quot;Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon&quot; here instead?) and Deja Vu and Parallel Universe Jumping (&quot;Mandela Effect&quot; anyone?). Or should I add in here the infinite intelligence of nature itself which is visible in something as infinitely complex as our respiratory and digestive systems? Or the simple magic within a blossoming flower and a honey-gathering bee? Or the hundreds and thousands of recorded Near Death Experiences (all which have SO MANY similarities) wherein people have observed events that they couldn&#39;t possibly have seen and later even VERIFIED these? Or children recalling their past lives? Or humans doing &quot;in-humanly&quot; things, that nobody would really believe had even happened -- had the Guiness Book of World Fucking Records not been filled TO THE BRIM with them? What the fuck have people of this world been smoking? I fucking <em>fail</em> to understand.  </p>

<p>My point is simple. Magic is LITERALLY EVERY-FUCKING-WHERE to see for anyone who is not fucking <em>blind.</em> And the religion of modern science is perhaps the blindest and the stupidest of them all, all of their fancy inventions be damned. I mean, it is so funny when I see people buying utter BS scientific arguments like &quot;One person saw this happen? Bet they were hallucinating or on drugs! Where&#39;s the recorded evidence?&quot; -- followed by -- &quot;What do you mean MULTIPLE WITNESSES saw this happen? Surely it is a case of &quot;MASS HYSTERIA!&quot;. Sure, try throwing that <em>&quot;multiple witnesses mean shit&quot; argument</em> in an ACTUAL COURT OF LAW. See if anyone&#39;s buying that crap. <strong>Speaking of which, there are no known video recordings of &quot;dreams&quot; anywhere in this world. It is ALL in the words of multiple witnesses saying it throughout centuries. Which means that, if you&#39;re <em>dreaming,</em> you&#39;re really just a victim of <em>mass hysteria</em> according to &quot;modern science&quot;. Sorry to break it to you!</strong>  </p>

<p>But &quot;dreaming&quot; is a valid phenomenon to science, and yet, &quot;miracles&quot; are not, even though there have been countless recorded instances of those time and again. You call this drivel &quot;science&quot;? I call this BULL-FUCKING-SHIT. Same goes for UFOs. Evidence regarding them has been present from ancient paintings and records to the mother fucking Dogon civilization. But naah, NASA is telling you the truth. Whatever.  </p>

<p>So yeah, STOP ignoring and disregarding your own otherworldly experiences. STOP waiting for mainstream science to <em>validate</em> you. STOP giving &quot;scientific evidence&quot; to dumb sheep as to why <em>spirituality is &quot;scientifically real and valid&quot;</em>. Such things are beyond their understanding anyways, so respect their free will and level of understanding on that. And yeah, STOP giving a fuck as to what &quot;science&quot; thinks about the magical world that is the reality, as ALL evidence suggests. <strong>You are light years beyond the doctorate, so stop fucking entertaining kindergarteners. You have better things to do.</strong>  </p>

<p>End of rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think the problem lies with either science nor spirituality in of themselves (we’re inching closer and closer towards a convergence everyday), rather it’s the dogmatic stances on either side that breaks down productive dialogue and any method of congruence. To your point, one inevitably has to decide for themselves, but I feel an evolved soul learns how to listen to another point of view without taking it on as their own or carrying the burden of its perceived injustice. Tune in to tune out.</p>

<p>I completely agree. I wouldn&#39;t comment upon whether I am <em>evolved</em> or not because it&#39;s an endless ladder anyways and I, from my limited human experience, cannot really judge as to where I am upon this ladder anyways. Neither can I really judge anyone else.  </p>

<p>You are right, in that whether or not <em>other</em> spiritual folk continue to believe in science and restrict their evolution or not is ultimately not my business. All I wanted to post was an eye-opener that hopefully gets people to think about what things they&#39;re buying into from the asleep collective unconscious mind. After all, I myself would probably not be where I currently am upon the spiritual evolution ladder had someone else never made the efforts to write/speak about spiritually advanced things. So yeah, this is my small attempt to return their favours to the rest of the world by presenting my two cents. Thank you for your response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. We’re feeling the same, I think. </p>

<p>As a physicist, a veteran, an artist, and someone who is highly spiritual, I tread that line everyday. If you don’t mind, I’ll share what I’ve learned from the many moments when I too, have felt at my wits end.</p>

<p>I’ve found that so many people have trouble distinguishing between truth and rhetoric, even when it’s blatantly apparent with real data to validate. Yes, we can argue all day whether it’s imprudence, ignorance, or laziness, but in the end, the ability to look past face value, to question everything, while evaluating and reconciling its meaning against our own inner compass, is a hard skill for many to master. Especially since we all have a penchant towards superficial judgement (I use the context of preconceived notions based on past experience) as a means to decipher.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten more success in showing clear examples of where I see the breakdown (this was said vs. here are some facts), what could be the possible solution (not everything has to be black or white), and by recommending ways for people to approach these topics in the future (e.g., read this, do that, etc.). This encourages dialogue as opposed to chalking up your very important points to a mere rant, which I feel is a disservice to your viewpoints.</p>

<p>We evolve ourselves and each other by opening dialogue and finding balanced ways to help each other understand how we fit into the equation and what we can do together to affect change. I feel this app a especially true since most people feel insignificant in comparison to the insurmountable issues we face. It’s like they say, “If you think you’re too small to make a difference, try sitting in a room with a few mosquitoes.” Remind them of that and show them how to be a mosquito. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Perfectly put. I understand that I went full &quot;<em>us vs them</em> mode&quot; (duality mode) in here; but the language I used and the way I put things wasn&#39;t really done with an intention of curtailing/closing down dialogue, but more so to <em>strongly drive home a point.</em> Yes, there was anger coursing through my words, but there are places where even anger is valid; after all, it is a perfectly legit expression of our soul and its innate divinity.  </p>

<p>But yes, I agree that the same could have been said in a more open, more balanced, more <em>inclusive</em> manner, so as not to have given off the impression of having attacked everyone who was looking for validation from science, irrespective of their reasons for doing so. So yes, while I felt that the &quot;attack mode&quot; was essential for driving home my point(s), I agree that I can and could attempt a more balanced/dialogue-friendly approach in the future and see how that works out overall. Thank you for your insights and suggestions! They were greatly appreciated! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do fully believe in a spiritual world but it is the specific one as described in the King James Bible.  What is described here is the new age &quot;god is within us&quot; kind of thing which is just as false as mainstream materialistic science.  I should have said worship anything else but the God of Abraham who&#39;s incarnation is Jesus Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I realized Jesus Christ was real and that he died for my sins was one of the crazies things in my life.  I&#39;ve done plenty of shrooms and LSD and other drugs in my life and nothing compares to getting saved.  The kingdom of God is within all born again believers of the gospel as presented by Paul.  The Holy Spirit moves in, quickens the believer&#39;s  spirit and pushes a lot of bad stuff out.  It makes the process of sanctification much easier.  I was convinced of a lot of things in my life and it felt like no problem walking away from them.  Things I thought were just a part of me before.  To me getting saved and the experience of the Holy Spirit working in my life is a spiritual experience.  I believe all mystical experience like the ones you can have on DMT are from the Lucifer, his fallen angels, and other unclean spirits that live in this fallen realm with us.  There are no good spirits locked in here with us.  The only good spirit is the spirit of God saving people and indwelling in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely 100% yes.</p>

<p>Joh_14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>

<p>There is no other &quot;way&quot; and no other &quot;truth.&quot;  Christ Jesus is the only way to avoid the second death and have life eternal.</p>

<p>Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. </p>

<p>Only Jesus Christ saves:</p>

<p>Act 4:10  Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</p>

<p>Act 4:11  This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</p>

<p>Act 4:12  <strong>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</strong> </p>

<p>Every other spiritual belief system and religion in the world has something to do with the works of the human during this life having to do with the result of their afterlife.  The truth is we are incapable of doing what needs to be done so God himself had to do it for us.</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Nothing we do help other than repenting and believing the gospel.</p>

<p>Eph 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Eph 2:9  Not of works, lest any man should boast. 
Rom 3:24  Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: </p>

<p>We can only get there by having his perfect righteousness.</p>

<p>Rom 3:22  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: </p>

<p>We must repent (change our mind) about what we believe about ourselves, of God/Christ Jesus, and about our hopeless sinful state.</p>

<p>This is the gospel that saves in this dispensation of Grace.  It&#39;s so incredibly simple:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>This means God himself paid our debt with his blood and if we believe that and believe in our hearts he died, was buried, and resurrected on the 3rd day according to the scriptures we are saved.</p>

<p>Rom_5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Rom_5:9  Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</p>

<p>It seems most people don&#39;t get saved because they don&#39;t want to admit they are sinners in need of a savior.  We like to compare our actions to each other and not to a perfect and holy God who can&#39;t tolerate even one tiny bit of sin in his presence.  The way God looks at one lie is the way we look at a child molesting pedophile murderer.  All good we do is filthy to him he is that holy.  That&#39;s what we have a hard time understanding.</p>

<p>Isa 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Ultimate Truth is that you are God playing with geometrical light forms spanning 10 dimensions, as everything and everyone. &quot;you&quot; are a light form. A hologram used to experience this certain construct/world. The &quot;Earth&quot; is neither flat nor sphere, but a simulation/hologram.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a game, folks. These &quot;elites&quot; have (in the past) controlled this game in their favor through fraudulent use of language (just as we see with politicians) to manipulate us with our consent.</p>

<p>It stops when we say it stops, and act accordingly. Quit funneling your energy/money/time/attention towards that which does not serve you. Watch its life support dwindle. You are the observer; quit observing and acting upon ignorance. Wield your sovereignty. </p>

<p>Yes, limitation/rules are needed for expansion but We&#39;ve overplayed just about every experience in humanity&#39;s 3-dimensional duality of mind. Let&#39;s start playing with the 5th-dimensionally-based toys/paradigms/programming :) </p>

<p>We are the same force in every body. The &quot;Big Bang&quot; has become aware of itself through us, and now we/it learns how to play like a universe does. As One </p>
