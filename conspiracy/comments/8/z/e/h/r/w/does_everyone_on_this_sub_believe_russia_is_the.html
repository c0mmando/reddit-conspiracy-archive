Every day the t.v. and radio shout, &quot;hey, hey you, hate and fear Russia!&quot; to me.
Isn&#39;t there any other possible thing I can do with the freedom of thought God gave me than follow the official narrative??
this post is a support group for people who don&#39;t have faith in the U.S. intelligence community&#39;s credibility.
Unless I&#39;m the only one. 
I feel so alone in a sea of Russia-haters frothing at the mouth. 
Trump is a bad president that I don&#39;t like. But I also don&#39;t hate Russia. Their country is really far away.
Can&#39;t we let the Cold War thaw out a little ffs ?</p>

<p>The less trade America does the more is possible for Russia to do. Specifically drive a wedge between America and China, the less trade China does with us the more Russia gets to do. </p>

<p>Same with Europe. </p>

<p>Its in Russia&#39;s best interest to have a protectionist president who alienates allies. </p>

<p>They cant. They want to encourage trade with Asia and have America not do as much business. </p>

<p>No one will be able to make goods as cheap as China for a long time. </p>

<p>Russia doesnt want us to have a strong economy, just like we want to keep Russia in check. </p>

<p>And since you like facts that don’t matter, without California Trump would have won the popular vote. So using your own logic outside of California Trump does have the rest of the nation behind him right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a global dark hand at work here and Russia is only part of it. They have been actively creating division within our population for a very long time and it is all coming to a head with what is going on today. </p>

<p>Russia absolutely influenced the election through social media manipulation and more importantly laundering dark money through the NRA and other anti-American organizations to the GOP. This is why they are publicly fighting tooth and nail against anything negative in regards to Russia. </p>

<p>Make no mistake, there was a silent coupe of the US government and America as we know it is officially over. </p>

<p>In my eyes the goal is to destabilize America in any and every way possible in order to render America irrelevant as a global power. Once the current world order is destabilized they can swoop in and offer the &quot;solution&quot;. Which will be the final stage of the creation of a global currency and central one world government. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been the plan all along and is working to perfection. They needed to get America out of the way first though and this is exactly what is beginning to happen right now. </p>

<p>We saw the ultra-diverse ideas at the turn of the century, leading into the refugee crisis and even till today. But it swung back around after groups of people actually came into contact with foreigners. Many reverted into the base human nature, which I believe to be: &quot;If you aren&#39;t the same ethinicty/skin color/culture as me, I don&#39;t like you&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to have high-minded ideals when safe and protected from actually having to carry out those ideas. When it came down to it, it came out that humans aren&#39;t as ethically and morally developed as we&#39;d like to think. This isn&#39;t to say we, as a species, haven&#39;t advanced in this department, but it only takes a slight push to revert to our true selves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia had little to nothing to do with it.  Trump&#39;s campaign started out as a joke, just like the last one.  Very few people thought he was serous.  Then, Trump was gifted a billion dollars in free advertising by the left leaning corporate media, and with that gift, he was able to beat back a lackluster field of GOP challengers...in spite of attempts by the GOP to rig things against him (Colorado comes to mind)....but that&#39;s only part of the story.</p>

<p>Another part was due to Democratic policies, specifically intersectional privilege theory and social justice.  As a black man there are two things i never thought i&#39;d see in my lifetime, one was a black president, and the other was white people being only discriminated against, yet I lived to see both.  Beware the dangerous cis white male who is automatically racist, due to his birth into a pigment-ally challenged skin suit; because if you keep telling him he is a racist by default, he is not going to care...and here comes Trump...unafraid to throw red meat to these folks.</p>

<p>Then of course there were the DNC shenanigans in favor Hillary Clinton and against  Bernie Sanders.  The bias was so identifiable, his supporters knew the fix was in long before Seth Rich ever leaked those shenanigans to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>Then there was Hillary Clinton herself, with a track record for disaster and dead bodies...a woman who helped her husband ruin woman who came forward to expose his sexual misdeeds, a woman who treated our nation&#39;s deepest secrets as memes, a woman who dropped like a dead deer on the campaign trail, and who was having obvious seizures.  Benghazi.  Uranium One.  Hell the friggin&#39; Nixon investigation she was kicked off of due to malfeasance.  The list goes on.  I would be hard pressed to identify a weaker presidential candidate.</p>

<p>With all that I;m supposed to believe Russia handed Trump the win?  Even if Russia was behind the DNC leaks, and I do not believe they were, by the time those came out people had largely made up their minds who they would vote for, so all that really did was make a few Bernie supporters stay home, and still net Team Hilldawg the popular vote by a count of 3mil +</p>

<p>Russia is simply the boogieman the deep state needs to deflect away from the unearthed malfeasance of the left wing control group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without espionage Trump probably wouldn&#39;t have taken it TBF. He barely won as it was and he needed a big boost from the DNC email steals from either a hacker OR leaker. Which is still espionage. </p>

<p>BTW... it&#39;s really funny how people get when you talk to them about this stuff. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>hate and fear Russia!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This line is used so often. Apparently you&#39;re not allowed to accuse Russia of anything because of &quot;muh death&quot;. Apparently you can&#39;t criticize them because whatabout the United States! Apparently to acknowledge they may have stolen some emails and given them to wikileaks is fear and automatic war. </p>

<p>Maybe in olden times before the nuke we would have warred over something like that. Now we just sanction the shit out of their people. Russia should be a very prosperous country but cold warring with the U.S has left them in a position where they lost the U.S.S.R. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been really fun to see people get red scared themselves. Talk big shit about commies and throwing them out of helicopters but when it comes to commie Russians, oh no please don&#39;t accuse them! They&#39;ll kill us all!</p>
