        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seriously; imagine if in the lead up to the Iraq war someone said &quot;I don&#39;t believe the US intelligence services when they say that Saddam has WMDs&quot; and then they received mass downvotes.</p>

<p>We&#39;re experiencing an incredibly varied propaganda push to force us to hate Russia and Trump, and while you&#39;re certainly entitled to hate both, the idea that we have to blindly accept ANYTHING that the FBI/CIA/NSA says is completely against the spirit of this subreddit.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly certain we&#39;re experiencing a well-funded raid by the same people and organizations that very likely engaged in this behavior during the 2016 election (first: in getting Trump nominated for the republican party [see Podesta &quot;Pied Piper&quot; email], second: in eliminating Bernie Sanders from contention, third: in character assassination of Donald Trump and the gaslighting of his supporters, fourth: in the continued subversion of the current President [who&#39;s obviously outside the established power structure {although whether he&#39;s a part of a different, just as nefarious power structure is certainly debatable}]).</p>

<p>So let me just say this: If you accept anything a government intelligence service claims at face value, without question, then you do not belong here.  Period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real issue is how hard it is to have any sort of real discussion here. It&#39;s one thing to question the source of a piece of info but I feel we&#39;re approaching the age where no source is trusted and what should be a discussion on Trump or whatever becomes a circle jerk of &quot;I don&#39;t trust that source&quot;, &quot;Fake News&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re an idiot if you believe that&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s so strange for me is how out in the real world it doesn&#39;t feel all that different. There&#39;s the same loud-mouthed assholes who don&#39;t want to hear anyone out, and the majority seem at least open to discussion even if they have no intention of changing their stance. But the second you hop online the mood completely shifts to one that feels far more hostile and confrontational.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Perhaps an evolution in how we use symbols to communicate online? (I&#39;m dreaming here)</p>

<p>Anonymity, I believe, allows such hostile words to be thrown around. But anonymity is essential to internet freedom. Hopefully one day we will be able to communicate more effectively through text online, but until then we have this sort of dynamic.</p>

<p>I personally think tone is conveyed enough in MOST conversations by the use of words or caps lock already. Plus I doubt it makes much difference. On either extreme side, ANY attempt to disagree but try to understand is interpreted as a personal affront and death threat and is met only with shouting.

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously the MSM lies about a lot. What I meant by it containing a grain of truth is that if they say Trump met with Putin or something, it&#39;s likely that actually happened. What&#39;s not necessarily true, is how they then frame it. It&#39;s tough, I don&#39;t think we can go around with our heads down refusing to believe anything, but it&#39;s also damn near impossible to find info on anything that isn&#39;t heavily partisan in its presentation.</p>

However, the <a href="https://heavywatergate.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/judithmillernytpropaganda.pdf">New York Times gleefully endorsed the Bush administration&#39;s propaganda about Iraq.</a> The &quot;fake news&quot; from alternative outlets like ZeroHedge and InfoWars is objectively far less dangerous than the propaganda the corporate media is documented to have published in its history. Okay, ZeroHedge might run an article saying the Pope endorsed Trump. What impact does that have? Zero. </p>

I don&#39;t doubt the office in Moscow has more slant towards Russia, but the shows I mentioned are good at being factual.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between propaganda and bias.  You cited an operation from the 1950s as a source to discredit every American news source, which isn&#39;t critical thinking at all.  By that metric I could discredit any source I so choose.</p>

<p>CNN and Fox News are more in the bias hemisphere than the propaganda one. Sources like InfoWars and RT shamelessly mislead viewers.  Watching InfoWars might lead you to think there are interdenominational vampires (most of whom are Democrats) that feed on molesting children. While watching RT you might see reporting from Azerbaijan that shows people wanting Russian&#39;s to support their military efforts.  Watching CNN or Fox would just show you the Left or the Rights view of things, which is bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right, there <strong>is</strong> a difference between propaganda and bias. That difference is when the state intervenes and gives the media the &quot;correct&quot; talking points. Do you want to know exactly <strong><em>why</em></strong> the mainstream propaganda picked up so hard? See there was this thing called the <strong><em>Smith-Mundt Act</em></strong>, right? What that did was make it <strong>illegal</strong> to push domestic propaganda on the citizenry.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s rewind back to 2012 to when Obama signed <strong><em>HR 4310</em></strong>. See that&#39;s called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and <strong><em>Section 1078</em></strong> where it <strong><em>repeals the Smith-Mundt Act</em></strong> and authorizes the use of domestic propaganda.</p>

<p>So while there may have been a short period where the media wasn&#39;t corrupted, it very much is back to being as corrupt now as it was back then.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it, look for yourself:</p>

<p>This sub hates itself? These kinds of comments don&#39;t get upvoted here, except for specific threads where the difference is obvious. They want to have their cake and eat it too.

They want you to believe that nobody is talking about this thing when we are upvoting and discussing that thing. </p>

<p>As for your comment, you will find many people here who cite sources from the mainstream media. A lot of us understand that the truth can be found there sometimes, but it&#39;s good to be skeptical and it&#39;s good to look for context and what they&#39;re leaving out of the article as well. Obviously some people believe that literally everything written in the media is a lie, but why should we even acknowledge such a foolish belief? it&#39;s a minority opinion and not even worth pointing out. </p>

DJT policies are almost identical to Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. In that sense, he is establishment.</p>

<p>The problem for MSM is that DJT is widely despised and -- just like at the time of the Great Depression -- risks a popular movement so huge that people decide to clean up the oligarchy. MSM is tactical. FDR saved capitalism. MSM is playing that role now.</p>

<p>Notice how MSM is constantly parading Republicans out to be outraged against Trump. This builds credibility for the same Republicans who destroyed the economy so many times -- in 1981, 1987, 2001, and 2008. MSM wants us to go back to these same policies and submit to them since Trump is so bad. The political spectrum moves &#39;to the right.&#39;</p>

<p>Regarding &quot;the Russia thing,&quot; it is generally true but also total cover for other things. By blaming Russia for the 2016 election, the solution is merely to get Russia out of the business of US elections. But that leaves all the other games we&#39;ve seen since Bush V. Gore still in there. As people breathe a sigh of relief, the voter purges continue, the gerrymandering is permitted by the Supreme Court, the giant &quot;free speech&quot; money funds take over more of our information stream, CrossCheck continues, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, it is impossible to believe that all those Republicans IN POWER -- those who have the actual ability to stop Trump -- do nothing substantive to stop him. These people for some reason are not worried about DJT and Russia, even though they claim to be -- or they would STOP IT. </p>

<p>There is one reason why Republicans who wrote up the master plan to encircle Russia are suddenly not worried -- because they know something that is going to sucker punch us at some point -- Russia will be double crossed.</p>

<p>In the end, here we are with all the same problems that conspiracists have complained about for ages, covered over with layers of the 2016 election that makes everything harder to reach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting take. I agree that Trump isn&#39;t good for America (though honestly, who could be given that the issue isn&#39;t the person in the White House but the Establishment). I hesitate to give the MSM any credit for espousing this though. From my view it seems they aim to divide rather than unite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll lay out some bullet points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ted would have closed the embassies in Havana &amp; Washington, bringing back pre-Obama Cuban relations. He might have even reversed Clinton&#39;s progress by fucking with Vietnam.</p></li>
<li><p>Ted would push harder to undermine homosexual marriage, recreational marijuana, and abortion.</p></li>
<li><p>Ted would have refused to meet with people like Putin, Xi, and Kim <em>at all</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>You think Trump loves Israel? Ted would have bowed to the Israeli agenda even more fervently because his love of Zionism adds a religious aspect, while Trump is all business.</p></li>
<li><p>Ted would have pushed a Christian agenda.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of all of these, reversing progress made with Cuba would have been the most disastrous. Sure, Trump pissed me off by rolling back some of the progress, but at least he didn&#39;t cut diplomatic ties and close the embassies. I hate Cuban-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans of that generation because they carry a blind hatred for progress and an inability to let go of historical baggage for the sake of improved relations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m surprised that you&#39;d ever support Ted Cruz. You seem far more like a supporter of The Pauls (my personal choices for Republican leadership, for whatever that&#39;s worth). The Bush-Clinton machine is the worst, and while I generally dislike Trump, I like him more than that globalist tag-team because he&#39;s a threat to the global elitist juggernaut of the west. At least, I thought he was, but then he blows shit up in Syria and takes advice from a guy who is, as SJWs love to phrase it, &#39;literally Hitler&#39;, named John Bolton, who&#39;d like nothing more than the Occident to triumph over the Orient, Rudyard Kipling style, ending our Neo-Confucian way of life here. With guys like him, it goes beyond the expected political anti-communism of the party, it spills over into cultural anti-Orientalism. For me, John Bolton is perhaps the only American &#39;politician&#39; I can think of worse than Ted Cruz, and Trump is keeping him around. If I could order a hit on anyone in addition to the members of the Kim family (Czar-style), it would be John Bolton. Just dangerous as hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the foreign policy issue is thr one thing I disagreed with almost everyone on. And initially I was in support of Paul. But I saw he had no chance early on in the primaries so I flipped over to Cruz because he was talking real about the issues facing us, and I agreed with a lot of his stances and positions. Plus no one on either side liked him so to me that was a plus (I don&#39;t know how much I believe the Goldman Sachs connections. I think a lot of the reporting was exaggeration and oversensationalism).</p>

<p>The kicker for me was seeing that Trump was more of a fake I thought he was a Clinton plant to divide the republican party and I wanted the best shot at making sure Hillary would not be president.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t vote in the general election because I felt it was completely fixed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed completely, plus on any subreddit your posts can be removed for even completely arbitrary reasons. Even on subreddits that have nothing to do with politics, like r/funkopop, I&#39;ve experienced recently a removed post because they said I didn&#39;t flair it right, despite me doing literally everything correctly (proper title, proper flair, and the pic I used proved such circumstances of what I was posting), and despite the reply message saying I can contact with any questions, they&#39;ve left no reply.</p>

<p>Reddit allows for full-on censorship, which is disturbing when it even happens at the non-political level.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I find Imgur to be better at discussing such issues as despite the stupid 140 character limit that even Twitter has abandoned, and their own issues when it comes to moderation, you&#39;re still able to speak rather freely and openly and there is sometimes a good balance of ideas on all sides (even if the site leans to the left). And even if a comment gets deleted, it&#39;ll say &quot;deleted&quot; and imgur users can tell SOMETHING substantially offensive to the group was said which can create intrigue at their statement which can help.</p>

<p>IE: they might claim the world is 7b people when there&#39;s really only 500m, or the USA is 300m people when it&#39;s really only 20m and it&#39;s just impossible for 20m to &quot;honestly&quot; vote against 150m &quot;fake&quot; votes.  </p>

<p>Or another example would be the up/down votes.  We think Reddit has 10m viewers an hour when it might be 15k and they need to ensure we don&#39;t know we&#39;re the majority and instead make us seem like a small minority that&#39;s not actually in control.  </p>

<p>AFAIK, just mind your own business, don&#39;t share opinions not relevant to you, and we might just be OK living our lives without lifting a finger.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I call this the &quot;Epistemological Dystopia&quot; - we live in a society now where it is impossible to know anything. Every assertion is little more than a narrative and everyone is free to pick and choose what or whom they believe. For every assertion a supporting fact can be found, and every discussion between opposing viewpoints can spiral into an endless array of citations and quotes. The only honest thing anyone can say now is &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; - because no one knows anything. It is absolutely amazing, and completely unlike any dystopia that anyone ever imagined in fiction. The Party in 1984 came close to this idea, but not exactly; they manufactured reality and an authoritative narrative - we don&#39;t even have that. Anyone can believe anything without actually knowing anything, and any attempt to &quot;get to the bottom of it&quot; will invariably just end in your picking whatever &quot;facts&quot; &quot;feel most true&quot; to you - which just takes you right back where you started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but it is more inextricable than it seems. Like when you &quot;rather than bringing people together with the understanding that no single viewpoint can be the true authority&quot; - that assertion rests on an implicit universal assumption; a hard to see one, but it&#39;s there. One of the real difficulties is that really embracing the idea that there are multiple viewpoints with no single authority requires you recognize that other could have viewpoints which themselves claim that there is only one valid viewpoint. And you somehow have to be able to live with and alongside them even if they require that they eliminate opposing ideologies. If you do this faithfully you are wiped out. If, however, you say - no, I accept all ideologies and viewpoints as valid except those that do not accept other ideologies and viewpoints as valid you have then in fact put forth a universalist authoritative statement about how the world &quot;is&quot; and, ergo, have become the thing you say you reject. As far as I can tell there&#39;s no way out. It is completely fascinating. Every possible supposed way out of that trap that I&#39;ve tried to find, either through my own thinking or by studying history and philosophy, always ends up falling apart if you think it through long enough. It always ends in authoritarianism of one form or another, or tribalism, or chaos. There really appears to be no philosophical basis for any kind of truly long term social stability that grants people all of the rights and dignities we desire as modern people. I guess the best that can be hoped for is for enough people in a single place to agree on enough foundational social and philosophical axioms for a long enough time to have some sort of stability bubble - a sort of localized social negative entropy bubble. But, that does not appear to be a time we&#39;re in right now. I&#39;m not sure what the best that can be hoped for over the near term is. Based on what I&#39;ve read of history it doesn&#39;t seem pretty though. Building a new stability bubble usually has a high price paid exclusively in blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an addendum, I want to say: Do not give up on this subreddit.  It&#39;s obvious that someone is afraid of the power we have here.  Sure we get made fun of (&quot;Oh you post on r/conspiracy!  Now I don&#39;t need to respond to your logic!&quot;), but the fact remains that this is one of the main hubs of conspiracy information on the internet.  </p>

<p>The internet is the most powerful tool that has ever been placed in the hands of the masses; by proper utilization of this tool we can create new pathways to the future, that NO ONE, not even the most powerful of the elite, can control.  That&#39;s why the 2016 election was so important; because despite all the parrots squawking the exact same story, here on the internet we decided to tell another... and the internet&#39;s tale won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea trusting Putin is retarded. Read &quot;Foundation of Geopolitics&quot; by Aleksandr Dugin. The book basically describes Russian foreign policy and was probably taught to Putin. </p>

<p>The book emphasizes that Russia must spread Anti-Americanism everywhere: &quot;the main &#39;scapegoat&#39; will be precisely the U.S.&quot;</p>

<p>In the United States:</p>

<p>Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke &quot;Afro-American racists&quot;. Russia should &quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics&quot;.</p>

<p>This is happening right now. Yet people think that Russia is a pseudo ally against the EU. The Russians are the masters of doing this. They&#39;ve done it for decades in Eastern Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His trade wars are not a departure -- they are an advancement.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is against multilateral trade deals. He is for unilateral trade deals -- each nation on its own. His tariffs are being used as threats to gain ultimate advantage nation by nation, divided and conquered.</p>

<p>This &#39;unipolarism&#39; is the perfect next move to support American hegemony because it is easier to get better deals for American oligarchs when each nation must negotiate alone against the power United States.</p>

<p>In that respect, Donald Trump is perfectly aligned with Paul Wolfowitz when he wrote up the official policy that America should have no rivals, not even friendly ones.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what purpose this statement has.  Maybe your list of fallacies has something to say on particular brand of totally organic discourse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody says politicians do not lie.</p>

<p>Trump is only a departure from the usual in that he was willing to lie about anything and everything to get elected</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the implication of this statement. The suggestion is that Trump lies so much and so completely that anybody compared to him is a saintly beacon of truthiness. Of course, that is a big pile of horse shit. All politicians lie, it is the nature of the job. The reality is, anybody seeking political office in this country already lied about whatever was necessary to get on the ballot. You think every one of these politicians is exactly what they seem to be? Please consult your list of fallacies again, only reflect a bit more on them this time.</p>

<p>Trump is emphatically <em>not</em> a departure from the usual. He is business as normal. That is not a straw man, it&#39;s observable reality. Do you remember how hated Obama was by the right? It is the exact same now with Trump, in reverse. This is nothing new. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s actually true. We only seem to be disagreeing about how obvious lies from real politicians are. It&#39;s not hard to spot lies from Trump because he does absolutely nothing to hide them. His agenda in telling a lie doesn&#39;t seem to be explicitly to deceive (otherwise, why continue when it&#39;s obvious they do not work?)</p>

<p>No, if we are disagreeing, it&#39;s about whether or not a real politician <em>ever</em> says anything <em>actually truthful</em>. Only then does any comparison with Trump have any relevance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are being dishonest.</p>

<p>What part do you believe is dishonest? I have made no statements with dishonest intent (in the history of this account). My only agenda is Truth. Not truth as the Left or the Right sees it - objective Truth.</p>

<p>For the record, I am not a Trump supporter, nor do I despise him.</p>

<p>If you believe we are enemies, just know that it is entirely one sided. I will not engage you in a state of war, only discourse. If you cannot bring yourself to do the same, I only ask, why not??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because in America, we are constantly told bad things about the &quot;official&quot; enemies of us (Iran, Russia, China, Syria, Aghanistan, Iraq, etc.).</p>

<p>What is discussed less often is how horrible we are. And even if it is brought up, it&#39;s always with the caveat that although we are horrible, it was secretly for the &quot;greater good&quot;; the greater good, of course, being a very amorphously defined phrase that allows the US to pretend that it is the &quot;good guy&quot; no matter how many millions of deaths we cause.</p>

<p>So when the current MSM dominates political discourse with anti-Trump/anti-Russia stories, people react by wanting to discuss the story from a different angle.</p>

<p>Almost never do you see true support of Russia, just people who are skeptical of the dominant narrative, which is something conspiracy theorists have always been about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the largest issues is that the structure of reddit is not well-suited to political or geopolitical discussion. The upvote system was a decent solution to the problem of content aggregation. If I  want to see gifs of cute kittens, I can go to a sub for that and, for the most part, the wisdom of the crowd who also want gifs of cute kittens will bring the best gifs to the top. </p>

<p>Yet for any topic which is controversial, and especially when participants have a vested interest in the affecting the opinions of others, the vote system breaks down. It becomes nothing more than a battleground of competing narratives, and &#39;reddiquette&#39; is overwhelmed by ideological motives. Outside of small subs which aren&#39;t seen as influential, or subs with strict moderation, votes are only indicative of which side is more motivated at any given point in time. </p>

<p>This sub still has value but it is because we don&#39;t censor topics or subjects. You, the user, can find quite a bit of truth here, but it is on <em>you</em> to find it and separate it from the copious misinformation and disinformation. Browse /new, sort by controversial, and check your own biases and preconceptions. Explore rabbit holes that challenge your worldview. Question where information comes from and the motives people have for disseminating it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, post USSR, the Russians are far closer to the right, ideologically. They&#39;re Christian, socially conservative, nationalist, pro-&quot;capitalism&quot; (which really just means they &quot;privatized&quot; formerly state operated industries and handed control over to selected oligarchs), anti-Muslim, etc. There&#39;s a reason a Russian national was arrested on Saturday as an unregistered foreign agent that was working closely with the NRA (sorry, GUN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION) to curry favor with the GOP, and it has far more to do with common ideology than it does anything else. </p>

<p>I think the Russians see a chance to align themselves ideologically with members of the far right in the USA, and both sides could see it as being beneficial. </p>

<p>Russia has the obvious benefit of improved relations with the country most forcefully demanding they be sanctioned.</p>

<p>As for the USA, it goes a bit deeper, and this is where we get to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> worthy material (buckle up). It isn&#39;t much of a secret that many on the far right in the USA have a lot of disdain for our NATO allies and Western Liberalism in general. They feel like the USA is being used and getting away from what they think is the heart of our origins as a nation. There are aspects of the right in the USA that would like to see a reshaping of America into a Christian nation, governed by Christian law and ideals. Look in to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_theology">Christian Dominionism</a> to start down the rabbit hole. They believe that America was founded as a Christian nation and should be a Christian nation once again in order to restore our waning glory. These people are real, and have influence in the GOP. I believe Betsy Devos has been linked to some of these political groups to throw a name out there related to the current administration. Steve Bannon is also on record as having similar beliefs re: the state of the world being a war between the Christian West and everyone else. He was also pretty anti-Russia though, which, who knows, maybe that&#39;s part of why he fell out of favor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m meandering a bit though so I&#39;ll try to bring this back to the focus on Russia. The aforementioned Russian national that was arrested appeared to do most of her political networking in two spheres, the NRA and events related to the National Prayer Breakfast. The National Prayer Breakfast itself is a relatively benign thing. Many politicians on both sides have participated. However, the origins of it are tied to a group that has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family:_The_Secret_Fundamentalism_at_the_Heart_of_American_Power">accused of some pretty shady stuff</a>, an organization known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_(Christian_organization">The Family, or The Fellowship</a>). While these people wrap themselves in the name of Jesus, the high profile misdeeds and moral failings of known political members show that they&#39;re far more interested in power and money than anything else. </p>

<p>Perhaps these individuals saw Trump as a chance to radically reshape the political landscape locally and globally with the help of populism and a little friendly assistance from like minded people in Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;election influencing&quot; topic is a red herring. It&#39;s a false trail that leads nowhere. Here&#39;s some news for you: elections have been bought and sold since the beginning of time. There may have been a brief golden age in the U.S. where it actually was a true democracy, but that ended a long, long time ago. Now all kinds of propaganda campaigns are waged, all kind of influence is bought and sold, corporations own politicians outright, etc.</p>

<p>But where do &lt;&lt;they&gt;&gt; have you focusing your attention? On some &quot;Russian&quot; hackers and trolls, some of whom may even have been employed by the Russian state, but who couldn&#39;t possibly sway the outcome of an entire election in the face of all the above. </p>

You don&#39;t know how many liberals I have seen saying I am right-wing because I am centrist and point out certain flaws or been called a Nazi because of my skin color and told I should die or not be able to voting or speak my mind on issues. </p>

<p>Russia, Syria, Trump, Conservatives <a href="https://www.byline.com/column/67/article/2122"><strong>all</strong> used the same private company to rig elections</a>. This is why they&#39;re so made at Putin and Assad, they thought these people would be puppets for them but they learned everything they needed to know about making election wins happen and out-smarted them.
The oligarchs of the west <strong>really</strong> don&#39;t like people beating them at their own game. </p>

<p>Now we have effectively rigged elections the world over and democracy is just a rubber stamping for who has the means to subvert the media will continually win. Good luck breaking the big lies of the past few decades with 10,000&#39;s of full time government sock-puppets lying to people 24/7. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So let me just say this: If you accept anything a government intelligence service claims at face value, without question, then you do not belong here. Period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  Given that the CIA has already been exposed as having a program designed to manufacture cybercrime evidence and pin the blame on foreign countries, why the hell would <em>anyone</em> trust <em>any</em> digital evidence coming from our intelligence agencies at this point?</p>

<p>This is not to say foreign agencies don&#39;t try to further their interests in the United States - <em>that&#39;s their job, after all.</em>  But no one here should be accepting the spook narrative being obediently vomited up by the mainstream media.  </p>

<p>And I think, for the most part, <em>real</em> <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posters don&#39;t.  But we have a lot of people raiding from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, paid astroturfers, and the crew at Elgin AFB who radically skew the votes.  It&#39;s all about shaping the narrative and manufacturing the consensus they want.</p>

<p>When dealing with misinformation, your best course of action is to ignore official channels and develop a narrative that best fits the motivations of the players involved.  You can&#39;t trust most information they feed you, but you can trust people and organizations to work in their own interests.  Once you figure out those interests, you will be able to build a framework by figuring out how shadowy organizations would move to support those interests.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that the Russian boogeyman narrative was created just as the War on Terror is wrapping up.  It&#39;s in the interests of our intelligence agencies and military contractors to maintain a perpetual state of war - preferably hot but in the absence of an easy target, cold will do.</p>

<p>I also find it perfectly reasonable that Russia was motivated to develop close ties with the subordinates of a president-elect in order to further Russian interests.  Just as I would expect Israel or China to do.  China, in fact, was very influential in Bill Clinton&#39;s presidency and Israel exercises undo influence over <em>every</em> president.</p>

<p>Our spooks are using this combination of normal foreign power plays and manufactured evidence to renew our permanent state of war -- and Russia is just the easiest story to sell because their hands are never clean.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible, and I would argue likely, that this is retaliation for something Russian oligarchs or the Russian government itself did (i there&#39;s a difference anymore) that had nothing to do with the election.  My own theory is that the Flash Crash was a successful dry run and that Russia is attempting to engineer something even more crippling and financially beneficial.</p>

<p>Our government doesn&#39;t want to admit the house of cards could crash.  The Russians don&#39;t want to admit they&#39;re trying to blow it over.  And so we get this stupid show over &quot;election meddling&quot; to cover for the real reasons for increased tensions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol so with ALL of the evidence that the interfered with our election you think it’s a massive conspiracy and the Russians are innocent and the US is purposefully painting them to be evil? Do you not look at history or the news? Putin kills his opposition, he rigs elections, he launders mafia money through russian banks, they celebrate spies when they return to russia, like come on dude. It’s not some massive conspiracy this is just basic cause and effect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not propaganda to hate trump and russia it’s just pointing out the facts and you either react like the majority of the world or you don’t. You can do whatever you want man. It’s so sad to see this is what being a conspiracy theorist has become. Someone once told me “dont go too deep, everything will be ok”. Not everything is a conspiracy, I promise. Clintons don’t rule the universe, trump isn’t hated because he is “against the deep state”,  putin isn’t just a “good guy who is misunderstood”. You can treat everything like a conspiracy but you have to be prepared to look at every side, not just what you want to be true. </p>

You trumptards have got to stop assuming shit without the facts being present. Notice how I called you a trumptard? Now it’s safe to say I hate trump, justifiably I might add.

    <div class="md"><p>Agree 100%, but you forgot to mention 9-11. The patriot act was like dealing three cards up, instead of 5 down. Each agency got to peak into the abyss and gambled on freedom and liberty, while bluffing on privacy. It was all going on before this, but nothing like it is now. Snowden was the dealer who changed the game from 5 card stud to 7 card roll your own, king killer, queen follower, one eyed jacks, and deuces wild. It’s a fucking nightmare where anything goes and no one knows what the other is holding because there are too many variables when everyone goes dark. It’s going to crash down hard. The only winners are the people at the table. The spectators get to pay the consequences. US citizens have never realized our country was the gamble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or I mean it could just be the very obvious fact the Donald Trump is a bumbling, psychopathic idiot, a fact which is almost universally agreed upon. The fact that anyone would think there even <em>needs</em> to be a conspiracy against him at this point is beyond me. I am a believer in deep state conspiracy theories in some regards, but anyonee who wants to conspire against Trump just needs to sit back and watch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree with the mainstream narrative... receive mass downvotes.</p>

<p>This is a very succinct description of a couple of a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The group mind. This is the mass of users on reddit who are a bit less aware and a bit more weak-minded. Once part of the group, they are more vulnerable to the manipulation of the group by those who understand group psychology.</p></li>
<li><p>In this case, the mainstream narrative is the manipulation. </p></li>
<li><p>Downvotes are part of the control. They represent a score, a quantifiable display of how closely the user&#39;s comment conforms to the group. Since the group conforms to the manipulation (ie. mainstream narrative), the comments must conform to the narrative in order to receive upvotes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, the best comments are the ones that have the most downvotes. Why? Because they represent someone with a strong mind who is still capable of thinking for themselves and willing to express the truth (as they see it) despite group pressure and downvotes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>fourth: in the continued subversion of the current President </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you look over at worldnews, you see tons of negative headlines and negative comments getting tons of upvotes. When you look at the front page, you see posts from the bogus anti-Trump subreddits getting 20k upvotes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot like watching a whole herd of cattle suddenly start running in the same direction. This is called a stampede. It usually happens because something got a few of them spooked... not because each of the cattle are thinking for themselves.</p>

<p>tldr; If you have an understanding of how crowds and herds act, reddit becomes a lot more obvious.</p>

I used to consider myself a democrat until I saw how the Hopium that Obama gave the nation was just that, a quick high and nothing changed. That’s when I realized this whole two party system is a sham. Though I disagree with many of the Trump administrations policies at least he does what he says and that is refreshing.  </p>

I wish there were a way to tell for sure one way or the other...</p>
