    <div class="md"><p>As I peruse zerohedge, they seem to have a hardon for destroying Musk.  But the longer you look at it, you start to realize that it&#39;s the trade sector trying to destroy him.  It looks to me as an attempt at a hostile takeover of Tesla.  </p>

<p>It also appears that Musk&#39;s ventures don&#39;t follow Wall St. traditions.  Yeah, he&#39;s willing to lose a shitload of money because he believes in his product.  He&#39;s not going to keep doing something if he sees failure on the horizon.  Musk puts a lot of his own cash into his ventures, and he has a history of success through persistence.</p>

<p>One of the most disgusting claims I&#39;ve read was that he has a &quot;history of failures&quot; then the cite SpaceX early tests as failures.  Rocket science and the stock market don&#39;t belong together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ONLY reason I like Elon musk is because he seems to be one of the few businessmen out there trying to change things in our world in a positive way. </p>

<p>He’s selling solar panels that look like roof shingles and batteries that can store enough of that energy to power an entire house or apartment building. His electric cars have popularized the idea of owning a car that doesn’t run on gasoline. And if his hyperloop system can do what he claims it can (NYC to D.C. in 30 mins) then he is on the way to revolutionizing the transportation industry. </p>

<p>I guess when I see negative news on Elon and his companies (which I see very often), I take it with a grain of salt and think about all the rich and powerful entities he has out there hoping for his failure. The kind of people who would prefer things to always stay just as they are. </p>

<p>Maybe it’s just the kid in me who thought we’d all have flying cars by now. But the older I get, the more I understand how resistant our business world is to actual, real, human advancement and change. It makes perfect sense that the people making a living on the current system the way things are would be against anyone trying to change it, even if that change could make the world better for the rest of humanity. </p>

<p>But at the end of the day, Elon Musk is a human being like the rest of us. And just like the rest of us he can be a total asshole. I don’t have to like the guy to like what he’s trying to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One or more hedge funds are taking short positions and using the media to dupe people into betting similarly.
