        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The first time this happened a few days ago I brushed it off as coincidence but now that it’s happened again I’m starting to believe that it’s not a coincidence.</p>

<p>I get the pretty standard run of the mill ads. I rarely see a new ad while watching YouTube. YouTube is where I see the vast majority of ads. As I said I get pretty generic ones, and anytime I get a new ad is when I’ve visited a certain site. For example every time I visit Articbuffalo.com and go to watch a YouTube video I get an Articbuffalo.com advertisement before my videos.</p>

<p>A few days ago I drove my grandparents to the airport. We were making idle chatter, and I asked them what airline they were flying with. They told me and then my grandma said “I was recommended to fly  West Jet, but they were more expensive.” We moved on in the conversation and nothing more was said about West Jet. When I got home I went to sleep for a bit since it was about 5am. When I woke up a few hours later I went to YouTube to listen to stories like I do every day. The video started playing an ad and low and behold it was for West Jet. I thought it was weird and asked myself if my phone was listening for trigger or key words to later run advertisements matching.</p>

<p>I haven’t thought anything about it until now 3 days later.</p>

<p>Earlier today I was driving with my sister. I drove past a VW dealership and said to myself but audibly “I do really like the VW Jetta.” I’m in the market to buy my first car, and I’ve been considering VW. I was just sort of talking aloud to no one when I said what I did.</p>

<p>Just before writing this post I was settling in bed to watch some YouTube when I got my first ad of the night. You guessed it! An ad for the VW Jetta.</p>

<p>“You’ll love the new VW Jetta.” The announcer said to me through headphones as the 5 second ad played.</p>

<p>I just want to clarify that I wouldn’t post this if it wasn’t for the fact that West Jet, and VW are 2 ads that I don’t see play before my YouTube videos. I get car ads but they’re almost always Jeep ads. Which funny enough all I talk about is how badly I want to buy a Jeep, but how I can’t afford one. </p>

<p>I do believe that our smart phones are listening to pick up key words to than later show us advertising that matches what we talked about. What better way to show personalized ads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is confirmed and I&#39;ve tested it a few times recently. Just a few days ago my wife and I were talking about needing to go to the dentist and later that night she had ads for dentistrys. that was the most extreme case we have had so far. we literally said maybe one or two sentences about it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s worse, is I&#39;m sure our phone/laptop cameras are logging info as well. It&#39;s very easy to connect to personal security cameras, so why not just have constant stream of info on our daily lives. Locations, conversations, images, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea if you have a smart phone it&#39;s going to happen unless you disables your permissions, which makes apps unusable mostly. what&#39;s more unsettling is that I doubt that&#39;s that&#39;s nbn only info being mined. I&#39;m not on social media other than a quick browse on Instagram. I&#39;m very conflicted on the whole thing. I almost dont care because I have nothing to hide, but maybe one day I will. And kind of uncomfortable with databases being used to keep tabs on people, but again why does it matter if Google knows everywhere I&#39;ve been since I signed in on my phone...8yrs ago. I guess it&#39;s just principal. I know things will take a turn for the worse, and I won&#39;t be surprised like everyone else.</p>

<p>I’ve shared thoughts with people close to me when we were vibrating at the same frequency, and am able to tune into people’s energy. This being said I cannot read people’s minds.

    <div class="md"><p>Well if any sort of monitoring is going on that involves what I type, I need to get an oil change ;-). I&#39;ve heard the Jetta is nice. Also, I&#39;ve heard of this before. I read an article late last year about these people that were talking about cat litter. They got articles for cat litter a few days later. They decided to test it and purposely had conversations about Mazda. They got Mazda ads on Facebook a few days later. It&#39;s not surprising that they&#39;re using what we post and such to give us ads that relate to us but listening in on our conversations is something else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about this last night.  I don&#39;t believe in this and I will tell you why.  I spend a lot of time in an incognito browser.  While there many things are said around my smartphone, but never once has anything I didn&#39;t want to see popped up in an ad.  This shit is always too selective.  If it were true I would be bombarded with ads I would never want to see.  People just see a lot of confirmation bias.  Fact is we talk about a ton of shit eventually something will pop up that seems freaky coincidental.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without a doubt! Had a conversation about tires.. ads for tires.... one really freaked me out... looking at a laptop at bestbuy... talking to bf... no it&#39;s too expensive, let&#39;s keep looking. Get it my car.. I checked my email for reason and immediately had a coupon for $50 off. This might be a good tactic to use against them? Lol anything you ever need to buy just say it&#39;s too expensive and get coupons?? :D ?</p>

Yesterday during work I went on Reddit and the first ad was for an easy online app for making animated banners. So I guess gmail is giving this information to some data pool that is being used by reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geo fencing advertisement services are really starting to take off now. A company can target their ads to people that have been to a certain area during a period time with tons of customization. For a basic example, an airliner could target ads to devices that came within x distance of their terminal at an airport. For a more complex example, lets say a band wants to advertise their new album. They could look up venues where music acts of their same genre are playing and target ads to people that were at that venue during the time the concert was happening. It&#39;s pretty wild and a bit creepy.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some devices are already secretly listening to conversations in order to target ads, but I think most of the anecdotal evidence of it that we have so far can be attributed to geo fenced ad targetting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true, they are listening to our phones are at least.</p>

<p>There are microphones in our phones.</p>

<p>It is really creepy, for example I was out at a camp being a camp counselor for a week and I had 10 kids under my watch all 10-11 years old.</p>

<p>My phone was turned off, my group of kids started talking about Fortnite, and a few of them  were imitating Shrek how he says “Donkey” which sounds like “Dunkey”. </p>

<p>I go on a 1 hour break to rest from the kids, I turn on my phone, open up YouTube, and the videos that were being recommend to me we’re all fortnite, and there was one video from the username “Dunkey”</p>

<p>I was pretty freaked out.</p>

<p>Fuck you government stop listening to us.</p>
