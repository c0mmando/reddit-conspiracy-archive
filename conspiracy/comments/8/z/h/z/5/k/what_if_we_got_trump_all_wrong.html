       just playing devil's advocate to see what comes out of the woodwork...
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        what if Trump isn't concerned about Russian meddling because he already knows it wasn't Russian meddling--that the meddling was actually the CIA (aka deep state) to make it look like Russian meddling
       </li>
       <li>
        what if Trump knows (has a really good idea) the Pandora box of crap that the CIA has/is done/doing but can't vocally come out against the CIA because look at what happened to the Kennedy's, MLK, etc.
       </li>
       <li>
        what if Trump's border controls is to actually hinder the CIA
       </li>
       <li>
        what if Trump is friendly with Putin and Kim Jong because he knows that the CIA hasn't compromised their inner circles, but has compromised all the other leaders' circles
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I could make even more speculation , but just would like to see what you guys may dig up to refute or support these theories

       He’s got a huge boned for imperialistic Israel and the Zionist pigs running it. I can’t trust a guy who supports a country massacring and relocating hundred of thousands of Palestinians from their own homes. He’s no where as evil as Hillary or Bush, but he’s not a saint either.

       You mean when he gave them a huge win, relocating their embassy where they wanted it?

       The only people who had targets painted on their backs from this were the Palestinians (as always), as Israel was even more empowered than normal to continue to kill them.

       I am not American but my feeling is that he has no idea WTF he’s doing, HOWEVER- I think he is aware and ready to expose all the mess previous Administrations have made, which will ultimately be a major step forward. I just think he’s going about it the wrong way. He’s a narcissist so he is all about “I am the best, I did this”, and I think he overly-admires tyrannists and wishes to have a dictatorship for his own, personal agenda...he would have a much better impact on the history books if he represented or re-branded all these issues as “hey, this is how terribly broken things are- let’s fix it together”  (the classic “there’s no “I” in TEAM”).  His public opinion would be very different.

       Exactly. The MSM would never let him carry out an agenda like that openly, so he has had to go around the MSM and create Q. Everyone saying how stupid and unprepared Trump is, is going to have the rudest of awakenings.

       There is a terrible thing about America: No one wants to "fix" it. Two or three camps have sprung up, mostly inflexibly, around political ideologies, and the supporters of each think that eventually they'll get the best of the others, and gold will rain in them while shit bubbles up to drown the others. There is no fixing it, because major (though differing) problems exist on all sides, and the support for one sides solutions inevietably lead to a swing in support of the other side. We've been given half angel/half demons to vote for. How do you choose?

       Its going to differ immensely based on who you ask.  But these are the questions that are being  fought over in the media, and this sub, on a daily basis.  There's the neoliberals, who downvote the trump supporters, thers the trump supporters that downvote the neoliberals, and there's the sanders supporters who get downvoted by everbody.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's played out on a literally daily basis, so spend a week watching this sub and that will pretty much cover it.

       Oh boy, you'll love this Q guy then!  This is pretty much what he says.
       <br/>
       1.  Yes pretty much spot on Q.
       <br/>
       2. Yes, kinda except Trump is doing something about it, and that's what this summit was about.  Putin playing ball on his side and revealing some of the information he has.
       <br/>
       3. Yes, kinda, but mostly human trafficking and such.  Which the See EYE a is invovled in, supposedly.
       <br/>
       4. This is possible.  He's also friendly with Saudi Arabian leadership.  Remember the BIG envelope from Kim?  Do you think that might have something important in it?
       <br/>
       Sorry, I generally don't bring up Q in non Q subs, but you're really close there with your theories.

        what if Trump isn't concerned about Russian meddling because he already knows it wasn't Russian meddling--that the meddling was actually the CIA (aka deep state) to make it look like Russian meddling

       Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that Hillary rigged the DNC in her favor (should have been Bernie, doesn't matter if you liked him or not, should have been his nomination) and given her contacts from years of service and/or being a puppet of the deep state, then it's not hard to believe that she would have been a part of the plan to make it look like Trump via Russia hacked her accounts to cast shade on Trump and secure her election.  The media was doing an excellent job at spinning it that way as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I believe this one way or another.  But definitely an interesting perspective to be open to and to look for evidence.

       Welcome to the Great Awakening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine where we could be today if GWB hadn't been so quick to trust the USIC regarding Saddam Hussein? He was also extremely vocal in his denial of the accusations against his alleged WMD program. Remember when he asked for a public forum with GWB in an effort to avoid war? Look where that got us. Trillions of dollars and thousands of lives and untold damage and destabilization in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we see the desperate last-ditch effort to bait the masses into war with Russia - a fucking nuclear superpower. This is no Iraq. This would destroy the world as we know it and must be avoided at all costs. We are extremely fortunate to have Donald Trump as president right now.
