       Seriously. There are lots of insinuations and accusations and all sorts of blustering, but can any one point me to firm evidence of Russia's interference/meddling with our election? Serious question. Thanks

       There is zero evidence in those indictments, only allegations. I'm not saying that they couldn't be true, just that they haven't been scrutinized in a court of law, and none of the allegations presented are independently verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that there is evidence, then why is it that when Concord Consulting, a group indicted for election meddling by the special counsel, showed up in court to defend themselves, Mueller stonewalled the discovery process and refused to hand over the evidence that the defense is legally entitled to review?

       Here’s the thing though, if there was only allegations then would we not have indictments for many other events? Like Hillary being indicted or Podesta or all the pizzagate folks. And don’t hit me with the “well the deep state doesn’t want them indicted” bullshit. The fact is Clinton is public enemy number 1 for the Republicans and they control all aspects of our government at the moment. If indictments didn’t need evidence and only allegations she’d be up to her neck in them along with all her cronies. But they aren’t. You know why? Because a lack of evidence. You know why those Russians were indicted and that woman was arrested? Because there was evidence.

       You're trying to make it sound like Mueller waffled because he doesn't have evidence.  A federal judge doesn't agree with you that these foreign nationals with ties to Russian intelligence are entitled to view sensitive information.  At least not at this stage of the process.  According to the judge, "... federal prosecutors gave 'ample good cause' that identifying sources in the probe could tip off Russian intelligence and other foreign services to ongoing national security investigations and undermine efforts to protect future elections from similar interference."

       Then why issue an indictment if you're not prepared to take the case to court. That is THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF AN INDICTMENT. You investigate, prepare a case, and indict.

       They're refusing to hand evidence to Russian lawyers acting on behalf of their clients (charged with crimes), due to the sensitive nature of the information and the ongoing investigation. They WILL give the evidence to the actual people charged with the crimes if they come to the US and request it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That evidence won't be made available to the lawyers until it's deemed appropriate and won't affect the current investigation.

       They didn't show up in court, they hired a bunch of American lawyers to contest the charges. Mueller argued that the information is sensitive and should not be seen by the Russians unless they show up to defend themselves in the US. The judge sided with Mueller. The lawyers can still see the evidence, but they are barred from showing it to their Russian clients.

       An indictment is literally an accusation that establishes enough probable cause to charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking for evidence it will be presented at trial, except in this case there will be no trial unless the US establishes in personam jurisdiction over the defendants. This will be impossible because those charged will not come to the US and Russia will not extradite them.

       There is enough movement that saying "I trust Putin over our own investigation" is intentionally ignorant.  But your right no one should be judged in the court of public opinion... neither Trump or anyone else.  But similarly we shouldn't be trying to do them favors.   ABOVE ALL we should stand behind our own people that are working to find the truth.

       For starters, you don't have to be a fan of Putin to be skeptical of
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       particular conspiracy theory.  That said, what exactly is 'movement'?  We have had an evolving collection of allegations, but we are still at flat-zero in terms of evidence.

       We could have said the same of Colin Powell and his little vial or even Mueller when he testified to congress about his fear that Iraq was supplying terrorists with WMD.  I would argue that it is
       <em>
        crucially
       </em>
       important to be skeptical of this kind of claim.

       Yes, but this doesn't include simply taking them at their word.  We stand behind them with our tax dollars and with the protection of our legal system.  They are not entitled to any more than that.

       The only additional entitlement is the one we all deserve: a government that is united to take care of it's citizens.  This means not standing next to a forgein leader and declaring to the world that they are more trustworthy.  United we stand.  Divided we fall.  We are definitely divided.

       We can have as many internal disagreements as we want, but it is horrid that the leader of our nation doesn't stand up for us in the global arena.

       Ive always felt times like this just gives them time to manufacture the next 'smoking gun' while we wait. Probably use our banter on social media to shape a piece that fits for their narrative. No way any actual evidence is held back by these people, in this current environment.

       Yes, but this is nonsense. We KNOW the DNC was leaked, not hacked. We KNOW Guccifer 2.0 is a US intelligence operation. So indictments based on fabrications are literally worthless, except as a PR exercise--which is exactly what this is.

       First, the AP publishes a story starting that all 17 intelligence organizations say Russia hacked us. They then retract it later and clarify that only 3 do, the NSA, FBI and CIA. We then found out the NSA said "sure, its possible", the CIA said "we agree with whatever the FBI has to say on the matter" and the FBI agents in charge had clear conflict of interest and never saw direct evidence but simply trusted a private third party that was paid for by the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, not exactly rock solid evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the whole transfer rates of the data being too high for internet transfer speeds, a DNC IT guy was murdered in an apparently botch robbery after the breach but before the release by Wikileaks and Wikileaks point at his case as important, and the released evidence to the public about the breach has been roundly discredited as not evidence at all, especially as some of the origin nodes were from TOR routers which means their physical location is pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure its the Russians maskerading as Ukrainians using outdated hacking software that is freely available to literally anyone online using a TOR endpoint that still pointed back to them and then took that data and released it completely to Wikileaks in the hopes this somehow gets Donald Trump elected in a few months when at the time he was expected to lose by 20 points.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't hold on to the data until October so it would have maximum effect, no they released it to wikileaks pretty much immediately after receiving the data about DNC railroading Bernie so as to disrupt the Democrat National Convention with the ultimate goal of helping Trump win ... somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Trump will remove Russian sanctions and generally be Putin's puppet. (None of which has played out.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I am pretty sure that's the media approved narrative, and beyond the fact it makes no sense, there is also not a single piece of evidence that supports it. Unless you count Trump campaign had a short meeting with a Russian once and then didn't do anything afterwards as evidence, which I guess some do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh an Trump fired Comey to cover this up and not because Comey was a terrible FBI directive despite the fact if you believe everything above it all happened under his watch and according to him he had forewarning of it happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes its good to review how we got here and how time has not treated the feasibility of the core story very well.

       The indictments were approved by a grand jury. It means enough evidence was submitted to justify criminal charges. Yes in this case is is more symbolic, but the indictments were not granted without evidence that there was a crime committed.

       It hasn't got to the point, as in a panel of citizens that is convened by a court to decide whether it is appropriate for the government to indict (proceed with a prosecution against) someone suspected of a crime and it never will either.

       A indictment is not evidence under U.S. law and your link is irrelevant to the conversation.

       Let me re-educate those, especially ones who are so blindly following to the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your team wants to challenge it but at the same time can't because they also did reckless rigging as well.  The Russian claims are so porous your investigation boat cannot even make it out of port without it immediately taking on water and sinking like a rock.  The best that can be done is information smearing and roping as many uninformed people to fight for that lost cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are afraid to bring up Guccifer 2.0 because you dismissed it during the campaign as an unsightly weakness to your rigging and the fact that it is not actually tied to Russia when the DNC was exposed.  The DNI threw out the evidence for Russian collusion/rigging because it was actually your party and supporting shadow hands that  royally fucked it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damage control does not even convey the information programs working overtime to keep the dems ship afloat.

       It's way too early for that step.  You guys are still at the "denying anything happened, or if it did it wasn't illegal" step.  You don't move on to the "obviously this shit was illegal, but it was a false flag by those sneaky libruls" step until you can't deny the evidence with a straight face anymore.

       no, because most of them are either from 10 years ago or they don't have any link to Trump nor does it prove that Trump used these people to swing the election. It's just there because "25 indictments" next to trump's name sounds juicy.

       This thread is asking whether there is evidence that Russia tried to impact US elections, not whether Trump was involved. There is plenty of evidence in those indictments to agree that members of the GRU actively worked to sway the election. That's 100% confirmed, even Fox News will admit that. Even if Trump wasn't actively conspiring with Russia, he is actively ignoring the generally accepted fact that Russia took measures to impact the outcome of the election in his favor all because Putin says he didn't do it. Seems shady as hell.

       That is a lie, there is zero evidence available to back up your claim, indictments are not considered evidence under U.S. law and those 12

       What evidence is given in the indictments? They have zero actual physical evidence of the hack. The FBI hasn’t even been allowed to physically investigate the server, how could they have evidence? Oh yeah, I forgot. They’re going off of the DNC contracted CrowdStrike for their analysis. No need for a proper, impartial investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Binney and VIPS would like to have a word about actual evidence and analysis of what we do have available. Here’s a little secret - it doesn’t jive at all with Russian hackers remotely stealing the data. That’s probably why we never hear anything about it in the press.

       I don't think you understand what an indictment is. It's a "a formal charge or accusation of a serious crime". These are charges that are being made, not the entire judicial system/evidence set/jurors/etc printed on a sheet of paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       The indictment makes the claims. The evidence is presented to a judge and jury backing up the claims made in the indictment.

       The indictment doesn't provide the evidence, the evidence is presented during the trial.

       In this case I think it was presented to a grand jury who concluded that there was enough evidence to make the charges. But this evidence hasn't been released to the public.

       Note that the prosecutor has absolute control over what information is presented to the grand jury. It is perfectly legal for the prosecutor to withhold evidence which suggests the accused is innocent and only present evidence which creates the appearance of guilt. It is also perfectly legal to present evidence which would not be admissible in court. The standard of evidence for indictment is only "probable cause" rather than the much stronger "reasonable doubt" standard required for conviction. This is what all the fuss is about. In high profile cases, there is legitimate danger that indictments can be used as a political weapon.

       Guilty pleas from whom? Manafort and Flynn? Manaforts is from before he even knew Trump. Flynn pleaded guilty when even the FBI agents who interviewed him said he told the truth, and he pled guilty how long ago, still awaiting sentencing? Who else has made a deal or been found guilty? Every indictment made public is for some faceless Russian intel agent. Good luck with that.

       Not about evidence, no.  There was no evidence included in the indictments (nor is there usually).  As to the guilty pleas, those had nothing to do with Russia hacking anyone.

       I'm not sure I understand how it's any different from (eg:) the police reporting that they have a suspect or perpetrator, and the media relaying that to us without being privy to the full body of police evidence. Is every media report on any police case "tabloid bullshit" too?

       If they are worth their salt, then they would be talking about allegations and not stating their guilt as fact.  Media figures and elected officials far and wide have been doing exactly that.

      <p>
       I just expect the claims to match reality.  Right now, we have allegations with zero evidence.  That's fine, but no one should be acting as if they know more than they do and if they want to take the prosecutor's word on faith, then they should be honest that this is what they are doing.

       OK sure, but I've got bad news for you man. You're probably never gonna have the granularity of evidence that you apparently need to form a view. Not in this case, nor pretty much any other investigation. And in almost any endeavour involving parsing or compiling information, you're going to have to take something on a basis of faith in someone else's work.

Every election in the USA has several companies, interest groups from all over the world including Russia giving money to certain candidates and it was just a thing that was not really talked about but it was happening. another country "hacking" our democracy is a very vague term that was used in this election to pin Trump directly to Russia. The narrative was "this evil superpower, Russia, and their super villian DICTATOR (Putin, who was actually democratically elected by the Russia people, who a very large number of Russians actually like him) somehow gave orders to hack the DNC and steal emails so Russia can swing the US election. Seth Rich died around this time so we will never know the real story, unless you rely on these intelligence agencies which haven't really been the most truthful over the last----well, probably ever. This whole thing, despite the "hack", is only important because Trump got elected and its just another tactic to get him out of the white house because people and media are so desperate to get him out. What's more disgusting to me than a foreign country "hacking" our democracy is our OWN COUNTRY HACKING EVERYTHING INCLUDING MEDIA AND ELECTIONS only to FLIP EVERYTHING ON TRUMP. They could not wait until Trump and Putin met so they can paint this whole thing as how Trump is a traitor and this is proof of him being Putin's pal. This whole thing is blown out of proportion and it is my opinion to say, Trump is doing the right thing here as far as trying to keep the peace between the USA and Russia. Please don't attack me for agreeing with Trump on something.

       By that rationale, no one would be making any claims-of-fact about Russia hacking anything since there is no evidence yet released.

       It's absolutely mind-boggling. Want to keep every shred of evidence locked up tight until the investigation is complete? Fine, then we shouldn't have a billion fucking articles published acting like the evidence is long settled and there is nothing left to debate. We shouldn't have mass hysteria and people calling treason over Russian meddling without giving the public specific details about the accusations and hard evidence to back it all up. This is Saddam Hussein and his WMDs all over again and this time they are trying to bait us into war with Russia.

       This really depends on what you define as "interference/meddling".  They illegally gained access to emails between democrats and then shared them with the public.  It's not like they switched votes in a voting machine, erased votes or otherwise tampered with actually voting systems.  Their actions were intended to sway public opinion.  And I have a hard time calling the action of swaying public opinion "hacking our democracy" - that's pretty much what every person involved in a campaign is doing...
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the Russians been as good as Americans at interfering with an election, they'd just had orchestrated a coup and put in their own guy.  Americans remain the best at election tampering - by a long shot.

       Or at least this was estimated by some intelligence agencies.  They were very clear about not claiming that this was any kind of certainty.  It's all in the report.

       In this case I think it was presented to a grand jury who concluded that there was enough evidence to make the charges. But this evidence hasn't been released to the public.
