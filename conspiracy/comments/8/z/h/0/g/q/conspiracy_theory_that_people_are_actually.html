       Why is every single piece of media I am reading/watching today so blown away by what Trump said.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly did he reveal today in his press conference with Putin that was not already common knowledge?
      </p>
      <p>
       He has systematically shit on his own intelligence agency numerous times, and denied anything at all to do with Russian collusion and praised Puntin in public and via his tweets.
      </p>
      <p>
       He just came back from the G7 in Canada last week and shit on the Canadian PM while calling for Russia to be let back in.
      </p>
      <p>
       He openly says he wants to dissolve NATO and called the EU a foe, I just can’t understand why people are so blown away by today’s news conference and the weekend in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly did he say that was so jaw dropping that we have not heard or read from him before today?

       At the Nato meeting he told Germany to not buy natural gas from Russia. He even get other countries to invest more into Nato to make it stronger. How does that benefit Russia? We still have sanctione on Russia. Troops in Syria, and supplying arms for Ukraine. Those things all oppose Russia. Now Russia is the biggest nuclear threat on the planet so I see why he would attempt good relations with them. We don't need a nuclear war with them. There is a difference between getting along and being in their pocket.

       Never said they were no longer threats, that was a big jump. Never mentioned Isis either. Only showing things that oppose Russia and stating being friendly is not the same as being owned by them.

       Save this comment. You are onto something big. There will come a time when people know that Donald Trump was not pro-Russia and that Donald Trump was not anti-NATO. But by then, he'll be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       His demands for more NATO funding obviously make NATO stronger. How come nobody is seeing that? This one's easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       His relationship with Vladimir Putin is a little more difficult to get. Expect a double cross. There is no way that all those Republicans who have the power to remove Donald Trump from office sit by submissively while Trump buddies with Russia -- unless they know a double cross is coming.

       Even Fox was blown away. Trump looked like a little bitch up there who loves Putin more than his own country. I'm not outraged and I dont try to look for something to be mad at him about every day. But it was a shameful press conference and people have a right to be upset by it.

       What exactly was “shameful” about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what point did he say something that he has not openly said before?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have people not been listening to this president for the last two years, outraged that what, he said it in front of a world audience instead of just the nightly national american news or a tweet?
      </p>
      <p>
       He openly admires Putin and Kim Jong-un, and thinks PM Trudeau is weak and the EU is the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just dont understand why people are so surprised by this, he has been saying this type of thing since day one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So today some type of revealation came to the masses, give me a break, if this is news to people they sure dont get out much.

       Nothing Trump said was new, but in light of new information, the fact that he's still sticking to this 'Putin is a saint' narrative is definitely disgraceful.
      </p>
      <p>
       With these 12 new indightments of Russian officials, our intelligence agencies are putting their money where their mouth is and Trump is choosing to undermine them and praise Putin instead. I don't know anything more disgraceful a president can do than talk shit about his own country in the midst of an attack from foreign powers, cyber or otherwise.

       Can you explain this?  As none of the indighted are going to turn up in court, the intelligence agencies have put nothing at risk.

       By indighting these 12 russian officials, our intelligence officials are saying that "while we can't show you the physical evidence, as it's still classified, we have enough proof to lock away these people if it were possible to take them to court". While it isn't concrete, it is proof that this investigation is actually going somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, even if there was no investigation, our president should not be trash talking our intelligence gathering capabilities on a global stage.

       Yes they could, but personally I think there's a reason Mueller has waited so long to do anything amidst the constant screaming of which hunt from the right and for spilled blood from the left. I think the wait was because he's trying to do a legitimate investigation, regardless of what the people are clamoring for.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, the investigation is irrelevant to Trump's comments. His faith should be in our own government and not Russia's

       Meh, the only issue here to me at least, is that the world media just shit themselves because Trump didnt change his tune at all...
      </p>
      <p>
       The one reporter put him on the spot and asked to his face basically do you believe your own country's intelligence agency or the guy beside you that they are investigating in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       His reply was the same thing he has said since day one, Putin told me he had nothing to do with it and i believe him, therefore my country’s intelligence agency is either lying or wrong.

       those spy agencies who keep getting those wonderful toys from the MIC and paid for by the American taxpayers?, well, those who haven't shifted their finances to Panama or other wonderful tax havens.
