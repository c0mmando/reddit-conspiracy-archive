        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know if the users posting anymore are actually real or bots. I&#39;ve been on reddit since its inception, and the tides have turned since 2016. A quick browse of any political post on r/all just has top comments that scream blatant propaganda.  Its as if those &quot;people&quot; or bots&quot; mass upvote the comments they want to be seen, and downvote the counter opinion.  This makes it appear as if the majority agree with the mass upvoted opinions.  Front page political posts seem to lack any critical thinking.  I feel sorry for these &quot;people&quot;, they&#39;ve fallen into a trap and don&#39;t realize it.</p>

<p>Reddit is the Fox,CNN, etc of the younger generation, and many have had their entire political opinion swayed by this site.  Bots or people pay to have comments reach the top.  Average user sees this and reaffirms their bias, growing with each passing post until discerning from a bot or person is impossible. </p>

<p>Also a quick browse of r/greatawakening gives off an eerie cult vibe.  Comments are very cookie cutter, almost like an algorithm writing them.</p>

<p>TL;DR:  An entire generation&#39;s political persuasion is based on reddit comments paid for by bots or shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you had to wait two months, it wasn&#39;t a ban. There is a 2 month waiting period because the sub&#39;s previous account age minimum was 7 days so the page was constantly inundated with 7 day old accounts. </p>

<p>The idea was that a 60 day waiting period, while annoying as hell, would reduce the number of deliberately disruptive accounts. Anyone can message the mods and request to circumvent the required waiting period. It&#39;s happened several times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there you have it. That wouldn&#39;t work because saying something negative about Russia doesn&#39;t necessarily constitute good faith action (one way or another). If you said you wanted to come in and discuss alleged Russian misdeeds in an open manner, you&#39;d have much better luck. </p>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re saying, but most of the posts like that that I&#39;ve seen quickly devolve in the comments section and so rarely lead to any meaningful exchange. It&#39;s upsetting because I have a fair amount of background knowledge on Russia and would gladly discuss hacking/spying/misdeeds, or even Russian-based conspiracy topics in general, but the threads get overrun with emotional replies or startling vote counts. </p>

<p>I view this lack of civil discourse as a desired outcome for some malicious party acting on this site. No topic should be off limits, so long as everyone in the thread can play nice and keep civil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you wouldn&#39;t say &quot;I can I post early so I can say negative things about Russia.&quot; But if you asked them if you could post an article about Russias misdeeds they would say no. Go ahead and give it a shot if you dont believe me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of accusations of bots and shills, but with how impressionable people are, and the strength of the prevailing ideologies being so great, it&#39;s easy to see how people can be &quot;programmed&quot; to act as <em>bots</em>, or play the part of <em>a shill</em> as a volunteer. It&#39;s difficult to know when or if you&#39;re making an informed decision or if you are tricked into playing the role of the useful idiot.</p>

<p>To combat this at a personal level, it&#39;s important to check your biases and constantly reassess and question what you accept as <em>true</em>. At an institutional or societal level, the best we can do is engage others and try to have a meaningful discussion, as difficult as it may be at times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A co-opted reddit is potentially more damaging then the obviously corrupt corporate media, because reddit claims to be subject to public voting. When the front page is openly for sale, when comments and votes can easily be bought, and when the admin is complicit in this activity, how can the public trust reddit inc.? The owners of this website are playing a dangerous game selling out like this. There will be another reddit type site built on block chain and hosted by the people. For now, reddit has become an example of what happens to privately owned media in a &#39;free market&#39;.</p>
