        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are some strong indications, that Donald Trump does not act in the interest of the american people.</p>

<ol>
<li>Putin and the FSB are accused by the FBI, to have intefered in the 2016 US presidential elections. These inteference is said to consist out of the follwowing parts:

<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#Cyberattack_and_email_leaks">Cyberattack on Hillary Clintons Email Account </a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#Social_media_and_internet_trolls">Social Media (Facebook) influence by fake news and internet robots.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#Intrusions_into_state_voter-registration_systems">Intrusions into state voter-registration-systems</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_between_Trump_associates_and_Russian_officials">The FBI is investigating links between Russian officials and Donald Trump&#39;s campaign team, for the questionhow many persons of Donald Trump&#39;s campaign have been actively involved in Putin&#39;s inteference in the US presidential elections.</a></li>
<li>The FBI officially accuses 12 Russian intelligence officers for the hacking of the  Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton&#39;s email account during the presidential campaign.</li>
<li>Yesterday Donald Trump has met Wladimir Putin in Helsinki. But he did not address the official FBI accusation to Putin. Instead he stated: <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/donald-trump-putin-helsinki-summit/index.html"> &quot;I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you  that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial  today,&quot; Trump said during a joint news conference after he spent about  two hours in a room alone with Putin, save for a pair of interpreters.&quot;</a></li>
</ol>

<p>All this does only makes sense, if Trump truly did dirty deal with Putin and now is depended on Putin, who blackmails him with publishing the dirty deal. </p>

<p>But if you want to suggest that he&#39;s an -employee- of Putin&#39;s, who is taking his marching orders from a foreign leader and performing acts designed to shift the entire global stage in Russia&#39;s favor and in the destruction of the United States&#39; economic treaties, alliances and standing--</p>

<p>sure, call him an asset.   </p>

<p>It actually makes him worse, IMO. A spy just shares info. An asset acts as an extension of the foreign countries&#39; will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that is true and he is a foreign asset (which i just really hope he isnt) then America is totally bought and paid for. I mean, I already suspect it is via the federal reserve (which controls the U.S Monetary policy and is owned not by Americans or our government, but by international bankers) and I personally think the US is more like a big corporation that the international bankers are using to make as much money as possible before they just let us go and destroy ourselves.</p>

<p>This is the primary reason I hold onto some hope for Trump. If hes sincere, he knows all this and is actually doing a lot to correct the imbalances in our government that pay these fraudster bankers every day and defraud the American People. If hes not, he is just buying them another decade or so to collect and collect before they have to let their long term investment go.</p>

<p>Think about it: of all the world leaders he’s finally met, which ones make him the most wet? The only two with confirmed kills credited to their names. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton email account was probably a leak. Also, she was using her private server illegally and insecurely (along with many other bureaucrats) to share classified info with (????) while taking bribes in the form of Foundation donations. So whoever leaked it / hacked it (probably both since it was so insecure) simply released accurate records of her emails, much of which she illegally deleted before providing the rest to the FBI. SO there&#39;s that.<br/>
&#39;fake news&#39; on facebook? What would you call corporate media lies that started the iraq war? Who&#39;s (whose) fake news?<br/>
Trump is a threat to the status quo because he&#39;s unpredictable and holds some strong opinions about the trade imbalance with China, and disagrees with Middle Eastern foreign policy.<br/>
Are you aware that in the 50s, those with opinions different than the status quo were labelled &#39;Reds&#39; or &#39;Communist&#39; Russians? Turns out the American Imperialists just needed a boogey man to keep American society under their control. Do you see a pattern at all?</p>

<p>What was the alternative? Clinton who would be owned by the same people that own trump?</p>

<p>People that constantly post political shitposts here are the worst conspiracy theorists there are.  If you think we get to have any say in who rules us, you are not a conspiracy theorist.  If you think there is a significant difference between the two parties, you are not a conspiracy theorist.  Youre just a useful idiot.</p>
