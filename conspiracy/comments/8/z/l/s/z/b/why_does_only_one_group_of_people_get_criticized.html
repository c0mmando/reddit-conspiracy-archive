        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All cultures have prejudice and many non-white cultures have contributed to slavery all over the world. Most of them have been involved in ideological driven warfare.</p>

<p>Why is it that only one group of people is generally blamed for it?</p>

<p>Africans are prejudice toward each other, light skin vs dark skin arguments are prevalent throughout much of society, many cultures are prejudice against albinos, and in South Africa for example there is currently an extreme prejudice against Caucasians among certain political groups (or North America for that matter).</p>

<p>The idea that &quot;white people&quot; in America are inherently more racist than those who immigrate from places with just as much culturally accepted prejudice makes no sense.</p>

<p>&quot;White people&quot; is a generalization. They aren&#39;t a homogeneous entity and from area to area think nothing alike and share very little culture.</p>

<p>The Caucasian Jews of Israel think nothing like Russians who think nothing like those from Iceland who think nothing like those from Ireland who think nothing like those from Southern America.</p>

<p>Claiming &quot;white people are racist&quot; (a bigoted generalization) is not an acceptable reason to share your hatred and prejudice against them all over the internet.</p>

<p>This is racism (a small sample of online discourse over a 10 minute timeframe):</p>

<p>Just look at Hillary or Trump. They were fighting over the 50% that vote, 25% each. Either way 75% of people get fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold on a sec. Racism is a universal problem. There are assholes everywhere just like there are good people everywhere. The same minority&#39;s that make the most noise in the US only have a political voice because a predominantly white populace voted to give them one. White people freed the slaves and gave women the right to vote. I know the counterpoint is that it was withheld from these groups beforehand but it was the same state of play for many countries mired in a patriarchal system. The point is that the dominant group had a moral compass. Even if it&#39;s a result of Christian morality the point is that they showed empathy and compassion and changed their ways. Even though it diminished their power as the dominant class on the long run. White men are not the devil. We&#39;ve fucked up. Repeatedly. Name a rave that hasn&#39;t. Identity politics is absolutely bullshit. You can&#39;t legislate for assholes. 
And of course there&#39;s institutional racism in the US. But let&#39;s not pretend that drug dealing and gang banging isn&#39;t an institution in and of itself. It takes an exceptional negro to look at the quick and easy material rewards their gang banging counterparts real and not be swayed to do the same. Who wants to hit the books when you could be doing drugs and getting your sick sucked? I know which one id rather :P 
There was a time when racism was widespread in the US and blacks could have considered themselves genuinely oppressed. As time goes on, while there are still racist assholes, the matter of their legitimate oppression by whites is diminishing. At a certain point the black community needs to unshackle themselves from an unhealthy victim mentality which seems to prevail today. They&#39;re largely hurting themselves and landing themselves in jail in the process. Let&#39;s not pretend that even though there might be double the blacks in jail in the US than whites that they are all innocent or instances of jailing merely because of skin colour. I&#39;d wager if you interviewed each individual prisoner they&#39;d concede they were young and dumb and fucked up. Racism is a thing everywhere and institutional crime is more prevalent in areas where there are a high concentration of blacks living. It&#39;s up to them to break the cycle at this stage. Unfortunately it&#39;s a self-fulfilling and self-perpetuating prophecy at this stage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And there&#39;s your racism. You&#39;re willing to pretend that all imprisoned people belong in jail, attribute abolition to white people, deny racial profiling in crime enforcement and the workforce, and ignore ongoing racial conflict. </p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;ll concede racism knows no borders. No, I won&#39;t deny that anyone can be an abolitionist. But I also won&#39;t pretend that racism was (and in many ways still is) a de facto policy of the United States. And I won&#39;t ignore the inherited ramifications of such oppression in the United States. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t ignore that it happens in other countries. But I&#39;m not gonna resign myself in defeat that it&#39;s an unbreakable cycle.

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Not a racist but you go ahead and label everyone if it makes you happy. I don&#39;t pretend that but its equally true for white prisoners as it is for any other race. Yes white people abolished slavery. The slaves didn&#39;t imprison themselves but they didn&#39;t free themselves either. It doesn&#39;t make it okay but it shows a moral conscience developing. By the way, in modern slavery white women are the most coveted slaves along with children. I don&#39;t deny racial profiling at all but there&#39;s a reason they do it and it involves prior indiscretions. Just like a semetic looking person probably gets pulled for security checks more often in a pot-9/11 world. 
Nobody is saying its a policy of the US. Its a natural facet of human beings. A black baby in a mixed race room will look at black faces over the white ones. It discriminates in a sense. This is an extremely benign form of racism but its racism nonetheless minus all the hateful connotations. It happens all over. Its an inherent property of humans. Of course the media, as the propaganda arm of the elite, using divide and conquer tactics to cause division across racial lines but the same is true for religious, political and socio-economic lines. But we&#39;re not all the same. All men are not created equal. There are differences among the races. Difference is not necessarily a bad thing. Pretending we&#39;re all equal cuckery is bullshit. Very nice of you to group me with a group you view as despicable (racists) thus creating a division between yourself and I and then end your post with proselytizing bullshit about being together. Wankstain. </p>

<li>You&#39;re an uneducated fuck. Black state sanctioned slavery was abolished. Of course it still exists on the underground just like it existed before abolition. It may be cheap but it&#39;s not free is it? Money in exchange for goods/services. Welcome to capitalism. If you have an actual working alternative that wouldn&#39;t result in mere anarchy being loosed upon the world free to fly it by the UN. </li>
<li>You&#39;re a messenger of nothing. I called you Kanye because it sounded like you were parroting something he said recently. You&#39;re point here is garbled nonsense. Wage slavery, as you see it, is just the fucking system we live in. Think about it. If there were no incentive to work (money) how much work would get done? Apart from a few outstanding motherfuckers who produce something of worth it would be extremely difficult to get most people to do anything productive. Don&#39;t believe me? Ever been in a welfare line? It&#39;s a long fucking line. A lot of those people are able bodied. The will to work isn&#39;t there. Do you have an alternative means to incentivise production? Just keep shot posting and screeching on the internet about how it&#39;s a fucked system just be aware that the platform you&#39;re screeching on wouldn&#39;t even exist without capitalism. Is it a perfect system? Fuck no. Is it the best we&#39;ve got? Fuck yeah it is. </li>
<li>I&#39;m not your fucking dictionary. If you want a definition ask google but here&#39;s an approximation. Fringe topics. </li>
<li>Get learNED you ignorant dunce. Don&#39;t try to hide behind Kanye like a shield or pretend he&#39;s some paragon of wisdom. He&#39;s not. Don&#39;t try to label me as someone who derides the mentally ill when I literally spend more time with people who are legitimately mentally ill then you ever have in your life. You actually belittled those people with your stupid comment about everyone being mentally ill these days. I don&#39;t care what anti-depressants you&#39;re on.

It actually violates other social justice norms such as not stereotyping or essentializing people by race, gender, etc. Swedish people are not the same culture as Greek. Not everyones family comes from one of the main colonizer groups. Not everyone‚Äôs family was even in the US during slavery, etc. Yes there is much more to the institutionalized racism argument, I know, but people also stop throwing around their own hateful, stereotyping, monolithic statements about white people. It does nothing for justice nor understanding.</p>
