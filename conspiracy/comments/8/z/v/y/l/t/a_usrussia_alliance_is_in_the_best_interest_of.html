<p>I want to propose that a US-Russia Alliance is in the best interest of the entire World - completely separate from the domestic profile of the current president and administration. In other words, <strong>any president of any party would have considered such a move</strong> at the time of their choosing.</p>

<p>You will want to bring Trump into this discussion. Try not to.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the short list of my reasonings:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Europeans are ready and able to fend for themselves - NATO is obsolete.</li>
<li>The real geopolitical threat to the West in the coming decades is clearly China, not Russia.</li>
<li>A Russian alliance enables a Middle East settlement that will endure.</li>
<li>Further political reform in Russia will be greatly accelerated by a US Alliance.</li>

<p>Ridiculous.  EU nations allows US bases all over their territory, which gives the US an unparalleled ability to conduct military and intelligence missions.  We work closely with and share intelligence with these nations because of our deep alliances.  If we weaken those relationships, we lose that network.</p>

<p>Germany et al spending a couple billion dollars more or less on their military does not determine their worth to the US as an ally, it determines their worth to defense contractors looking to make more sales.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking policy, I&#39;m talking politics.  Putin uses the US as a bogeyman to deflect criticism of his administration.  The more he criticizes the US the more popular he becomes.  His power comes from our poor relations.</p>

<p>This is precisely my point. We have bases there, not vice versa. They operate as our minions not our equals. That is what remains ridiculous when they... </p>

<p>Yes, this is how the game is played.  We stopped hating the Russians for a bit there in the 2000s when we shifted our hate to the Arabs, but that&#39;s seem to run its course so it&#39;s back to the Russians.</p>

<p>Note in my original post that I do not think this is any reason why we shouldn&#39;t ally with Russia, just why it won&#39;t happen.  It keeps the MIC running and it keeps Russian oligarchs in power.</p>

<p>Million times times (maybe I should tweet this phrase, repeated ad infinitum, with clap emojis between each word...). The Russia boogeyman enacted to put the lid on the DNC&#39;s corruption and Hillary&#39;s clusterfuck of a campaign is a great distraction for the public to rage on and rend garments over <em>foreign intervention</em> while no one cares that China keeps colonizing Africa and Latin America, keeps expanding their borders with artificial islands, keep pirating technology from wherever they can, and are establishing a dystopic surveillance-based techno-dictatorship that will become the envy of despots worldwide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really cute, but completely unfeasible. I dont know if you just woke up from a cave or something, but these two counties have not had great relations in modern times.Here are a couple thoughts..</p>

<ul>
<li>The Europeans are ready and able to fend for themselves - NATO is obsolete.</li>
</ul>

<p>NATO is not only a military alliance but also an alliance of ideals. Rich western oligarchs in France are not that different from their US counterparts. Suggesting the US leave NATO for a closer alliance with Russia spits in the face of our closest allies. We are talking about historical relationships that are mutually beneficial for both parties, especially since the US and Western Europe basically control the world. Prob not gonna happen.</p>

<ul>
<li>The real geopolitical threat to the West in the coming decades is clearly China, not Russia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Russia seems to have more to gain by siding with the Chinese then they do with the US. The two superpowers touch each other physically which presents lucrative trading opportunities. Coupled with the fact that Russia is at odds with with the Western political establishment, its safer for Russia to cooperate with China against a common enemy... NEWS FLASH.. its us.</p>

<ul>
<li>A Russian alliance enables a Middle East settlement that will endure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Middle East was carved up by its colonial masters 100 years ago and the competition for control of this region is literally Russia vs the US. </p>

<p>A brief look at the alliances surrounding Assad in Syria should make it abundantly clear that the US and Russia are at odds in the Middle East. This bullet point is probably the stupidest thing I have ever seen.</p>

<ul>
<li>Further political reform in Russia will be greatly accelerated by a US Alliance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Putin has taken his country from chaos to order in a relatively small amount of time. The Russian economy has tripled in size since he took over and the people love him. He is not leaving and I think his people would support him before an alliance with the USA. </p>

<p>In that way you say to a friend &quot;You don&#39;t need me any more bro - you can walk on your own two feet&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>safer for Russia to cooperate with China</p>

<p>That long, long border - safe... you really think that would be safe? Why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>abundantly clear that the US and Russia are at odds in the Middle East</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. If US and Russia were not at odds, then the path to peace would become much clearer.</p>

<p>Right. If he says the US is suddenly on their side, they will go right along. Expect a lot more trouble on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what bothers me most about the &quot;Russia should be our ally&quot; narrative?  I&#39;m old enough to remember the Republicans insisting we &quot;spread democracy&quot; throughout the world.  I&#39;m old enough to remember how important people have &quot;freedom&quot; - so much so we literally went to war over it.</p>

<p>Yet all of a sudden, Americans are supposed to get on board with being friends with a malevolent Russian dictator?  Who kills members of the press for criticizing him and any/all enemies who stand in his way?  Who keeps his thumb on people and is certainly not a fan of &quot;freedom&quot;?</p>

<p>Nah man - I&#39;m not getting on board with that guy.  Ever.</p>

<p>AND - it doesn&#39;t have to mean war.  We&#39;ve been perfectly fine being civil enemies for the last 20 years - no need for that to change now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your &quot;conservatism of hate&quot;. But consider this: We fought the King of England and everything he stood for from 1776 to 1815, then we made peace and then we made allies. More recently we fought the Germans and Japanese and their entire world view for years before and during WWII, but then we made them allies. Why this special case of Russia? Why not make them allies too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Russia is still being Russian.  Dictator Putin is still killing his enemies, still killing members of the press, still cheating, lying and manipulating every chance he gets.  Hell, you don&#39;t think he&#39;s behind all the troll farms meant to sow discord around the world?  Becoming allies with Putin makes us dirty and complicit.</p>
