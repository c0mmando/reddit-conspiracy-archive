Considering how the entire country was lied into war, why should we be trusting US Intelligence now?
Sure, you could blame the most recent Iraq War all on the Bush Administration, but it took a team to sell it.
There are good and honest people within each organization, but are they being listened to?</p>

<p>The FBI has had its very questionable actions and statements.

<p>These are only a few examples of what a few people within an organization can do to manipulate the narrative. It could be the culture of these bureaucracies that allows this type of behavior, that&#39;s up for debate.</p>

<p>Remember, during the first stages of the Iraq war, if you disagreed with the “official” narrative, you were called unpatriotic and unamerican.  My, how the tables have turned.</p>

<p>So why are people jumping on board with trusting the Intelligence Agencies now? Could be brainwashing, could be tribalism (team sports politics). The examples above should give pause to the people on that &quot;Russian Collusion&quot; wave. It&#39;s not to say all the Russian info is incorrect or that Russian didn&#39;t do anything during the US election. It could all be true. But we should all be asking &quot;Why is this intelligence true given these past actions and statements from our Intelligence Agencies?&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not repeat the bad aspects of history.</p>

<p>In this case, by &quot;America&quot;, I feel that you mean the unelected entity that profits from war and international conflict. The USA is the largest exporter of weapons in the world, and we should not forget that this &quot;sworn enemy&quot; stuff is a product of cold war thinking, the type of thinking that led to the over-inflated military budgets and geo-political clusterfucks we grapple with today.</p>

<p>Perhaps you personally think that that the cold war was productive and necessary,  but I think its important to point out that the arms dealers that run this country benefit greatly from the &quot;us against them&quot; mentality that you present. </p>

<p>I agree with you that Putin is not a good leader by western standards, but do you trust US intelligence agencies to provide you with the truth?</p>

<p>No one&#39;s asking you to trust the US intelligence who have toppled over 80+ foreign governments (which of course, you don&#39;t care about, such as the CIA providing the Indonesian government with a kill list of 5000 civilians). You don&#39;t have to choose. You just need to trust yourself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a controversial opinion, my opinion is that you are stupid. Putin hasn&#39;t toppled any foreign government has he? You would rather trust the international police, the WMD, the dictatorship supporter, the 80+ government toppling intelligence network. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did NRA spend 55 million of Russian money on Trump, 45 more than they did on Romney (none of which was Russian)?</p>

<p>Why did donald tell the Russians who the Israeli spy in Syria was? Why did he tell the Russians what the target in Syria was, before the counter-attack? Why did he not complain when Russian “mercenaries “ attacked US special forces?</p>

<p>Mueller has never made a single complaint about donald. He was appointed by a Republican AG, is a lifelong Republican, and volunteered for Vietnam as a Marine. He has dedicated his life to the US. The only people disparaging him are donald’s “followers” who had never heard of Mueller before donald cried about him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t have to be answered with propaganda from the repubs or propaganda from the democrats.    Both are lying.    Let&#39;s focus on the known evidence with some historical perspective of reality.</p>

<p>War mongers are trying to corner us into a new cold war to justify military budgets.</p>

<p>The degree of election interference is dubious.    The content of the hacks tells us it was information that US citizens did indeed need to be aware of that was being concealed.    The information was also first released to yet an additional country,   probably China.    Also the information was likely hacked locally,  by memory stick,  not by internet access.   The information probably also did not affect the outcome of the election vote.    And there were other illegal or unethical or dubious elements of the election that have not been addressed,  remedied,  etc.   Russia&#39;s meddling is different than Israeli or Saudi or German because of what?    Who decides that Russia is more of an enemy than the others?    Because of US policy in Nato expansion,  or US policy in Syria?    US policy in Ukraine and Syria was dead wrong,   Russia did what any country who wanted to preserve its self interest would have done.    We should focus on world peace and not fabricating an enemy for the convenience of the deep state military industrial complex who misses the cold war and whose excuses for war in the middle east have been exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all the claims on both sides are more complicated than that, and both sides may in fact be correct.</p>

<p>It is highly likely that the Russians hacked the DNC.  Along with China, Iran, Israel, and a number of private parties.  Their security was atrocious, they were wide open, and the value of information to be gained was extremely high.  You&#39;d be an idiot to think the Russians <em>didn&#39;t</em> hack the DNC.</p>

<p>Oh and also the GOP.  Don&#39;t think state actors weren&#39;t all over the GOP as well.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s a stretch to claim it was the Russians who leaked the info to WikiLeaks.  A lot of hands were in the pot.  State entities tend to like to keep things secret to use as blackmail.  It is far more likely that Russia was monitoring and gathering blackmail intelligence.</p>

<p>Somebody leaked it, but it probably wasn&#39;t the Russians.</p>

<p>Now, the twist in all this is that the leak SHOULD have won Hillary the presidency.  Instead, it cost her the presidency.  If she had run an honest campaign then America would have gladly elected our first female president.  But instead, we saw that she was every bit the corrupt, cheating, backstabbing corporate whore we feared, so we elected someone else.</p>

<p>Awkwardly, that turned out to be Donald Trump.  Thanks, DNC, for having too many fucking skeletons in the closet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are being told that the Russians &quot;hacked our elections&quot;; we are being told by prominent politicians and leaders that this is &quot;an act of war,&quot; that we must &quot;respond,&quot; and that this (alleged) Russian intervention justifies actions including sanctions, an increased military budget, and (potentially) removal of the current sitting president. These accusations have elevated global tensions enormously, to the point where conflict doesn&#39;t seem unfathomable.</p>

<p>Given the stakes, yes, the American people deserve to see irrefutable proof of these allegations. If American blood and treasure will potentially be expended because of it, then we deserve to see the reasoning for it. Too often in American history, money has been spent and lives has been lost due to lies (Vietnam War, Iraq War, etc.), so it&#39;s foolish to say &quot;well, the intelligence community says it, therefore it must be true.&quot;</p>

<p>Trusting the intelligence community with no evidence is just as bad as trusting Trump or Putin without evidence. All three have been shown repeatedly to be liars.</p>

<p>Also, the only reason I picked one lie to focus on is for two reasons: this is the most recent, and it&#39;s a glaringly obvious fucking lie that even 70 IQ retards could pick up on.  Also, I&#39;m not going to waste my time researching something for said retard, if they&#39;re going to dismiss it with... retarded logic.</p>

<p>Many Americans have become accustomed to President Trump’s lies. But as regular as they have become, the country should not allow itself to become numb to them. So we have catalogued nearly every outright lie he has told publicly since taking the oath of office. Updated: The president is still lying, so we&#39;ve added to this list, taking it through Nov. 11, and provided links to the facts in each case.</p>

full list- <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html</a></p>

<p>here&#39;s just the first two months he was in office</p>

<p>Jan. 21 “I wasn&#39;t a fan of Iraq. I didn&#39;t want to go into Iraq.” (He was for an invasion before he was against it.)  Jan. 21 “A reporter for Time magazine — and I have been on their cover 14 or 15 times. I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time magazine.” (Trump was on the cover 11 times and Nixon appeared 55 times.)  Jan. 23 “Between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes caused me to lose the popular vote.” (There&#39;s no evidence of illegal voting.)  Jan. 25 “Now, the audience was the biggest ever. But this crowd was massive. Look how far back it goes. This crowd was massive.” (Official aerial photos show Obama&#39;s 2009 inauguration was much more heavily attended.)  Jan. 25 “Take a look at the Pew reports (which show voter fraud.)” (The report never mentioned voter fraud.)  Jan. 25 “You had millions of people that now aren&#39;t insured anymore.” (The real number is less than 1 million, according to the Urban Institute.)  Jan. 25 “So, look, when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech. You can&#39;t have that.” (There were no gun homicide victims in Chicago that day.)  Jan. 26 “We&#39;ve taken in tens of thousands of people. We know nothing about them. They can say they vet them. They didn&#39;t vet them. They have no papers. How can you vet somebody when you don&#39;t know anything about them and you have no papers? How do you vet them? You can&#39;t.” (Vetting lasts up to two years.)  Jan. 26 “I cut off hundreds of millions of dollars off one particular plane, hundreds of millions of dollars in a short period of time. It wasn&#39;t like I spent, like, weeks, hours, less than hours, and many, many hundreds of millions of dollars. And the plane&#39;s going to be better.” (Most of the cuts were already planned.)  Jan. 28 “The coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost has been so false and angry that the Times actually apologized to its dwindling subscribers and readers.” (It never apologized.)  Jan. 29 “The Cuban-Americans, I got 84 percent of that vote.” (There is no support for this.)  Jan. 30 “Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage.” (At least 746 people were detained and processed, and the Delta outage happened two days later.)  Feb. 3 “Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” (There is no evidence of paid protesters.)  Feb. 4 “After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!” (It never apologized.)  Feb. 5 “We had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully.” (About 60,000 people were affected.)  Feb. 6 “I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35.” (Much of the price drop was projected before Trump took office.)  Feb. 6 “It&#39;s gotten to a point where it is not even being reported. And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn&#39;t want to report it.” (Terrorism has been reported on, often in detail.)  Feb. 6 “The failing @nytimes was forced to apologize to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!” (It didn&#39;t apologize.)  Feb. 6 “And the previous administration allowed it to happen because we shouldn&#39;t have been in Iraq, but we shouldn&#39;t have gotten out the way we got out. It created a vacuum, ISIS was formed.” (The group’s origins date to 2004.)  Feb. 7 “And yet the murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years, right? Did you know that? Forty-seven years.” (It was higher in the 1980s and &#39;90s.)  Feb. 7 “I saved more than $600 million. I got involved in negotiation on a fighter jet, the F-35.” (The Defense Department projected this price drop before Trump took office.)  Feb. 9 “Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave ‘service’ in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!” (It was part of Cuomo&#39;s first question.)  Feb. 9 “Sen. Richard Blumenthal now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?” (The Gorsuch comments were later corroborated.)  Feb. 10 “I don’t know about it. I haven’t seen it. What report is that?” (Trump knew about Flynn&#39;s actions for weeks.)  Feb. 12 “Just leaving Florida. Big crowds of enthusiastic supporters lining the road that the FAKE NEWS media refuses to mention. Very dishonest!” (The media did cover it.)  Feb. 16 “We got 306 because people came out and voted like they&#39;ve never seen before so that&#39;s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.” (George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all won bigger margins in the Electoral College.)  Feb. 16 “That’s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.” (Delta&#39;s problems happened two days later.)  Feb. 16 “Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.” (The jobs are a result of its investment plans announced in Oct. 2016.)  Feb. 16 “When WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information.” (Not always. They have released classified information in the past.)  Feb. 16 “We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision.” (The rollout was chaotic.)  Feb. 16 “They’re giving stuff — what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates. Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.” (It was widely covered.)  Feb. 18 “And there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing.” (Refugees receive multiple background checks, taking up to two years.)  Feb. 18 “You look at what&#39;s happening in Germany, you look at what&#39;s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” (Trump implied there was a terror attack in Sweden, but there was no such attack.)  Feb. 24 “By the way, you folks are in here — this place is packed, there are lines that go back six blocks.” (There was no evidence of long lines.)  Feb. 24 “ICE came and endorsed me.” (Only its union did.)  Feb. 24 “Obamacare covers very few people — and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them — it was taken away from them.” (Obamacare increased coverage by a net of about 20 million.)  Feb. 27 “Since Obamacare went into effect, nearly half of the insurers are stopped and have stopped from participating in the Obamacare exchanges.” (Many fewer pulled out.)  Feb. 27 “On one plane, on a small order of one plane, I saved $725 million. And I would say I devoted about, if I added it up, all those calls, probably about an hour. So I think that might be my highest and best use.” (Much of the price cut was already projected.)  Feb. 28 “And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.” (NATO countries agreed to meet defense spending requirements in 2014.)  Feb. 28 “The E.P.A.’s regulators were putting people out of jobs by the hundreds of thousands.” (There&#39;s no evidence that the Waters of the United States rule caused severe job losses.)  Feb. 28 “We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials.” (They can&#39;t lobby their former agency but can still become lobbyists.)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He mixed up a detail. Every time he gets something like this wrong, he very clearly indicates that he isn&#39;t sure. Go back and look up the quote. He says something like &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I guess&quot;. What he heard was that it was the first time she had inspected her guard <em>with a visiting head of state</em> in 70 years. Oh boo fucking hoo. I wish he wouldn&#39;t make sloppy off-the-cuff remarks like that, but it&#39;s a far cry from being a liar.

    <div class="md"><p>You might have a point except that this happens on a daily basis. He often qualifies them by saying &quot;someone told him&quot; or &quot;I heard&quot; or &quot;I think&quot; as to have an excuse (like you&#39;re making now) when called out on it. His staff is either severely misinforming him to stroke his ego or he&#39;s lying (or a mix of both). If you want an even more ovious example just look at his inauguration crowd lie. It&#39;s such a unnecessary and blatantly wrong lie but he goes with it anyway. Like, noone cares that your crowd was smaller than obama&#39;s, but Trump just can&#39;t help himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, now <em>you</em> mixed up a detail. I didn&#39;t say that Trump said &quot;with a visiting head of state&quot;. That&#39;s the detail he mixed up, because many sources <em>did in fact</em> report that it was the first time she had reviewed her guard <em>with a visiting head of state</em> in 70 years. Trump referred to these headlines and sloppily left out the &quot;with a visiting head of state&quot; part, at which point you can very clearly hear the uncertainty in his voice because he knows he may be mistaking a detail.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>95% or more of the examples on those websites are total garbage, either stretching the definition of a lie or not even a lie at all. Disagreement over principles or ideas does not constitute a lie. Mistaking some details in an off-the-cuff comment is not a lie. When you whittle away all the bullshit, you&#39;re left with shockingly little substance. I unironically believe his administration is the most honest I have seen in my life. Watching the level of effort people take to attack his character is only making me support him more. People lie about him at least 10,000 times more often than actually tells a lie. They just repeat the claims over and over until people get tired of arguing over it. It&#39;s gaslighting to the extreme.</p>

Tptb think they can demoralize us w/their large and loud shill army on social media but it only makes us open our eyes wider to be more incredulous of their baseless claims and motivates us to go to the source directly by reading and watching Trump’s actual words, which makes us support Trump even more. </p>

<p>I just want to give a shout out to all the shills here and everywhere else on SM: you are doing such good work, opening normies eyes w/your repeating and pushing tptb’s hate-filled baseless attacks of Trump! Thank you!! 😘😘😘</p>

None of their defenders have offered any explanation other than some nebulous &quot;Deep State&quot; conspiracy. What was the motivation? As I pointed out to you in the 2010 article, Republicans, Russians and Julian Assange have all publicly gone on record with their reasons for doing exactly what we all saw happen. It&#39;s simply much more plausible that the people who benefited most from the hacking were the ones who actually did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is implicating the IC in general - not just one agency. FBI (headed by Mueller at the time) had a lead role in selling the war, but CIA clearly had a hand in paving the way for hi-jackers to enter our country. Even if you don&#39;t think 9/11 was an inside job, CIA officers fast tracked 15 visas to Saudis that would have been denied under ordinary circumstances. I don&#39;t think any of us are naive enough to think that ALL members of the IC are complicit - it only takes a few rotten potatoes to spoil the batch and they are very very adept at compartmentalization of information.

<blockquote>
<p>See Manhattan Project to understand just how good they are at keeping secrets</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the second time in as many weeks someone here has tried to say that exact thing. Weird that the same claim is made by multiple accounts, almost word for word.</p>

<p><em>Anyway</em>
As I said to the last person, there were tons of leaks. A reporter even found (and wrote an entire article) exposing Los Alamos, when it was a &#39;secret city&#39; - including how to get there, what security there is, which buses go in and out - tons of information. This wasn&#39;t the only leak - there were tons.</p>

<p>The reason the overall Manhattan project didn&#39;t leak has less to do with compartmentalization and more to do with working on something that no one knew existed or even could. The nuclear bomb was an impossible idea to most until it happened. It was too ridiculous and dismissed. </p>

<p>If someone told you that your neighbor had a working UFO in their garage, you wouldn&#39;t immediately run to the news - you would probably laugh... <em>even if he did have one</em></p>

<p>Compartmentalization only works on a small scale - the more compartments there are, the higher chance they will cross. If and when they do, pieces go together and the secret is out. </p>

<p>I have referenced the Manhattan project a number of times because it&#39;s a great example of compartmentalization well before the information age. There may have been stories, but NOBODY expected them to deliver a weapon on that level. To suggest compartmentalization only works on a small scale is ridiculous - look at SR-71, U2, hell - almost any planes. Look at the space programs... we very likely have ghost satellites floating around whose sole purpose is to attack other satellites - can you imagine how many people had to work on that.</p>

<p>To suggest compartmentalization isn&#39;t a thing is ludicrous - there are a number of books on the topic.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that. It only works if there is no possible contamination from other compartments - which only happens if the compartments have no contact. People in Stagg Field had no contact with the people in Los Alamos. the &#39;compartment&#39; were small and far from each other. A paper in <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/09/20/worst-manhattan-project-leaks/">Cleveland</a> leaking a ton of information wouldn&#39;t be read by the people working on-site in Chicago. </p>

<p>Wait, you&#39;re not accusing me of shilling but perhaps of having access to some databank of talking points? What would that make me? I&#39;m in here trying to have rational discussions - not proposing wildly insane ideas or doing much else to indicate shillhood. You said you didn&#39;t want to slide the original topic (about CIA involvement), but it is now effectively slid...</p>

<p>Anyway, Manhattan Project is simply the most well-known example of successful info compartmentalization and it&#39;s used frequently in r/conspiracy as a means to push back against the frequent notion that &quot;But nobody could keep a secret like that!!&quot; I think you&#39;re a regular here, so you must have seen these discussions before but in a non-political right vs. left context.</p>

<p>Sure, but still hundreds or thousands - systems of this complexity were impossible to achieve with small teams.</p>

<p>Of course leaks happen all the time and it&#39;s perhaps more difficult to track and stifle these days, but the gov&#39;t uses principles of compartmentalization extensively. Like I said, there are entire books on the topic. It&#39;s not as simple as &quot;hey don&#39;t tell the other guys.&quot; Here&#39;s some info: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information</a></p>

<p>Not at all. Sometimes information gets repeated in places that becomes something people will subconsciously recall and bring up in conversation. It&#39;s a type of subliminal advertising marketers do. You can market an idea like that and put it casually into news items and people will start bringing it up. It can turn people into walking advertisements without them even knowing about it.</p>

<p>The difference between that and what US intelligence is currently doing, is that information is never put out in the public to be refuted. A lot of people / compartments have touched the information in the &#39;Russia investigation&#39;. At any of those steps, if the data was wrong, one of those compartments would potentially leak. If someone had evidence to prove the reports were wrong and got it to Trump, he would have a pardon ready before the leak even hit the news. It would completely vindicate him. </p>

<p>OK, but you and I were talking about CIA involvement in the lead up to the Iraq War, not the Russian investigation. That is no doubt a complete shit show. I don&#39;t really have a firm grip on the veracity of Russia&#39;s involvement, but I&#39;m inclined to ignore findings from the FBI until we see hard evidence. However, I&#39;ll keep an open mind - it&#39;s just that IC has lied to us so many times before.</p>

<p>I think 9/11 was very different in that the perpetrators were intelligence agents (likely contract agents) and the colloborators were mainly military, all of whom were well versed in the requirements of their chosen field, such as op-sec and the need to keep secrets, and not to ask questions which you did not need answers to in order to carry out your orders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, minus the whole ‘dessert Muslim tribes’ already bombing the building once almost a decade earlier.</p>

<p>I’m not a huge fan of the 9/11 conspiracies. I think there was a coverup, but it was over the government having information it was going to happen and ... let it. Failing on something like that would have led to a mass loss of faith in the US globally.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really understand the question to be honest. We have Don Jr.&#39;s emails regarding the Trump Tower meeting.

<p>To be clear, I have no doubt that DT and others in his corrupt cabinet have engaged in all manner of illegal activity.

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to Russian election meddling, i dont believe intelligence agencies one bit. No one should. We should all honestly just trust the Trump administration on this one.</p>

<p>I trust Donald Trump Jr. when he told us he tried to collude with Russia to get stolen emails. I trust Mike Flynn when he admitted to holding secret meeting with the Russians and then lying about it. I believe Donald Trump when he told me he fired James Comey to take the heat off the Russia investigation.</p>

<p>Everyone else should do the same. Eff the intelligence agencies, just trust what Trump&#39;s team is telling us directly.</p>

<p>Trump brought reality TV to reality.  It&#39;s the greatest show on Earth with a new season every month.</p>

<p>I guarantee you 100% that the other side feels <em>exactly the same as you</em> and has all the evidence and facts to back it up.  Plus the same overwhelming moral superiority to ensure that the right side must win.</p>

<p>How can I guarantee this?  Because I am the other side.  Trust me, the narrative is seamless so long as you don&#39;t look too closely.  Both narratives.</p>

<p>You need to listen to Fox or Alex Jones long enough to find something you agree with.  Then you will have started to actually broaden your horizons.</p>

<p>Or RT.  Or Al-Jazeera.  If all you see is lies, you are blinded by your chosen narratives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/anthrax-files/">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/anthrax-files/</a></p>

<p>Check this PBS doc about how Mueller used the FBI to bully two innocent men, one of which committed suicide. By the way, Mueller was one of the defendants named in a suit in 2015 for withholding exculpatory evidence that would have 1) embarrassed and disgraced the FBI and 2) would have proved Ivins&#39; innocence.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that at the very least there is money laundering/tax fraud in the tens or even hundreds of millions going on with some of Trump&#39;s people. But I also have no doubt that no one, whether it&#39;s Trump or the FBI, should be trusted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what I want to know is why every single fucking person on CNN right now screaming for World War 3 is either in the CIA or was at one point in the CIA. Anderson Coooer&#39;s monologues are getting increasingly melodramatic. And now you have Comey just straight up telling people to vote Democrat? Not independent, not a plea for voters to reconsider voting Republican. No, there is no attempt to now to hide their bias now. </p>

<p>Like what the fuck, people. Just a few months ago we were all clamoring on the about how the CIA and FBI were literally working together to spy on Trump and his campaign. The Obama administration knew what they were doing when they expanded the intelligence community and started unmasking US citizens.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1fWNZDvOgR4">https://youtu.be/1fWNZDvOgR4</a></p>

<p>And now everyone&#39;s acting surprised when Trump expresses some skepticism against the US intelligence community???? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with the intelligence agencies along with other big agencies is that they are self perpetuating. Those with a job in them want job security, not national security. This is why there are many cover ups and political bias. In the end it&#39;s all about a job and money.</p>

<p>Same thing happens in big companies/corporation top heavy in management. A bureaucracy or those with administrative function have their own self interest in mind. This same culture is what perpetuated the corruption that was down fall of the likes of Enron, World Com or the old Kmart with executives covering up and perpetuating crap-why because it was about their job in the end.</p>

<p>I would not trust the intelligence community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Highly doubtful because thier revenue has skyrocketed. There is a reason they keep portraying Trump, the views. Media like CNN went from being practicaly non existant to having the best numbers in over a decade. The last thing MSM wants is Trump to go away.</p>

<p>You can see this on the other side with Hillary Clinton. Look at the hits, or even reddit posts mentioning her. It&#39;s primary conservative media. During the Hillary book release, Conspiracy had one post, Bernie&#39;s sub had one post, Hillary&#39;s sub had one post. The_Donald had 13 posts, with many posts on all the right leaning subreddits.</p>

<p>These people are huge revenue generators and the media is having a viewership golden age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes hopefully. I also worry that the military is inherently incentivized to use military force to solve every issue, (when youre a hammer, etc)</p>

<p>But thats not an issue if you have a wise, principled leader who second guesses the military leaders.</p>

<p>Instead we have a guy who is throwing himself a military parade like we are in North Korea. </p>

<p>But my point still stands: If you want to know what other countries are up to, you cant rely on Fox news or breitbart or asking Putin. You need to rely on your eyes and ears in the intelligence services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

Also, I distinguish between the justice department, which I certainly believe lies and hides things, and the CIA and Dept of Defense, which by nature are covert, shrouded in secrecy, and use deception as a fundamental premise of their operations.

    <div class="md"><p>OP&#39;s post is kind-of bullshit. The IC&#39;s work for the American people to best inform the elected officials (and their appointees) on complex decisions. That&#39;s it. Iraq is a perfect example of this and how it can be manipulated. Cheney and Powell wanted a war and they had the IC lie about WMD&#39;s to manufacture one. As another user pointed out in the thread: &quot;they [IC] admitted there wasn’t enough evidence, though concluded it was likely anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>More evidence is in a book called Blowing My Cover. It&#39;s a pretty good memoir written by a CIA case officer (they recruit spies or what are actually called assets). The book ends around the time Cheney and Powell were trying to manufacture the war and the writer talks about how disillusioned some of the CIA employees were about the whole thing and even quotes a superior saying something along the lines of &quot;Washington wants a war in Iraq.&quot;</p>

<p>The CIA subverting governments and running drugs is, well, exactly what it&#39;s purpose is and it&#39;s the CIA acting on behalf of the elected officials. That is, those officials have to decide to allow the CIA to do those things (same for any IC). That&#39;s how the chain of command works in the government. For example, the CIA didn&#39;t give the go ahead on the UBL mission, the POTUS did. The CIA doesn&#39;t even have these kinds of resources in the first place. The best thing they have is SAD/SOG but that&#39;s absolutely nowhere near the virtually limitless resources of the US military.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s talk about the torture. What people need to understand is the American people were pretty okay with torture up until the middle 2000&#39;s. So yeah, the CIA tortured people. When the politics changed, so did the CIA - once again demonstrating how they work for the American people (through the elected officials).</p>

<p>The FBI is probably a little worse mainly because they work domestically (the CIA can&#39;t). This gives them a little more leeway. They also aren&#39;t only an intelligence organization (the CIA is). As for missing attacks such as 1993 and 9/11 - that sucks. But you can actually read all about how that stuff happened in the first place and it&#39;s mostly do to infighting, management mistakes, and all the hoops that need to be jumped through with agencies sharing intelligence among each other.</p>

<p>The NSA is probably the worst but you have to keep in mind that, once again, they&#39;re acting on behalf of our elected officials. That&#39;s where ALL of this begins. The IC is just a tool and the elected officials are the ones that are ultimately making the decisions. People that work in the IC don&#39;t make much money and are doing so mostly because it can be really cool and they have a deep sense of patriotism for the American people. They have little to gain from spying on the American people or allowing attacks to happen, but they might be directed to do so (legally because, once again, our elected officials) or by human error (which they are just as capable as anybody else of making).</p>

<p>And how did you refute the established fact that IC lies as a matter of business</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t. The whole point is you don&#39;t need to trust the IC to conclude their telling the truth here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well even then, you cannot deny all of the other morally bankrupt incidents that the IC has participated in throughout the years. With no hyperbole, I think a list of their human rights violations could be 6 or 7 digits long with entries. They&#39;re basically the American SS bullying dissident individuals and groups into compliance. Remember there are a whole lot of good jobs in the world; these people signed up to imprison, spy, and torture. What does that say about the moral character of these agents?</p>

<p>What if he wants to know if China is gearing up militarily? Is he going to go with his gut to know how many tanks are being produced? Is he going to watch Fox news? Is he going to ask Putin?</p>

<p>No. He needs to use his intelligence agencies, there is no other way to know.</p>
