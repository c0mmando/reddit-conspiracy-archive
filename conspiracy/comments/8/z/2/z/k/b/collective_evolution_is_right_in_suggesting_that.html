<p>Acacia would be your best bet, as the other two require massive amounts to utilize properly. But just make sure you find a list of strain specific alkaloids as some acacias have other stuff. Nicotine even. Definitely don&#39;t want to smoke or eat extracted nicotine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found it is best to look at conspiracies through multiple different perspectives. Just as the light going through a prism separates into different color spectrums so does information and understanding.  Focusing solely on the spiritual perspective will not give you the full picture IMO. And leaving out the spiritual will also not give you the full picture IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, having a spiritual underpinning is useful in understanding conspiracy theories. But, like the article said, it only gives you half the picture - by negating the inherent duality of reality. However, being spiritual is also particularly useful in understanding the religious foundations [mystery schools, hermeticism, gnosticism, and, yes, even mainstream religions] of civilization, without which one may never come to understand &quot;what is really going on&quot;. </p>

<p>The thing I find with a lot of new age spiritualism is that it is just another empty feedback loop, like mainstream religions [or politics]: just enough information to keep you lost &amp; not enough to actually save you - which is the point. Like the article said, anything negative is negated as a buzzkill, but once one digs deep enough to understand what this place actually is, one is more than entitled to be righteously indignant and royally pissed. Bliss is OK, but so is Anger (It&#39;s very strange how anger has been reclassified as a negative, forbidden emotion). As long as were here, no one is escaping the inherent dualism that is the very nature of this place. MORE people should be fighting mad.</p>

<p>The thing I find with a lot of new age spiritualism is that it is just another empty feedback loop, like mainstream religions [or politics]: just enough information to keep you lost &amp; not enough to actually save you - which is plainly the point when the inorganic of the new age movement is researched.

Bliss is fine, but so is healthy, mature Anger (It&#39;s very strange how anger has been reclassified as a negative, forbidden, BAD emotion &amp; equated with crazy rage). As long as were here, no one is escaping the inherent dualism that is the very nature of this place. MORE people should be fighting mad, at least in the back of their mind.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the comment. Dualism is the very nature of this place, but science confirms we can only perceive a fraction of the bigger picture. Spirituality is the path within, to awaken our instinct. When I quiet my mind for a while and just listen, I don&#39;t feel duality, I feel unity and oneness. </p>

<p>A solid spiritual foundation also allows us to channel our anger and transform it into a positive energy within ourselves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s an excerpt from   <strong>A Tantric Trick for Transforming Tough Emotions</strong> by DMCubic  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how many of you are familiar with Tantra as practiced in Buddhism. Lots of people have heard of the sexual aspects of Tantra, and obviously we know about the energy centers and kundalini, which are a big part of it, if we&#39;ve read a lot of this channeled material. But one of the main practical points of Buddhist Tantra is finding ways to take tough emotions like envy, pride, anger, and lust and bring them onto the path of love/wisdom by transforming them into something useful. I&#39;m not &quot;officially&quot; a tantric practitioner but I do know the gist of it so I want to share some approaches to self-transformation I don&#39;t usually hear much about outside Buddhist circles. Hopefully this helps someone.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a common Buddhist practice to envision yourself as one of the peaceful deities, and it&#39;s found in other religions and spiritual systems too. You know the drill: Imagine yourself meditating in a Merkaba, radiating divine light; imagine yourself as an angel of some sort; imagine yourself in a light body, et cetera. These meditations are all positive and helpful in my experience - but I can&#39;t always do them, which I will talk about in a bit.   </p>

<p>Now there are also images of &quot;wrathful&quot; deities in Buddhism, which are like hideous multi-headed monsters drinking blood out of human skulls, wearing garlands of severed heads, and wreathed in destructive flame. They appear in the manner of demons.    </p>

<p>Why would enlightened beings be depicted in this way? One of the reasons is to remind people that the One Mind is still the One Mind, whether it&#39;s angry and consumed by negative emotion or calm and placid. It&#39;s all divine - but if you work within the Law of One philosophy, you already know that. But these beings aren&#39;t just showing us the fundamental nonduality of clean and unclean mental states, they are giving us a clue as to how we can work with painful mind states directly as they arise to actually use those negative energies themselves for practicing the spiritual path.   </p>

<p>You&#39;re probably familiar with the situation of being really angry and feeling like it&#39;s impossible to &quot;be spiritual&quot; in that state. I definitely am. When I&#39;m in that state, I have the option of trying to get myself out of it, waiting until I&#39;m more peaceful, and then doing a spiritual practice from the basis of that peaceful state, fueling it with positive emotions which are missing while I&#39;m angry. But this requires a delay, and in my experience, instead of just waiting to calm down naturally I am tempted to actually repress my emotions so they can come back with friends another day. But in the moment I&#39;m angry, I can use that anger directly, in a constructive way, by visualizing myself as a wrathful deity.   </p>

<p>So, an example: I am angry, too angry to do a peaceful visualization. So I use that anger to fuel a wrathful visualization, which I am more capable of in that situation. Suddenly I feel myself to be in a hideous, twisted body with wicked claws and horribly angry, grimacing heads sprouting off everywhere. Their mouths are filled with fangs, they&#39;re breathing fire - and this is all very crisply and purely generated because I&#39;m not fighting my angry state. I <em>feel</em> like a demon, so it&#39;s very easy to visualize myself as one.   </p>

<p>So why is this positive? Because I&#39;m about to transform that rage. All it takes is one momentary thought of compassion to activate the hidden power in this anger. I take the single moment of compassionate intent I can find in this maelstrom and suddenly, the heads emit a piercing shriek which blasts everyone in the world to shreds! Left behind are dark, shadowy forms representing their suffering and defiled emotions. All my heads begin inhaling those forms with a massive wind and greedily devouring them in their fanged jaws, <em>my anger now being directed positively toward the causes of others&#39; misery, and not to them</em>. Then when all is clear, I make a gesture or some such demonstration that I wish for their bodies to be reassembled into a new, pure state, my anger having been worked off. They are re-made without any pain or suffering whatsoever.   </p>

<p>So if I can just find one shred of love in my angry state, that combination of pure anger energy plus that little bit of love can fuel an amazing visualization that transforms the whole situation into a source for wisdom. These visualizations, as I have experienced them, just need that one little piece of love to turn a whole terrible mind-state into something great. </p>
