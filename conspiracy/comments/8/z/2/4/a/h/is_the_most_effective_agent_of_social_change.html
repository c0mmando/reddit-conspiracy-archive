       Consider that the sum of humanity is a machine that reproduces itself.  Whatever bad state it may be in at any given time due to its behaviour can be changed eventually.  People die.  Children are born.  The machinery of humanity - the people - change.  We have this built in agent of change in our design.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the idiom "a rising tide raises all ships" is true for a society and the character of its citizenry, wouldn't the fastest way to enact social improvement be the act of good parenting?  If everyone here were to focus their energy on creating better children, instead of trying to debate left/right paradigms for example, we could just change our way out of this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, I've noticed a thing with many parents.  The baby fever.  The sense of awe and amazement of having a sweet blank slate to care for.  Surely these instincts aren't there by accident.  The kind of community that is created by caring parents is one that is very tight.  It can be built upon.  And it's weird that it's not a larger phenomenon.

       Probably whatever you make of it, on both the part of parent and child alike. I can say with certainty that my relationship with my mother led to increased free thought while my father was more authoritative and controlling. I believe noting the differences between the two was helpful in developing a healthier world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know not all are so lucky as to have a positive relationship with both parents and recognize that the Marxists may in many cases be correct in their belief regarding the oppressive nature of the family unit, but much of that "oppression" are rules like "don't touch that hot stove" and many other similar lessons that exist to protect the child from physical harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm trying to say I believe it's a little greyer than they make it sound, while I do totally understand the sentiment.

       As a non-religious homeschooler, can confirm. We're all authoritarian fundamentalist anti-vaxxers who are perpetuating ignorance. No...just wanted to make sure my kid's head was screwed on straight before he entered the State Indoctrination Machine that is the public education system.

       You have to be an amazing parent to avoid the pitfalls of modern life. Children are easier to corrupt than ever thanks to all the inlets of foreign ideas into our homes now...

       Plus, us raising good children matters fuck all if you believe in overlords, or Rothschilds and all that. As they are just going to raise their children as they have been... entitled, and born to rule, no?

       I said it has little to no bearing on improving the world because we are low down on the food chain compared to the people having kids who will influence the way the world works for decades to come... if anything posted on this sub is based in fact.

       Sorry, I took that to mean you don't see the point in raising sound kids. Didn't realize you're talking about their impact on society at large. Although I still disagree with that too, since everyone is part of their own miniature societies and cultures, therefore their childrem being raised properly will make the world better, even if it's just in their small circle.

       Agree with you there, in a microcosm it does have a positive effect on communities in general... I've seen a fair down turn in recent years of my local area and community spirit, but I see it more as us generally looking around to see what we don't have rather than what we do have.
      </p>
      <p>
       But generally speaking, on the whole, if our neighbourhoods are graffiti free but our politicians are still lying and selling us short on policies... are we going to be much better off? If those are still the role models that we have in higher society, can we expect children to live a life on the straight and narrow?

       I feel that if you actually punish your kids as in spank them and timeouts they learn to have self control and more respect for others I was spanked as a kid and I feel that helped me turn out the way I am today.

       You’re wrong! You were psychologically damaged as a kid due to the physical abuse by your parents, and are now a dysfunctional adult with a cornucopia of mental problems that manifested due to that physical abuse. Didn’t you know?????

       Not being allowed to discipline your children properly is what leads to raising a generation of a bunch of spoiled and entitled brats. Those same spoiled brats are also most likely to support ideas like socialism or communism. Almost as if it was intentional...
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone with a brain knows the difference between child abuse and discipline. While I acknowledge that the line can be pretty blurry sometimes for different people, I think throwing the baby out with the bath water was a huge mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question I ask myself is, should teachers still be allowed to discipline students? Rulers, spankings, etc.?
      </p>
      <p>
       Half of me gets pissed at the thought of a teacher hitting my child... but the other half of me believes that disruptive students are the #1 way to destroy a proper educational environment, and if my kid was acting out at school (presumably because they’re away from their parents) then I’d want that teacher to show them that there are consequences in the outside world as well, not just at home.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was only ever hit like 2 or 3 times as a kid, but the
       <em>
        threat
       </em>
       of being hit was ALWAYS there when we acted up or talked back. Kinda like how a dog only needs to get shocked a few times by its electric fence before it stops trying to run out of the yard.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole topic is a slippery slope indeed, but I think they way they are currently handling it is not the right move for the future of our society.

       Yeah my education was pretty shitty because of a couple of Rich spoiled brats that the teachers catered to and let do whatever they want, instead of punishing them. We couldn't learn because their dumbasses wouldn't be quiet and the teachers wouldnt discipline them at all.

       Havent you noticed that the people that are most critical of your parenting skills and call you such things about spanking have freaking wild banshees for children most of the time? Its like if leading by example is a real thing I am not sure if I am on board... Meanwhile the kids are climbing all over the furniture and torturing my cat because of youthful experiences and growth right?!

       The first five years of a child's life are extremely important in development. So yes, being a kind, loving and patient parent is extremely important to the development of a child. And all that carries over into the older years of a child and into adulthood.

       In keeping with the spirit of this sub I'll offer up a contrasting question.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way to bring down a society than to make seem normal behavior that will only bring pain and suffering to your offspring. Enter acting like a 'gangster', having kids with many random women to create a fatherless society, push the normalization of violence at every opportunity (movies, TV, etc), stoke the fires of racism, etc.

       I wash shocked the other day when I found out that the married parent rates for blacks in the US went from 80% in the 1960s to the &lt;30% of today. A 50% swing...how'd that happen and why? Did any other race's marriage rate swing in a like manner?
      </p>
      <p>
       When raising our kids, I felt doing the best job we could as parents was our 'calling' and the #1 priority in life. It seems mass media and the entertainment industry is pushing raising the next generation down the priority list.

       The most effective agent of social change is helping children become great adults. No need to become a parent. Tons of great kids out there who need some time and attention, who have exhausted weary parents. Volunteer to help one of those kids.

       Public compulsory school system has made good parenting impossible for vast majority of the population because state bureaucrats acting as "teachers" are more powerful than parents so when presented with opposing viewpoints the children will inevitably abide by requirements of their teachers. Children can see that it is the teacher who summons his parent to explain himself, not the other way round..
      </p>
      <p>
       You can try with homeschooling or private schools but it's obviously difficult because they force you to essentially pay twice for this privilege (you still pay taxes for "free" education)

       The short answer is, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what exactly is being a 'good' parent?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does being a good parent mean that you succumb to the grind and provide the highest quality of life, at all costs?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it mean to practice what you preach, even if at times your children go without?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it mean to resist with all your might, so that one day your children's children may know real freedom?
      </p>
      <p>
       All choices in life have consequences.  Being a good parent, isn't good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be the change you wish to see in the world, and teach your children to do the same.

       Raising children better would help. But when you work 8 to 10 hours a day, it is awfully difficult to find time / energy to influence your children more than what the school system, or various forms of media do. It can be done, you just gotta be really strong.
