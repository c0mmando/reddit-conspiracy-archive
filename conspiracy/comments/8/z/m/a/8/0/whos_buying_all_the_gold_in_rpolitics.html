        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that posts in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> that focus on whichever aspect of the narrative the media is currently pushing are often gilded multiple times. Right now most posts having to do with the Trump-Putin summit have been gilded, especially if they&#39;re highly critical opinion pieces. </p>

<p>Then you have the commenters. Try commenting and you&#39;re <em>swarmed</em> with downvotes. I get it, it&#39;s a circlejerk, but the sheer force <em>and speed</em> with which comments are downvoted seems too excessive to be organic. Then the number one comment is always a <em>call to action</em> to resist Trump in some way (also often gilded). Other highly upvoted comments are highly-researched, well-written <em>essays</em> on why the latest Trump thing is the most outrageous yet. They seem crafted, focus-grouped to appeal to the skeptical, fact-checking Reddit set. Low-effort circlejerking which would normally get the high numbers are buried in favor of posts engineered to produce a political reaction.</p>

<p>It seems too efficient, too <em>engineered</em> to be a pure act of the hivemind. It seems like something a large room full of people have meetings about and coordinate the day&#39;s strategy for, like a newsroom. Are mods and users just coordinating via a Discord channel (seems like massive unpaid effort for a relatively small effect)? Or does it go deeper -- is the whole thing bankrolled by someone with fat pockets? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. I&#39;m thinking it could be the MSM themselves, it&#39;s nothing to them to have a gold coffer of $10,000.

Gilding these links makes redditors (especially the clueless that may think those subs are impartial) think they were gilded because they contain important new information, so they click the link and visit the site.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea you&#39;re right, after looking through the gilded section, it seems my analysis was off as of lately. Scroll down a couple months back, and you&#39;ll get a better feel for what I meant. Seems like <em>they</em> got wise to the fact that nobody here was falling for it anymore, and have since stopped gilding as many posts (aka posts pushing mainstream media narratives, which can typically also be found gilded on the FP of r/news or r/politics). Looks like most of the recent gildings are of comments that people don&#39;t want to get buried by vote brigades (you can tell by the low or even negative vote totals of the gilded posts... pretty much the opposite of what you see with gilded posts on <em>any</em> other subreddit).</p>

<p>Sorry for the quick judgement. With all the &quot;activity&quot; around here today, I was already in defense mode. I try my best to not let emotions from one thread spill into another, but that&#39;s sometimes hard to do.</p>

<p>I mean, I don&#39;t particularly understand the point of Reddit gold, but I don&#39;t think you can safely say it&#39;s largely used for propaganda. It might have been co-opted for that in some cases, yes. But I&#39;m not sure it has been enough to make that a safe rule of thumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think mods/admins are giving out gold in the larger subs.  Reddit makes money when users buy &quot;gold&quot;; so it&#39;s just the a step towards commercialization.</p>

<p>I definitely agree there seems to be targeted down voting going on.  Might be Reddit&#39;s version of Mind Control (Programming) similar to youtube&#39;s which has slapped <em>Encyclopedia Brittanica</em> links to every video which degrades the official story of the JFK Assassination.</p>

<p>We the People are being <em>Programmed</em>--by our corrupt media conglomerates and by the social media platforms.  This has been taking place in stages, in small increments.  Before the e2016 election there was an article about Reddit hiring a guy, Mark (can&#39;t remember his last name), he had been employed at Twitter previously.  A couple months after he started with Reddit, r/politics began rolling out changes to their sub (no self-post Saturdays, etc.).  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know about now, but this was definitely true in the past.  I&#39;m reminded of Sam Kinison talking about his time working at a (comedy?) club.  He would be responsible for seating people when there were openings, so the next person in line would be sat while everyone else waited.  What they would do is bring some cash with them and when coming back from seating someone would hand the coworker some money and say it was their share of the tip for seating the people.  The rest of the people in line would see and hear this, intentionally, and think it was customary to tip so they would.  In a similar way, admins want users to think it&#39;s customary to spend a few bucks on gold for posts they like so they&#39;ll gild things here and there to encourage it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah guilding is just used to show how &quot;right&quot; a user is along with upvote counts. Rarely do you see guilding outside of political posts nowadays.</p>

<p>It used to be a lot more organic and guilded/upvoted posts actually pointed to good content but those mechanisms  don&#39;t work when outside sources can brigade/ selectively censor by vote manipulation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so heavy handed recently I&#39;m sure a lot of Reddit is aware. Especially here or any news sub people should sort by controversial to see the surprisingly reasonable viewpoints they don&#39;t allow.</p>

<p>Often on a Sunday night you&#39;ll see them crafting comment stacks for new submissions intended for the following days news cycle. Normally reddit conversations can often be derailed by replying to the second or third top comment. They churn out multiple levels of conversation deep to prevent this.</p>

<p>Then skim through conversation during the day responding quickly to any deviation from the intended message. Trigger alerts on certain key words.</p>

<p>Add in an AI element that displays series of potential responses to an argument found, human selects most relevant and modifies it if necessary. Modified response feedback gets kicked back to the database the team is using improving the set of prepared response database, training up the model.</p>

<p>Would allow a small team to have an oversized voice drowning out a topic in a controlled manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trigger alerts are pretty well tested. The trend of abbreviating names to initials, for example HC, DJT, DWS, or purposeful misspelling words Dmeocrat seems to do a pretty good job of extending the amount of time before controlled response comes in. Text on image also tends to slip by oftentimes without rapid response.</p>

<p>Only anecdotal evidence on the comment stacks. Spotted it in action a few times in the San Francisco sub and bantered with them as they were stacking comments. Watched the aligned news cycle the next morning aligned with the messaging being prepared. Popped over to politics and saw similar stacks.</p>

<p>Next time there&#39;s a predictable cycle such as another controversial meeting with a world leader, or nomination to the Supreme Court, watch new submissions around 11pm to 4am PST. They get stacked in the evening before the East Coast wakes up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then the problem is you cannot know the motive. You may perceive a motive incorrectly. You may dismiss a motive because it doesn&#39;t make sense to you (for example perhaps nazi groups would gild posts negative about Jews).</p>

<p>So, the way I see it is - reddit is by nature broadly anarchist in that each user has the same abilities (excluding mods and admins obviously) so anyone can gild any post. Sometimes a post will be guilded ironically or perhaps you&#39;re right and some posts are gilded by &#39;bad actors&#39;. The point is I would suggest gilding is irrelevant. It&#39;s nice to get it because some of the features but beyond that I don&#39;t treat a guilded post any differently than any other post and neither should you. Gold doesn&#39;t equal validity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what is suspicious is that a lot of liberty oriented, anti-government comments get down-voted to oblivion initially, but then, usually a few hours or a day later, they eventually end up with many more upvotes than downvotes. It&#39;s odd because this usually happens during the early hours of the work day (CA time), but then, once the work day has ended in much of the country, the upvotes start rolling in and the comments go positive almost like... people are sitting down and consciously mass upvoting and downvoting comments with certain opinions, but <em>only</em> during the work day. </p>

<p>Sure, you could just say that people are more active in the mornings while they are waiting for the work day to start, having coffee, riding the bus, etc, but this doesn&#39;t explain why the downvote and upvote patterns seem to change completely once the work day ends. It really feels like hundreds, if not thousands of people are being paid to manipulate reddit opinions to support status quo, Democrat (bite me), globalist, EU, UK gov. opinions during certain parts of the day and I think the amount of gildings of status quo comments is strongly suggestive of an effort to use financial swing to sway opinion. </p>

Baudrillard&#39;s famous example was Disneyland, and that Disneyland exists and exists so obviously fancifully so people think its surroundings (Los Angeles, and really western society as a whole) are actually normal.  </p>

<p>&quot;The Disneyland imaginary is neither true or false: it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary. It&#39;s meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the &quot;real&quot; world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness.&quot;  </p>

<p>Is Trump the Disneyland of the world&#39;s political machine?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure the military intelligence community that is propping him up is well aware of ideas like &#39;hyperreality&#39;. It&#39;s not a question of whether the last election was scripted, but to what extent?<br/>
I&#39;d like to think they had a last minute change of script due to those pesky leaks making Clinton let&#39;s say... Un-presidential.<br/>
To what extent is the deep state actually at war with itself? Not at all? I think that&#39;s unlikely. There are some massive differences opinion among the deep state elites.<br/>
I&#39;m also reminded of Trump&#39;s negotiating strategy of taking an extreme (hyper) position so that any final agreement would be more in Trump&#39;s favor than if he started in a more (real)istic posture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree that this is all scripted, especially when it comes to major events like presidential elections. Was is George Carlin that said along the lines of &quot;if elections could actually make a difference, those in power would never let us vote?&quot;  </p>

<p>i now think Trump&#39;s purpose is to make people clamor for &quot;traditional&quot; politicians, who in reality are and will always be a the problem, no matter what team they play for. since the election i&#39;ve seen outspoken democrats (both celebrities and &#39;normal&#39; people) actually say stuff like, &quot;gee i never thought i&#39;d actually miss GWB,&quot; when he used to be public enemy #1. or &quot;sure obama bombed people like it was going out of style, but at least he wasn&#39;t a crass buffoon.&quot; i&#39;m not sure what the equivalent is on the right, maybe republicans that now publicly support guys like McConnell, McCain, and the rest of the good ol&#39; boys? the more out there they can make Trump appear will result in either A) his supporters reverting back to supporting &quot;the system&quot; as it were, or B) his supporters continuing to support him, and becoming more and more ostracized and publicly shamed, at least in the mainstream media and among public figures. either way &quot;they&quot; win.</p>

<p>Interesting because we have a massive amount of people who are hardcore reactionaries for the system. Demanding a return to the political status quo is the most punk rock thing you can do according to the media. Not a common occurrence historically.</p>

<p>Reminds of me of Ted Kaczynski&#39;s bit on how liberals are people who rabidly demand that people follow the values of the system, but act like rebels -- they say they&#39;re against racism, but society is already against racism. Maybe the whole SJW thing that seemingly came out of nowhere a couple years ago was getting the culture ready for reaction, and the installation of Trump is bringing about the political component of the reactionary revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any going back. Trump has set in motion some things that you can&#39;t undo. Like for example the pentagon audit. It&#39;s not entirely under control, but I think basically, the military has taken over the executive office, in opposition to the global corporate power structure. Trump is more of a nationalist than I think we&#39;ve seen in power for at least a generation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there like evidence of that tho? It sounds to me personally like mumbo jumbo conspiracy talk. </p>

<p>Wouldn’t it make more sense that more liberal people frequent Reddit so overtime the most popular political subreddit became liberal after conservatives realized that they weren’t welcome and went to create their own subs? That makes a lot more sense to me than paying to manufacture a sub, unless I’m missing something. </p>

<p>Using Ocum’s Razor or whatever it’s called makes me lean towards people just leaving the sub because they aren’t welcome and it became a liberal circlejerk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit like trying to shout at a jet engine at the moment. Whether those particular subs show evidence of coordinated action? Probably. Snowdon&#39;s revelations already told us there are intelligence efforts to target social media and that was years old information, it&#39;s certainly only got worse (more effective) since then. Can&#39;t prove it of course. But probably.</p>

<p>Thinking about the &quot;jet engine&quot; effect recently, it&#39;s occurred to me that we really have entered the information dark ages. It&#39;s now not only very difficult to determine truth from fiction from virtually all media sources, but it&#39;s impossible to accurately gauge real social support for any viewpoint. Sure there&#39;s a lot of anti-Russia sentiment from the media / politicians at the moment. How much of it is based on truth? .. Possibly virtually none, maybe most of it? How many people actually buy in to it? Absolutely no idea. A vast majority of visible popular support for it on social media might be manufactured, might not be. Maybe most people don&#39;t give a shit? Who knows?</p>

<p>Of course I have my own opinions, but according to the jet engines of social media, internet, broadcast media and politicians, my opinions aren&#39;t acceptable in polite society any more, and the jet engine is used to justify the jet engine. &quot;How can you be so so stupid?&quot; they shout, &quot;There&#39;s a jet engine of information about it. It must be true because of the jet engine!&quot;</p>

<p>But back to your original post, I doubt JTRIG uses Discord.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit gold is cheap af. Reddit is one of the most popular websites in the world. The anti-Trump side has had a lot of good news lately, so it&#39;s no surprise there guildings on most top posts.</p>

<p>As for the informative comments, it&#39;s not that hard to piece together information that&#39;s already out there. They likely get most of there info from other Reddit comments/posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one the subs rules are in favor of well researched, high effort posts and discussions. Just blasting Trump to do it isn’t acceptable. r/politics may be trash and propaganda, but what you’re describing is nothing more than people downvoting low effort rock throwers and upcoming thought provoking discussion. The real conspiracy is how this post made it this high. As for who is gilding, people spend way more on far more trivial and fleeting things. Look at Twitch.TV for example. </p>
