        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see this line thrown around a ton and they are absolutely correct but for the wrong reason.</p>

<p>The Russia conspiracy is the greatest conspiracy of all time because it shows how quick the public will believe a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; as soon as the news tells them too.  </p>

<p>Are you brainwashed? Of course even if you were  you  would believe the opposite even stronger to the point of anger and projection. Is that what we are seeing? You tell me. </p>

<p>You might think that you are repeating facts, the interesting part as that no single fact is allowed to be questioned. What is the common response if someone dares to question a single event such as the &quot;States voting system that were hacked&quot; (they weren&#39;t), the &quot;power outage that was hacked&quot; (&quot;it wasn&#39;t&quot;), the dossier that accused the wrong person of the same name as being in Russia when it was proven he was not and included several spelling mistakes a document of that level would not have, the constant use of vague nonsense phrases like &quot;election hacking&quot; or &quot;hacking of democracy&quot; that no one can actually explain quantitatively, etc? They bring the logic in a circle and say, &quot; oh well what about the rest of it (i.e. the inditements, texts, etc). </p>

<p>If quickly brush off &quot;facts&quot; being debunked that we&#39;re used as evidence then you are falling victum to confirmation bias and have lost much of the credibility you think you have. </p>

<p>If this conspiracy is so true then why are &quot;credible&quot; news outlites putting out so much false information and selectively ignoring the information that goes against it? Wouldn&#39;t you want to see a unbiased picture or do you want to see the picture those in power have created for you, &quot;Trump is hitler and must be removed at all costs&quot;? </p>

<p>Im not telling you what to believe. Treat the idea of Trump being right as a fantasy, play with it assume it is true ask yourself what would it look like? Is it possible? Could I be wrong? If you aren&#39;t willing to accept the possibility of being wrong why is that? </p>

<p>If you respond that I am insane or insult me or show any signs of anger, whataboutism, or accusing me of being a Trump supporter or &quot;Russian apologists&quot; (The most egregious crime apparently? Why is that?) you are proving my point</p>

<p>i think a lot of people who put their energy behind the russia investigation simply hate trump, and need to feel like there&#39;s some hope he might get impeached. and as always i know it&#39;s completely possible he colluded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that most top-level comments are going to be paid shills that rely mostly on their own posts, and possibly pasting AI generated posts/responses that they would read-over before posting. Let&#39;s call these people influencers. These influencers would also upvote and downvote comments that they agree or disagree with.</p>

<p>The influencers have a little bot army that then follows those behaviors, lumping on upvotes and downvotes in coordinance with the influencer. This way you can maximize the impact of what that influencer wants to see, minimize what they don&#39;t want to see, and avoid the obvious errors that AI commenters would make.</p>

<p>A negative score means I&#39;m right!</p>

Maybe all the years of predictive programming of Russians to be bad guys in movies and video games I just find it laughable that people really don&#39;t question why this is being pushed so hard especially seen as Hilary wasn&#39;t elected and without seen any evidence or proof they jumped onto it I really thought this sub would have more sense or maybe the downvotes are from shills</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the big difference on this one is that many people are watching this stuff unfold live. If i watch trump and he sits there in front of the world and sucks off putin, im able to form my own conclusions about that rather than taking someones word for it. I just watched his press release &#39;&#39;rebuttal&#39;&#39; to what he said in helsinki, and he claims he misread the speech he was giving. the contraction in question would have entirely reframed his argument to be one of open antagonism towards russia, which would have suited the moment, but is clearly at odds with his emotional state and actions. my conclusion is outright bullshit and lies. i dont need to buy what the MSM is selling to think that there is clearly stuff behind the scenes here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m essentially making the same argument that Pizzagate proponents often make - that in the absence of a smoking gun, compelling evidence can be made of a collection of individually dismissable evidence when said evidence would not exist in such numbers were something significant not underlying. The problem with this line of argument is, when you have an infinite amount of material to sample, it&#39;s possible to find a large number of odd coincidences that support nearly any theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were investigation a highly sensitive HRC server scandal involving classified information of the state department.</p>

<p>Numerous evidence brought before the House intel committee hearings prove they ignored 2 very important sources proving Hillary had 30,000 emails out in
1. Weiner&#39;s laptop
2. A server being used by a foreign state verfied by the IG
3. a yahoo and gmail account used by Huma Abedin.</p>

<p>Weiner&#39;s laptop was found and handed over by the NYPD . The FBI never used this evidence in their investigation wrap up HRC email case. Strozck testified he ignored it and did not look at it.</p>

<p>The IG alerted the FBI that a server with HRC &quot; classified emails&quot; was discovered and was accessed by a foreign government. FBI ignored it. 
Strozck testified  this, he was asked many times why he ignored this alert from the IG. He refused to answer of course.</p>

<p>In May-July 2016, a FOIA was made to the FBI regarding the HRC case. What they released proved Huma Abedin would print and send her State department emails to a yahoo account. They also used gmail account.
This FOIA also proved the FBI gave Huma and all HRC associated immunity and let them destroy all their devices. This is all in public files released by the FBI to the public.  </p>

<p>When you put all the pieces together. Peter Strozck&#39;s hearing, the FBI utterly failed to protect the national security and the American people&#39;s interests. </p>

<p>This exposes your agenda. From pretending that the leaks had no effect on the election to &quot;public had the right to see the content of the emails&quot; to &quot;transparency is [NOT] a bad thing.</p>

<p>We also had a right to see Trump&#39;s campaign emails, where his son agreed to meet with the Russian lawyer for dirt on Hillary​ as part of Russia&#39;s help for his father, or where Wikileak suggested they leak something innocuous so as to pretend Wikileak was unbias, and Wikileak&#39;s communication with Guccifer2.0.</p>

<p>But we didn&#39;t even get to see his Tax Return which all modern day Presidential candidates take as a normal part of running.</p>

<p>So where was the &quot;transparency&quot; advocates on that? </p>

<p>You ask for three things:</p>

<p>Trump son&#39;s meeting with the Russian lawyer about the emails and sanctions. 
Papadopoulos meeting the Russian professor about the emails. 
Trump&#39;s son commicating with Wikileak and Wikileak communicating with Guccifer2.0. </p>

<p>Explain these:</p>

<p>Why did Trump lie about his son&#39;s meeting the Russian lawyer? 
Why did Flynn talk to Kislyak about sanction and lied about it, rather than wait until he was sworn in?<br/>
Why did Trump​ fire Comey under false pretenses and then said on TV that it was about the Russian thing? 
Why do the Trump​ ​campaign have so many contacts with Russians, including Flynn lying about talking about the sanctions with Kislyak, Sanction lying about his meetings with Kislyak, his son&#39;s meeting, Kushner&#39;s attempt to set up private communication channel with Russia, Prince&#39;s meeting in Seychelles etc?</p>

<p>Nice strawman and deflection. I am all for seeing Trump&#39;s emails and tax returns (which we did end up seeing).

<p>You claimed there is zero analysis and yet you were quite confident it doesn&#39;t explain how Trump​ won. And then just in case, you went on to try to explain away how it isn&#39;t a bad thing &quot;even if they did&quot;.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t &quot;imply&quot; there were equal amount of damaging emails on Trump&#39;s side I named those emails and messages namely:</p>

<p>where his son agreed to meet with the Russian lawyer for dirt on Hillary​ as part of Russia&#39;s help for his father, or where Wikileak suggested they leak something innocuous so as to pretend Wikileak was unbias, and Wikileak&#39;s communication with Guccifer2.0.</p>

<p>If we had seen these emails a week before the election, I&#39;ll bet a sizeable amount of voters wouldn&#39;t be able to vote for him even if they hated Clinton. But Trump​ was able to skate by on just being a good old sexual assaulter rather than the Russian Puppet. Granted this was also Obama&#39;s and Clinton&#39;s fault for not digging these up or forcing the media to cover the Steele Dossier the same way that the Republicans and Russia was able to dig up Clinton&#39;s emails and forced the media to cover it through Wikileak.</p>

<p>You asked for three things that happened during the election to cause people to believe that Trump​was working with Russia, we have done that. I gave a bunch of other circumstances that more than make up circumstancial evidence of collusion between the Trump​ campaign and Russia. You have no rebuttal to any of those except to pretend that you&#39;re right and any evidence contrary to your beliefs are wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm you clearly performed a classic strawman by claiming that I was both &quot;pretending that the leaks had no effect on the election&quot; and directly implying that I only care for transparency in this case. Both of these are complete fabrications by deflecting from my initial point by creating a strawman... </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No again your missing the point I claimed that without any analysis (and I have found none correct me if there is some out there) you cannot conclusively claim what effect it had on the election it is just conjecture.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can claim you would bet all the money but it&#39;s still just weak speculation with 0 facts to back it up other than your feeling which is doesn&#39;t follow logic more often than not.</p>

<p>Regarding your circumstanial evidence you think you are proving me wrong with (you&#39;re not), I want you to answer me these questions. What is a &quot;Russian national&quot;? Is there a different between someone from Russia and the Russian government? What makes someone &quot;Kremlin linked&quot;? Could that be used as a smear campaign to baselessly tarnish the reputation of someone? Has it been done in the past? Is it still happening now?</p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard to put into words how disheartening it is for me to see others go through and still have to feel like I am to this day. In general that&#39;s what it&#39;s like following conspiracies (you&#39;re the minority opinion, no one believes you, etc.) but lately it is getting really bad.</p>

<p>I really wish I could go back to sleep some days tbh.</p>
