       You guys have a severely over expectation of what will happen to social media

       Yeah you're right in the early days of social media sites would pop up and then be replaced. Back when they were only million dollar companies instead of billion dollar companies
      </p>

       But if you think that Facebook is going to collapse just because they censor some conservatives then you're fooling yourself

       It seems like they've stopped even bothering trying to push that BS narrative anymore, because it was so hilariously ineffective.

       Out actually pick sides? What are you doing here? You're literally a perfect example of what people are talking about in this thread. You come here pushing your partisan 'my side is right' bullshit. Wake up dude they're all bad guys and on the same side. Literally no one wants to here anything about how the left is good or the right is good they both suck.

       What say you when Trump uses insults and demeaning nicknames to demean anyone that doesn’t agree with him? Seems like all his supporters aren’t critical at all of his crass rhetoric. The same goes for Trump supporters slandering Hillary and other democratic politicians. Trump supporters really are the most fragile snowflakes.

       This reminds me of when Trump supporters declared the Syria chemical weapons attack was a false flag, then when intelligence confirmed it was Assad, Trump supporters were on board 100% with decision to airstrike. Get your talking points together, your president just pulled a 180...like he always does.

       It’s sad to see skeptics side with a Russian dictator over U.S. intelligence agencies, in relation to a crime that Putin is accused of orchestrating against the U.S. which seems to be working out great for Russia (circumstantial evidence that they at least had a motive to meddle). Hell, Putin even declared yesterday that he wanted Trump to win publicly. Even knowing that intelligence agencies have lied in the past, that doesn’t make Putin trustworthy.

       No,  what sad is to see neocon war mongers piss on an opportunity for peace after Americans have learned they have been lied into war after war since 2003.
      </p>

       But then again,  just follow the money,  the corruption,  the corporate welfare of a military police establishment that has taken away the freedoms we used to cherish.

       No one is suggesting that the US and Russia are not competitors,  but trust based on verification is the only reason this planet has not already been incinerated in a nuclear inferno.   What you are suggesting brings the world closer to that inferno,  not further away from it,  based on no evidence of any substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who ever it was who leaked out the emails of criminals like Podesta and Clinton,  who we know did collude with Russia,  and it was not likely Russia,  should be thanked.   Any US patriot would want that pile of treason exposed,  that pay to play,  that corruption of the American electoral process that was so actively encouraged by the DNC.    If it was available for the RNC I would expect we should have the right to see that as well.

       According to your president, leakers are “traitors and cowards”, but only when they leak information that paints the GOP in a negative light. Otherwise, they praise the leakers, and even ask them directly for dirt on their opponents!

       If I were a moderator of this sub I would fight for better rules. Rules like:

      <p>
       1) Posts that are nothing more than a link to an MSM news article, with a title the same as or similar to said news article, will be immediately removed. (If we wanted to read MSM bullshit we would go straight to their website site. Guess what? We aren’t coming to this sub to read it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       You get the idea. Users that can’t think beyond Democrat vs. Republican and who have absolutely no interest in discovering the truth have ruined this sub.

       Yep - I still think the mod team is good here. They've tried to implement things to help. Not allowing posts from young accounts and submission statements eliminated a lot of the general spam like yournewswire, etc. But the brigading and/or paid shilling and bots are another matter and completely out of control. You can watch it slow down during holidays. The couple of days over July 4 were amazing - it was like the week after the 2016 elections.

       I just don't know how you combat this without more insight into the poster (like IP address). It seems like there should be some aggregate database that finds similarities in posts and can flag potentially artificial users.

       I agree about the blind links to MSM though. If you can be bothered to add some unique analysis to a story then there's no reason to share it here.

       Thank you soo on too much for saying this. I have run into brick walls on here from it. Lots of people on here think that it is only Dems vs GOP. If something is against your side, you have to attack it instead of actually look into it. They don't even want to think that their side could be dirty.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I compare politics to sports. If you are a fan of a team, it doesn't matter how dirty that team is, fans don't care. They will justify or downplay it and continue rooting them on, even defending them. This is not what this sub is about and it sure as fuck isn't what politics should be about. This sub is about finding the truth, no matter what. That has been lost since political operatives realized they can come on online, start a narrative they want, and their supporters will back it no matter what.

       Ohhhh ok that’s why they’re pulling out every last stop to eject Trump from the white noise, risking their ability to even effect the behavior of the populace they want to control by burning up their credibility like tender. That’s why The FBI and DOJ were weaponized to keep him out in the first place. That’s why they’re sending panicked private text messages to each other promising they’ll stop him at any cost.

       Not only does Putin recognize and respect Israel's occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights, Israel
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/">
        got a whole new chunk of Syria.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, you are right the Syria situation is somewhat puzzling.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my interpretation, the central planners aren’t truly against Putin, as explained; more so, they are helping him domestically by doing what they're doing with this pretend-Russophobia and their imperialism / war-mongering in the Middle-East (Putin is now a hero in his country for his intervention in Syria, he didn’t even need to fake it in order to be “reelected”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Israel didn't necessarily want to topple Assad, and get utter chaos right at its border (even if it does control the Salafi islamists that would have replaced him). See Lybia or Iraq: controlling the chieftains doesn't equate with the ability to rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion a key goal in Syria was to weaken Hezbollah (which they correctly presumed would get involved), in preparation for their next war against Lebanon. When they saw it was having the opposite effect, Putin “stepped in” to put an end to the war, and hand Israel a new chunk of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I think the Zionists wouldn't mind a fair amount of devastation in Israel during the next war. That would comfort the domestic populations' inculcated victim complex, and would give them pseudo-moral cover for more Arab democide and land grab.
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7uesbo/im_going_to_explain_something_that_i_fear_many/">
        Remember the Zionists are the truly antisemitic.

       Putin seems a lot more reasonable than our asshole politicians if you actually listen to what he says. He seems to not want thermonuclear war, for example.

       These fucking assholes trying to get us into a war with Russia are the exact same fucking assholes who got us into a war with Iraq, asshole. Nobody believes them anymore except for a small cadre of braindead dead-enders.

       RT has for years peppered their newscasts with popular conspiracy theories among the usual pro-Russia propaganda vignettes. The people who ruined this sub are too dumb to realize they were being pandered to and manipulated. As much as it sickens me, RT is a long-game propaganda masterpiece that set up the current shitshow perfectly. The grooming was top notch.

       All 3 of those groups were definitely targeted for sure. Bernie, and I love Bernie, copied the style of Ron Paul and got hugely popular on the internet- you could say he fine tuned what Ron was doing but with it came everyone else on the internet watching and learning to manipulate and disseminate information.

       Just talking somewhere else.. and we decided that Trump knew they would unleash hell and had been planning to do so, if he did what he did with Putin and at NATO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump completely changed up what he said... and entirely ruined likely weeks if not months of planning and resources geared up to coincide with Mueller and everything else. Now he says I meant wouldn't instead of would... and they're destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now they have all these resources... time.. planning... people and they're trying to recoup some of their losses because he just BTFO'd them.

       Except that flimsy excuse he gave doesn't hold up. If he believed the intelligence community reports and the Russian indictments 
 were accurate, then why would he surround that statement with other statements  intended to cast doubt on investigation that led to indicting Russians?

       Yeah. Pretty much this. He walked into a trap, and he walked out unscathed. Now, Putin is coming to WH, and they both should rub it in and troll as many people as they can. Putin and Trump really are the best trolls/shitposters IRL. Pence is a good second. :)

       Since anti-Trump shills have started brigading any political post. Mass upvotes for anything supporting the DNC, MSM, Intel community etc. Downvotes for anything skeptical of the MSM and government establishment... In other words the sub is behaving the opposite of what you'd expect for a conspiracy sub and exactly how you'd expect if it was overrun by shills.

       Because there are zero good or trustable sources anymore.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The majority of "conspiracy" blogs, "alternative news" sites, etc., are fiction click farms preying on peoples' desire to be validated  and nothing more. Any legitimate ones are drowned on in the sea of BS.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You got the MSM that is a puppet of powerful interests combined with a desire to drive their own ratings with fear and outrage.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have a president who can barely keep his lies and fabrications straight with himself nevermind anybody else.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have the three-letter federal agencies with their own exposed corruptions.

       So...because everything is so “bad” you are asking op to just trust the msm?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I los think you are exaggerating the amount of “crazy” blogs and such. I’ve seen this “narrative” happen time and time again when a small scale/personal blog is posted. Immediately discredited. Sometimes even before actually consuming the content.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is blatant propaganda to descredit the very question op asks. And I will ask again, why are so many people posting msm articles (which  are untrustworthy). And ALSO why are so many people against personal research and the desimination of those findings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone else try and come over up with a reason for why the powers that be are withholding info?

       Since the neo-liberal ideological leaders began steering their heifers to infiltrate areas of dissenting discourse. These are not natives to the conspiratorial landscape but displaced immigrant hoards who care nothing of the culture, spread social disease and stand ready to eat up all the resources. They are strangers in a strange land calling out to the priesthood of their homeland (MSN, CNN, etc) to help make "sense" of this new environment and directions on how to reshape this new climate of higher level thinking into the dulled down, truth can be legislated, pit of intellectual feces and laziness, better reflecting the place of thier birth.

       Why is it so hard to believe that a geopolitical enemy of the west wants to destabilize the west? You are a westerner you literally don't know anything about Russia, my country has been targeted by Russian hackers, propaganda and trolls since 1991. I'm more concerned with the blind trust of Putin that a large portion of this sub has. Like they generally believe an enemy of the US is better for the US than domestic actors. It's completely fucked.

       The real problem is that unchecked globalism has led to massive increases in inequality throughout western countries screwing over the working classes, and the centre-left parties are doing nothing about it. The anger of the dispossessed is going to keep leading to demagogues like Trump to get elected until measures are taken to address these massive inequalities.

       The problem with idiots is that they think a "liar" is a person who never tells the truth, and a "trustworthy" person never lies. Neither of these people have ever existed on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes trustworthy people lie. Sometimes liars tell the truth. The "truth" wears no capital "T". It has to be ground out and worked against the things we think we know.

       The OP clearly wants everyone to disregard
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mueller-indictments-dnc-hacks-guccifer-roger-stone-2018-7">
        the indictments of Russian GRU operatives
       </a>
       . Why? Because the OP wants more people to believe the POTUS isn't in Putin's pocket. I'd love to have the luxury to believe that. But the facts do not fit this narrative.

       I'm fairly new here. When I think of conspiracy theories, I first think of government, JFK,RFK, Vietman war.  Since my eyes, and many others have been opened by Wikileaks and the like,  of course we would seek to follow that same path.  Honestly, I come here to see what's happening in our government, since MSM is all propaganda. Sorry If the government talk is overwhelming, but you still have the option of posting about other worldly conspiracies. I probably won't participate, as what's happening  in this country, on this planet is scary enough. I'm not yet ready for a new awakening of that sort. PS. I never down vote, but maybe we need to upvote these posts to keep it versatile. Could that help?

       I think it's somewhat a mistake to think there ever was a "conspiracy community". Communities in real life develop around shared values and shared interest, not shared enemies. Conspiracy theorists are largely brought together only by a shared cynicism, but without shared vision, of course any semblance of community would be coopted.

       The parallels to the current Democratic party are quite striking. The Democratic party is only really united against Trump. Not that they don't have many good reasons to be against him, but nothing will grow from that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We as a species have become cynical and distrustful, and not for unfounded reasons, but that's not enough.
