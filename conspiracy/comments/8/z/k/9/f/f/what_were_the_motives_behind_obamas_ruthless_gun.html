       What were the motives behind the Obama administration's ruthless gun control agenda? Why was he so eager to disarm everyone, using these obviously media hoax shootings (like Sandy Hook) as an excuse?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that the Obama administration, and the DOJ/ATF was caught red-handed supplying drug gangs in Mexico and Islamist groups in the middle east with hundreds of thousands of military firearms in what became known as operation fast and furious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that there is a connection between the gun control agenda and large-scale, state-sponsored arms trafficking?
      </p>
      <p>
       What can you surmise?

       I’m in Australia so our experience is different but I’ve always felt that the gun control agenda is more about appearing to do something rather than actually doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia is frequently held up as a leading example of gun control but the fact is that there are still plenty of guns out there and getting a gun licence isn't that difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have had a few fairly high profile examples recently of people having (&amp; tragically using) guns that have surprised many of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our leaders want the votes of people that are scared about guns, but they don't want to lose the votes of gun owners.

       There are vastly fewer gun deaths in Australia. How is that not a good thing? The real result of control?

       My point is not about gun deaths. Perhaps we just don't like shooting people as much. Perhaps the economic conditions don't lead to as much violence. Perhaps our cities are not as crowded. Perhaps it is gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm simply saying that it's not that hard to get guns in Australia. It's certainly not as difficult as "popular opinion" would have it and I'm suggesting that our politicians like it that way.

       I agree. In America we have extraordinary confusion about social ills, we have absurd social and economic contradictions that the average person can’t relate to and thus point blame and action at the right forces, racial tensions, and more reasons like these not to allow guns in the hands of teenagers and newly disenfranchised middle aged white men. Still. If we solved these, I wouldn’t want automatic weapons out there.

       Anywhere that gun ownership is tightly restricted also have the highest rates of gun violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chicago, Illinois, has the toughest gun laws in the country, and there are over a dozen firearm homicides that occur in that city on a daily basis, which is almost entirely gang-related.

       It's possible that the CIA wanted to protect their drugs interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black budget is funded entirely by illicit activities such as drug trafficking, gun running, money laundering, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also not a secret that the US is engaged in a proxy war against Syria and Russia, and are using radical islamists as their proxy army to fight that war, which pertains to contested control over two proposed natural gas pipelines. The Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline, which is US-backed, and the Qatar-Turkey pipeline, which is Russian-backed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently multinational oil conglomerates and their puppet governments are literally willing to risk world war 3 over control of a little bit of oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Countless guns from fast and furious went directly to these US proxy forces in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       The western intelligence community has done similar things in the past, when the USSR invaded Afghanistan in the 1980's, the CIA was secretly supplying the Taliban and Mujahideen (the likes of Osama Bin Laden) with literally thousands of FIM-92 stinger missiles, which crippled the Soviet air force and turned the tide of the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military industrial complex is also making a hefty profit from all of this.

       Is this post for real? You think Obama was trying to take your guns? And you think Sandy Hook was an attempt at that?
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem with some people in this sub is they demand hard evidence for trump (FBI indicted 12 Russians but everyone wants hard proof that they accessed the server)
      </p>
      <p>
       But when it comes to shit like Vegas or Sandy hook it’s
       <em>
        assumed
       </em>
       to be a government conspiracy until you can prove it’s not, when they don’t even have proof that it was.

       But your only argument to not trust the intelligence agencies is “they’ve lied before” and trumps only reasoning for saying he disagrees with the intelligence agencies is that Putin told him it isn’t true.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you are quite literally choosing Russian intelligence over the United States intelligence and you’re saying the reason is because “you can’t trust the US government”

       According to your first comment
       <em>
        if you had to choose
       </em>
       (I’m not nor have I ever said you had to choose)  you would pick trump over US intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like I said, Trumps only reasoning for not trusting the US is because of what Putin told him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you are indirectly choosing russia over the United States. I’m going off what you said, I’m not forcing you to say anything.

       Guy, you just said, previously and again now, I must believe Russia because I don’t necessarily believe the US intelligence agencies report.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also said if I had to pick, and confirmed that I don’t have to.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, lose the spin and explain why you are adamant people pick a side here.

       The lightning speed in which the mainstream media (particularly CNN) exploits these questionable mass shootings to push gun control is extremely suspicious.

       Sandy Hook happened at around the same time that the US senate voted on the United Nations small arms treaty. How convenient!
      </p>
      <p>
       That, combined with proven state-sponsored arms trafficking is even more ominous.

       I have more proof that Russia tried meddling in our election than you have proof of sandy hook being a false flag but you choose to believe the latter and not the former.

       I’m not attacking your choice to believe sandy hook is fake (although I disagree) I’m attacking your logic because you seem to pick and choose where to apply it

       It's possible that his gun-running operations may have been mob-related.

       Obama was openly trying to take people's guns.

       Sandy Hook was a false flag, and there's plenty of evidence of that for those who look into it.

       I believe that Martial Law is on the horizon.  This includes, of course, gun confiscation.  Does this have anything to do with the sun rising ENE and setting in the NW?  What would be the consequence of a shifting in our geographic poles?

       Arming the Muj was done under Reagan, I believe, with the SAS (Brit Special Forces) flying militants to remote Scottish islands to train them. It backfired when the Muj kept a bunch of stingers and used them against allied troops later on. No source for this, btw. I think I read it in the memoirs of an SAS soldier.
