       Those of us who were adults during the direct aftermath of 9/11 have seen this before. I only feel sorry for the legions of naive children who may very well be shipping off to fight Russians soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This echo-chamber is everything the DC establishment ever wanted. And just to make it crystal clear (since this comment section will soon be heavily gaslit), Donald Trump may not be the best leader but he was never and is currently still not part of The Establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Establishment always meant The Washington DC Establishment, aka The Established Family Names that Run Washington DC and the people they sponsor and allow into the fold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we have the first non-Establishment President in decades and look at the results. This is blatantly obvious to those of us with functional thinking skills, whether we voted for Trump or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       What a fucking joke. The lunatics are running the asylum and the entire world is being gaslit by the same people who killed millions of innocents in the Middle East, tanked the world economy in the name of greed and corruption, and created a continent of refugees fleeing their for-profit wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the wheel continues to turn because people can't even be bothered to have a shred of common sense. Why is Russia the enemy? People on this site are openly calling for assassinations hourly! The hordes of useful idiots are calling for impeachment. For what? People are acting like Robert "9/11" Mueller has provided even a shred of evidence that Donald Trump is "in bed" with the Russian government. Clinton gets a humiliating loss and people really can't connect that to her hundreds of powerful Establishment government/intelligence/media friends sowing this chaos?
      </p>
      <p>
       They are stirring up a civil war and World War III at the same time completely out of revenge and because they thrive on divisive chaos and a war-time economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure its all "the Russians fault".
      </p>

       Wake. The. Fuck. Up.

       I'm pretty confident that a guy who owes money to TPTB, was born into great wealth, gamed legal systems for hus own benefit, and used to support the other party financially is not part of the Establishment at all.

       No, no, no, no....you've got it all wrong. When they are born into wealth, exploit the legal system, exploit foreign workers, game tax loopholes, fuck over workers and investors, fake a charitable organization to line their pockets, and get backing from the Republican establishment 'til the bitter end, it means they're

       Trump is a New York based real estate magnate who at various times has had to receive huge sums to stay afloat from zionist banks.  So yeah, he also has a hollywood connection and has been an attention whore his entire life, rubbing shoulders with the elite, because he is one of them.

       Follow the money.  Trump was slurping zionist schlong years ago.  “In spring 2004, at the height of violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the single largest gathering in support of the Jewish state,” Trump told attendees at this year’s American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington, D.C., a line he has also offered at debates, in interviews, or whenever his fealty to the Jewish state or knowledge of foreign affairs is questioned. “It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel,” he continued. “Many people turned down this honor. I did not. I took the risk, and I’m glad I did.”

       The multi-national worldwide power behind the scene is known as TPTB = The Powers that Be.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are having a conversation about whether or not Trump is part of The Establishment, which again, means The Washington DC Establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Trump is beholden to TPTB, everybody who isn't TPTB is beholden to them. Try to keep up instead of derailing threads because you lack an understanding of definitions.

       Cannot agree more with this.  Fuck Trump, as it's not like he's any sort of "for the people" type, but I cannot.  Agree.  More.  100% correct.  Anything that anybody says that is even
       <em>
        mildly

       Let me guess, you think Trump is a republican simply because Trump understood that he wouldn't have a chance at winning unless he had an R or D next to his name.

      <p>
       And no, I come from a family of lifetime democrats. I voted democrat my whole life, I voted for Obama the first time, nobody for the second term, and I would have voted for Bernie, but since he got railroaded I voted for neither Clinton nor Trump.

You are an idiot for not noticing how ridiculous and shady the President is acting when it comes to Russian related issues.

       I am getting pretty close to seeing my way out of here, tbh. It is absolutely obvious that certain accounts show up at the exact moment that the brigading starts and I watch the mod logs and the people getting banned are most often people pushing back against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these brigaders openly admit to coming back under other accounts after they manage to get banned, and they remain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, you and I are not allowed to point them out. We are not allowed to point out the above fact either.

       They have let the shills take over. This comment will be deleted and I will probably be banned for saying this. It's the same crap everywhere you go on the internet. They are simply allowed to take over and shill the shit out of every social media source.

       The whole point of a gish gallop is to throw out a bunch of stuff and then say, "well you haven't refuted all of this, so it must be true."  Which is exactly what he's doing.

       The scary thing is it is the young and the naive that are being sucked in and twisted to purpose. They are indoctrinated in schools and universities that no longer teach how to think and lead but what to think and who to follow.

       The people on this site claim the GOP is the root of all evil in America. Then they conveniently forget that the DNC fixed their primaries to elect Clinton. "Wahh, Russia is interfering with our Democracy". Apparently Democrats don't believe in Democracy, since they let the DNC shit all over it and they still happy give them their vote. But hey, somehow some Russian bots are more of a threat to Democracy than fixing an election lul.

       You know, your political point aside, if you really wanted to convince people you are correct, being condescending is not the way to go. You say you are smarter and can see things clearly, yet provide no real evidence or argument as to why that is the case. How about presenting critical facts and analysis to support your position, rather than a long, heavily laden opinion piece about how the other side is "naive children"? Just a suggestion.
