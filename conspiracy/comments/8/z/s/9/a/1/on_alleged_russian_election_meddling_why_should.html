       SS: I don't support Trump, or any politician for that matter, but on the subject of alleged Russian election meddling, why should we believe U.S. intelligence agencies that have provably lied the country into so many illegal wars in the past, have killed so many innocent civilians, are responsible for covertly overthrowing numerous governments, arming and funding terrorists, drug smuggling, and even proposing to attack its own citizens (Operation Northwoods) to justify going to war with Cuba? Not to mention that the US government is most likely responsible for more election meddling than any other country in the world.

       They almost certainly interfered in the US elections in some way, just like they have in the past, and like every other world power has for at least the last 70 years, including at least 81
       <em>
        documented
       </em>
       cases of the US government doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, the US IC hasn't provided any hard evidence to the public, and has a documented history of lying to the US public, so know, I do not take them at their word.

       You really shouldn't. The intelligence community has no credibility. Time and time again, they have proven themselves to be liars and the enemy of the American people and world at large. The only people propping them up, are useful idiots who simply hate Trump or paid in one form or another. Five eyes and COINTELPRO. Amazing how people have the memory span of goldfish.

       Would it be fair to say that this applies equally if not more so to Putin's government, meaning this particular line of thought doesn't get us very far in determining who is telling the truth?

       It's not that the American people have the minds of goldfish (though many do). Imo it's more that they listen to the media to tell them what to think, without doing any actual critical thought. So any story the MSM creates will be immediately accepted by most as fact. And even if a lot of people see through their story, that information will never make it on MSM.

       The problem is that the "intelligence community" is just one part of the vast American Empire.  If you are against the American Empire, you have a valid case.  Read Chomsky and get a horrifying look at what that all means.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're ambivalent or agnostic about the American Empire, (
       <em>
        which country should be running the world? How am I gonna buy my iphone, or pay my mortgage?
       </em>
       ), then you have a difficult question:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If it is all true
       </strong>
       , that DT is being blackmailed by Putin, has been installed in the Presidency as a puppet of the Russian dictator,
       <strong>
        then who
       </strong>
       do you think has the power and ability to discover this, and root out the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will Alex Jones save you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the "Deep State" and "Intelligence community" has the power to figure this out.  We each have to decide, if we think we're being lied to.

       But what about the US intelligence track record? We couldn’t even get all the JFK assassination files declassified after 50 years. That’s a treasonous act. Or the 9/11 Commission report obstruction from the CIA. Another treasonous act. Or the WMDs in Iraq. Another treasonous act. So so so many more examples. The guilty party has a history of accusing others of the very things they are guilty of. And no, Alex jones works for the CIA. So does Trump most likely. Trust nobody unless they offer total transparency. The thing is, this could be the CIA’s plan. Just like the world thinks the Nazis were defeated in World War II. They seen the Nuremberg trials. But in reality project paperclip flew them over to set up camp with their CIA brothers. I can see them destroying the CIA and transferring all their operations to a different agency. Creating the illusion that all the bad things CIA was responsible for has been dealt with and justice has been served. In reality, some scapegoats will be thrown under the bus and the true criminals will move on to other agencies.

       You can be concerned with more than one thing at a time, but that question is beside the point. The point is we can't determine the truth of the claim that the Russians hacked the DNC simply by considering the reputations of those on the opposing sides of the story because both sides have terrible reputations.

        why should we believe U.S. intelligence agencies that have provably lied the country into so many illegal wars in the past, have killed so many innocent civilians, are responsible for covertly overthrowing numerous governments, arming and funding terrorists, drug smuggling, and even proposing to attack its own citizens

       Because the evidence supports what they're saying. And because this logic doesn't actually get us anywhere useful since it also applies to Putin and the Russian state.

       No it's not, at least not remotely in the sense that Trump is accused of. And even if it were, which again it isn't, that would not make the allegations against Trump any less important or meaningful.

       So what about the reports from other countries such as France and Germany? Please keep in mind that France opposed military action in Iraq in regards to the WMD reports, so clearly they are not in line with American intelligence. Let's not act like Russia hasn't shown a pattern of this behavior.

       Rather than tossing a bunch of shit at me that can't possibly be addressed with any efficiency, why don't we stay on the subject at hand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, American intel agencies have told many lies in the service of many bad goals. That is not sufficient to conclude that they're ALWAYS lying, nor is it sufficient to conclude they're lying here and now. That's especially true because, as I mentioned, Putin and Russian intelligence have also told many lies in the service of many bad goals, and in this case they are telling a story that is mutually exclusive with the American version. In other words, you're going to have to believe one set of proven liars no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the evidence that supports what the American intel communities are saying, yes, it's solid as hell. We have the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that the Trump campaign has already admitted to. We have Manafort's emails to Konstantin Kilimnik offering private campaign briefings to Putin-aligned oligarchs in order to "get whole" on Manafort's millions in debt. We have congressional Republicans (Ryan, McCarthy, Scalise) privately speculating that the Russians perpetrated the DNC hack six months before the USIC briefed Congress on their conclusion that it was Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't see the truth here it's because you don't want to.

l still believe USA intel agencies are everything they keep trying to convince us Russian agencies are, and Russia doesn't have a military base in my country, nor does china. AMERICA DOES THOUGH. and you think l should still believe those biased unelected officials who have their own agenda and nests to feather?
