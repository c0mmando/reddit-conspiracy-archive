Not to mention that the US government is most likely responsible for more election meddling than any other country in the world.</p>

<p>Would it be fair to say that this applies equally if not more so to Putin&#39;s government, meaning this particular line of thought doesn&#39;t get us very far in determining who is telling the truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that the American people have the minds of goldfish (though many do). Imo it&#39;s more that they listen to the media to tell them what to think, without doing any actual critical thought. So any story the MSM creates will be immediately accepted by most as fact. And even if a lot of people see through their story, that information will never make it on MSM.</p>

<p><strong>If it is all true</strong>, that DT is being blackmailed by Putin, has been installed in the Presidency as a puppet of the Russian dictator, <strong>then who</strong> do you think has the power and ability to discover this, and root out the truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what about the US intelligence track record? We couldn’t even get all the JFK assassination files declassified after 50 years. That’s a treasonous act. Or the 9/11 Commission report obstruction from the CIA. Another treasonous act. Or the WMDs in Iraq. Another treasonous act. So so so many more examples. The guilty party has a history of accusing others of the very things they are guilty of. And no, Alex jones works for the CIA. So does Trump most likely. Trust nobody unless they offer total transparency. The thing is, this could be the CIA’s plan. Just like the world thinks the Nazis were defeated in World War II. They seen the Nuremberg trials. But in reality project paperclip flew them over to set up camp with their CIA brothers. I can see them destroying the CIA and transferring all their operations to a different agency. Creating the illusion that all the bad things CIA was responsible for has been dealt with and justice has been served. In reality, some scapegoats will be thrown under the bus and the true criminals will move on to other agencies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rather than tossing a bunch of shit at me that can&#39;t possibly be addressed with any efficiency, why don&#39;t we stay on the subject at hand? </p>

<p>Yes, American intel agencies have told many lies in the service of many bad goals. That is not sufficient to conclude that they&#39;re ALWAYS lying, nor is it sufficient to conclude they&#39;re lying here and now. That&#39;s especially true because, as I mentioned, Putin and Russian intelligence have also told many lies in the service of many bad goals, and in this case they are telling a story that is mutually exclusive with the American version. In other words, you&#39;re going to have to believe one set of proven liars no matter what.</p>

<p>As to the evidence that supports what the American intel communities are saying, yes, it&#39;s solid as hell. We have the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that the Trump campaign has already admitted to. We have Manafort&#39;s emails to Konstantin Kilimnik offering private campaign briefings to Putin-aligned oligarchs in order to &quot;get whole&quot; on Manafort&#39;s millions in debt. We have congressional Republicans (Ryan, McCarthy, Scalise) privately speculating that the Russians perpetrated the DNC hack six months before the USIC briefed Congress on their conclusion that it was Russia.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see the truth here it&#39;s because you don&#39;t want to.</p>
