        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is well-known who Eisenhower was pissed off at when Gary Powers&#39; plane crashed right before he was to attempt ending the Cold War with his summit with Krushchev. Krushchev knew who to blame too. CIA Director and deep state operative Allen Dulles, who ordered it. </p>

<p>The ensuing crisis had no benefit to anyone except the deep state and the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower would later warn about. They wanted to keep the Cold War going, with good reason.</p>

<p>Now the deep state, along with the main-stream media that it controls, is stoking the flames and doing the same thing all over again. It was no accident that Rod Rosenstein issued his indictment of the &quot;Russian Hackers&quot; right before Trump&#39;s summit with Putin. </p>

<p>There is corruption in Russia&#39;s government, and it is a potential threat to the U.S.&#39;s security that is to be sure. But what else is to be sure is that there is corruption in <strong>all governments.</strong> </p>

<p>Is Russia&#39;s &quot;meddling&quot; any worse than what our wonderful &quot;allies&quot; have been doing to meddle in U.S. affairs? Is Russia the state that has been encouraging the flood of illegal and potentially felonious immigrants into America? Is Russia the state that had one of its former intelligence agents feeding information to American media and politicians in a bid to overturn the will of the American people as pertains to their choice of the American President? Is Russia the state that openly controls both parties of Congress through one of its lobbying proxies to the detriment of our national security interests? Is Russia the state that has been covertly giving funding to religious extremists and terrorists, putting the lives of our armed forces and civilians in the middle east at risk?</p>

<p>Who are the <strong>real</strong> enemies here? Who really benefits from this sabotage?</p>

<p>I agree. People are ignoring/forgetting that we live in an age where it is entirely possible to put words into Trumps or Putins mouth &amp; most of the populace is not actively assuming &#39;manufactured Tensor Flow&quot; video where it is very difficult to spot whether it really  happened or not.</p>

<p>Not a Trump fan, but yesterday he is complimentary &amp; civil to Putin &amp; today he appears to retract all of that.....</p>

<p>Cmon we have to admit it is bizarre. I&#39;m starting to suspect tensor flow manufactured statements once in awhile.</p>

<p>I mean if I can do it on my home laptop with deep fakes software. Pretty sure it&#39;s not &#39;hands off&#39; to deep state traitors to this country.</p>

<p>Also if you look at his walkback video statement today. He doesn&#39;t read off that paper very enthusiastically &amp; when they zoomed in on the paper it&#39;s written across the top &quot;There was no collusion&quot;. So who is insisting he reads this shit?</p>

And I don&#39;t mean his half-hearted double speak when confronted with conflicting statements. That, and y&#39;know, he was speaking in front of myriad eye witnesses both times. It&#39;s far more likely he&#39;s a embarrassingly inconsistent person whose opinion depends on who most recently stroked his ego.</p>

<p>And as concerning as deep fakes are for the future, there is very little chance they could be used nowadays convincingly. It is very easy to tell if you&#39;re looking for the signs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And how is Russia a greater threat to US security than the US is to everyone&#39;s security? I&#39;m calling bullshit on that. The enemy of the American people is the American oligarchy - Putin has never tried to privatize social security, or deny Americans healthcare. It&#39;s not Putin&#39;s fault that Flint and a few thousand other American cities don&#39;t have clean water, or that Wall Street regularly loots the economy. Every crime suffered on the American people has been inflicted by the American oligarchy - not Putin, or Xi, or Un, or any of the other boogeymen used to scare the American sheeple into voting against their own interests (not that it really matters how they vote, since the American oligarchy has corrupted the American voting process to a degree that dwarfs Putin&#39;s (supposed) wildest dreams.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>why did Jill Stein request a re-count of votes in 3 states where Donald Rump barely defeated Killary Clinton: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it wasn&#39;t actually gonna make any difference. Good opportunity to stoke more divisions among Americans. And, oh by the way, the leftover cash she collected from supporters as part of that recount fight? The cash whose donors she promised would have a chance to vote on how it&#39;s used? Guess what she&#39;s using it for? <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jill-steins-recount-cash-pays-for-her-russia-legal-defense">To pay lawyers for her Russia legal defense.</a> </p>

<p>Womp womp.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve answered your question, you answer mine. Why the fuck was she spending so much time in swing states? How was that in the Green Party&#39;s best interests or the country&#39;s best interests?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s see George W. Bush went fishing with Putin.  I guess President George Bush was a Putin stooge too, right?  Peace between nations necessitates political leaders meet with each other.</p>

<p>The Bush whacker even said he could see the soul in Putin&#39;s eyes.  Yep, George Bush was Russia&#39;s man in Washington.  No doubt about it.</p>

<p>Look here, my friend, as long as the CIA fictitiously casts Russia as a threat, our hard-earned tax dollars will continue to be lost in the Trillions to the Military-Industrial Complex, which needs the Russian phantom menace to gobble up our taxes.</p>

<p>We are a menace to Russia, not the other way around. The Russians want to be our trading partner, just like France is our trading partner. The Russians for decades have wanted normalized relations with the U.S. The warmongers in the CIA are responsible for the Cold War. Russia (the Soviet Union) never wanted the Cold War. If FDR had lived, the extremely costly Cold War never would have happened. So FDR had to die, just like JFK and RFK had to die, and Nixon had to be run from office, since Nixon was pro-detente with the Russians. All the while, the Military-Industrial Complex is making out like bandits, feeding on our tax dollars (devouring 10 times more tax money than they need). The &quot;Defense&quot; companies are the Borg, and they have assimilated you, despite President Eisenhower&#39;s warning about the Military-Industrial Complex in his farewell speech to the nation.</p>

<p>Oh give me a break. Bush was the sitting US President. Not a fringe politician who couldn&#39;t break a million votes in her wildest dreams. There is no good reason for Stein to be in a position like that and you know it. </p>

<p>And this is now the second time you&#39;ve dodged the question about why Stein was campaigning in swing states. Another one you can&#39;t answer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to argue that American elite/oligarchy use lobbyism and the media to ensure corrupt practices in their favor, because that&#39;s true everywhere in the west and in Russia.</p>

<p>However, we have to view the recent Russo-phobia in the correct &quot;geopolitical&quot; lens. Since the Cold War, and especially after USSR collapse, the west has increasingly left Russia out of trade deals and international exchanges. We see a govt struggle economically under Yeltsin and then seemingly prosper under Putin. During this time increases to the military allows RUS to reclaim lost Soviet satellites and subsequently, NATO expansion to protect their sovereignty by allowing them to become members. 
Annexation of Crimea marks a point in which the west repeatedly engages in cyber warfare (eg stuxnet against Iran, NSA expansion, so on). Also the Magnitsky Act signed by Obama created a way to circumvent across-the-board sanctions by instead targeting the Russian oligarchs themselves. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t exactly say that history is repeating itself in this recent turn of events leading up to the 2016 election. Your examples about domestic US issues being self-inflicted (rather than RUS) make sense but it&#39;s very silly to read the rhetorical questions with Russia / Cold War 2.0 in mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I call bullshit-the deep state as a concept is rather new. Its just the trendy scapegoat on the block thanks to Trump and Russian bots spamming the phrase. In 15 years it will be some new scapegoat element of our country. And yes I consider Russian influence a bad thing considering their strategy of undermining the concept of democracy and assymetrical warfare. Thanks, but I&#39;m not falling into that trap. Yea our govt is evil, but that doesn&#39;t mean Russia&#39;s govt is any better. Russia does some pretty evil shit.</p>

<p>I know quite a bit and I expect quite a bit more. And as I said, that wouldn&#39;t make Russian meddling a non-issue so what&#39;s your point aside from trying to deflect with whataboutism?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d love to hear details about how Russia controls the Republican party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re lying. If you actually wanted to hear these details, you&#39;d have sought them out a long time ago since they&#39;re readily available. But the most obvious place to start is the apparent control they have over Trump, the head of the Republican party. Look to the comments I posted above from congressional Republicans who were speaking privately. <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/05/08/putins-proxies-helped-funnel-millions-gop-campaigns">Read this commentary about how Putin&#39;s oligarchs funneled millions into GOP campaigns.</a> And just yesterday Russian spy Maria Butina was indicted for working with her mentor, Alexander Torshin, to develop back channel communication with US politicians via the NRA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does this include Graham and McCain and the rest of the GOP establishment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly doubt in includes those two given their historical opposition to Russia. It certainly seems to include significant portions of the GOP establishment like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, who have both provided cover for Trump and Russia. Hopefully we&#39;ll find out the true and full extent of the problem soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree I hope we find out the truth also. It&#39;s just comical the selective outrage for alleged meddling by the Russians when Israel is a far greater threat with far more influence like pushing us into the Iraq war, trying to stop deals with Iran etc.. </p>

<p>Of course threat depends on what foreign policy you want to see. Clearly the people upset are the same folks who push for occupation of the middle east and what Israel wants. </p>

<p>It is really silly to say that Russia is an enemy of the United States when U.S. officials are still making diabolical pacts with the Israeli regime and even Saudi Arabia. It just doesn’t add up, and it is interesting to see that even a person like Oliver Stone is realizing that the press, the media and other news outlets are essentially shooting themselves in the toes when they are not reporting the real thing.</p>

<p>Right. I also mentioned comments from GOP reps Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, and Steve Scalise in which they speculate that Putin owns Trump and at least one other GOP congressman in Rohrabacher. I also mentioned yesterday&#39;s indictment of Maria Butina. I didn&#39;t but could have mentioned the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and the emails between Paul Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik in which Manafort offers private campaign briefings to Russian oligarchs in order to &quot;get whole&quot; for the millions of dollars he owes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>&quot;On May 1, the president found out his CIA director&#39;s assurances were hollow, when a Soviet missile slammed into a U-2 plane flying over Russia&#39;s Ural Mountains, resulting in the downing of the aircraft and the capture of CIA pilot Francis Gary Powers. The flight on the eve of the Paris summit seemed so badly timed and planned that at least one close observer, Air Force colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, suspected that the CIA had intentionally provoked the incident in order ot ruin the peace conference and ensure the continued reign of Dulles dogmatism. Prouty, a liason officer between the Pentagon and the CIA who was summoned by DUlles whenever CIA spy flights ran into trouble, later wrote that the U-2 shootdown was &quot;a most unusual event&quot; that grew out of a &quot;tremendous underground struggle [between] the peacemakers led by President Eisenhower&quot; and the Dulles &quot;inner elite.&#39;</em></p>

<p>You don&#39;t know the control Israel has over our election process? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know quite a bit and I expect quite a bit more. And as I said, that wouldn&#39;t make Russian meddling a non-issue so what&#39;s your point aside from trying to deflect with whataboutism?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d love to hear details about how Russia controls the Republican party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re lying. If you actually wanted to hear these details, you&#39;d have sought them out a long time ago since they&#39;re readily available. But the most obvious place to start is the apparent control they have over Trump, the head of the Republican party. Look to the comments I posted above from congressional Republicans who were speaking privately. <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/05/08/putins-proxies-helped-funnel-millions-gop-campaigns">Read this commentary about how Putin&#39;s oligarchs funneled millions into GOP campaigns.</a> And just yesterday Russian spy Maria Butina was indicted for working with her mentor, Alexander Torshin, to develop back channel communication with US politicians via the NRA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does this include Graham and McCain and the rest of the GOP establishment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly doubt in includes those two given their historical opposition to Russia. It certainly seems to include significant portions of the GOP establishment like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, who have both provided cover for Trump and Russia. Hopefully we&#39;ll find out the true and full extent of the problem soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>you linked to an editorial in the Dallas paper that suggests, mainly conjecture some donors had &quot;ties to Russia&quot;</p>

<p>Right. I also mentioned comments from GOP reps Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, and Steve Scalise in which they speculate that Putin owns Trump and at least one other GOP congressman in Rohrabacher. I also mentioned yesterday&#39;s indictment of Maria Butina. I didn&#39;t but could have mentioned the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and the emails between Paul Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik in which Manafort offers private campaign briefings to Russian oligarchs in order to &quot;get whole&quot; for the millions of dollars he owes.</p>

<p>So what do you think of this evidence? I mean obviously you reject it, but I&#39;d like for you to explain why in detail because I highly doubt you have good reason to do so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lmao. That&#39;s your amazing evidence &quot;Russia controls the GOP&quot;? Seriously? That&#39;s your case the Russian government controls the Republican Party?</p>

<p>This is not a counterargument. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you yourself admitted the leadership establishment of the GOP all came out against Trump</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I didn&#39;t. I said the exact opposite. I said GOP leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have covered for him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I assume you would claim the Saudis and Russians also control the DNC via contributions to the Clinton foundation and Fusion GPS?</p>

<p>Deflect, deflect, deflect. It&#39;s all you can do.</p>
