       Seriously I. Don't. Fucking. Care. That was 2 years ago and literally nothing can or will be done about it. The only thing worse than this was the Obama isn't a citizen, birth certificate fiasco. Ugh. Its too late he's (Trump)is in office. Like it or not, so just stop already. I'm not a huge Trump fan, but he hasn't wrecked the bus yet, and hasn't embarrassed us anymore than Bush Jr. So can we just talk about something else? Ffs.

       You put forth your opinion but you stated no fact. Just because you dont give a shit about what shady dealings go on behind the scenes doesn't mean you should tell others they shouldn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you should care is because one thing leads to another. Let them slide on this, next year your in a POW camp. At first people didnt think Hitler was up to no good.

       Ok. I will slow this down for our senior citizen population.. Fact#1: I'm a non-voter. Fact #2: Trump is in office. Fact#3: This happened a long time ago.. Need I go on..

       I never said America was once great. I also never said any of what you're implying. People like you like to do that to fit your narrative.

       I don't support Trump, I don't support either side very strongly. I support what makes sense for the world around us. Sometimes people like you want to let corrupt shit happen cause you either A. Cant do anything about it. Or B. Just need something to argue about.

       Oh that was my point. It doesn't matter at all bc people ARE stupid as fuck. That's why he got elected. That's why Hillary was on the ticket. Thats why he will get re-elected.. And shills like yourself will still be on reddit talking about.. your stupid bc.. blah..blahblah..blahblah. When it just doesn't fucking matter. So please do yourself a favor.. stop worrying about shit that doesn't matter. And maybe we could talk about something that does.

       But where is the evidence that Trump actually colluded with Russia to do so? It’s quite clear that Russia meddled in the election but whether or not Trump was involved is still unknown and right now there simply is no evidence. I’d say there is a better chance that Russia’s goal was to simply create chaos within the United States by trying to mess with the elections and look at us now...playing right into his hands. But that’s just my theory

       I definitely understand your thoughts. As long as he's in office, America will be fu**ed with whatever words coming out his mouth. As long as he's POTUS, there's NOTHING we can do about it. No matter how many propaganda, shared posts, videos to ridicule him, he would still be POTUS. We just have to move on.

       Hahaha! And what does your speech does? It does enlighten me. But at the end of the day, he's still sitting there. Can I raise a bill? No. Can I hate him? Yes. But that effort would be placed somewhere else productive. I'll leave it to the congress or lawyers to oust him. If I'm invited to join a rally THAT WILL ELIMINATE him from his seat, yes I will join. But if none, I'll seat on my chair, feed my family, and work for my expenses.

       Idgaf. It's likely fake news anyway. Throw them a dollar and they will say anything the media publishes what they are paid to publish. They are not reporting on these events for the better of the American people, they are doing it to make a buck. I really think there are some people that want this conspiracy to be true, and they will either fabricate the evidence, or pay for bullshit propoganda. People will believe most anything they read in the headlines., especially if they only read t headline. Seems to me like people are looking for any excuse they can to riot. Even here on reddit,  if you don't agree with the popular opinion, they become very aggressive and hostile. This downvoting is a primary reason why everybody seamingly has the same opinion about politics.

       as a nonvoter, millenial, before you call me a boomer... it's imperative to ruin your feed talking about politics. sorry, not sorry. we need to get everyone to the  same point of disenchantment as you to change it.
      </p>
      <p>
       so prepare to hear about politics for the rest of your life. good news is? you've got a scroll option!!! taa daa!

       You're far from the only person who just does not care about Trump/Russia election collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, here's why you should.  If this behavior becomes normalized, and becomes seen as a valid political campaign tactic, the American political class will begin to sell out our country to foreign interests in the same manner it already sells out our country to corporate interests, and that is not good for America, right or left.  If you see the stuff going on with the NRA, it's already starting.

       So, we elected Trump to be just like Obama and Hillary, just mixing up the countries we're selling America out to?  Maybe we should start calling Trump the third Clinton?

       It already is normalized.  They just lost at their own game and real butt hurt.

       US has not had a fixed/corrupt free election system since before G.B. senior days.

       Yes. I care about a silent government coupe by the GOP and a hostile foreign nation. I've paid into this system my entire life and have a lot to lose if it slips into an authoritarian dictatorship.

       As far as Bush Jr. goes, I hated that fucker with every fiber of my being but at
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       point during his term did I think we were no longer a nation of laws with appropriate checks and balances or that there was a real possibility of becoming a dictatorship.

       Like I told the last political moron it doesn't fucking matter. Election Rigging didn't have anything to do with it.. Even if it did its too late. Trump got elected bc the general public is dumb af. The same reason Hillbot was on the ticket instead of Bernie. The same reason Trump will be re-elected.. The same reason people wanted Obamas birth-certificate.. Like I could go on and on and on.. It doesn't matter but while the idiots are chirping about this we literally could be talking about anything else interesting on this thread and in life.. But no.. we have to talk about devisive shit that just doesn't matter. Whatever.. this is why I don't vote.. this is why its back to video games.. The boomer was right about one thing this country is fucked.
