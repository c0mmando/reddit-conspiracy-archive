<p>And was also illegally wiretapped by Obama but lets not worry about that for now.</p>

<p>Yes, for their own personal wrong doings. Nothing related to Trump, otherwise they would have slapped charges on him too.</p>

<p>Because they are desperate for any reason to impeach him. Hello? The investigation has been going on for almost a year and a half now... Mueller has nothing. </p>

<p>Cool so Trump hired a criminal and had no idea about any of his criminal ties to Russia. I guess Trump is just retarded then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mistake, I didn&#39;t read that you said appointed, I thought you meant people in general.</p>

<p>That makes what you said even stupider. Of course the people he appointed think a proper thorough investigation is needed, that is how you clear the air from all this Russia hysteria. A proper investigation, led by a proper investigator (Mueller). So far, nothing.</p>

<p>Obama knew about the wiretapping and signed off on it. Why would Trump even bother with the FBI when they were against him from the start? </p>

<p>Trump is not fighting for Russian interests, he&#39;s fighting for AMERICAN interests. He strengthened NATO, how does that help Russia? </p>

<p>You&#39;re incredibly naive if you think he didn&#39;t know about it. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe because it&#39;s not a smart idea to telegraph your moves if you&#39;re trying to catch someone in the act of something?</p>

<p>Also, Strzok saying they needed to &#39;Stop Trump&#39; was not proof enough for you? Seriously? That is some amazing cognitive dissonance. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s getting European countries who have been slacking on defense to pay their fair share. A strong NATO deters Russia. Why am I having to explain this, this is basic knowledge and the whole reason Trump did the NATO briefing before visiting Putin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama was briefed on a counter intelligence operation, yeah. Because the fuckin president usually gets told about it when someone running for office has surrounded himself with Russian agents. </p>

<p>No ones guys personal opinion isnt proof of anything. Especially when the IG report said it didnt effect the investigation. </p>

<p>If Trump wanted our european allies to be strong then maybe he shouldn&#39;t constantly talk shit about all of them on twitter. </p>

<p>Look at what happened to Libya.  Gadhafi was spending a lot of money on his people, but then they took him out.  All the Libyan gold disappeared and his programs were shut down.  The Libyan people had it really good under Gadhafi.  This is why the international bankers could not let it continue.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of Trump policies benefit the top 1% the most, who keep much of their money in offshore bank accounts, so no.</p>

<p>It’s funny how you would consider someone who escalates the War on Drugs, diverts $$ from social programs to military spending, and champions the propagandized Fox News as someone who is doing something right for the people.</p>

<p>If there is an actual “deep state” Trump is their wet dream, especially as he continues to appoint people from the “old guard” (Kavanaugh, Bolton, DeVos, Sessions) into prominent positions.</p>

<p>Benefit the wealthy predominantly (especially when tax cuts expire for regular folk in 2021), escalate the drug war, make quality education only attainable for the wealthy, place more power in the hands of corporations — it’s just amazing to me that someone would consider these things counterproductive to what a theoretical deep State would want.</p>

<p>Trump is a lying sack of shit  </p>

<p>who&#39;s campaign is under criminal investigation.</p>

<p>And was also illegally wiretapped by Obama but lets not worry about that for now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His campaign manager is sitting in jail while other members of his campaign take plea deals with the FBI</p>

<p>Yes, for their own personal wrong doings. Nothing related to Trump, otherwise they would have slapped charges on him too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone hes appointed thinks this criminal investigation is appropriate and necessary. </p>

<p>Because they are desperate for any reason to impeach him. Hello? The investigation has been going on for almost a year and a half now... Mueller has nothing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hes not trustworthy in the slightest.</p>

<p>Except he is, because he&#39;s done everything he said he would do. Opinion discarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Obama didnt sign off on anything. Because the FBI doesnt take orders from the president.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re incredibly naive if you think he didn&#39;t know about it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the FBI was against him from the start, then it would have leaked that Trump had a criminal investigation on his hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe because it&#39;s not a smart idea to telegraph your moves if you&#39;re trying to catch someone in the act of something?</p>

<p>Also, Strzok saying they needed to &#39;Stop Trump&#39; was not proof enough for you? Seriously? That is some amazing cognitive dissonance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How the hell has Trump strengthened NATO?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s getting European countries who have been slacking on defense to pay their fair share. A strong NATO deters Russia. Why am I having to explain this, this is basic knowledge and the whole reason Trump did the NATO briefing before visiting Putin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama was briefed on a counter intelligence operation, yeah. Because the fuckin president usually gets told about it when someone running for office has surrounded himself with Russian agents. </p>

<p>No ones guys personal opinion isnt proof of anything. Especially when the IG report said it didnt effect the investigation. </p>

<p>If Trump wanted our european allies to be strong then maybe he shouldn&#39;t constantly talk shit about all of them on twitter. </p>
