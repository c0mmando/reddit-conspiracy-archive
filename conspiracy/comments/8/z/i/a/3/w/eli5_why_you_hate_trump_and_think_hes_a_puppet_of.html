    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re both puppets of Netanyahu and Rothschilds. The left-wing press just attacks them so much because it&#39;s negative reinforcement. The more they get attacked, the more people get defensive towards them. The reality is that the same puppet masters own both sides of the political spectrum, and that is why I think it&#39;s too late for a political solution to save humanity. They same people that criticize the Ted Turners of this world parrot Murdoch mouthpieces, but CNN and Fox are both a joke. CNN is just more blatant with it&#39;s skullduggery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny.</p>

<p>Listen, communism sucks. On that we can agree. It&#39;s a very destructive force in the world, but Russia is no longer ruled by communists, nor will they be in the foreseeable future. Putin may have been a member of the Communist Party, but he&#39;s certainly not one today. He&#39;s an oligarch and a capitalist one at that.</p>

<p>Anyway, none of this proves Trump is Putin&#39;s puppet. Still looking for proof rather than ad hominem attacks on the &quot;commies&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have a read of the fucking national anthem of the United Kingdom. It strongly implies that they are ruled by a monarchy without so much as a mention of parliament. It also implies that monotheism is woven into the fabric of the nation itself, and that the monarch rules by Mandate of Heaven.</p>

<p>Does this make the UK a monarchy? No. Using the Soviet Union&#39;s national anthem doesn&#39;t make Russia communist either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll play devils advocate and give it a go from one perspective. Putin wants to ensure that Russia continues to produce and distribute two things. Oil and weapons. For oil drilling, Putin perhaps asked for Rex Tillerson to be made sec. of state so that the sanctions could have been lifted and Exxon could begin drilling in Siberia. Same thing could be seen for the pipeline deals. During the later Obama years, Ukraine became a battlefront over pipeline access to Europe between two of the top three oil producers on earth. Under Trump though it might have been made easier to access European markets. At least that was the hope. And as for weapons, again the US and Russia are two of the leaders for sales - I believe the top two. If we look to Syria, recently with the bombing after the alleged chemical attack, the US (and her allies) provided the firepower and Russia provided the air defense systems. Both sides got to test their systems in real life situations and then use the  publicity from the media to sell either offensive or defensive weapons. Now, none of these cases truly prove  that Trump is in Putin&#39;s pocket (as both seem to benefit from each other&#39;s success) but I would say the increased weapons and oil production for Russia may indicate that Putin does have sway over Trump. </p>

<p>Well, okay, but Tillerson is gone and we imposed <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/06/united-states-imposes-new-sanctions-russia/490814002/">new sanctions in April</a></p>

<p>Nice try, but no cigar. Sway from a geopolitical standpoint is not evidence of being a &quot;puppet&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure he was irate. In fact, he even said today that he was hoping for Trump to win. But then, he said the same thing about Obama over Romney.</p>

<p>Problem with this is that Wikileaks (actually Assange who&#39;s been coincidentally silenced recently) stated categorically that it wasn&#39;t Russia or any state who gave them the material. He wouldn&#39;t say this unless it could be proven, which it will in my opinion.</p>

<p>Admittedly, Trump was inexperienced politically, but there&#39;s no proof he had help from Russia. The voters from Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, etc. (which gave him the electoral victory) certainly weren&#39;t hacked, swayed, or influenced by Russians. Ask them, they&#39;ll tell you.</p>

<p>In fact, the indictment of the Internet Research Agency (Russian troll farm) was a joke. And when one of the entities accused in the indictment (Concord Management) showed up to defend itself in court, Mueller and co. asked for a delay because they weren&#39;t prepared to back it up with evidence. The judge denied it. They eventually gave over a slew of so-called Russian social media posts, but admitted they didn&#39;t have an English translation for them! </p>

<p>Wut?</p>

<p>As for the most recent indictment of the 12 Russians, I suggest reading <a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/indictment-of-12-russians-under-the-shiny-wrapping-a-political-act/">this article from Truthdig</a>. </p>

<p>If the establishment, which uniformly despises Trump, had any hard, concrete evidence, they&#39;d have shown it by now. Instead, all we get are accusations and empty rhetoric that he&#39;s a bad person, that he&#39;s Putin&#39;s bitch, shoddy or half-baked indictments (many of which have nothing to do with collusion), etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s getting tedious at this point, but it&#39;s still interesting to hear people&#39;s point of view. Unfortunately, it&#39;s just speculation based on MSM propaganda.  </p>

At least there will be records of dissenting voices (away from state propaganda) when the dust settles in a couple of years. Keep up the good fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! Yeah, the main problem is our media has devolved into these echo chambers, on both sides. So much so, it&#39;s hard to determine what&#39;s true and what&#39;s false. </p>

<p>It takes work and dialogue to get to the bottom of things, and it appears our dear leaders (and their sycophants) don&#39;t want that. </p>

<p>BTW, we have a podcast that discusses conspiracy, the paranormal, and politics from a conspiracy angle. If you have time, check it out:

<p>All the best, and thanks for engaging in the dialogue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy.  Russia has its own deep state of NWO globalists who were put in place after the fall of the Soviet Union and before Putin became President.  The Clintons had a lot to do with this.  </p>

<p>When Hillary was Secretary of State, she was involved in the Uranium One deal, and it netted her and her conspirators at least $140M.  Putin is aware of this and is smart enough to use it as blackmail. This would be very useful if Hillary was President. Putin would essentially control her.  </p>

<p>Now to the 2016 election.  Trump is running on a platform of &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;.  Why would Putin want to make America great again?  Why would the Russian NWO globalist deep state want to make America great again?  They wouldn&#39;t.  That is why they gave money to the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary campaign.  </p>

<p>Hillary lost, but she has all of this money that was given to her on the pretext that she would win and be able to &quot;earn&quot; that money through favors.  Now she has to give it all back, so they do and they wind down the Clinton Foundation.  The money was given back to the Saudis, the Russians, and who knows who else.  </p>

<p>The problem doesn&#39;t end there, though, because now Trump is President and he has everything.  Military Intelligence gave it to him.  What to do?  It is the &quot;accuse your enemy of what you have done&quot; trick.  </p>

<p>Putin went from thinking he would be dealing with a U.S. President who would sell out her own country, to dealing with President Trump who will never sell out his own country.  </p>

<p>Putin would never sell out Russia, so Putin respects people who would not sell out their own countries.  This is why Trump and Putin will get along.  That, and they both hate the NWO globalists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t even have to involve Russia to hate Trump. I can assume the Russian debacle is all nonsense and still despise him. That being said, based on his oppressive Russia-like domestic policy, I would not be surprised if Trump is fond enough of Putin to collude with him.</p>

<p>His appointing of Jeff Sessions as attorney general directly escalates the War on Drugs, which is contradictory to the constitution and is purely a vehicle for private prison industry and police unions to profit.</p>

<p>The “press is the enemy of our people” would be fine, if he wasn’t citing a propaganda machine in Fox News as what “real news” looks like. Unlike past presidents, zero effort at bipartisanship. Putin does the same in calling anything but state sponsored media propaganda.</p>

<p>Trump is empowering al-Qaeda in Syria. By forging a de facto alliance with Russia and Iran to defeat the Islamic State, Trump is driving Sunni Arabs into the waiting arms of al-Qaeda — which is preparing to replace the Islamic State and is much more dangerous.</p>

<p>He stood by Roy Moore. His endorsement of an alleged sex predator was morally indefensible and sent a message to women everywhere that Republicans do not believe that credible allegations of a grown man molesting teenage girls are disqualifying. And that message has been received. Polls show a significant increase in the percentage of women who favor Democrats over Republicans in 2018.</p>

<p>As far as the Russia stuff, it would just be another reason to consider him a pathetic sack of garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Yeah, I hate MSM, as they play a huge role in dividing the country. Unlike Trump and many of his supporters though, I consider Fox News - which has more viewers than any news network - to be part of this MSM.</p>

<p>I would have no issue with Trump calling out MSM if he didn&#39;t just cherry-pick the ones that give him favorable coverage. But calling Fox News real news and CNN fake news just continues to encourage tribalistic behavior, because we all know what he&#39;s really saying -- that the only &quot;real&quot; news is the one with a conservative tilt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s not a puppet of Putin.  EVEN IF collusion is proven, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s being blackmailed by Putin.  Despite the massive rhetoric shift, our current foreign policy is basically identical to Obama&#39;s.</p>

<p>Trump is two things.</p>

<p>1) A narcissist.  He&#39;s scared to know someone else helped him win.  He could have ended the &quot;russiagate&quot; story IMMEDIATELY by saying &quot;While no votes were changed, we take Russia&#39;s attacks on our democracy very seriously. We will start a bipartisan investigation into the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>The narrative would have been dead in the water.  MSM would have nowhere to run with it.</p>

<p>Instead we see a year and a half later him bringing up his electoral election numbers.  He won&#39;t concede the popular vote because it was all illegals that voted for Clinton.  He can&#39;t stand that anyone would think Russia helped him, because that would hurt his ego.  He is his own worst enemy.</p>

<p>2) A coward.  He boasts acting tough on all these other countries, but in every chance to meet with foreign leaders, he acts deferential.  Look at his body language yesterday.  Completely different than the man strutting up and down the stage during the debates with Clinton.  He&#39;s got what, 6 inches on Putin and acted small next to him.</p>

<p>He fires his staff over twitter.  He makes snarky comments about Jeff Sessions but can&#39;t actually tell him to leave.  Despite his TV show, he can&#39;t look another man in the face and tell him he&#39;s fired.  He can&#39;t sit for a tough interview.  He pretends to not hear questions he doesn&#39;t want to answer.  The man is a coward.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of financial tie-ups coming out between the GOP/Trump&#39;s campaign and Russia, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a pee tape or any shit like that out there.  Even if Trump is tied up in a lot of financial crimes with Russians, that&#39;s still not to the level where he would be some super spy for the Russian gov.  It&#39;s a dumb strawman meant to discredit any investigation into the GOP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reasons to dislike Trump:</p>

<p>Anti-environment.  My son will inherit this world from us.  I want to leave it in better condition then what I inherited.</p>

<p>At least as bad as Bill Clinton when it comes to women.  His comments about his daughters make me cringe.</p>

<p>Tax cuts for the rich.  Like everyone predicted all the elite did was buy more stocks.  This trickle down shit needs to stop.  </p>

<p>Repeal and replace for healthcare.  Our nations healthcare was fucked before the ACA.  It is still fucked after but at least not as badly.  Couldn&#39;t repeal it, much less replace it, so he&#39;s actively trying to kill it so it fails.  Healthcare should be a right in this nation, and we have only one side trying to actually do anything about it.</p>

<p>Twitter.  This guy acts like a troll non-stop.  I know that is funny to some people but that is not how the POTUS should act.  It is extremely embarrassing that my 9 year old niece has better grammar and manners than him.  This is the world fucking stage.  At least run your tweet by an intern to correct your grammar.</p>

<p>Extremely divisive.  I was hopeful when Trump took office that he&#39;d do a better job than Obama in bringing our two political parties together to actually work for us.  Instead he uses the word democrat like it is an insult and his cult lap it up and act like him.  Everything is the democrats fault.  Even the shit he created himself.  He is tearing this country apart because of this, and it is going to take a long long time to heal that.  </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t drain the swamp at all.  Again I was hopeful that maybe this guy, not being a real politician yet, might actually get some good reform when it comes to lobbying and his appointees.  Turns out he just offers waivers for lobbying and appoints some of the most scummy people in US history to various positions like Bolton.  If he appointed Cheney tomorrow for something I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.  Can add in nepotism to this as well. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t seem to have a clue about what he is talking about if forced to answer a question he is not prepared for.  Even when he is prepared he rambles on like an idiot.  Says really stupid stuff.  Johnson got reamed for not knowing what was up with Allepo, but Trump has said some of the most stupid shit that he makes Gary look like Neil Degrasse Tyson (when he isn&#39;t being a douche).  Thanks for your contributions to NATO Finland!</p>

<p>Constantly lying and making shit up.  Day one he starts lying about his inauguration crowd size.  Why do this?  How he had more electoral votes than anyone.  Oh he&#39;s actually at the bottom of that.  Over and over again.  How anyone can take this guys word for anything is beyond me.  He lies about the most easy to check things.</p>

<p>Extreme hypocrisy.  Constantly railed on Obama for golfing.  Constantly out golfing.  So many more examples of hypocrisy that it is daunting to attempt to list them out.  Says he&#39;d never have time to leave the WH, constantly going to his resort.  Calls everything negative fake news, but quotes Fox news constantly like gospel.  America First!...has products still being made in China and hires foreign seasonal workers.</p>

<p>A static wall is going to do very little in curbing illegal immigration (and almost zero for drug trafficking), and I am sick of the argument that because people oppose the wall they must want open borders.  Fuck that argument.  I can oppose the wall but want better border security at the same time.  Mexico is paying for it so I guess that is ok...oh wait...my tax dollars are paying for it.</p>
