       I'm not a Republican, but it's absolutely disgraceful the way balance has been lost in representation on this site. Are reddit really saying not a single person has posted to r/worldnews or r/politics about this, without enough attention to get to the top 100?

       Well, let me put it like this as your bias is clouding your judgement. If, for example, Obama or Trudeau had brokered a meeting with Kim Jong Un, reddit would be creaming it's jim-jams. Yet, as it's Trump, even though the world's entire media is praising the effort, it barely registers on here.

       Well considering reddit is a heavily left leaning website of course it’s not going to get the type of attention that you want. I do not so easily put my trust/faith in those in power because they obviously don’t care and will never  know what it’s like to live as we do. You assume I am against trump because i like obama? What sub are we in at the moment? fuck both of them.

       You have no idea what you're talking about. The Kims have been trying to meet with a US president since the 90s. Other presidents wouldn't do so without preconditions.

       He's a belligerant bellicose tyrant and sitting him down with the ptesident legitimizes him.

      <p>
       I hope something good comes out of this, but only time will tell. The communique they are signing was agreed on before the meeting, so the two of them sitting down is just for show. When they release the details of the agreement we will have something to discuss. In the meantime, it's all just kneejerk speculation.

       THANK YOU. I'm so frustrated with the attitude that some sort of diplomatic skill on Trump's part is why this meeting is happening. It was nothing to get Kim to the debate table, he and his father have always wanted to sit down with the US president. Trump's just the first one who said yes. That's it. Hopefully something good comes out of this, but acting as though this is a win for Trump for simply meeting with Kim is disingenuous.

        Ajit Pai is actually a family friend of mine. He's a pretty nice guy once you get to know him, so he doesn't quite fit the sub IMO. However, I understand most redditors are too poor to afford a little price hike on their internet so I'll leave this up out of respect.

       First, its  literally on front page of at least eight subs. And the meeting just started and we don’t know anything about how successful it was. Nor will we really know what “truly” was communicated between either Un or Trump because it’s closed to the press... Spare us your faux anger, snowflake.

       Because this subreddit isn't a satellite community of your echo chamber, fuck stick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing has even happened to suggest a conspiracy. They're at a fucking meeting. No one's talking about it on the conspiracy because there's no evidence of a conspiracy. If you want to circle jerk about Trump then leave it on your sad excuse of a community.
      </p>
      <p>
       So tired of you morons trying to make this place a second community for your corrupt ass hero. Just because we all know Clinton is a shit stain doesn't mean Trump, who ran as a publicity stunt and had no intention of actually winning until he realized it was actually possible, who couldn't give two shits about you, who isn't even a god damned conservative, who has absolutely no idea what he's doing isn't clearly just winging the damn thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're more than welcome to like Trump but stop making shit posts without a hint of irony just because you don't feel comfortable unless everyone around you is choking on his dick.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't have to collude with Russia to be a scam artist and I have yet to see anything convincing of the accusations, for what it's worth. Figured I'd get ahead of that before you go on an autistic bitch fit over any narrative that isn't directly aligned with NYP or no-name Twitter troll sources.

       If it isn't negative about Trump it isn't newsworthy essentially. The narrative is Trump can't be successful he has to be a failure according to MSM and the elite. If he became successful or was proven to be a success in any way by any main stream source I am sure the responsible party would be suicided.

       I can find even more articles like these from other MSM sources in like 5 seconds. But I thought they weren't covering it? For the Narrative? Shit most of the articles even describe the talks as being historic. According to you I woulda thought they couldn't, or wouldn't, say anything positive

       MSM creates a whole swath of problems. Making the president of most powerful country to exist some little victim is not one of them

       it's fucking all over the news. no conspiracy. Trump is working with China/Russia alliance. That's what's somewhat allowing the NK/SK peace treaty, but they have to flesh out the details re:nuclearisation (NK isn't going to denuclearise. US won't move navies out of their territory. It'll be a brittle alliance at first but my hope is that they will get used to it and there will be some semblance of peace.)
