       Silly title I know, but follow me hear, there's a lesson to be learned...
      </p>
      <p>
       So for going on three years now, I have been working for a well known independent wrestling orginization (essentially the minor leagues) doing their video editing. I won't reveal the name in effort to hide my identity, but the only clue I'll give is I am currently working on footage from this past saturdays show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, onto how this all relates to conspiracy stuff. Well, it all falls on selective editing, or manipulating footage to get teh emotional reaction you are looking for. Fan or not, it's pretty well known that pro wrestling is heavily storyline based, there's good guys, and bad guys, and tweeners. One issue every company has, including WWE, is maintaining the popularity of the good guys, while keeping the heat on the bad guys. Very often a bad guy becomes so good at portraying his character that the fans start to support them. They'll cheer your villain, and boo your stories hero, and now  your left with footage that gives off the opposite emotion of what you had intended. That's where I come in. Very often I have to manipulate the footage to put out a final result that tells the story we wanted it to. That means cutting out crowd reactions, or replacing it with boos from a seperate segment, cutting out the lines that made the bad guys get cheered, or editing out the parts that make the good guy look weak. This is something that WWE has been known to do frequently. Antoher outlet I have noticed using similar techniques...MSM news outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a video editor it has become impossible to watch anything without noticing the editing within it, it makes it difficult to actually enjoy the story sometimes. I give major credit to a show that can actually grasp my attention to the story and not the editing (Game of Thrones is an example of one that keeps me in viewer mode more often than not) But when I am watching the news, I am in full editors mind set. Every video clip shown, every opinion room an average Joe,  every breaking story explained has me asking a long list of questions. "Why did you start the clip there and not earlier" "why did you cut out sentences from what this person was saying?" "Why did avoid showing certain material relating to the story." It all goes back to what my goal is in editing wrestling. Make your heroes look strong, and your villains look evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few examples of this from recent events. There's a Project Veritas video (often criticized for using the same editing techniques I'm reffering to) about CNN. Within it they show a segment on voter fraud, and ask a pannel of average people about their opinions on it. When they ask the right wing voter his opinion of it, he gives some nonsensical, all over the place response, which capped off with the line "it's all over the place, just look on the internet." At first glance you would think this guy was a nut job, but the Project Veritas video goes on to show the leaked raw/un-edited audio from that interview. In the audio, the guys full response is actually coherent, he mentions that he was a poll worker, and when he says check the internet, he lists specific sources to do more research on the topic. All of that was cut from the interview, and each clip creates 2 very different "characters" of the same person. Another example was the whole Trump Koy Pond thing, where the internet blasted him for dumping an entire cup of fish food into a Koy Pond, but shortly after, the full video was released which actually showed the Japanese Prime Minister doing the exact same thing seconds before, and Trump followed suit. (allow me to just clear the air, I am not a Trump supporter, didn't vote for him, but I don't jump blindly into this Trump hate without research)
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment that really opened my eyes for me, was the Democratic Convention's second day, after the massive Bernie Walk Out. There were reports and photos coming in of empty seats, paid seat fillers and plants, as well as use of camera angles, sound manipulation, crowd placement to create the illusion of a packed house. These are all things that WWE is known to do, and that I have had to work with my self. To the average viewer, this stuff is unknown, and they may never even think of any of these things when viewing the news, taking in the information they're being fed without question. Their hero looks strong, their enemy looks evil, and they continue about their day.

       Agree 100%! I notice this in local media a lot. When they interview people it can be obvious that they're just clipping together whatever makes the story fit the agenda being pushed.

       Your post reminds me of this Netflix series, "the power of myth" and the importance of heroes in our society and our psychology. It reveals how telling a story is so like a drug that it can shape a generation - star wars, harry potter etc - people model themselves after their personal heroes.

       I wish I would have saved it but the one that really opened my eyes was when Trump went to China and said that you've been taking advantage of us for too long, but I don't blame you, but this ends now.  I watched the whole speech live, unedited, but I'm paraphrasing of course.  When I watched Rachel Maddow that day, they played a completely false narrative of what Trump had said.  Like blatantly false and edited.  Before that I thought that maybe that only happened in the movies, surely someone would call them out on it right?  Nothing.
       <br/>
       Don't get me wrong, I know politicians lie, and the media lies, but wow that example was so completely unashamed in its blatant distortion of the facts.   Crazy.  How can they do this?  Because nobody watches the entire speech.  Because people only read headlines, and take those headlines as the truth without even reading the article.

       I had a similar experience with the Special Olympics. I have a friend that participates, and watched the Special Olympians who were envited to the White House chat with Trump. The whole thing was very friendly and everyone looked like they were having fun, he thanked them for representing the US, expressed pride, exactly the sort of thing you’d expect for this sort of White House PR visit. Nothing remarkable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afterwards, there was this huge news story about how Trump had told Special Olympians that they were “hard to watch”, clearly implying that Trump was so repulsed by disabled people that he said that to a Special Olympian during a White House visit. Having seen the whole thing, I was confused. Did this happen before/after the broadcast part? No. Turns out a clip had been edited where Trump was politely
       <em>
        apologizing
       </em>
       to the athletes for not being able to watch every event because of his busy schedule. Which, in itself, is a complete nothing. If the few seconds before and after the clip were played, this would be clear. Instead, the news decided to erroneously report that Trump insulted Special Olympic athletes at the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this frustrating not just because of the manufactured story line, but because it is what captures the attention of people. They waste so much valuable energy hating something that didn’t happen, they they have no energy or mental space for real things that are happening...potential changes to the Affordable Care Act that allow denial based on pre-existing conditions, China making serious moves to become the new world standard currency issuer, the erosion of the Second Ammendment (not just a problem for gun rights, but for setting precedent to destroy the Bill of Rights without the Constitutional amendment process), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What a frustrating time to be in. Truly, propoganda now is at least as bad as any dictatorship in the past. Perhaps worse, because this garbage is pumped into every aspect of our daily digital lives, and we still so stongly want to believe in journalistic integrity that we absorb it willingly or no.

       Back when I was in uni we were shown a really interesting video on editing in one of our classes. In the video they played 2 different 'on the street' interview sections each with the same 2 people. However their comments seemed to contradict themselves in the 2 interview sections and show support for differing sides (in this case is was Tory vs Labour, the age old political struggle in the UK).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we were shown the full interview response each person gave, and they showed how they edited and cut the response in order to support the given side, it was fascinating stuff.

       This. I work in audio editing, both for film and music, and it’s the first thing I pay attention to. I almost always notice things like dialogue and sound effects that were redone or edited in post. Before I got into the field that stuff never crossed my mind, but now it’s distracting to notice that the audio for a coat billowing in the wind doesn’t actually line up with the way the coat on screen is billowing. I don’t work in tv, so I don’t have that specific kind of editing awareness, but damn did op hit the nail on the head. Once you know how to do something, it becomes a lot easier to recognize it.

       As an editor, I can't ever stop seeing the editing. It changes everything. As silly as it sounds, I can't even watch porn without thinking about the editing lol. When you see videos through that lens it changes everything, but I find that most people don't actually understand what editing is, and since editors try and make our cuts invisible most of the time, it's hard to observe. This is why most of the Oscar wins for best editor are the same as best director (they started changing that in recent years) it's because even the Academy can barely tell the difference between good editing and good directing.

       I know this isn't the same, but I've been making little videos for a while now using Sony Vegas, started out in 2009, I'm not 'professional' and I don't have qualifications but I like to say I've gotten pretty good at it. I too have started to notice everything, and it feels more and more blatant the more I watch. For example, I was watching a programme with my girlfriend (her pick) - I think it was something like 'Dinner Date' which is a UK program where people... go on a date. Well basically at the end of the show you're following someone at their shop, they own it, and it closes with them leaving their shop and locking the door to the shop, whilst the camera man is inside the shop staring at them with the camera, recording... which means obviously, that he's going to have to unlock the door again to let the camera man out, unless he plans to stay there all night. I brought this up to my girlfriend and she was like "how did you even get that thought" - so I guess to us people that are used to chopping clips/editing, we can see it and the average person can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: noticing stuff too, an example: camera man stood in shop whilst shop owner locked door to shop, camera man obviously has to be let out of said shop, camera tricks that the average person won't think about.

       Ive took part in a reality tv show and the main thing that got me was how its all just about repeating stuff, the camera guys see you doing something or talking about something and theyll tell you to do it again for camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we did the actual show the routine which lasted about 5 minutes max took at least 3 hours to film as it was repeated over and over. Once to get a wide shot, cameras are repositioned to capture individuals and we do it again, cameras are repositioned to capture audience reaction and we do it again etc etc.

       The people they want to build storys about are identified very early on in the audition process and followed through the whole show, constantly asked for interviews etc while everyone else is just background. If you dont play up to your role they quickly move on to someone who will, some people are cut out of the final cut entirely, they dont care if your story is real or fake either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those shots where its a group of people talking are all set up and probably took half an hour to arrange yet it looks like conversation spontaneously captured when its on screen, the woman in your example would have been told we want a shot of you locking the door. She will have turned round as soon as they were done filming, opened the door and gone back to work or whatever. I will say though that when they are 'revealing' news to someone ARE genuine like telling someone if they passed or whatever, it looks fake as they just happen to have a camera and their whole family in the house but they dont actually know the news yet. Or people getting told they are selected from the show and get a shock visit from the presenter are just told a producer is coming round or something.

       Yep. Going behind the curtain really spoils the illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have worked in the visual arts and industry for thirty years, from high profile advertising as a photographer in the 80s, through writing for magazines, then theatre, then broadcast radio, then TV as producer/director and editor, finally arriving back as a photojournalist and sole trader in commercial photography. Understanding the processes is a good way to spoil the illusion that the makers are trying to get across.
      </p>
      <p>
       By far the most honest of the mediums I have worked in is theatre and broadcast radio (I was part of the script team and assistant director on a radio sitcom) because no-one was under any illusion that it wasn't a fiction. The commercial work I do these days is very niche and demands zero retouching beyond lens, white-balance and dust-bunny corrections, so it's a pretty honest form of advertising photography.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporate news outlets are tricky beasts, which is why I will sell them my images and I will buy their output, but only when my work is in it (for my tearsheet collection).

       Great post.

       The DNC convention was clearly rigged in favour of Hillary, and the coverage was blatantly edited not show things like this:

      <p>
       Lies of omission, and selective editing is how the news networks can paint whatever picture they want, whilst claiming their coverage is accurate and objective. The BBC is the master this.

       I guess it can be said TV editing colors our world falsely.  The CIAstream media's editing has us believing that our country, the USA, is the world's hero while other countries the CIA dislikes are the world's super-villains: countries like Nicaragua, Syria, Yemen, Iran, Bolivia, Cuba, Venezuela, Vietnam, China, Russia, Angola -- in other words, countries trying to maintain their freedom and independence in the face of the CIA's onslaught to subjugate them.

       agreed.   HRC campaign rallies vs Bernie rallies... MSM NEVER showed a Bernie Rally.. we saw it on internet only 30k plus crowds.... MSM DID show HRC rallies and had to push in tight crop to make it appear as if there were more fans than there ever was huge empty stadiums/HS basketball courts with only 300 people but cropped to appear a full house... all fake.

       And Trump knows their tricks, that is exactly why at all his events he would berate them and tell them to turn the cameras around and show the audience. Because they were deliberately trying to make it seem he had no support.

       Joke from one video editor to another:
Q: how many video editors does it take to change a lightbulb?
A: why do you want to change it?
Kind of on topic, I used to edit a reality dating show that took place on a cruise ship. Narrative was always the same. Act 1: will they hookup? Act 2: look at this crazy stuff they do together but they’re realizing this blind date is not working out. Act 3: they go their separate ways. Problem was they almost always hated each other from the get go and as editors we had to tell a different story. Good luck. PS. Work in news now and I’ve graduated from propaganda to psychological warfare.

       Great post and good points. But the fakery in media goes way,
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       beyond selective editing. For example, these two videos on 9/11 fakery:

       Reminds me of a clip posted on r/squaredcircle. Roman copped a beat down and I think Jericho won the match and the camera panned to the crowd and a guy was mega happy! the fan was filmed later that night with a really sour reaction to a decision and that was used the following week in an edited video package as the reaction to Roman losing, and not to Jericho winning as originally aired. Excellent comparison.

       Hi, great read thanks. I have come to the opinion (right or wrong) that everything has an agenda behind it. It's crap because as you say you can enjoy any news/info without trying to find he motive. And Im no video editor just a concerned citizen with a brain.

       It is totally normal because truth depends on where you live, what you have been told by your family, friends.
       <br/>
       There is no real truth.
       <br/>
       Like the world you know it is just YOUR PERCEPTION, the illusion of YOUR mind.
       <br/>
       It is like hallucination that YOUR mind creates for you when it receives some sensory input and processes it through YOUR brain connections.

       After 9/11, they did the same when interviewing people about tightening security, which lead to the patriot act. They kept interviewing people until they got one or two soccer moms saying that they'd give up some of their freedoms "if it mafe us safer", even though the majority of people asked said they would be strongly opposed. It's one thing for entertainment to be edited to be more...well, entertaining; it's an entirely different thing when the real world is edited to control the minds of the people to brainwash them. This is the exact sort of techniques the KGB used with expertise for decades.

       Never been a huge wrestling fan, but I have friends who are. About 10 years ago, we went to taping at our city arena. The main event was a steel cage match between the Undertaker and someone I forget. The storyline called for them to drop and hit the ground at the same time, leading to a technical tie.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wrestlers mistimed it, and  the Undertaker hit the ground a good second before the other guy, but they played it off like it happened at the same time. The stadium erupted in boos when they said that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later that week, we watch it on TV. They only show a split-screen video replay which shows them hitting the ground at the same time (but you can see in the background the other guy is still 3 feet off the ground when Undertaker hits.) You don't hear any of the crowd boos. If you didn't know what to look for, or weren't paying close attention, you'd have no idea there was any controversy.

       I don't have the links to it, but about the same time, I made a comment about how editing can be used to basically change the story.  And I specifically mentioned stretching out a response to make the person being questioned seem less competent. I mentioned you could also compress the conversation to make it appear confrontational, when it was not.

       Sure enough, the Katie Couric gun documentary came out and they did EXACTLY what I suggested was possible.  During a question, they showed b-roll of the audience sitting for 9 awkward seconds of silence, and then cut to the actual answer.

       I'm a film/tv editor in Hollywood. I edited reality TV for almost three years. Can confirm everything OP says, people would be terrified at the power video editor and segment producers have. Outside of simple little stories it's very easy to see, from the editors chair, how these skills could be used to manipulate the masses. The line between documentary and propoganda is growing fuzzier and fuzzier every day.

       Great post. I like how you mention you don't support Trump, but you aren't going to hate him based off of the slant of every media outlet. Another great example of this is the Daily show with Trevor Noah. They had a segment about female soccer and male soccer. The whole point was, the females get paid dramatically less than the males, which is true, however the angle they took was completely one sided, and didn't mention any of the opposing points. They had Gavin Mccines on, and he was explaining the fact that male soccer has been around a lot longer, and has generated a lot more revenue, throughout it's existence, than female soccer. I watched the whole interview, then the "edited" interview. He was joking around with the interviewer by calling out a bunch of fake over the top stupid names of former soccer players, indicating that he knows nothing about the sports history. They then spun that part to make him look like he was serious, and very ignorant. I cannot stand that show, but I guess I understand why they do shit like that.

       Its actually a bit embarrassing that it took editing a bunch of czw shows for you to come to this realization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean presuming you have any knowledge of editing (i know big presumption, czw isnt the classiest promotion), you'd know you can do anything.

       Cut here and the scene gets a laugh, cut there its awkward, cut over there its emotional.

       Really wonderful post, and what we need more of here and now. Let’s not tell people WHAT to think, rather teach them HOW to think. I have noticed the scripts and editing and “adhering to the storyline” to great extent myself and now with your perspective in mind I know I’ll see it even more. Thanks for sharing.

       Kind of like its not the vote that counts, its who counts the votes, but in this case its who edits the footage.  The editor holds ALL the power to control the narrative.  Where have I seen that before? Ah, the MSM.

       Wresting is still far more real than most news.   They are Baby Faces, Heels &amp; Jobbers or Jabronis.  These men get hurt. They get worn out &amp; they know the score more than most ppl as they are well aware of the fact that THEY are the bread &amp; circus. Many wrestlers are heavy into conspiracies too.   It is very sad to think many dont see the blatent deception of the media &amp; most of what comes from the flickering lights of movies &amp; programs is programming. The word itself should tell people.  There was a good doc. about their beloved 60 minutes being highly deceptive. Cant even trust Mike Wallce, I guess. But unlike modern fake news, wrestling is for the ages. It spans all times &amp; cultures.  It will never die &amp; is more fun when you are there live, even if you know what the outcome will be - its at least labelled properly -  as entertainmemt. Unlike the fake news that promotes war, wrestlers let us release frustration through them.   I cant wait till more ppl see what youve seen &amp; Im grateful to see others care enough to bring it up. nice post, but wrestling is still tons of fun.

       Great post. Most people don't realize how easy it is to fabricate a story on TV. All you need are some theatrics and cameras. Edit it, play it on TV, have the news tell you it's real, and boom.

       I remember Hillary doing an interview with some technology group/mag.  It was a video interview and during it she complained that Democrats aren't making enough documentaries to smear their opponents.  She specifically referenced a bunch of Clinton-negative documentaries on Netflix.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward a year or two.  Netflix hires Obama and Lynch and suddenly there are a bunch of anti-trump documentaries.

       spot on post. as a fellow editor i have felt this exact same way. i can no longer watch politics or debates or evening the daily news without seeing the manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       to take it a step further, they use lighting, camera angles, colors etc to manipulate the viewers emotions. just like a film would. creepy shit really.

       With some work and editing, you could turn this post into an article that would be suitable for publication in a newspaper or magazine.  You would need a witty David Foster Wallace -esque title "On Wrestling and Politics: The Creation of Good Guys and Bad Guys through the lens of a video editor" (don't trash me on this, I just thought it up in two seconds).  It would be a public service.

       Ive been on reddit a long time (dont let my account age fool you).
      </p>
      <p>
       I frequently ask people how they know what they think they know.  I ask them to consider that the information they have been given that they have used to form their opinions could be incorrect and if it is incorrect, how would they know?
      </p>
      <p>
       People just refuse to consider the possibility that their beliefs are wrong and based on lies. This goes for Christians, Jews, Muslims, Mormons, Republicans, Democrats, Socialists, Communists, Capitalists.  All of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you know your beliefs, ideology, values are real or true?  They are not real. You cannot touch them, measure them, or quantify them in any significant way.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have these "myths" that we hold on to thinking they are real and right, but none of us can prove it.  We cannot prove something that does not physically exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can measure outcome comes of policies and ideas, but we will be using our values to judge whether or not those outcomes are good or bad.  Values are not real. They do not physically exist. They only exist in our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in an imagined world full of imagined rights and wrongs, goods and evils, happiness and sadness.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I ask you, reader: If your beliefs were wrong, how would you know?

       All of this is obvious. Neither party is good, but the leftists and their party(ies) have fully embraced open, transparent deceit, lies, and retelling of truths unlike anything we've ever seen. They tell lies without a hint of truth or reason about them and point at us like undeveloped and outdated anti-intellectuals when we scoff at it.

       I could be wrong but im guessing you have a very honorable ring OP. I spent 6 years as a worker see things in the way the MSM operates that
       <em>

       a lot of wrestling tropes. If he sticks to this agreement..i think Kim just pulled off a pretty significant face turn.

       Even though I agree with a lot of what he campaigned on, I can't let myself trust Trump on the grounds that this whole thing could be a work. The news even

       shitting on him daily to get a desired result from a desired demographic.

       I said it during his campaign and I'll stick with it: If the media truly wanted to stop Trump, all they'd have to do is endorse him and cover him positively.

       ABC news radio has been on an epic fit over Trump and it is I interesting hearing how their hourly segments change during the day. For example they made sure to get hot audio of the hundreds of child refugees marching up to their border and they say trump wants them to come in legally (if they are truly refugees) and this is why we need a better wall in that area. Flash forward an hour later and they retell the story with the same screaming babies and sobbing children noises and the trump part was changed to a sarcastic out of context "I hope they're good climbers!"

       Can confirm.  Once I got interested in CGI being passed as reality, it became clear that most advertisements make intense usage of CGI.  A silly but quick example being an ad for a milk cremer where when they show the product being poured into coffee, its literally entirely CGI (computational fluid dynamics.)  No reality at all, just mathematical equations (Navier Stokes.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the next one is this couple in their apartment filled with sand, trying to emulate a beach.  Except the sand is fake.  It's CGI with particle emulators for the sand.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dont care much, it actually comes off as nearly real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harmless?  No, because they are "fibrillating" (dont know why this word came to mind but it fits) our tie to real pictures/video ... our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to be able to decipher the real from the unreal in order to see the video fakery involved in a false flag such as 9/11.

       I had a similar experience with the Special Olympics. I have a friend that participates, and watched the Special Olympians who were envited to the White House chat with Trump. The whole thing was very friendly and everyone looked like they were having fun, he thanked them for representing the US, expressed pride, exactly the sort of thing you’d expect for this sort of White House PR visit. Nothing remarkable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afterwards, there was this huge news story about how Trump had told Special Olympians that they were “hard to watch”, clearly implying that Trump was so repulsed by disabled people that he said that to a Special Olympian during a White House visit. Having seen the whole thing, I was confused. Did this happen before/after the broadcast part? No. Turns out a clip had been edited where Trump was politely
       <em>
        apologizing
       </em>
       to the athletes for not being able to watch every event because of his busy schedule. Which, in itself, is a complete nothing. If the few seconds before and after the clip were played, this would be clear. Instead, the news decided to erroneously report that Trump insulted Special Olympic athletes at the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this frustrating not just because of the manufactured story line, but because it is what captures the attention of people. They waste so much valuable energy hating something that didn’t happen, they they have no energy or mental space for real things that are happening...potential changes to the Affordable Care Act that allow denial based on pre-existing conditions, China making serious moves to become the new world standard currency issuer, the erosion of the Second Ammendment (not just a problem for gun rights, but for setting precedent to destroy the Bill of Rights without the Constitutional amendment process), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What a frustrating time to be in. Truly, propoganda now is at least as bad as any dictatorship in the past. Perhaps worse, because this garbage is pumped into every aspect of our daily digital lives, and we still so stongly want to believe in journalistic integrity that we absorb it willingly or no.

       She's one of the misleaders for resisters to watch so they can think that they're informed now and don't have to do their own research and analysis. Controlled opposition.
