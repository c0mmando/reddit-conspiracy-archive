        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I realize this may not be the correct sub as maybe this is already a known open thing in Facebooks “Terms and agreements” but it was jarring and creepy. It felt like I caught a glimpse “behind the scenes” like Truman seeing himself on camera. Anyway it scared me so I just wanted to tell someone about it and see what others have to say on it.</p>

<p>But anyway this is what happened just 10 minutes ago: </p>

<p>I was just getting into bed and going to send a selfie pic to my boyfriend to say good night. I wasn’t liking the angles and spent maybe 5 minutes just looking at myself in the camera. Eventually I decided I would rather send a video of me doing a kiss to him so I held my finger down to capture video, blew a kiss and then stopped recording. The video played back to me before I would press send was not of my kiss but was multiple few second clips of me looking at myself in the phone over the last 5 minutes. Playing back out of order. I watched maybe 3 of them and then got scared and closed out the camera. I wonder what more would have played back had I let it run its course? </p>

<p>So I personally know definitively that FB is video recording me when I’m not recording. I think what I’m scared about is if this a known thing? Is this something facebook is denying? I knew Facebook was recording audio and I was fine with that as it makes sense in terms of personalized ads. But video seems strange. </p>

<p>It’s just scary to think a bit because maybe my phone is video recording me right now even? I actually feel like I’m being watched at the moment. Trying to shake it off with “even if I’m being watched it doesn’t matter” </p>

<p>I just wonder why they would be recording us? </p>

<p>It was like I accidentally tapped into a backlog of videos of me. Was quite strange. I so wish I had tried to save it! I got scared though (as I had just creeped myself out earlier that night reading on r/glitch_in_the_matrix and impulsively closed out of the app afraid of what I would see next!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird to me that people are just waking up to this. This has been going on for years and specifically why I never used the messenger or Facebook app on my phone. Stop using Facebook, Google, Amazon, Reddit and move to the woods and read a book.  You will probably never escape it unless you change your internet habits or completely unplug. Protect yourself better online.  Btw it is the wrong sub only because it is not conspiracy and fact. Read the terms of service and they flat out tell you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree with all you have said here. I think I’m shocked simply as I did not think they were taking video recording of me. And I wonder how it is worded in the terms of service and what makes me uncomfortable is that it is something they are discreet about even if the terms of service has some statement that you can extrapolate they are video recording you. </p>

<p>I don’t mind audio recording but I am now feeling a bit uneasy about the video recording. But still, not necessarily opposed to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All cameras should be covered when not in use, whether they be on PCs, laptops, tablets, or phones. A piece of tape works well as a semi-permanent blocker, but if you&#39;re worried about your tech looking janky with tape on it, you can actually buy little plastic shields that can slide open and closed. Try looking up &quot;camera cover&quot; or &quot;webcam cover&quot; anywhere that has tech accessories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it’s too late! I mean they don’t just have video of my face they have my breasts, my vagina, me watching porn and masturbating and pooping and going on political rants about things I would never post to Facebook. </p>

<p>I’m not too concerned though really. It’s only their being discrete about doing it that has me unsettled. Was so strange seeing the videos of myself.... my first thought was I was experiencing a glitch in the matrix 😁</p>
