<li><p>Q never claimed “Clinton and Podesta were arrested fleeing the country in a private plane.”</p></li>
<li><p>You seem to be able to navigate Q posts fairly well for someone that has already dismissed Q. </p></li>
<li><p>This was one of the first couple posts from Q.
So, you were on top of it from the beginning &amp; immediately abandoned ship? </p></li>
<li><p>Does this dismiss the countless proofs Q has provided since then?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>IMO, the post you are referring to was done by Q for 2 reasons:</p>

<p>a.  Get the autists attention.</p>

<p>b. By providing an inaccurate “claim” from the beginning, Q proved he was NOT a LARP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not OP but I&#39;ll try.  I&#39;m not going to reply to all your points, just the more &quot;fun&quot; ones.</p>

<p>1) What do the words &quot;Hillary Clinton will be arrested between 7:45 AM - 8:30 AM EST on Monday&quot; and &quot;HRC detained&quot; mean? </p>

<p>3) You act like it was hard to look at the first few posts and dismiss all of it as BS.</p>

<p>4) Can you cite specific examples?</p>

<p>b) (By far my favorite) So, Q is wrong from the beginning, but instead of claiming it&#39;s a LARP, you double down and say that being wrong proves he was NOT a LARP.  How exactly does that work?</p>

<li> “I stopped following Q when they claimed Clinton and Podesta were arrested fleeing the country in a private plane.”</li>
</ol>

<p>You can be detained and NOT arrested, right?
Where do you see Podesta, plane &amp; fleeing the country? 
Would that mean the statement is inaccurate? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fair point. </p></li>
<li><p>Not hard.  Unlikely.

You’re a grown a$$ adult.

<p>a.  No counter?
Good point, right?</p>

<p>b.  In conjunction with point a, it would make sense. </p>

<p>It’s my opinion. 
You are free to have your own. </p>

Your link to the Q post is categorized by a specific search.

<ol>
<li><p>Q never claimed “Clinton and Podesta were arrested fleeing the country in a private plane.”</p></li>
<li><p>You seem to be able to navigate Q posts fairly well for someone that has already dismissed Q. </p></li>
<li><p>This was one of the first couple posts from Q.
So, you were on top of it from the beginning &amp; immediately abandoned ship? </p></li>
<li><p>Does this dismiss the countless proofs Q has provided since then?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>IMO, the post you are referring to was done by Q for 2 reasons:</p>

<p>a.  Get the autists attention.</p>

<p>b. By providing an inaccurate “claim” from the beginning, Q proved he was NOT a LARP. </p>
