<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, <strong>Starbucks</strong> has always been like, 1/3 of the coffee shops in this city. But I think they&#39;ve been around long enough that they&#39;re starting to have their end game come to fruition. </p>

<pre><code>                   So you know how they made up all their own names for sizes and drinks right? Well people who start making a Starbucks their usual coffee shop are basically incapable of ordering coffee like a normal person. Once you start going to one, you forget the words &#39;small&#39;, &#39; ~~medium~~ &#39;, and &#39;large&#39;, and for some reason you get horrifically offended if a barista doesn&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. If you try and order a &#39;double flat tall white&#39; and the barista doesn&#39;t know what the fuck you&#39;re talking about a normal person would just explain right? Or admit that they are a manchild who doesn&#39;t know what he orders and just copied someone else one time and never changed it right?                               But no.            
        Because **starbucks** has broken people&#39;s minds, it mAkes any interaction with a real coffee shop nearly impossible, trapping them in *s t a r b u c k s ,,*
</code></pre>

<p>normal bean water people can go to any shop, but once you start with   ((( <strong>starbucks</strong> )))</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>               you can&#39;t stop  !!

<p>This is a classic international banker trick, creating a monopoly through mental manipulation and communist government tricks</p>

<p>I get your point and agree starbucks does it to train people to order from them. </p>

<p>I was in NYC once and I sleepily ordered a large coffee just cream and a shot of espresso. The guy behind the counter was not amused. He said &quot;You mean a red eye?&quot; I was like sure that whatever. </p>

<p>Every small coffee place I went to in NY was like that. </p>

<p>I went home to our local hipster coffee shop and the guy behind the counter was like &quot;WTF is a red eye?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I also used to be a barista at a couple of local coffee shops and had the same problem. It&#39;s frustrating when you&#39;re just trying to do your job and other people look at you like you&#39;re the one that is crazy. </p>

<p>I think OP&#39;s point is that if you can control the language you can control thinking. It starts small with stupid stuff like coffee lingo and soon it&#39;s much bigger social issues. Especially when, speaking from experience, people are super proud of themselves for knowing the &quot;uniform lingo&quot; and instead of thinking they are the ones making no sense they think you&#39;re the stupid one for not being in the know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to Italy recently. You can get a cappuccino there for like 1 Euro, it tastes great. Nobody gets these dumb flavored drinks with a million calories for six bucks either, because their coffee is way better than the garbage we have here. Starbucks started this horrible trend</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s so sad. Espresso is so rich, thick, and no need for sugar! I remember going to a Starbucks (had a gift card, I don&#39;t go ever with my own money) and it&#39;s the morning. I saw a group of middle age women ordered big size of that unicorn drink. It&#39;s like do they realize that&#39;s a milkshake. Of course they all took pictures of it. </p>

<p>I hope to get to Italy next year, looking forward to their coffee experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our entire culture is manufactured by corporations and part of that is controlling/limiting the use of language. Anyone interested in these ideas should read 1984, especially the appendix on the topic of the language of newspeak. It&#39;s incredibly prescient with the way they describe language being artificially changed to limit the worldviews of the users of that language. The idea is that political dissent becomes difficult or impossible if you lack the words to describe the act of dissent that the state wants to discourage. In this case, it sounds more like op is describing a corporate cult that encourages members to keep giving money to the corporation, but the idea is the same. Artificially limit the use of language to keep people locked in to oppressive social structures. </p>
