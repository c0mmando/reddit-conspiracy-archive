<p>Why is this industry allowed to thrive and not cut off at the borders or at least intercepted? Is it because of the fact that it is the 3rd most profitable criminally planned industry? With over $150 BILLION dollars a year?</p>

<p>&quot;Estimates of just how much the human trafficking business is worth have grown massively since the last ILO report on forced labor almost a decade ago. Back in 2005, the business was estimated at about $44 billion annually. Now, it&#39;s more like $150 billion.May 20, 2014&quot; and that was in 2014!</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/105360/inside-the-scarily-lucrative-business-model-of-human-trafficking/">http://time.com/105360/inside-the-scarily-lucrative-business-model-of-human-trafficking/</a></p>

<p>Here is a 1 minute video on the facts of human trafficking: <a href="https://youtu.be/IRaOSzIr_oQ">https://youtu.be/IRaOSzIr_oQ</a></p>

<p>For those of you not caught up on the situation, a suspected CARTEL trafficking break/rest point was found in Tucson, Arizona. A veterans care group called VOP (veterans on patrol) was tipped off to a potential trafficking camp. Blood stained restraints tied to trees were found, empty hair dye boxes were found, childs toys were found and more. Watch this 5 minute walk through of the original camp:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/k4dIjJwwjzE">https://youtu.be/k4dIjJwwjzE</a></p>

<p>Here is the latest big finding: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvBo09LpuDY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvBo09LpuDY</a></p>

<p>For further updates, most of the videos are on this YT channel:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyceYjjvA8CJ0JbEU5rswTw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyceYjjvA8CJ0JbEU5rswTw</a></p>

<p>Otherwise you can find them live streaming most days on their FB group page, just look for &quot;VOP Team Pulaski&quot; and it should pull it up.</p>

<p>They have hundreds of volunteers ranging from active duty military and law enforcement as well as federal agencies, to retired members and groups and importantly our veterans. More people are joining BY THE DAY.</p>

<p>There is a team coming down from Australia, Canada, and more. More states have people and patriots coming down.</p>

<p>THIS IS NOT AN ARMED STAND OFF.</p>

<p>THIS IS AGAINST CARTEL TRAFFICKING.</p>

<p>VOP has been around for 3+ years and has to date, RESCUED OVER 30 CHILDREN. They have visited THOUSANDS of homeless camps and know the difference between a homeless camp and a cartel trafficking/resting point. Watch the videos for yourself and decide. Don&#39;t let others or me tell you what to think, watch the videos (the first video is only 5 minutes) and THINK for yourself what it could be. Then compare it with the fact that the trafficking industry alone is worth $100+ billion and drugs and guns are also smuggled through these corridors.</p>

<p>We cannot bury our head in the sand on this. We need to continue this pressure and flush all these traffickers out and save any potential victims.</p>

<p>I will continue to post and update you all on this. If you have any questions or anything I will try to answer them, I have been mostly staying up on the situation as it develops. A lot more things are being found EVERY DAY. </p>

<p>Thank you and God bless us all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope that is the right skull.</p>

<p>Also, the original VOP member that found it, assumed it was an animal carcass as it was buried under brush, he kicked the bone with his foot to move it from the brush and was horrified to see it was a human skull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These were shared the other day. Seems the cartels use upside down white crosses to mark their trafficking routes.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/CcLWEyC.png">https://i.imgur.com/CcLWEyC.png</a></p>

<p>The original maps and books found at the first trafficking site (before it was bull dozed over, link below) are also being used to form a grid and they have been searching this massive desert area to find these hot spots that were marked on the maps they found at the original site. Also, the recent finding of the house, there were a ton of maps inside, as if being used by cartel members to plan routes. Even topographical maps. Here is the bulldozer proof video showing the original site has since been bull dozed over</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, with only one site and one upside-down cross, it&#39;s not really useful information. You could just as easily pick anything else around the site - a tree with unique branches, some specific rock, whatever - and claim that&#39;s a mark they use. You need more than one reference point to show the white cross is related.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even know about this. Thanks man. About the skull, news articles say it was an adult skull. So unfortunately, you have to put that into theory. Because unless an independent examiner checks the skull, we can&#39;t really know. It seems cover ups like this have happening for a LONG time and the government is possibly actively involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand, I just want people to be able to look at the comparisons themselves. I interjected my own opinion into the title, which is not always best IMO. </p>

<p>More markers are being found and I have atleast 6-7+ coordinates of where they found additional markers, but I did not want to post that. </p>

<p>Fortunately folly we got patriots on our side this time, we have teams coming from all over the world to come help investigate. We have active duty military, law enforcement, and even federal agencies helping volunteer on the ground. Atleast 200+ people at this point. This is not going to die anytime soon. Just the other day, a sherrif or a group (cant remember) held an evidence preservation class for everyone so everyone knows what to do when they come across more scenes. This is getting a lot of people stirred and mobile into action. It is time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All systems nominal here, boss. Every day is a learning experience, and anyone willing to write off this whole movement and 200+ volunteers over a wording mistake really would not have or be willing to listen to such a thing in the first place.</p>

<p>Anyone here can see my intentions, and see my heart in bringing awareness to this subject.</p>

<p>If someone wants to doubt or jump on one small mistake or something miniscule, then they did not have the intentions to be open to this in the first place. This event will either make people more ignorant and bury their head further, or it will awaken some new minds to these ideas... It is all up to the person if they are willing to make the leap or not. It really is not hard but some people really do not want to hear it and want to live in a bubble of safety away from things like this and that is perfectly okay too. But my mission first is awareness and I will do what it takes to keep sharing this.</p>

<p>There are many other gangs and in all honesty, cartel trafficking routes (drugs, woman, and guns) have stretched and reach into every corner of the United States. To the corner of Washington near the canadian border to the opposite end of the US even Florida and CA. There is so much money in this industry</p>

<p>Though I also would say these orgs do not realize who is truly running the show.</p>

<p>For example, Scientology has 10s of thousands of acolytes, I guarantee less than 10 maybe less than 5 individuals in this multi billion dollar organization know of their connection to an even more powerful group and those individuals are either the very highest leadership or trusted advisors whos names are never public.</p>

<p>The Same i am sure applys to MS-13</p>

<p>This gives the highest illuminati group camouflage as their actions come through dozens of unconnected groups so you cant put the pieces together and even if you lock down evidence on one group, 99&amp;#37; of that group doesnt even realize who they truly serve so they call you crazy and absolute WORST case scenario you truly pin some serious shit on them, they got dozens or hundreds of other groups and they sever all connection with the tainted group and move on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory that is the black nobility and the Catholic church because the black nobility sided with the pope at the time and thus both parties gained power. This was roughly 1,000 years ago? I also need to look into Egypt. Because in upper Egypt, theory is, they experienced famine and ate their children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite his boasting, Ankhtifi may not have be lying about people being reduced to eating their children to survive. Abdel-Latif Al-Baghdadi, a physician/scholar from Baghdad who was in Egypt between 1194 to 1200 AD, tells of people who habitually ate human flesh; parents even ate their own children. Graves were ransacked for food, assassinations and robbery reigned unchecked and noblewomen implored to be bought as slaves. These horrific scenes had been caused by a low Nile flood, two years running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What could have begun from simple desperation could have evolved over the millennia to become a cannibal cult. This is all just theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pope and Vatican is definetely connected, they are what PizzaGate should have focused on</p>

<p>Have you seen &quot;The Keepers&quot;</p>

<p>A priest was caught red handed raping his students at their private catholic school</p>

<p>The parents found out and went to the equivalent of the superintendent.</p>

<p>The Super said he would handle it</p>

<p>He handled it by placing the pedophile at another school where he was estimated to have raped over 150 children with the teachers being aware of what was occuring.</p>

<p>He would call teachers while class was in session and have them send whatever student he felt like seeing to his office.</p>

<p>He called his semen, the seed of the holy spirit or something like that.</p>

<p>The guy was never punished.</p>

<p>The Keepers goes further into other evidence but it is past the point of debate that the Church endorses and enables child molestation on a massive scale and possibly has for hundreds of years, think about how stigmatized victims already are, now think about how impossible it would have been to come forward before the internet, hell before the printing press.</p>

<p>Point being the Catholic Church has free reign to open churches everywhere on earth and not pay any kind of taxes and in fact be gifted free money for basically no reason other than their name and because they tell the sheep &quot;god will bless you if you give us your money, Sign up your credit card for automatic payments!&quot;</p>

<p>So we have a Religion with over a Billion adherents and endless wealth, and endless hidden knowledge (The Vatican Secret Archives dont forget they suppressed Galileos discoveries for a century)</p>

<p>Who has its fingers in almost every town on earth, and it is molesting children like a fucking assembly line.</p>

<p>I believe they are doing it to institute psychological changes, as the goal being sexual gratification is to simple for the problem to be on such a massive scale and to be enabled by the church.</p>

<p>No It has been proven molestation at different periods of a childs development causes specific, reproducible, and permanent changes to a childs personality and mind in ways we do not fully understand (I bet they understand though) and these changes actually become genetic, so if your parent was molested, but you never were you will still have permanent genetic abnormalities associated with molestation meaning that as long as they continue molesting everyone they can, they will have eventually genetically altered the entire human race </p>

<p>My pet theory is that basically humans grow stronger in response to stress.</p>

<p>These people probably believe they are strengthening the human race by over stressing the young permanently increasing their capabilities and teh capabilities of their children and childrens children.</p>

<p>So in a really fucked up way they view themselves as the good guys. </p>

<p>Now people will slowly start seeing this and in all honesty, many already are and have.</p>

<p>The Catholic church is only one of many facets, and this practice has probably been going on for a long, long, long time. We now have the technology and the capability to do something about it. And we are. We Will Win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that worries me, is they may be technically correct.</p>

<p>I have been and I know many others who were molested.</p>

<p>And it does have the power to permanently shatter you.</p>

<p>But in most of the scenarios I have seen, it activated some kind of innate power or talent, </p>

<p>I know a man who was Molested who created a multi-million dollar Defense Contracting company (go figure) and has created numerous businesses since then.  </p>

<p>I know another who is a prodigy level artist.</p>

<p>and I myself have an IQ of 140+ and was reading at a college level in 5th grade.</p>

<p>Very Very anecdotal to be sure but as someone who dabbled in the art of growing plants, I see clear parallels.</p>

<p>For examples if you let a plant live a privileged good life never facing wind or damage or anything and then place it into a difficult situation such as high wind it will fall over and die, and if you let it grow to completion, the fruit will be less plentiful and smaller, this is fairly identical to what happens to privileged rich kids</p>

<p>2 techniques were utilized to combat this</p>

<p>one is called Low Stress Training, which was for example hanging fishing weights from the branches so they would have to grow stronger to accommodate the weight, you had to put the ideal amount of weight though, as too little would be nearly ineffective, and to much could break the branch.</p>

<p>I find this similar to typical life challenges such as employment, social interaction, and schooling.</p>

<p>The other type is High Stress training, the main one I utilized was snapping a growing branch enough to wear it was clearly broken and would be laying straight down but still connected to the plant enough to regrow the connection, what would happen is where the branch was snapped it would grow back stronger than anywhere else on the plant into a thick knot that could transport more nutrients to the branch making that branch grow exceptionally fast.</p>

<p>The risk was if you put too much stress on the plant it could go into shock and no longer improve itself in the face of the stress but wither and become even weaker than it was originally.</p>

<p>Sorry for the ranty lesson on horticulture but I feel like it is very analogous to what the Catholic Church is doing, they feel like everytime they molest a kid, they are snapping a branch while it is young with the goal of it growing back stronger than it could have ever been had that not happened, basically activating an innate human mechanism allowing the ability to overcome adversity in extreme situations, which in modern society would lead to Olympic Athletes, Genius inventors, and Amazing Authors.</p>

<p>Do not take this as an agreement or endorsement of their methods.</p>

<p>But I think true evil with no ray of goodness is exceedingly rare, and I just cant imagine them wasting so much time, money, and resources not to mention the risk of lynching and imprisonment if they were to get caught doing these things with no good reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stress does and CAN create growth. That is why the &quot;school room earth&quot; is such a potent soul mission, but you can also get &quot;lost&quot; on the wheel of karma. This is a free will universe, and such, people have the free will to be &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;positive&quot; or walk the fine line and see both sides.</p>

<p>The important key here is that SUFFERING does not have to occur, we do not NEED to hurt each other to &quot;grow&quot; we can do that with trial and error, not constantly slapping and hurting each other... That just creates pain &amp; suffering.</p>

<p>Splitting a persons personality can be used to train and condition them into certain ways, usually without the persons consent. This creates a controllable &quot;altar&quot; that can then do what you want them to do. This is dangerous, and not warranted. Project MKUltra was only the beginning. Anyone familiar with Allison Mack&#39;s work will know what I am talking about (I still need to read them, but I now feel comfortable sharing her name) Abuse does not have to breed abuse anymore. Let&#39;s step outside that box of pain, suffering, and victim consciousness and step into a box where we can be anyone we truly want to be in a world with advanced technology and  new innovative ideas. We can do that. We are doing that. It is happening.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they did it with epigenetics in mind. I think this is part of an ancient ritual. There are links I have found to the black nobility because the Catholic church didn&#39;t have much power until the black nobility sided with them and before that, the first crusades in 1095 enabled Christianity to finally have a foothold through bloodshed and violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1095, Byzantine emperor Alexius I appealed to Pope Urban II for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the Byzantine–Seljuk Wars,[306] which caused Urban to launch the First Crusade aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and returning the Holy Land to Christian control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this has a long history and the current leaders of this movement are the ones that enabled the Popes of this era to be in power. I believe it can be traced back to about 5,000 years ago in Ancient Egypt where things shifted. I feel, it&#39;s all connected. Ancient Egypt, Atlantis, black nobility, Catholic Church...it seems so bizarre, and frankly, silly...but everything for me at least, is connected. I&#39;ll present a theory with evidence soon.</p>

<p>Also it can be interesting tying new finds into these old ancient secret societies and orders (not all of them are bad either) especially in regards to ElsaGate and fear &amp; anxiety patterning targeting our kids through youtube and other avenues.

<p>But I find it quite coincidental that their is a correlation between their rituals, and reproducible long term changes in the human psyche and genetic structure.</p>

<p>How can we say Epigenetics is not just a modern term for what used to be considered magical?</p>

<p>Hell maybe even the ones doing the molestation believe it is 100% ritualistic and it is ones above them that have the residual genetic effects in mind.</p>

<p>It is complex and impossible to really be sure of.</p>

<p>A different but relevant theory I hold onto is the extra-dimensional beings theory.</p>

<p>This basically says their are Interdimensional Vampiric beings overlapping with our reality but in a layer beneath us, that feed off human negativity and negative emotional energy.</p>

I know they have helped that many homeless people. When did that happen?  I am finding no info regarding that. I think you may have that info flipped around. Craig has for sure rescued more than 1 or 2. And he has been responsible for arresting several child traffickers. So the number of children he has saved by putting these people in jail is incalculable.

    <div class="md"><p>All I am saying is that is not easily verifiable. These people are standing up for something and for some stupid reason only use Facebook. You can do a search of their page and that doesn&#39;t pop up. They seem pretty adamant about putting everything on social media and find it very hard to believe they have rescued 30 children and didn&#39;t post about or mention it once. Also there should be some sort of news coverage about their achievements at least once. I have looked and searched and as it stands now am calling bullshit on that statement. Hopefully I am wrong but don&#39;t give credit when credit isnt due. They were looking for homeless camps came across a strange one thought child trafficking was involved and that was the first time they have been involved in any kind of child trafficking search. Like I said Craig Sawyer has been involved in child trafficking and a lot of people in the beginning were confusing those two people they do look alike kind of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me ask you</p>

<p>can you look at a picture and process thought? We are not discussing emotions here, you seem to be the one reacting with feels to an open thread regarding discussion of this skull was found. We already have an &quot;experts&quot; opinion, it is not hard to look at the fact that there is some characteristics of the skull identifying it as a young skull, much younger than what most people are assuming.</p>

<p>We can exchange petty arguments all day, but until you actually bother to look at the picture yourself and make your own conclusion, these back and forths are really a waste of time for everyone involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked at the picture and it doesn&#39;t seem like a child to me, for a variety of reasons that have been explained elsewhere. If you think it does, fine, but when people who are trained in this area (some of whom have posted on this very sub and have agreed with the ME) use evidence to back up their &#39;adult&#39; claim, that means more to me than random people processing the picture, since they likely know little about how to identify the age of a skull.</p>

<p>You are speaking of &quot;facts&quot; but talking about how you FEEL the skull looks. It couldn&#39;t be a much more obvious example of Feels Before Reals, sorry.</p>

<p>I am speaking of facts too.

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair the screen shot you linked looks intentionally edited to sway opinions, between the child, young adult, and adult skull, the only one that isn’t obstructed by the arrow boxes at all is... surprise surprise the child skull, and the funny thing is we didn’t even need the arrow boxes at all, the text above it is literally explaining the reasoning on why that person felt it was most likely a child skull, and fortunately for me I just so happen to have a head permanently attached to my neck, so Im fairly knowledgeable on where the various parts of the skull happen to be, i really don’t need arrows to show me where the eyes or nose would be on a skull.... </p>

<p>it just seems intentionally designed to prime the reader with what the author wants the reader to be thinking and then edited to control the readers focus/ ability to come to any conclusion except what’s being presented to them.....</p>

<p>I’m not trying to discredit the claim you’re making but shit like that is huge red flag to me, <em>“compare this skull to these other 3 skulls, doesn’t it mostly match the only one skull I didn’t cover up with arrows!?”</em> How are we suppose to know if we can’t clearly compare it to all three.... </p>

<h2>Some Expert Redditor seconds later: &quot;Why that&#39;s a orange death beetle from the northern coast of the westernmost of the Hawaiian Islands...&quot;</h2>

<p>I just feel like it should be incredibly easy for someone to chime in and go &quot;Hi, I&#39;m a forensic pathologist/osteologist/etc., I can absolutely confirm that this is a ___&#39;s skull.&quot; and the mods could confirm their credentials. We&#39;re sitting on this mountain of human intellectual capital and all standing around guessing and being dismissive of each other like idiots. </p>

<p>And actually, given the relative ease at which this could be discredited, I&#39;m more and more hesitant to believe this aspect. If there was never a picture of it, we could always wonder and the person who examined it might not have to worry about any real scrutiny, but it&#39;s right there. If it was a cover-up, I would assume they would have embraced it and pushed the trafficking story and blamed it on illegals bringing their kids on the dangerous trip. Maybe miraculously catching a few coyotes pretty quickly. Why create a problem by claiming it&#39;s an adult&#39;s skull when there are tens if not hundreds of thousands of people who could see through the obvious lie?</p>

My Wife is Mexican and American. She has dual citizenship. Drug trafficking is different than human trafficking. Drugs don&#39;t sprout feet and try to escape or grow a mouth and scream for help. I know someone who had their 5 year old Son murdered and stuffed full of cocaine. They found him in a VAN on the border. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep my personal info out of this account, but I have a lot of of professional knowledge in this area. </p>

<p>There are tend of thousands of unaccompanied minors who cross into the US. Most cross willingly, at least at first. Often they are systematically broken down during the trafficking process. They people who traffick are pros. The victims don&#39;t have to be dragged kicking and screaming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to UNICEF, along the borders of the United States and Mexico, at least 16,000 children are victims of child trafficking for sexual purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trafficking happens between Central American countries as well, and the most attractive / compliant / valuable are often sent to the US where they fetch the highest price. They cross in a variety of ways, as noted. This includes the desert border. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many girls are lured to Mexico with the promise of work, usually in domestic labour or as baby-sitters. In 2000, a group of approximately 400 girls from Honduras aged 10 to 16 were repatriated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;d like to know more from the experts, here&#39;s a good source of facts.

    <div class="md"><p>I am absolutely sick to the back teeth with this skull. I am a trained osteologist and the image you have provided is quite frankly, total fabricated garbage (that’s putting it nicely) and utterly insulting to both the people reading this and to the individual who’s remains you continuously desecrate. It’s almost midnight where I am so it won’t be now, but if anyone is interested I can provide a more detailed and cited comment tomorrow morning on just how shit that picture actually is. </p>

<p>However, just by looking with my very tired and pissed off eyes I can see no metopic suture (also known as frontal suture). According to Schaefer et al (2009) this suture disappears between 2-4 years of age. However, the metopic sutures can persist into adulthood (known as metopism) and the prevalence of this varies between ethnographic groups (see Kumar and Rajahekar 2015, Wadekar et al 2014). However, we do not use this as an age indicator for reasons I have described above (unless the osteologist prefers Buikstra and Ubelaker 1984), instead we prefer to use a combination of dental eruption (I use miles 1963 and the revised edition) which would be the most likely event here; the pubic symphyseal surface (Todd 1920, Katz and Suchey 1986, Suchey et al 1988), the auricular surface (Lovejoy et al 1985, Buckberry and Chamberlin 2002), epiphyseal fusion  (for instance Singh et al 2013 and the ischial tuberosity) and sternal rib end ageing (Iscan et al 1984, 1993).</p>

<p>For all purpose fantastic osteology advice please grab yourselves a copy of The human bone manual by White and Folkens (2005) or Human Osteology 3rd edition by Black, White and Folkens (2011). I’m happy to elaborate on any of my comments in the morning. A no, a trained, responsible osteologist would never claim to be able to provide an accurate age assessment based on just a picture. Now do me a favour and stop posting this crap. </p>

It has been so damn frustrating the past week having these idiots come on here and try to analyze the skull based on some shitty picture.

<p>What’s sad though is your post doesn’t fit into their narrative like all the other “experts” do so it will get ignored. But the FB post from some kid who spent 5 mins googling will continue to get passed off as fact. </p>

I tried very nicely to point out that his proof of ‘head trauma’ -what he described as a crack- was the squamous suture. Oh and the mandible had been removed to prevent identification apparently?

    <div class="md"><p>And people like you are the problem with conspiracies and this sub. Instead of keeping the &quot;open mind&quot; that conspiracies supposedly run on, you get info that doesn&#39;t fit your narrative and you bitch about it, then ignore it, move on and continue spewing your BS. Instead you should be referencing all the citations you were given and go over those. If you find that those are wrong, submit evidence as to why they are. But you wont do any of that after ignoring and spewing more shit. You don&#39;t want a discussion. You want an echo chamber of false info.</p>

<p>BTW, how does a 4 day old account with no posting history get accepted to bypass the 2 month old account rule? Hell you&#39;re still under the 2 month rule and you have no flair to warn people.</p>

<p>Your first post here was when your account was 4 days old.</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8im3cl/megalist_of_links_pertaining_to_corrupted_science/">https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8im3cl/megalist_of_links_pertaining_to_corrupted_science/</a></p>

<p>Account created 5/7/18. Submission that wasn&#39;t deleted for 2 month account age 5/11/18 = 4 day old account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hell you&#39;re still under the 2 month rule and you have no flair to warn people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sill under 2 month old account. </p>

<p>I checked your comment history cause I was trying to see why a less than 2 month old account was allowed to post here and bypass the 2 month old account rule. I see you had no posting history at all anywhere expect one submission in r/gardening and that was the day before you made a massive post in this sub. </p>

<p>So why is there a 2 month old account rule? The mods only letting discussion happen they want is the answer. </p>

<p>the real answer is my last account was compromised and my identity was too easy to connect</p>

<p>so i had to leave an old account and create a new one. I explained this to mods and petitioned them to approve this account and it was voted on. The vote passed and I got approved. Any questions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  You happened to hit upon one if my areas of expertise.  I&#39;ve studied anatomy as I am a liscense medical professional.  And I can tell you that the analysis of the skull in OPs post is absolute bullshit.  Sorry man, but children having more pronounced foreheads and eye shape is all just subjective.  That&#39;s not how you identify a skull.  I don&#39;t know who made that graphic or where you got it, but it&#39;s either disinfo or just outright propaganda.  </p>

<p>The image said nothing of sutures or dentition.  And I&#39;m not 100% sure, but a quick Google search will probably tell you those are both important to identification.  This shit about eye shape and forehead size and how smooth or not smooth it is is all just made up idiocy.  You can&#39;t go around waving it around as proof of anything.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you accepted this as gospel truth when you saw it, but at least do a Google search before you post shit like this. I get it.  You REALLY want this to be a child skull because it will then validate all your time and effort.  But you&#39;re basing it all on made up science and feels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the spirit of not being the dick who promises to deliver and never does, I wanted to elaborate on my comment that I posted last night. Please take any new dates and the genuine dates, I was fucking knackered last night. I’m not sure any of you wanted more but just in case you did or thought I was a lying tosser, I thought I’d shove it here. First off though: </p>

<ol>
<li>I cannot list every osteological technique that&#39;s ever been invented/trialled. There are literally hundreds of accurate, inaccurate, convoluted, mathematical, simple, quick and extremely difficult techniques and more are proposed every year. </li>
<li>There is going to be a certain amount of repetition from my previous comment, because we tend to use a core set of techniques each and every time. </li>
<li>Old does not mean irrelevant. Many of the papers I am about to list are years, if not decades old. Sometimes and oldie is a goodie.</li>
<li>When I say &#39;I&#39;, &#39;me&#39;, &#39;we&#39; or &#39;us&#39; I am mean just that. This is how my unit conducts an osteological assessment and there is bound to be some variation between institutions and without a doubt between countries, particularly Britain and the USA. Nobody is wrong, its just different. We argue over this stuff all the time. It is a good thing. </li>
<li>I am bound to disappoint someone reading this who either wants it to be more ELI5 or more in depth, I cannot please everyone. I am not trying to be patronising or arrogant. I also don&#39;t really know what you guys wanted so I&#39;ve included a little bit of everything.</li>

<p>If you are genuinely interested in reading about osteology then I recommend The Human Bone Manual by White and Folkens (2005) or Human Osteology by White, Black and Folkens (2011), and specifically for juvenile osteology, read Juvenile Osteology: A field manual by Scheuer and Black (2008) and Developmental Juvenile Osteology by Cunningham and Scheuer (2000). Journals are also a good place to start, look out for The International Journal of Osteoarchaeology or the International Journal of Palaeopathology.</p>

<p>On to the task at hand. First off, when producing an osteological assessment of human remains we typically attempt to determine four things. Biological sex, age, stature and ethnicity. Contrary to popular belief we do not jump to figuring out how somebody died, unless it is immediately obvious or explicitly requested. However, we are all trained to do so, and for many of us palaeopathology (study of past disease in human remains, sometimes called a subset of bioarchaeology) and trauma studies are our PhD speciality. 
As I don&#39;t think anyone is interested in the ethnicity of the Cranium (the proper terminology as it has no mandible) I wont bother to detail this process unties anyone is incredibly interested. Stature cannot be estimated because it requires elements from the appendicular skeleton (Trotter and Glesser 1952, 1958) which we are missing. Nobody seems to be fighting about biological sex yet either.</p>

<p>Calculating Age : Since this seems to be the biggest sticking point with this skull, lets start here. In the case of only having a cranium, the osteologist would consider dental eruption as a key indicator of age. Dental development follows a typical pattern and can be divided into convenient stages, with the development of permanent dentition covering birth to approximately 12 years of age (Lewis and Flavel 2006). According to Mincer et al (1993) and Scheuer and Black (2000) it is the only reliable system applicable when estimating the age of an individual prior to adulthood. White and Folkens (2005) have identified four key stages of tooth eruption, with teeth moving from deciduous to permanent dentition, ending at approximately 18 years old with the eruption of the third molar, although this is highly variable (Hillson 1996). Ubelaker (1989) has created an in depth diagram of dental eruption stages for a better visual grip of what we are talking about, as has AlQahtani (2008) known as ‘The Atlas of tooth development and eruption’. Ball park, you should expect to see permanent canines, premolars and second molars between the age of 10 and 12. A forensic odontologist would be responsible for deciding an exact age at death in forensic cases but for those which are archaeological, Miles (1962, 1863, 2001) and Brothwell (1981) are used, although these are based on the level of tooth wear and not eruption stages. Without inspecting the cranium or obtaining proper pictures of the dentition, it is impossible to make an assessment for age based on dentition.</p>

<p>Age can be potentially estimated using cranial suture closure, although there is such an enormous amount of variability in suture pattern closure that it has a reduced value (Masset 1989) and as previously discussed it can also be affected by ethnographic background (Kumar and Rajahekar 2015; Wadekar et al 2014). Buiskstra and Ubelaker (1994) produced &#39;Standards for data collection from human skeletal remains&#39; and offered an amalgamation of ideas from Todd and Lyon (1924, 1925 various) Mann et al (1987) and Meindl and Lovejoy (1985) to create their version of recording suture closure. The osteologist is asked to record 10 ectocranial, 4 palatal and endocranial sutures, which must be scored between blank (unobservable) to 1 (open) 2 minimal closure) 3 (significant closure) to 4 (complete obliteration), and at least 1 cm of suture for each measurement must be observable. A composite score is then recorded, which correlates to young adult (typically between 20-34 although Meindl and Lovejoy 1985 record a potential age of 15), middle adult (35-49) and old adult (50+). Although the above picture appears to show an obliterated metopic suture suggesting this individual is over 4 years (Schaefer et al 2009) it is entirely possible for an adult to suffer from persistent metopic suture (metopism). Because of this variability, Key et al (1994) claims negative closure (of sutures) cannot be used solely as an age indicator at all. Likewise, a single suture cannot be assessed in isolation, so again, a proper assessment of the cranium is required. As you can image, this type of complex and lengthy assessment cannot be done via a photograph of this quality. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of the methods we use to assign age to a skeleton involve the appendicular skeleton which is missing in this situation. With the rest of the skeleton, we would typically record observations of the pitting, bony nodules and grooves on the pubic symphysis surface (Todd 1920) and assign each written description to a phase accompanied by an age (Phase 1 is between 18-19 years, Phase 2 is 20-21, all the way to phase 10 which is the last and is listed as 50+). McKern and Stewart (1957) applied this to war casualties and simplified this process by providing pictures to accompany each phase. Bare in mind, both Todd (1920) and McKern and Stewart only gathered their data from deceased men. Katz and Suchey (1986), Suchey et al (1986), and most notably Brooks and Suchey (1990) also contributed to the same study of the pubic symphyseal surface but provided female, as well as male, illustrations and descriptions, this time with only 6 phases to pick from. It is also the favourite to use in cases when the skeletal material is suspected to be of a young adult, as it seem to have a higher rate of accuracy. 
Another observation is recorded for the auricular surface of the ilium, including granularity, billowing, lipping and porosity. The standard guide for this was created by Lovejoy et al (1985), with 8 phases each with a corresponding age, covering ages 20-60+. Buckberry and Chamberlin (2002) revised the technique to score 5 characteristics individually, and is more accurate on individuals believed to be between 50-69 (White et al 2011). I will even admit it has extremely broad age ranges (for instance a composite score of 9/10 is anything between 29-82 years old). There isn&#39;t much to say about this one, but another popular age determination method is analysing the changes at the costochondral junction of the 3rd , 4th of 5th sternal rib ends (Iscan et al 1984, 1986) and assigning each of these to a stage between 0-8 which corresponds to an age. The authors claim it is applicable to all three ribs but it was formulated on the 4th only.</p>

<p>Lastly, epiphyseal fusion is usually the primary indicator, as it can provide a relatively narrow age range in comparison to the other methods I have described. If the iliac crest and medial clavicle are intact they can be analysed using the combination method by Webb and Suchey (1985). Vallois (1960) provides a chronology of ossification and fusion of epiphyses in Europeans but analysed them collectively rather than by sex. As a quick run down, the scapula fuses between 19-21 in females, the distal end of the humerus 14-17, the proximal end of the tibia and the head and distal end of the femur also fuses between 15-19 years (all ages are provided for females and by Ferembach et al 1980, there are also male estimations but I have none to hand). The method of Vertebral union can provide an accuracy of up to 99% using a picture scoring system and an acceptable age range of 2.5 years (Albert and Maples). Swartz (1995) has fusion ages for the vertebral rib ends which will age you below 25, and the 2nd and 3rd sternebrae typically unite between puberty and 25. 1/2</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you can see, there is no shortage of epiphyseal data, you just have to record what skeletal elements you do and do not have, and keep in mind any expectation of biological sex and these will change which method you can use and it’s accuracy. Anyway, back to the skull at hand. So by now you can guess that I cannot work comfortably without seeing clear photographs of the skull, to access either the dental eruption or suture closure. I don&#39;t have any of the axial or appendicular skeleton, so that rules that out. Now, as for that text message. Geez, I would be out of a job if we could all just look at a skeleton and say &#39;Gosh, its eyes are so big, it must be a child&#39;.
Lets go through the numbers:</p>

<p>1.True, a child&#39;s eyes are disproportionately large, but that&#39;s because we are born with eyes already the size they will be when we are adults; its also an evolutionary advantage which promotes care giving and protection (see Kringlebach et al 2016 &#39;On cuteness&#39;).The shape of the eyes are err, distinctly &#39;eye&#39; shaped in both pictures. Its funny how a picture can look different when shot from different angles? </p>

<p>2.This is called morphological variation, and is natural in the human skeleton. The shape of your skull varies due to a number of factors including diet, disease, lifestyle, biological sex, geographical location and ethic group (see any of the main textbooks I have quoted). Age has a lot to do with it, adolescent boys tend to have gracile, more feminine features and older females can take on the robust sexually dimorphic traits of men (Walker 1995, 2008). Infant/adolescent skulls can be more bulbous, but then I&#39;ve seen this in adult and elderly remains too. It means absolutely nothing and has never been used as an indicator of age. </p>

<p>3.Again, your going to have to take my word on this. This is not a trait exclusive to infants/adolescents. This is nice, wholesome variation and is totally natural. </p>

<p>4.&#39;The eye brow region&#39;, also known as the glabella or supra-orbital ridge is a sexually dimorphic trait as described by Bruiskstra and Ubelaker (1994), Acsadi and Nemeskeri (1970), White et al (2011), White and Folkens (2005) and Walker (1995, 2008). I really don&#39;t know what to say about the &#39;closer together/further apart&#39; thing other than its just crap. It has nothing to do with age. Sorry. </p>

<p>TLDR: what I’m badly trying to say is that ageing a skeleton is fucking hard work, it’s a set of very simplex observations that cannot be done in the way that people in this post and others have flippantly described. We can age isolated cranium, but not without seeing the dentition, being highly experienced and having access to detailed photographs and time. It is unprofessional and offensive to guess when it comes to human remains. In my professional opinion, given everything I have described and my own person opinions, if the ME has told you this skull belongs to an adult then trust me that they have worked very hard to be 100% sure, within their capability as a human being. We do not make decisions lightly or in haste. If there&#39;s anything I can elaborate on or have left out just give me a shout. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks. </p>
