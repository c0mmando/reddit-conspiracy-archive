If pressed, he’ll find a way to pivot the conversation to something positive he’s focused on. Just like the stormy allegations, if you don’t admit guilt or wrongdoing, then you aren’t guilty in the eyes of the general population (the real judges of his actions).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, we&#39;re in 2 parallel dimensions.  I happen to live right smack dab in the middle of them.   And I frequently find it&#39;s a lot of fun to entertain both. If Trump&#39;s version of reality is true, then a lot of people are going to jail for straight up treason, and my own spin, possibly death.<br/>
If the left&#39;s view of reality is true, Trump had some hookers peeing on him.  All of the Mueller stuff doesn&#39;t count just yet because it&#39;s all indictments are things that were done by people not Trump, before the Trump presidential run, regarding things that have nothing to do with Trump.  I mean good for Mueller taking those guys off the street, but as of right now, it&#39;s nothing, and waning by the day. This could change, though.
On Trump&#39;s side though, we have verified texts/emails/exchanges of seemingly actual collusion to prevent him from being president?  It just seems that right now at least, the charges Trump is talking about has a lot more bite than the left&#39;s allegations of pee tapes.   We&#39;ll see though.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised either way.<br/>
At this point, lock up whoever, impeach whoever needs impeaching, Trump, Hillary, The Boogeyman, I don&#39;t care.  I think it&#39;s time to move on.  Let&#39;s just get this show on the road.</p>

<p>I agree with this.  Nobody hounded on this issue the way they seem to hound on others with far less evidence.  Always wondered why that was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. He has shown this far that most of the ridiculous shit he attributes to the democrats and Hilary Clinton (of which I would bet are just as dirty) is projection of his own misdeeds. Narcissist behavior at every turning point, and a complete subservient showing to KGB/FSB intents as to our democracy and nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you referring to the girl who sued him who was being handled by a jerry springer producer?  I thought that would be taken with a huge grain of salt.  Seemed like a blatant money grab.</p>

<p>Also rarely comes up.  You&#39;d imagine with the level of trump hate that it would be a more prominently used critique of him instead of the fake russia stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, we&#39;re in 2 parallel dimensions.  I happen to live right smack dab in the middle of them.   And I frequently find it&#39;s a lot of fun to entertain both. If Trump&#39;s version of reality is true, then a lot of people are going to jail for straight up treason, and my own spin, possibly death.<br/>
If the left&#39;s view of reality is true, Trump had some hookers peeing on him.  All of the Mueller stuff doesn&#39;t count just yet because it&#39;s all indictments are things that were done by people not Trump, before the Trump presidential run, regarding things that have nothing to do with Trump.  I mean good for Mueller taking those guys off the street, but as of right now, it&#39;s nothing, and waning by the day. This could change, though.
On Trump&#39;s side though, we have verified texts/emails/exchanges of seemingly actual collusion to prevent him from being president?  It just seems that right now at least, the charges Trump is talking about has a lot more bite than the left&#39;s allegations of pee tapes.   We&#39;ll see though.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised either way.<br/>
At this point, lock up whoever, impeach whoever needs impeaching, Trump, Hillary, The Boogeyman, I don&#39;t care.  I think it&#39;s time to move on.  Let&#39;s just get this show on the road.</p>
