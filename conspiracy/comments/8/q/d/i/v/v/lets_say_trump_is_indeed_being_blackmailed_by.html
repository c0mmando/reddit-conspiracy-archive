       Can’t blackmail a guy who doesn’t care. Even if all the conspiracy theories were true (which they aren’t) it wouldn’t change a thing. His name can’t be dragged through the mud like previous politicians.

       I believe it’s part of a bigger movement (call it what you will). Pushback has started and either things will go really well whether some like it or not or we can go into full blown civil war. Either way the outcome will be the same in the end.

       Depends on the timeline. In our lifetime possibly a new era of enlightenment. I’m optimistic. Although depending on what happens tomorrow that can change. That’s just in the US. I believe there will be a conflict on a global scale either in our lifetime or the next as well.

       I don’t think it’s because he ‘doesn’t care’, more about being selective with his attention. If a sensitive topic is brought up, he’ll ignore it. If pressed, he’ll find a way to pivot the conversation to something positive he’s focused on. Just like the stormy allegations, if you don’t admit guilt or wrongdoing, then you aren’t guilty in the eyes of the general population (the real judges of his actions).

       I don't think they have anything.    Maybe a video of him having sex?  We have some supposed "pee tape".    As someone else said, I don't think he'd care, and he'd "get out of it", whatever that means lol.  It would probably roll right off his back.

       There is no "pee tape". Its a fucking lie. Trump is clean as a whistle. Obama admin spied on him for 4-5 years and they have nothing.

       I don't know if they do or not.  But it seems that it's always fallen back on, the old "what do they have on Trump...
       <em>

       PEE TAPE

       Honestly, we're in 2 parallel dimensions.  I happen to live right smack dab in the middle of them.   And I frequently find it's a lot of fun to entertain both. If Trump's version of reality is true, then a lot of people are going to jail for straight up treason, and my own spin, possibly death.
       <br/>
       If the left's view of reality is true, Trump had some hookers peeing on him.  All of the Mueller stuff doesn't count just yet because it's all indictments are things that were done by people not Trump, before the Trump presidential run, regarding things that have nothing to do with Trump.  I mean good for Mueller taking those guys off the street, but as of right now, it's nothing, and waning by the day. This could change, though.
On Trump's side though, we have verified texts/emails/exchanges of seemingly actual collusion to prevent him from being president?  It just seems that right now at least, the charges Trump is talking about has a lot more bite than the left's allegations of pee tapes.   We'll see though.  I wouldn't be surprised either way.
       <br/>
       At this point, lock up whoever, impeach whoever needs impeaching, Trump, Hillary, The Boogeyman, I don't care.  I think it's time to move on.  Let's just get this show on the road.

       I agree. He has shown this far that most of the ridiculous shit he attributes to the democrats and Hilary Clinton (of which I would bet are just as dirty) is projection of his own misdeeds. Narcissist behavior at every turning point, and a complete subservient showing to KGB/FSB intents as to our democracy and nation.

       It probably isnt even blackmail. I feel like all you need to do to get on his good side is like him. So now hes giving preferential treatment to Russia and apparently he loves Kanye.

       This is the right answer, and is the reason he gets antsy when Mueller looks at financials from the past.

       Honestly, we're in 2 parallel dimensions.  I happen to live right smack dab in the middle of them.   And I frequently find it's a lot of fun to entertain both. If Trump's version of reality is true, then a lot of people are going to jail for straight up treason, and my own spin, possibly death.
       <br/>
       If the left's view of reality is true, Trump had some hookers peeing on him.  All of the Mueller stuff doesn't count just yet because it's all indictments are things that were done by people not Trump, before the Trump presidential run, regarding things that have nothing to do with Trump.  I mean good for Mueller taking those guys off the street, but as of right now, it's nothing, and waning by the day. This could change, though.
On Trump's side though, we have verified texts/emails/exchanges of seemingly actual collusion to prevent him from being president?  It just seems that right now at least, the charges Trump is talking about has a lot more bite than the left's allegations of pee tapes.   We'll see though.  I wouldn't be surprised either way.
       <br/>
       At this point, lock up whoever, impeach whoever needs impeaching, Trump, Hillary, The Boogeyman, I don't care.  I think it's time to move on.  Let's just get this show on the road.
