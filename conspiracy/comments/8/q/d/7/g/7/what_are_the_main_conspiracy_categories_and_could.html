    <div class="md"><p>There is no level of being a conspiracy theorist. Most of it comes from gut instinct that the world isn&#39;t correct. Some people have the ability to see bullshit and spin. It&#39;s not a freemasons lodge I certainly don&#39;t worship anybody or would anyone worshipping me. There is no level to try seeing the trees through the fog. 
Don&#39;t get me wrong some people might be more informed than others don&#39;t make them experts makes them more informed on a subject. But conspiracy for me is wether a subject is found to be true or not true. The media spin us has people who believe in UFOs or the loch Ness monster. Not the case I want to seek the truth of a subject and find whether it&#39;s true or not that&#39;s all. 
I&#39;d be happy debunking a subject if the evidence is there and would go for the truth if there isn&#39;t. Sadly people think the media are the last seabstions of truth when they&#39;re paid to spin a narrative. It&#39;s a sad world deep down everyone knows they&#39;re imperfect and soon the left right and the middle realise that shit we will all be better people.  There is no captain to think for yourself mate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worst thing to happen in the last two or three years is labelling and being categorised. Humans are not shit you find on shopping shelves we don&#39;t need to be out in aisles. we are all the same we have different colours and creeds but we&#39;re human it&#39;s that simple. People are that fucking desperate to be individual they want there own label it&#39;s fucked. Society has gone. We are all human when the Olympic games are in or the world cup everyone comes together for a game of football (soccer for the Americans) but politicians and their egos can&#39;t fix shit. Sad to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but surely some conspiracies are only suitable for certain people to start with. Let’s be honest, some people are awake on different levels.

    <div class="md"><p>This isn’t a bad idea or even categorized tags like other subs have but I feel like the experience level categories would just encourage people to take the most outlandish theories like flag earth as “master” just so they have a fallback when people challenge their idiotic ideas “the earth is flat, you just don’t get it because it’s a “master” level theory”</p>

<p>I see post on this sub all the time where the OP makes some wild claim/theory and when anyone asks for any type of information or where the claim is coming from they take the defensive and demand everyone else do the research themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the blue pill is more likely to be something like &quot;Bush knew about 9/11 before it happened&quot;. That makes more sense to me as a beginner&#39;s level, plus the fact that Iraq didn&#39;t do 9/11 is a well-known fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>concerning the different levels...there is one thing I&#39;ve noticed...users have a &quot;highly significant&quot; degree of understanding when it comes to understanding conspiracies seem to have a certain thing in common.</p>

<p>And that is this: They have a strong background in research pertaining to royal families/black nobility/Vatican/Jesuits/Free Masons and other secret societies..</p>

<p>I believe this comes from intensive research that ends up tracing to these common groups that tend to be found at the root of many conspiracies...</p>

<p>Also, think tanks such as Council on Foreign Relations...the Atlantic Council, Heritage Foundation...and many others.</p>
