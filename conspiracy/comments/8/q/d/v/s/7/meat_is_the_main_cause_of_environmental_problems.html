A small family owned dairy (50-100) cows that are out on pasture and fed a grass based diet (no corn or soy) does not have a negative affect on the environment. The problem comes from large operations feeding a mostly grain based diet and cramming 200-500 head of cattle on 2-5 acres.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a totally different argument than the environmental issues stated here. But I will tell you how I personally feel about farming.</p>

<p>God made the earth and everything in it for man to use and grow with. I believe bovines were put her for us to domesticate and use as labor and food, The animals that we farm today are not even close to what the original cows looked like, they have been bred for specific traits and are raised to produce meat or milk accordingly.</p>

<p>I own several milk cows (not going to say how many due to my appreciation of anonymity and its not hard to find a dairy farmer with a specific amount of cattle in any given region). I also own several beef cattle. I treat all of my animals with respect and let them be alone on pasture as much as possible. With the milking herd I have to bring them home twice a day and milk them. I love my animals, but they were made to serve us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesnt matter what you believe or feel. Killing a cow is actually very evil. They are very intelligent creatures and freely give us milk and labor. The vast Vedic texts share that killing a cow will bankrupt ones credibility in the eyes of God. How can one claim to be a devotee of God if you kill his creation for more enjoyment?</p>

<p>No need to murder cows. Eat grains,fruits, nuts, dairy, vegetables and you&#39;ll be strong. Otherwise you WILL be punished for the balance of your violent life.</p>

<p>Hands down best site which explains how meat isn&#39;t that good for you, nor is processed food. A whole foods plant based diet is much better for you.
Well researched videos, linked to sources, transcripts and comments. Watch the hour long summary videos and give it a go.
You&#39;ll probably lose weight and increase circulation too (great cure for erectile dysfunction too!)</p>

<p>Animal Agriculture is an awful industry. If they livestreamed the slaughterhouse above the meat aisle, I doubt many people would eat it. I started for health gains (more protein on your blood as animal protein causes inflammation) and stayed for cut animals.</p>

<p>For me it woke me up to the idea that consciousness is an amazing shared experience that we have yet to understand. But that animals definitely are like us in so many ways, and we don&#39;t have to harm them just for our tastebuds. What do we do if kids start murdering pets? We go visit a psychologist as it&#39;s not a normal sight. But if they went to KFC to pick up a bargain bucket? No problem.</p>

<p>And then you&#39;ve got the side of all the workers. Is cutting carcasses or bolt gunning animals a fun job that anyone really wants to do? Kids don&#39;t dream of becoming slaughterhouse workers, so let&#39;s stop propping it up.</p>

<p>Or the poop smearing from the giant pig farms. Awful to live nearby, and it&#39;s often the poorest people too which sucks even more.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forksoverknives.com">https://www.forksoverknives.com</a></p>

<p>Good documentary, worth watching. Try 5 days a week vegan/ more plant based cooking. Your poops will be great too, lots of fibre makes for a happy trip to the toilet.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll help destroy the pharmaceutical industry, animal agricultural industry and fast food industry in one go. What&#39;s not to like?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meat is the single cheapest and environmentally friendly thing a human can eat while remaining in a reasonably good health - this is because you can sustain a meat production on feeding animals with grains - the cheapest source of calories, which unfortunately is not nutritional enough for humans to sustain on. Vegans must rely heavily on various vegetables and fruits, which are expensive as fuck per calories delivered and require the most sophisticated production methods to get any reasonable return on investment. Veganism is a first world fad - these people must have enough money and free time for planning their diets, combined with  a sedimentary lifestyle with almost no calories spend on their daily activities to even consider this a valid nutrition plan for humankind. </p>
