<p>Here are some actual facts about &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;:</p>

<p>Born in Stratford-upon-Avon to illiterate parents.</p>

<p>Town contained no school capable of teaching the languages, history, or higher forms of learning reflected in plays attributed to Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Only six known samples of Shakspere’s handwriting exist.
All signatures.
Three of those are in his will.
All six spell his name “Shakspere.”</p>

<p>No autograph manuscripts of the Shakespearian plays or sonnets have been discovered. </p>

<p>Never left England.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DeVere was involved in my opinion. Bacon was the ring-leader, though. </p>

<p>As for the &quot;why&quot;, I believe this timeline is relevant:</p>

<p>1593: First Quarto published</p>

<p>1611: King James Bible published - Edited by Sir Francis Bacon</p>

<p>1612: First English Edition of Don Quixote published</p>

<p>=&gt;All three above cited works contain distinctive “Double A” headpiece with elaborately curved light-colored “A” on the left, and a mirror image dark “A” on the right.</p>

<p>=&gt;Symbolizes polarities in life that can be reconciled.</p>

<p>=&gt;The “A’s” stand for Athena and Apollo - The two “spear-shakers” of Greek mythology, associated with wisdom and enlightenment.</p>

<p>1613: Final Shakespeare play “Two Noble Kinsmen” produced</p>

<p>1614-1616: Rosicrucian Manifestos published</p>

<p>=&gt;Fama Fraternitatis (1614), Confessio Fraternatatis (1615) &amp; The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (1616)</p>

<p>1623: Shakespeare’s First Folio published</p>

<p>Additionally, historian Frances Yates names several Shakespeare plays influenced by Rosicrucian teachings.</p>

<p>=&gt;Hamlet, King Lear, and The Tempest, et al.</p>

<p>Yates also stated that “Shakespeare’s thought in these Last Plays belongs to the evolution of the Renaissance hermetic-Cabalist tradition into Rosicrucianism.”</p>

<p>Rosicrucian societies met secretly, and swore to keep members’ identities secret to avoid persecution for their scientific and spiritual beliefs.</p>

<p>Conclusion: The plays attributed to Shakespeare were written by a circle of initiates to promote and perpetuate enlightenment values and ideas.</p>

<p>Manly P. Hall has some great insight into this mystery in The Secret Teachings of All Ages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I don&#39;t believe that Shakespeare was anyone other than Shakespeare, but the best argument against the FB=WS is the relatively unknown idea of using a secret identity or a pseudonym in that time. Other writers used a pen name, but we know who they really were, and the only people using a secret identity were spies or secret agents, and in that case they would never have wanted the secret name to become as famous and well known as it did in Shakespeare&#39;s own time. He was a goddamned rock star at the time, an people knew him.</p>

<p>If Shakespeare was a secret agent or a pen name if someone else (or a group of people) it has been the most successful fake name in the history of the world and it comes from next to nothing. There are so few first hand concrete pieces of evidence to suggest he wasn&#39;t just some dude who wrote goodly. Theres more evidence to suggest he was gay than Francis Bacon.</p>

<p>&quot;Various explanations are offered for this alleged subterfuge, most commonly that Bacon&#39;s rise to high office might have been hindered were it to become known that he wrote plays for the public stage.&quot;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Mark Twain, Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles (and <em>many</em> other respected researchers), Shakespeare was the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere (the illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth, allegedly).</p>

<p>It&#39;s also been suggested that &quot;Shakespeare&quot; was a <em>group</em> of individuals with an occult agenda, as the plays not only are chock full of esoterica, but they practically recrafted the English language itself. Bacon may indeed have been part of this group, but de Vere was the mastermind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the version I have researched to some degree.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a wild ride. Under this hypothesis, Queen Elizabeth secretly bore her equerry (her most personal male retainer) named Robert Dudley, a friend and lover since teenagers, two children. Both were farmed out to families that had unimpeachable loyalty to Elizabeth. The older of the two was Francis Bacon, and the younger was Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex.</p>

<p>Francis was a genius. He traveled through europe, knew several languages, and had a classical education. Essex was a soldier and nobleman. Both of them were known favorites of Elizabeth as they grew up and took on their positions in the state hierarchy, but keeping a lower-status as a cover, like their father, Dudley.</p>

<p>So Elizabeth had a secret &quot;love-family&quot; right in or near her palace, hidden in plain sight, while she used her &quot;marriageable status&quot; for diplomatic advantage for over 20 years. </p>

<p>However, the end game was pretty awful. Both of her sons by Dudley knew or suspected they were of royal blood and wanted to get her to acknowledge them. It is said that Bacon wore the &quot;purple&quot; of royalty when he was just the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Essex nearly started an armed rebellion to force Elizabeth to recognize his claim to the throne. He was ultimately executed by &quot;his mother&#39;s&quot; command.</p>

<p>The primary objective of Elizabeth and her advisors was to unite England with Scotland. They believed, rightly, that Britain could only play a decisive role in history if the two squabbling parts were united under a single monarch. That monarch had to be King James VI of Scotland, not Dudley&#39;s sons. She was a queen first and a mother second.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some documentaries and historians come to a conclusion that Shakespeare did exist, but most likely as a front man for a group of writers who held a consistent theme and writing style in the plays. Some of the reasons include Shakespeare not having an education any higher than 5th grade, having found no letters or documents in his handwriting, and the full circle his career made. It’s pretty interesting but in my opinion Shakespeare was a front man for a creative writing club of advanced authors and free thinkers. Some plays address super progressive ideals like “Othello”  especially for the time period.  A play humanizing the objectified is really odd but holds great literary merit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this theory, with the caveat that it was a group effort led by Bacon. Edward DeVere was likely involved, since he traveled to several of the locations that appear in the Shakespeare plays.</p>

<p>As for the &quot;why&quot;, I believe this timeline is relevant:</p>

<p>1593: First Quarto published</p>

<p>1611: King James Bible published
Edited by Sir Francis Bacon</p>

<p>1612: First English Edition of Don Quixote published
=&gt;All three above cited works contain distinctive “Double A” headpiece</p>

<p>1613: Final Shakespeare play “Two Noble Kinsmen” produced</p>

<p>1614-1616: Rosicrucian Manifestos published
=&gt;Fama Fraternitatis (1614), Confessio Fraternatatis (1615) &amp; The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (1616)</p>

<p>1623: Shakespeare’s First Folio published</p>

<p>Additionally, historian Frances Yates names several Shakespeare plays influenced by Rosicrucian teachings.
=&gt;Hamlet, King Lear, and The Tempest, et al.</p>

<p>Yates also stated that “Shakespeare’s thought in these Last Plays belongs to the evolution of the Renaissance hermetic-Cabalist tradition into Rosicrucianism.”</p>

<p>Rosicrucian societies met secretly, and swore to keep members’ identities secret to avoid persecution for their scientific and spiritual beliefs. </p>

<p>Conclusion: The plays attributed to Shakespeare were written by a circle of initiates to promote and perpetuate enlightenment values and ideas.</p>

<p>Manly P. Hall has some great insight into this mystery in The Secret Teachings of All Ages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I was there. he just sent me an email recently letting me know his plans have changed. doesn&#39;t sound like he will be releasing a book 2 instead he is working with some producer on a full length documentary. he hopes it will bring more attention to the tomb at Stratford and with more eyes brings more pressure to re-sanctify the tomb exposing its secrets. I am excited and bummed about it. Excited to see a documentary on it but bummed I wont get a signed copy of his new book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the version I have researched to some degree.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a wild ride. Under this hypothesis, Queen Elizabeth secretly bore her equerry (her most personal male retainer) named Robert Dudley, a friend and lover since teenagers, two children. Both were farmed out to families that had unimpeachable loyalty to Elizabeth. The older of the two was Francis Bacon, and the younger was Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex.</p>

<p>Francis was a genius. He traveled through europe, knew several languages, and had a classical education. Essex was a soldier and nobleman. Both of them were known favorites of Elizabeth as they grew up and took on their positions in the state hierarchy, but keeping a lower-status as a cover, like their father, Dudley.</p>

<p>So Elizabeth had a secret &quot;love-family&quot; right in or near her palace, hidden in plain sight, while she used her &quot;marriageable status&quot; for diplomatic advantage for over 20 years. </p>

<p>However, the end game was pretty awful. Both of her sons by Dudley knew or suspected they were of royal blood and wanted to get her to acknowledge them.
