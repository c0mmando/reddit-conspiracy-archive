       I ain't no lawyer but I think the law says you're innocent until proven guilty and the sentencing phase takes place after a guilty plea or conviction.

       If you're calling for someone to be hanged extra judicially, that's not adhering to the law, and is inciting violence.

       We need to tax the rich! How do we do that? If they don't pay, we (Government) come to them with guns drawn, and force them, if they don't... we throw them into a cage! This is not violence Citizen. Go YT cat videos. Nothing to see here... Shit, the puppy has a gun. ...and the family dog was resisting, and is now dead. Freedom!

       Pretty sure if someone is found guilty and sentenced to hang, it isn't from a tree, but from a gallows. Tree means  more like a Lynch mob, which means inciting violence.

       Same difference if you use the term "put in front of a first squad " vs "drug out in the street and shot"

       No. It seems to me that people, like those in TMOR, who regularly attack people in this subreddit, this subreddit as a whole, or the mods shouldn't be allowed to participate (read: banned). Someone being banned multiple times for doing just that and allowed back every time raises some questions.

        No. It seems to me that people, like those in TMOR, who regularly attack people in this subreddit, this subreddit as a whole, or the mods shouldn't be allowed to participate (read: banned).

       Do you know what spam is? He made a post that was really popular with the people on Reddit, and the mods delete it saying that he was trolling the PM of Canada, which meets any and every definition of BS.

       There was a coordinated effort to shape the narrative ofd what happened. If you go back to the old posts they are mostly new accounts and deleted accounts claiming most of the stuff against flytape. Outside forces had complete control of the story of what happened. All I know is that the reddit admins stepped in and got rid of a couple mods then they chose some of this sub's worst shills at the time to take the places.

        I was running as such before the 2016 election. I recused myself from modding Trump related conspiracies until after the election because of my obvious bias (that I make no efforts to hide). After the election I went back to my usual routine and a couple fellow mods had a shit fit, and they were more biased against Trump than I was for Trump. They were willing to excuse any level of anti-conspiracy sentiments so long as the users were anti-trump. I tried to deal with the problem in cooperation with the other mods for a solid year before I demodded everyone and started demanding they mod in the context of pro-conspiracy acceptable, anti-conspiracy bannable. Then the admins got involved (in less than 5 minutes) and stripped my mod permissions while they reinvited everyone back to the mod team. I was in the process of reinviting those who were willing to mod a conspiracy forum (not a news feed) when the admins fucked everything up.

       Did you not read what you posted Top Mind? The anti_Trump mods were allowing anti-conspiracy attacks as long as they were anti-Trump. The mods were creating a safe space for anti-Trump shills.

      <p>
       All the original community knew everything was about the one world order agenda (globalism). It always had been for decades. That was conspiracy bread and butter. And here comes a candidate working against that agenda stopping it in the tracks and we had paid teams of social media thought police CRT/Sharemoo, coming to this sub trying to flip the script and convince people to love and miss the illuminati one world government corrupt establishment. Paid brainwashing took over this sub and that is what flytape was truing to stop.

       It's snowflake behavior. It's what happens when you were raised getting a participation trophy and being told that all your feelings are precious. Flytape thinks he is a very special snowflake, and he is furious that anyone would have the gall to think differently.

       ahaha TopDoucheBagsofReddit... Wow.. I wonder how it feels to be the shitholes of the Internet.. I mean if your virtual life is that pathetic, could you imagine how these "people" must feel in real life, after they put down the screen? Do you think these "Top Minds" even enjoy living? smh.. I would too, would feel embrassed if I had to rely on manipulation in efforts to project my relevancy on the Internet. And for what purpose? It's a lost game. There are millions of intellectual human beings that are opening their minds and these "Top minds" are attempting to manipulate the thousands. lol what a fucking sad life.

       Other subs, mods, and admins had been trying to get rid of him for years. Making up BS and trying to turn the sub against him on several occasions over the years. Then the purge happened and some of the worst shills on the sub became mods. Then shilling was the new norm for this sub.

       He is entitled to an opinion and a political party right? All this stuff about alt accounts was made up to attack him and get a one sided partisan mod team. I documented this is several comment on this post.  They were coordinated attack on flytape by conspiratard and top minds making up stuff to get their guys on the mod team.

       Sure, but when it effects their modding then it is a problem. If they see one side as good and one side as evil, they probably shouldn't be moderating a subreddit that is supposed to see past the stupid Republican/Democrat divide.

       Except it is completely true. It was visible in the mod logs, it was visible in the threads these accounts commented in, and DronePuppet even admitted it himself in the end. There is literally zero doubt that he was using alt accounts and it actually confounds me that anyone could possibly deny it at this point.

       This part makes absolutely no sense to me because no mods were added to replace Flytape, DronePuppet, or SarahConnor when they were all removed. The only new mods in the last year are the ones who were just added a few months back, and none of them are even close to being TMOR or conspiritard or whatever else you want to accuse them of being. And despite plenty of complaints (including some by me) our mod team isn't 100% partisan for one "side" or the other. There are definitely some who I think are too partisan, but to say the entire mod team is too partisan (and all for one party) is just absurd. We have a few mods who appear to lean to the right, a couple who appear to lean to the left, and a bunch that I honestly have no clue about because they can keep their politics out of their modding.

       You mean the purge where all of the mods who were purged were re-added? That's not a very successful purge, now is it? The only mods who were removed were the ones who did the purge, SarahConnor and Flytape, and the one who was using alt accounts, DronePuppet. Flytape was even allowed to stay a member here and was included in the exclusive "conclave", so I'm guessing there weren't a whole lot of hard feelings between him and the other mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why you included those links, because they don't address the purge we are talking about at all. Two of them are years before the purge and one starts out complaining about TMOR and then just spams youtube links. What point are you trying to make by linking these posts?

       You kept changing the subject to the purge. The point of the links were to prove that flytape had been under outside attack from conspiratard and TMOR for fucking years.

       Wait, you think the four newest mods are shills? I haven't really heard anyone complain about their modding so far, and from watching the mod log it seems like they have been fairly unbiased with their modding (with a few notable exceptions).
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not the one changing the subject at all. You've failed to respond to just about anything I've said in any comment so far and keep changing the topic with each reply. I also feel like you keep trying to drag me into saying something that will break a rule (like calling mods shills, attacking certain mods for the political beliefs, etc) so I think this is where I'm going to end it for the night. I have to wake up for work in six hours anyway, so I'm going to sleep.

       Okay? What does that have anything to do with what we are talking about? Like I mentioned in my other comment, the ex-mod we are discussing literally ran a right-wing partisan subreddit where you were not allowed to criticize the majority of our government. You need to make up your mind, are we judging people by their other subreddits or not? If he's breaking any rules, report him to the mods and get him banned. If he isn't breaking any rules, then I'm not sure why you are even telling me about it.

       You didn't even read my comment all the way through, did you? I said some mods definitely have political leanings. But as a whole the mod team doesn't all lean one way or the other. There are two or three mods who lean very far to the right, the one you mentioned leans pretty far to the left, and the rest are all a bit less clear to me. Most of the newest mods are definitely right-leaning to a certain extent as well, but I honestly don't think any of them are biased about it. Well, except for one, but he has apparently been suspended.

       Yes I read your whole comment. Maybe you could point it out for me?

        Okay? What does that have anything to do with what we are talking about? Like I mentioned in my other comment, the ex-mod we are discussing literally ran a right-wing partisan subreddit where you were not allowed to criticize the majority of our government. You need to make up your mind, are we judging people by their other subreddits or not? If he's breaking any rules, report him to the mods and get him banned. If he isn't breaking any rules, then I'm not sure why you are even telling me about it.

       Sorry, I guess it was in the other comment chain you have going with me. I have to keep jumping back and forth between the two conversations and got confused. Another reason I should probably go to bed.

       Here's the quote:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And despite plenty of complaints (including some by me) our mod team isn't 100% partisan for one "side" or the other. There are definitely some who I think are too partisan, but to say the entire mod team is too partisan (and all for one party) is just absurd. We have a few mods who appear to lean to the right, a couple who appear to lean to the left, and a bunch that I honestly have no clue about because they can keep their politics out of their modding.

       Right after being de-modded he posted in t_d saying he tried his best to get rid of the liberals in this sub.  He was a shitty mod.  He deleted his main account, but I’m guessing he’s still around and using more than a few alts.

        Except for the fact, that it wasn't. Worse is said on the daily on this website, however, the limp dicks over at TMOR declared  Jihad on various users/mods of this sub, yet, nothing ever happens to them.

       It was, it was even in the mod log. If you see worse you should report it and post the details when nothing happens.
