<p>Look at the participants. Look at who the triads backed. This is standard. Marxism is not a political ideology as I&#39;m sure we were all taught. Communism is not a way to organize society It is in fact organized crime. We see the evidence of a standard protection racket wherever it rears its ugly head.  You can&#39;t understand history if you still think communist revolutions are grassroots movements organized by peasant farmers.</p>

<p>Early in his political career, in 1915, Kaganovich became a Communist organizer at a shoe-factory where he worked.</p>

<p>You continue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They hide behind these different labels Stalinist Trotskyite lennonist. It&#39;s just a way to confuse the masses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well no, they point to significant theoretical differences which have political consequences.  For example, Stalinism is an affirmation of Marxist-Lenninism with a view that socialism can be built in one country, and that the USSR reached this stage, Trotskyism, holds that the USSR was not socialist, but rather a &#39;deformed workers state&#39;,  and that socialism is an international project achieved to a state of permanent revolution. Leninism was already defined for you. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, I thought global law was some kind of NWO project?  What global law was violated that made them a global criminal cabal?</p>

<p>Yes, yes, we are all individuals pursuing our own self interest, capitalism is great, and made is free, etc, etc,. </p>

<p>I am not dismissing ideas by calling out the trolling.  If you want my serious thinking on shit like this, it is the following.  You are repeating false claims that have their resurgence on 4chan among the fascist revival.  It is anti-semetic in the real sense, as it is because of irrational hatred of the jews.  You are regurgitating actual fascist propaganda, that has its genesis in the reactionary white movement in Russia, that was mediated through the Nazi party through their &#39;Cultural Bolshevism&#39; crap, and that was recycled through paleo-conservatives by resurrecting it through the Cultural Marxism crap by Lind.  </p>

<p>It is not rooted in fact, it is just of distortions rooted in innuendo.  You don&#39;t want to actually engage with facts, as evidenced by your distortions of the communist movement, and the bolshevik party. </p>

<p>There is no communism to implement, communism is not a social formation to implement.  It is a movement that abolishes exploitative social relations, i,e,. capital. </p>

<p>This is what I mean about starting at the begging. </p>

<p>Think about what Marx and Engels meant by this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.</p>

<p>Here I don&#39;t know what you are referencing.  Just for the sake of accuracy however, there was no communist Russia.  Stalin claimed that the USSR reached socialism in once country.  But I know fascist don&#39;t actually care for facts. </p>

<p>So wait wait wait, your evidence that pre Revolution photographs were altered en masse is that Rasputin was like really tall, but he looks short in pictures. </p>

<p>How about the obvious.  The claim that Rasputin was like really tall is not true.  </p>

<p>What do you think happens when you are dying in the United States &amp; your insurance runs out. It&#39;s called &#39;managed care&#39;....they pump you up with drugs &amp; let you die ..... because they &quot;ran out of treatment options&quot;.</p>

<p>It should be called murder unless the person wants to die.</p>

<p>We coat our murders in softer words to appear more human. It&#39;s a fucking charade for morons hypnotized by tv &amp; nationalism.</p>

<p>Insulin became so expensive people are being killed by economic left &amp; right.</p>

<p>My family lived after Stalin under Communism &amp; loved it. They still talk about how great it was. Their are tons of old timers on Russian forums going on &amp; on about how great it was. All it takes is Google translate to verify for yourself.</p>

<p>People had to share production of their farm goods to ship to help areas that were suffering because of Trofim_Lysenko&#39;s bad advice that hurt the Ukrainian people. Great grand parents were happy to do it.</p>

<p>They had house calls from doctors for anything. They came right away.
No one locked their doors. Weren&#39;t afraid for children to be out late playing because nothing ever happened like child kidnapping etc.</p>

<p>Everybody had a roof over their head.</p>

Fact 2 so-called communist countries are actually socialist countries none of them have achieved a communist state as described by Marx. 
We can disagree about whether these things are good and bad but we have to be on the same page about what the words mean to have a conversation. 
I agree that corrupt governments can become criminal Enterprises. Let me suggest to you though that&#39;s criminal cartels and Mafia Enterprise very happy to exist in a capitalist system. It is only through representative government that we the people can regulate mobsters and criminals. Is representative government a communist ideal to you? Or is it capitalist? Or are those stupid questions because representative government is decided by the people in the context of history and mutual understanding and shared experience I mean come on read a fucking book about Marx before you make a post like this.

Marx was far too idealistic. Many &#39;marxists&#39; take issue with &#39;Marx&#39;. Realize that it&#39;s not simple.<br/>

It is verifiably not an &quot;ideal,&quot; since it ends in failure or voluntary dissolution every time it is tried.
