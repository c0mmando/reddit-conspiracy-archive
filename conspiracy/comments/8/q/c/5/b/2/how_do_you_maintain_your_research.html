       I'm interested in how
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users keep track of their research. What tools do you use to organize your data and thoughts? How do you keep links to sources associated with the facts you draw from them? How do you differentiate between facts that you've sourced from somewhere and inferences that you draw from various facts (like, if you see that two people are associated because they have businesses that interact, you might infer that those people interact and share certain interests. That inference can be used in future inferences, but it's important to remember that it is itself an inference, and to be able to find the reason you made the inference. How do you track that, and how do you weight that fact for contributions to future inferences?).
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask because I'm having some difficulties in managing various records of my own, which makes it slower to find interesting correlations. I'm hoping others can make some suggestions on tools and techniques for managing and processing information.

       What sort of database?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm particularly interested in tools that can be used to easily combine images and text on the same page, and that can link them back to sources inside or outside the tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some kind of meta-analysis tool would be useful too, a way to see a network graph of how pages relate to each other, how links propagate through the graph, how many nodes a link traverses from it's root, etc.

       I have alumni access to a number of databases through my university's library. Most public libraries have access to these sort of Boolean databases however.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're talking about is something akin to open source analysis tools I believe. I'll check into it, but I'd recommend a search for "open source analysis databases"

       That's a great list, but it appears to me mostly information sources rather than tools for managing and analyzing information.

       I may not be recognizing the tools though, if anyone could point out specific items to focus on, that would be great.

       That's pretty much what I'm doing. Reading and studying stuff is of course necessary and unavoidable, but as the collection of information grows I'm finding that I keep 'rediscovering' stuff in my own collection, and that it's kind of tedious to annotate things with references in other articles, and to follow those references.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hoping maybe there are some rich-text type tools kind of like One Note or EverNote that are well-suited to this kind of data management.

       This is what I'm struggling with. It feels like there should be a lower-resistance tool along the like of Evernote and OneNote, but with some simple analysis tools built in. Things like Evernote's web-clipper tool make data extraction and citing pretty easy, but it starts getting really messy when you have layered lot of your own analysis, links, and notes about additional ideas to investigate.

       It's nothing really ground-breaking as far as actual content, if I'm honest about it I'm not really very perceptive about seeing potential connections when doing research (although the link to a list of potential sources
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8qc5b2/how_do_you_maintain_your_research/e0i1uex/">
        here
       </a>
       may help me with that).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I tend to focus on is information quality. For example, when someone here does a big wall-of-text dump with links (I love that!) I grab a copy and start tearing it down to double-check claims and isolate the various facts and inferences, and I try to put some kind of reliability guesstimate on each fact and then track how things chain together. I apply a kind of Bayesian weighting to chains so that when I start getting into third- and forth- generation inferences the reliability guesstimate is really low. When that happens you have to go back and see if you can find evidence for the low-reliability facts to bring them up, or maybe quit chasing that lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I write this stuff down because evidently my memory is pretty shit compared to some people who do this (years ago I had a couple of cop friends who just fucking amazed me with the way they could soak up information and recall it in the field. One guy was a god-damned wizard with face recognition, a couple of times we were driving somewhere and he'd whip the car into a parking spot and call his on-duty buddies to report the location of some gang member he spotted and recognized from some information earlier in the week. Half the time I don't even recognize my coworkers if I see them at the grocery store instead of the office).
      </p>
      <p>
       A few times my notes have become such a mess that I just have to toss the whole thing out, which sucks. That's why I'm looking for other people's methods, my way is such a shit-show that I can't reliably get more than a few levels deep before everything is so hard to find that it's too much work.

       I'm a software developer, so I'm familiar with common software development management techniques. It seems like it would be difficult to do knowledge analysis with that general tool set. Can you describe how you would use a tool like that to, for example, produce and explore a graph of links between wiki nodes?

       Managing it like a software project might be the wrong way to phrase it, but I would use the tools I commonly use.  So I would start by creating a new repo for a research project, probably git or svn.  Since both will take any file, binary executables, full databases, etc I would store everything in there, which would allow me to easily track changes to text files, as well as when new files were added.  You can even commit full databases(probably sqlite for small projects), so even if the changes aren't easily trackable with git I can always load the two versions of the databases locally and compare them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the graph of wiki nodes example,STart by making a new repository
       <br/>
       (or branch in existing, whatever you are more comfortable with). Then I would create probably use python with NetworkX (
       <a href="https://networkx.github.io">
        https://networkx.github.io
       </a>
       ) and Scrapy or BeautifulSoup(not including links because those are pretty popular tools) to create the graph and write it to a file.  Once that file is written add it to the repo, maybe add the script to make the graph as well.  Once I work out the stuff in the repo I would probably start a wiki page as a way to store the products/pictures/graph visualizations/wahtever.  On the wiki page I could also keep track of the inferences and other stuff.  This personal wiki can be used for a bunch of other stuff as well and makes it easy to link to pages internally and externally(I would treat it like a big scratch pad to write random ideas and other stuff).  The calendar and countdown timers could also be useful for scheduling tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phabricator might not be the perfect tool for this, but I would feel good about having the repos, wiki, calendar, and other stuff in one place.  Most version control systems are great at handling text and image files, and the other stuff is just for convenience.

       Ok, I see. I could make that work, but I'm hoping to find some good tools that I don't have to develop myself. Partly because I would like to focus on working on the knowledge, not on developing/debugging my own tools, but also because I'm hoping that existing tools will introduce me to some well-developed practices for managing information in this way.

       I have a few book lists, buy the books (physically), underline mostly everything in each book of use, star key sentences and jot down notes in the headers, footers and sides (any open space in the book). I don't really organize anything online.

       Not the best system, as I seem like a book hoarder. But, when I see the knowledge at an affordable price, I gotta pounce on the purchase.

       That's a great question. To me there are a few parts to it. I start with watching/reding other people's ideas, then when I see one that looks interesting or is related to something I'm already working with, a make a copy and start breaking it down and trying to verify and annotate various pieces to see how much of it seems like bullshit, I wrote some about that

       Some things are absolutely loaded with bullshit, like the flat Earth stuff. In that area some content producers are clearly just having fun misleading gullible people, and some others have genuine questions. There are other theories, like the pedogate/pizzagate stuff, where it's a big mix, some of it is bring-your-boots-deep bullshit, and some of it is why-aren't-these-people-already-in-jail level, with plenty of in-between material.

       I won't discuss that here because that's not the information I'm after in this topic.

      <p>
       I am of course aware that there being a lot of people putting out BS/misinformation on a given subject should not be interpreted as evidence for or against that subject. Deliberate misinformation can have many uses, and identifying it and guessing at the motivations of it's source is tricky and error-prone. Avoiding those errors is part of what I'm working on.
