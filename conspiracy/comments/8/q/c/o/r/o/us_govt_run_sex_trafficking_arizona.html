Originally posted to Facebook.</p>

<p>Ex-Military members stumbled upon a rape camp / child trafficking camp in Tucson AZ while searching for homeless veterans that needed help in the area. Tucson police are protecting the rape/trafficking camp from veterans and local citizens who are demanding answers. Apparently Arizona is a main hub for child trafficking in the USA, and the police protect the interests of the elites and the Mexican drug cartels that work for the elites by kidnapping children and selling them to the highest bidder. Here&#39;s where it gets good....</p>

<ul>
<li>Land is owned by CEMEX.</li>
<li>CEMEX is a partner of the Clinton Global Initiative and $100million donor to Clinton Foundation.</li>
<li>CEMEX linked to Haiti through Clinton Foundation.</li>
<li>CEMEX is also owned by Bronfman-Rothschilds.</li>
<li>Sara Bronfman/husband becomes head of Libya-USA trade initiative.</li>
<li>CEMEX is under U.S. DOJ Investigation (March 14th / Reuters Article).</li>
</ul>

<p>And here&#39;s where it goes even deeper:</p>

<p>Emiliano Salinas is the son of the former President of Mexico. Salinas in an ex-member of NXIVM, the Hollywood cartel with sex trafficking ties. Remember a few weeks back? SMALLVILLE actress ALLISON MACK self-admitted  her involvement in the NXIVM organization, and has since been arrested for her role.</p>

<p>Salinas worked for Lazard Investments. Lazard Investments is connected to George Soros.</p>

<p>JONATHON ROTHSCHILD is the Mayor of Tucson, and he owns the Pima County Sheriff.</p>

<p>The veterans that stumbled upon this site, are part of &quot;VOP.&quot; VOP is a group that patrols the streets and tries to rescue veterans who are homeless, drug addicted or impaired in some fashion. VOP discovered this site by chance, from INTEL gathered from their street operations in the search for veterans at the camp site when evidence was found that implicated the site as a child-sex trafficking site.</p>

<p>They have found hair combs with blonde hair. They have found boxes with children&#39;s toys, AND NEXT TO THE TOYS ARE USED CONDOMS. Graves have been discovered. The Tucson Police and the FBI REFUSE to come to the location where the crime scene evidence was located.</p>

<p>KGUN television in Tucson is MOCKING the reports of the VOP, which isn&#39;t surprising. The media is just as guilty as the politicians and elites running child trafficking rings, and they won&#39;t ever speak out of turn in fear of getting fired.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been telling people about the reality of child trafficking / child rape / child murder for at least 4 years now...this is not a joke. If you care about children, you should care about the unfolding scenario.</p>

<p>All of the above is most likely connected to the WALMART video from yesterday, showing police guarding the door and not giving any answers explaining why children are being held inside. This is ALL connected to the Clinton Foundation, as they play a huge role in child trafficking / child sacrifice all over the globe.</p>

It&#39;s crazy that I even have to say this, but there are A LOT of people who trust SNOPES when questioning the validity of the above information..... DO NOT TRUST SNOPES TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT ANYTHING. They are not the &quot;end all / be all&quot; of truth. Would you go to OJ Simpson for the murder weapon? Would you go to the Vatican and ask them to tell you how and why they kill children? Hell no you wouldn&#39;t. So why would you ask Snopes if anything is true or false when their SILENT INVESTORS are the VERY PEOPLE TRYING TO COVER UP THIS STORY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snopes has discredited shit ive literally been at or heard. Things that come out as fact have been put as false on snopes. Lol. Guys on the ground right now are mixed up in this. I am following it and it is very disturbing. Never said it is 100% true. Shit like this is encountered everyday and kept from the public. You can find shit you wouldnt believe on the dark web and interviews or videos from guys on scene. And to think this couldnt be real???  It is real and these people need to be removed from this earth.<br/>
This specific situation in Tucson? Who knows. Thats why its in conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally have no problem with people following what&#39;s going on as long as both sides get something approximating equal representation and I don&#39;t think that is happening in this sub. Snopes for one can largely fuck off, they&#39;ve proven themselves propaganda on a couple of issues and I can no longer take what they say without a grain of salt. However, you are failing to mention Snopes isn&#39;t the only one calling bullshit on VoP:</p>

<p>Craig Sawyer former Navy SEAL and founder of V4CR (Veterans for Child Rescue) gives an update on the situation in Tuscon:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/rAVuAvkE6bM">https://youtu.be/rAVuAvkE6bM</a></p>

<p>Sawyer&#39;s wiki page:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Sawyer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Sawyer</a></p>

<p>Also, It looks like the people who produced An Open Secret are calling Meyer a fraud as well.</p>

<p>Also, the Pima County Medical Examiner determined it (the skull) to be the remains of an adult:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/human-skull-found-in-remote-arizona-desert/75-562454733">https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/human-skull-found-in-remote-arizona-desert/75-562454733</a></p>

<p>Also a bit disingenuous to say Veterans patrolling the desert found the camp when it appears you convienently left out the fact that Micheal Lewis Meyer, founder of Veterans on Patrol is not actually a veteran at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see so many anti-investigation people flipping their shit in comments on Tucson posts, but not getting all melodramatically opposed to <em>any other</em> ludicrous conspiracy theory posted on this sub. Why do these people care how others spend their time investigating what they claim to be a non-issue? If it&#39;s nothing, fine, or if it&#39;s something other than child trafficking, fine, it turns out to be something else. But don&#39;t give me the political garbage line about slandering a politician&#39;s &quot;good name&quot; just because people want to know why all this shady shit is going down, esp on the border. By signing up for public office, politicians likewise sign themselves up to public scrutiny and speculation, hence why they are called <strong>&quot;PUBLIC SERVANTS&quot;</strong>. </p>

<p><em>The key point is this:</em> The only people who could care enough to deter virtual strangers from fully investigating a potential child trafficking ring are people who have something to lose by further investigation. </p>

<p>We know for a fact that people, including children, and trafficked into the US against their will for various work, including sex. Many come across Mexico&#39;s border. They have to get here somehow and stop along the way. Why not there?</p>

<p>And...?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>NXIVM is based on the east-coast, it&#39;s not a &quot;hollywood cartel&quot;. The &quot;sex-trafficking&quot; committed by NXIVM members bears no resemblance to the kind that VOP alleges is occuring in Tuscon. NXIVM&#39;s top leadership brainwashed adult women into joining Raniere&#39;s harem, and those women willingly traveled with him. How does that connect with abducted children being carried through the desert and bound to &quot;rape-trees&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Salinas worked for Lazard Investments. Lazard Investments is connected to George Soros.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Playing 8 degrees of separation doesn&#39;t add any credence to your story. What&#39;s the connection to Soros? That Lazard Investments worked with CEMEX which Soros is invested in? Did Salinas personally manage the relationship with Soros or his company? Was he involved with CEMEX in his role at Lazard investments? What are you actually alleging?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quick note. I appreciate you trying to bring more attention to this case and what appears to be a human / child trafficking waypoint. </p>

<p>To convince the skeptics, it&#39;s vital that we stick to the facts. I haven&#39;t seen any evidence or testimony about used condoms. That said, they reportedly did find sex lubricant. Also, no graves. But keep in mind that human traffickers want to get their &quot;product&quot; through alive, because they are only valuable alive. There are other voluntary migrants who don&#39;t make it through the desert alive, that&#39;s a separate thing we shouldn&#39;t conflate. </p>

<p>Also the TPD did visit the site. Whether they did sufficient investigation before the site was bulldozed by the property owners is another question entirely. </p>
