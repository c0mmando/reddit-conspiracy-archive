      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are two profound differences in the chemistry of lunar regolith and soil from terrestrial materials. The first is that the Moon is very dry. As a result, those minerals with water as part of their structure such as clay, mica, and amphiboles are totally absent from the Moon. The second difference is that lunar regolith and crust are chemically reduced, rather than being significantly oxidized like the Earth's crust. In the case of the regolith, this is due in part to the constant bombardment of the lunar surface with protons (i.e. hydrogen (H) nuclei) from the solar wind. One consequence is that iron on the Moon is found in the metallic 0 and +2 oxidation state, whereas on Earth iron is found primarily in the +2 and +3 oxidation state.

       IIRC the moon crashed into the earth a long time ago when the solar system was forming and the earth took a large part of the dense metal material and what was left over makes up the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought the moon was made up of feldspar which does exist on earth as well.

       Best case scenario its people who dont know how to use the instrumentation.

      <p>
       I have 2 coolers, one with a lid, one without.
      </p>
      <p>
       I put a cold drink into both. Which one will warm up quicker? The one that is in the cooler without the lid, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So do I proclaim that the lid on the cooler has a cooling effect?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, thats dumb. There was no lid so heat was able to radiate away more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens on clear nights where the moon is visible? There is no cloud cover AKA no lid on the box.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are clouds its like having a lid on a cooler, it doesnt leak heat as easily.

       The moon is its own light source, it radiates cold, and it's an energy transformer.  It's hollow and you can bounce lasers off of it.  It's orbit is not dictated by gravity.

       you can use thermometers in the moonlight when it's full - they will read several degrees cooler.  It's noticeable - no mainstream scientist can explain this at all.  They always claims it's space sucking the heat off the planet - which of course is total nonsense.  You can further prove it's the moonlight that's cooling by using a magnifying class - it will intensify the effect.

       I've already done this research - I've spoken to actual professionals with physics degrees - there is no explanation.  The magnifying glass amplifying the effect suggests it's a property of the light itself.  That's what no one can explain - thanks for confirming it.

       then the answer is one that any amateur astronomer can know.

      <p>
       The night sky is cold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Objects exposed to the night sky will radiate their heat into it. Objects exposed to less of the sky (such as under a tree) can "see" less of the sky and will radiate less heat to the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the same reason amateur astronomers put tubes in front of their telescopes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/dealing-with-dew/">
        http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/dealing-with-dew/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti-dew tubes have no optics and can be made of anything you fancy. They do nothing except stop the lens at the front "seeing" a large part of the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - that article even says "grass in the middle of a field white with frost or dew while grass near a tree has none". Its exactly the same effect as the "shade" in the youtube video.

       If, as claimed, a magnifying glass creates "cold" from the light of the Moon, you should be able to point it at a

       or a heat engine and generate free energy from warmer temperature of the ambient air.

       Of course you can easily check for yourself that the Moon does no such thing by looking at it with an infrared camera and seeing that it radiates heat.

       Really? What were the dozens of times and different conditions you used?
      </p>
      <p>
       I notice most of the videos which claim that Moonlight has a magical cooling effect cover up one object while leaving the other in open air, and don't provide a control where they do the same experiment without the moon being out. So I made sure to in my own trials.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my experiments I noticed that the target exposed to open air was cooler every time, whether the Moon was out or not, whatever its phase, cloudy or not, etc. The results were clearly that something more exposed to the open air was cooler, rather than that the Moon had anything to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget to also look at the Moon through an infrared camera. Have you done that? I have although some years ago.

      <p>
       If you have two thermometers, just leave one in the moonlight and one in the shade.  The one in the moonlight will read colder every time, usually by about 2-3 degrees.

       Again, radiative cooling is a total joke.  It does not hold up to any scrutiny - it's a myth.  It's a religious belief.  Would love to hear your thoughts :)

       Indeed, and as I said I noticed such a temperature difference every time for the object in "shade" whether the Moon was out or not.

       What were the dozens of conditions under which you did your own experiment?

       No, I don't think it's a forgery. I think it lacks any sort of control group. As I said is a common mistake above, the maker of this video did not perform a control experiment where they did the same thing but with the Moon not being out. When I did that with the Moon not being out, just the open air, I got the same sort of results.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suppose you would think these videos using thermal/infrared cameras are forgeries?

       Aiming an infrared camera at the moon seems like a diversionary tactic on your part to me - I don't have any experience doing this sort of test and I'm not sure what it would measure because I would have to further research the nature of the thermal and infrared cameras before I really speak on the matter - I would have to look into it.  Thanks again for the idea though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting - I'm telling you that radiative cooling as a substitute explanation for the cooling properties of moonlight is total bunk and easily falsifiable with less than $20 of equipment - one which I have responsibly performed with a control, successfully, over a dozen times.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes to answer your question - I have also used a control - I have also used the thermometers on various nights without a full moon - such as a new moon or a partial moon.  There was some very small fluctuations but no particular trend I noticed under non-full moon conditions.  During a new moon, for instance, the nights are very dark and there was no temperature difference across the thermometers.  Full moon brings out the temperature differences every time though.

       No - I'm sure radiative cooling does apply in many situations.  But moonlight is cooling.  Currently the only explanation given EVER to try explain away this phenomenon is "radiative cooling" - which is all I ever hear, and it does not address why the magnifying glass would further decrease the temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think the magnifying glass further reduces the temperature?  That's the heart of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have my data here - these experiments were generally informal - but the experimental design still works.  If radiative cooling were the only effect in operation, the lenses, as I mentioned before, would INCREASE the temperature.  However, the lenses focusing the moonlight consistently FURTHER DECREASE the temperature.  Why do you think that could be?

       Even if you assume this is true, the claimed difference of 2-3 degrees is not nearly enough to account for the difference in temperatures at night, yes? Especially since it is cooler at night even when the Moon isn't out, I'm sure you agree.

       So far you have offered absolutely NO EXPLANATION for the lens further decreasing the temperature.  Don't worry, you're not alone.  No one has been able to explain it thus far.  That's why this is relevant and I continue to talk about it.  Thanks for trying.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In my experiments I noticed that the target exposed to open air was cooler every time, whether the Moon was out or not, whatever its phase, cloudy or not, etc. The results were clearly that something more exposed to the open air was cooler, rather than that the Moon had anything to do with it.

       You do not mention lenses at all.  I think I've caught you making a false claim.  Please try the experiment sometime with a magnifying lens if you're interested.  Otherwise, keep believing whatever you want - I'll be using science to demonstrate how full of shit the entire mainstream cosmology is.  Cheers and thanks for your ideas.

       Incorrect. I was emphasizing the importance of making a control group, and the various conditions under which I did trials, not describing exactly how each trial was conducted.

       I'm speaking informally on reddit, I'm not trying to publish anything.  As we have discussed, my experimental design meets all the rigors you set out - I have a control and everything.  I'm not sure if you're aware, but you've come to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to engage with me.  It's a subreddit - it's not a science journal - and despite discussing this here, my experimental design was flawless - it met all the criteria you set forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, your attempts to attack my rigor are very transparent to me - especially because you continue to do it after we have already established my experiment is fine and it's simply my results that you don't like.  You clearly want to deny this phenomenon exists because you can't explain it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not really concerned if you don't believe my claims.  Thanks again for trying to distract from the fact that you obviously lied about doing experiments.  By your own words you completely omitted the lens component of the experiment, which is critical to proving that it's a property of the light.  I am now suspicious that you have even performed the version which you initially described.  You seem more like a contrarian trying to win an argument than someone interested in finding the truth.

       Generally, I've found people that are willing to lie that quickly and easily probably lie all the time :)

       Go ahead and keep replying if you want to, I'm done here.  I've shown everyone here that you are not to be trusted and will lie to try to prove whatever point you may be arguing.  Have a nice night.

I'm not asking you or anyone to believe me - I don't care if you do.  It's very telling that you apparently feel some kind of need to continue to try to argue with me even though I don't care what you think of me.  Sorry but you've clearly demonstrated enough character weakness (willingness to lie) that your opinion does not matter to me :)

       As I have repeatedly explained to you, I described the conditions under which the experiment was performed. I am happy to discuss more details about how it was done, and the many other experiments I have done, but you seem to have decided to run away from this discussion instead.

        You didn't answer, but do you agree that the Earth cools off at night even when the Moon isn't out?
       </strong>
       This is a simple yes or no question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer (yes) contradicts your claim that radiative cooling is "a myth," although you quickly backtracked on that claim and admitted that it does exist.

       I claim it cannot possibly be the sole reason for the temperature difference I observed and you continually try to mischaracterize what I said in order to make me seem less credible.  Here's my previous answer:

      <blockquote>

        No - I'm sure radiative cooling does apply in many situations.

       Good, so you agree that the Earth is cooler at night even when the Moon is not out. Remember, though, your initial claim was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        radiative cooling is a total joke. It does not hold up to any scrutiny - it's a myth. It's a religious belief.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is radiative cooling a myth? Or does it exist? You quickly backtracked on your claim and admitted that it does exist. So why did you claim it was a "myth" before?

       I said it was a joke as a full explanation of the effect of the experiment - which I control for with the magnifying lens that you did not include.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then after you goaded me for a while, I clarified my position.  Radiative cooling does exist (I never denied that it did, only objected to your claim that it was reason I was getting a temperature difference) but it does not explain why a magnifying lens further decreases the temperature reads from a thermometer during a full moon.

      <p>
       So, what do you think of my suggested experiment? Are nights with a full Moon generally cooler than nights with a new Moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, if the Moon is required to explain the cooling of the Earth at night fully, there should be a significant decrease in nighttime temperature when it is out, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I have read so far suggests either no difference or a minuscule but statistically significant temperature
       <em>
        increase
       </em>
       with a full Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you find any data which suggests that there is a decrease in temperature on nights with a full Moon vs. a new Moon?

       Honestly, I wasn't even aware the term "radiative cooling" applied beyond the topic of the earth cooling at night.  If you look at the wikipedia article on the topic, it's the only type of radiative cooling all that's mentioned.  Look.

       I'm not concerned with trying to broaden this to include speculation and other nonsense.  I posted my experiment - which you have claimed to have imitated (falsely).

       That's not what I am doing. You directly made a claim that that the moon "radiates cold" and cools things down when they are in its light. Should this not apply to the Earth?

       I see that you will not provide any data or evidence that there is a decrease in temperature on nights with a full Moon vs. a new Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not "speculation" to check the widely available data for temperature over time and compare it against the phases of the moon.

       Where did I make this claim?  I believe I've only said it's a property of the moonlight.  I don't know what the moon is and I am only speaking of moonlight on a full moon - I am not claiming the moon radiates cold.  The cooling doesn't seem to be present unless the moon is full or near-full.

       As I have told you repeatedly (you don't listen) I don't care about your opinion - I don't have to answer any questions from you.  I've already answered that question, and you didn't listen.  You were probably busy thinking about how you wanted to attack me next.

       You did not... You explicitly said you had answered the question about "global" temperatures even though I was explicitly asking for "local" ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want to answer the question that is fine. But claiming to have answered the "local" question is a direct contradiction with what you have said before.

       Yes I do.  And I have answered your question.  But of course, you have not been actually reading anything I write, you just want to continue to attack my position.
      </p>
      <p>
       The experiment works fine - the one you lied about performing yourself.  In your own words, you omitted the most crucial part of the experiment - and then you lied about.  Persistently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again - because apparently you have not been reading my words - I am not going to give in to your little question game.  I have already addressed it - it's that simple.  Sorry if you didn't like what I had to say.  It's over - the experiment stands with your lies and blatant tactical errors in this discussion.

       .  Really, please take a break and try to enjoy yourself in whatever way you wish.  It seems like you really need a break from this - you're just repeating yourself senselessly.  And as I have stated repeatedly, I have already answered it.  Not sure what your malfunction is but I would recommend a break from the internet for you my friend.  Cheers and have a good one.

       At this point it seems possible you might genuinely not understand the difference between
       <em>
        global
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        local

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...maybe you should investigate
        <strong>
         <em>
          local
         </em>
        </strong>
        data and see if there is any correlation there?
       </p>
       <p>
        Do you think it is cooler in your area when the moon is full, compared to when it is not? If not, why not?
       </p>

      <p>
       Do you claim to have answered this
       <strong>
        local
       </strong>
       question (specifically
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       about
       <strong>
        global
       </strong>
       temperatures) even though your response was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I already answered your question about the full moon and it's impact on
        <strong>

        temperature
       </p>

      <p>
       If you don't want to answer this
       <strong>
        <em>

       question, that is fine. But you are claiming to have answered it and you clearly have not.

       Otherwise, please link to the comment where you answered the
       <strong>

       There is no harassment here. I am being politely insistent on a question which you have falsely claimed to have answered. I am not trying to provoke you in any way--only trying to show you the difference between the "global" question (which you answered) and the "local" question (which you have not, although you claim to have done so).

       There are two questions:

        <em>

       question.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) A
       <strong>
        <em>
         local
        </em>
       </strong>
       question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you claiming to have answered #2, the
       <strong>
        <em>
         local
        </em>
       </strong>
       question? If so, only link to your

       You are being perhaps deliberately unclear and evasive here. I have asked you two questions, plural. You keep saying things like, "I answered you" and "I answered your question" (singular).

      <p>
       I am asking you if you are claiming to have answered

        <em>
         both

       </strong>
       (plural) questions. You can acknowledge that you understand this by saying something like "yes I have answered
       <strong>
        both questions
       </strong>
       " and linking to the comment where you answered the second one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems likely that you just want to avoid answering the second, local question.

       close, but no cigar. It's more that a cooler with a lid is a more contained system than the one without, therefore when the outside environment tries to equalize the inside of whatever object you've cooled, it's stopped by the lid, however it still will warm up to the temperature of the container, not as quickly though.

        unusually large size

        perfect distance from earth so that the moon and sun appear to be the exact same size

       . So many coincidences...

       IDK, you just kind of figure it out.  They tell you in 8th grade science that the Sun is plasma and stars are gas.

       This stuff is like the "proof" or whatever.  Zoom cameras are actually so good and cheap, that you can zoom in and see what's really going on.  My vision is good enough I can see stars shimmer with eyes.  But, there's videos online where people recreate the stars and planets in a lap.  They are just gas bubbles with electric frequency causing them to take their shape.

       The pictures you see are fake.  You can't go to a telescope and get pictures like that.  They have to be rendered, and it takes months or years.  So, IDK what the fuck you are talking about, but it has zero basis in reality.

       I like to star gaze as well (up to about a 200X magnification). That doesn't mean I believe what science says is up there. In fact, the more you look up there, the less you believe what school has taught about space. I have a feeling it's the skeptics who are more likely to look up in the sky, while the true believers tend to stay inside and quote books.

       Man-made or natural, I don't believe anything mainstream science says about it: the size, distance, tides, and the way the surface of it was formed. Watching it in a telescope, you'll see rough crater terrain and then it's impossibly smooth, making me think it's all a perfectly smooth surface under an uneven crust. I don't think the craters are from impacts or volcanic, either. They look more like bubbles popped or something to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, I love Moon-gazing. It's fascinating to see it up close, and I recommend it to anyone, whether they believe in the lies of mainstream science or seek the truth, it's still beautiful.

       To me the craters look like an impact through a thin layer of crust of rock over a much harder layer of something very hard, almost like a metal hull.

       There definitely could be something hard on it, or the whole thing made of a hard metal or something else smooth. Ancient Aliens did an episode on that, that was actually pretty cool with visual models of what the Moon might look like if it was "extra terrestrial" made.

       I'm also trying to catch sight of sun spots with my solar filter and track them throughout the day as they rotate like a wheel. Someday I'll invest in a nice telescope because it really is amazing to look at that stuff.

       It gives out plasma.  It's not a ball of gas, but the plasma is a state of matter that comes from the electricity that it is transforming into the plasma.  It's reasonable that the plasma emitted is hydrogen... but the Sun isn't hydrogen; it's a transformer turning electricity into plasma to make heat.

       Interesting question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect they are both transformers, or energy converters, that work independently of each other. They are kinda like really advanced, and large, lightbulbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not known where their energy comes from, so really I have no answer for you. But, I think it’s clear they are taking energy in and converting it to hot or cold.

       You can't convert to cold if that is what you are saying.

       No, a refrigerator is a heat pump. It doesn't create cold. It moves heat.

       This is why the condenser tubes on the back of a refrigerator get warm or hot, because that is where the heat is going.

       In the same way, thermal radiation is a transfer of heat from the object which is radiating. There is no such thing as radiating cold as you have suggested in some of your comments.

      <p>
       No. The Earth radiates heat all around it and that is how it cools down. When you shine a bright lamp on something, that thing doesn't just keep getting hotter forever. It radiates heat to its surroundings, even as they are also radiating heat to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hotter it gets, the more heat it radiates, until it reaches a steady state where it is radiating as much heat out as is being radiated to it. Conduction and convection are involved too in many cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested in this subject, there are free online courses about heat transfer I could point you to.

       There is infrared radiation coming from it... infrared radiation heats things up. Radiation in general is a form of energy, and adding energy to a system (by radiation incident upon it) does not cool it down, quite the opposite.

       You are not claiming "thermoelectric cooling," you are claiming that it "radiates cold." That is not the same thing.

       This is called a deconstructive argument.   You are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         over parsing, and breaking down language, to the point that it has no meaning

       <li>
        <p>
         reconstructing the language to have the meaning that you want
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         pointing at me and saying I'm wrong

       I'm not wrong because you are breaking language, and making deconstructive arguments.  That you are resulting to this, likely means that I am right.

       I saw this on the cover of a magazine like 25-30 years ago. I don’t believe it, but seemed plausible to me at the time. But, major science periodical was selling this story.

       Youre basically saying we cant know so you cant prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is different than proving a negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to your logic proving it does exist is a negative and proving it doesnt exist is a negative.
      </p>

       That some nonsense and you know it.

       Which back to my initial point that you cant prove computers are not magic because you cant shrink yourself down to view an electron.

       No, that is not how this works.  You might be a computer programmer and understand perfectly well though personal experience how a computer works, but that does not mean I know how a computer works.   To you, it would make perfect sense, to me it would be a mystery, but I would understand they work, just now how they work.  Just because I do not understand how they work does not mean I automatically assume its magic. It just means that, in my mind, I have no been exposed to the information necessary for me to know how it works.

       It's size and proximity (plus the exact ratio to the sun to make perfect eclipses) generates an extreme low chance that it's terrestrial.

       Yeah, they got nothing but our indoctrination from childhood but that is quite powerful.  This deception is so impressive and astounding when you just step back and look at how it all works.  People have dedicated their entire lives to it with no idea it's all nonsense.  It's the most successful religion of all time because it convinced the world is wasn't a religion.

       That great brain drain of Germany helped us become what we are today. They were part of Germany when it was controlled by nazis but they are still people. Just because I'm an American doesn't mean that I represent everything our government does. We are people living in nations. Your accusation is naive.

       Reddit doesn't facilitate active discussion anymore. It's become a platform where paid interests can control what we all believe to be the 'majority' mindset on a particular topic.
      </p>

       The 'science' subreddits have become such a tragic parody of what the concept of science is supposed to be its almost beyond belief.

        Why was the Emirate, and late Caliphate, of Cordoba never able to conquer it's Christian neighbors in northern Hispania?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       My response was as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They  got infiltrated by Sephardic Jews and Illuminati Superjews (after  marrying supposed Christian women). Having an advanced state wont help if  the castle doors are being opened from within.
       </p>
       <p>
        To  give you an idea of how badly the Moors were infiltrated towards the  end, the lions sculpture in the Court of Lions in Alhambra actually  bears a Jewish inscription on the back, complete with symbols, though  they have recently ahem restored it.

       I responded matter-of-factly. Normally I use the term [BLEEP] whenever I reference Jews on Reddit, that way fellow goys can still get the hint, but looks like I got lazy here. Going back to the topic, the Moors faced genocide, eviction and forced assimilation because of the treason of [BLEEP]. But we are not allowed to talk about it, even though its all part of the historical record.

       Now got banned from r/india for poking fun at their rapeyness. If only there was a way to display all the subs you were banned from right next to your profile, that would show your level of critical thinking, and also which subs are the most censored.

       I'm speaking informally on reddit, I'm not trying to publish anything.  As we have discussed, my experimental design meets all the rigors you set out - I have a control and everything.  I'm not sure if you're aware, but you've come to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to engage with me.  It's a subreddit - it's not a science journal - and despite discussing this here, my experimental design was flawless - it met all the criteria you set forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, your attempts to attack my rigor are very transparent to me - especially because you continue to do it after we have already established my experiment is fine and it's simply my results that you don't like.  You clearly want to deny this phenomenon exists because you can't explain it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not really concerned if you don't believe my claims.  Thanks again for trying to distract from the fact that you obviously lied about doing experiments.  By your own words you completely omitted the lens component of the experiment, which is critical to proving that it's a property of the light.  I am now suspicious that you have even performed the version which you initially described.  You seem more like a contrarian trying to win an argument than someone interested in finding the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, I've found people that are willing to lie that quickly and easily probably lie all the time :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and keep replying if you want to, I'm done here.  I've shown everyone here that you are not to be trusted and will lie to try to prove whatever point you may be arguing.  Have a nice night.

       That's fine. I don't need it to be

       No experiment is "flawless," since all experiments have error which must be accounted for. You have not even described your experiment in enough detail to really make that assessment, anyway. Which is fine with me, as I said, I don't need it to be
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       results that prove your claim.

       As I explained, I was describing the conditions under which the experiment was performed. I am happy to discuss more details about
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       it was done, and the many other experiments I have done, but you seem to have decided to run away from this discussion instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will leave you with the two questions you keep ignoring:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        You didn't answer, but do you agree that the Earth cools off at night even when the Moon isn't out?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Can you prove the claim that a magnifying glass "further decreases" the temperature? One trial in a youtube video isn't enough to show this, can you provide any proof of this experiment being done with
       <strong>
        repeated trials, control groups, error calculations...? Not necessarily by you, by anyone?
       </strong>

      <p>
       You have not proven this claim. I understand that you do not have your own data to share--do you have
       <em>
        anyone's
       </em>
       ? Or is all the "proof" that exists in youtube videos of one-off measurements with no control groups, no repeated trials, no attempt at measuring experimental error?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The earth is a very complex system where there are multitudinous factors polluting the "global" data so I'm not surprised that temperature data across time does not necessarily readily reveal this.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, are you agreeing that nights with a full moon are not as a rule cooler than nights with a new moon? Even though you make the claim that objects under moonlight are cooled down by multiple degrees?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But if you go out near a full moon and focus the moonlight with a magnifying glass, you'll be able to measure the cooling effects very easily. It's quite remarkable.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       My experience contradicts your claim. Since all either of us have are anecdotes, I have asked you several times to link to actual proof of this claim. You have given none.

       You do understand that there are two questions, and I am asking about the second one, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you claim to have answered both questions (plural), the
       <strong>
        global
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        local

       one?

       answer and I will be satisfied. Otherwise, if you simply do not want to answer that question, that is perfectly fine.
