       Think OP is saying it’s cognitive dissonance to believe that people who believe conspiracies lack political understanding while at the same time believing the Russian conspiracy. That’s what I got anyway.

       But you'll waste time attacking the users of the thread? Something that will be seen less than the study itself?

       I personally find fault in the sample size of the study; it seems much too small to draw a generalization like that.

       Yes, i'm pointing out their hypocrisy and idiocracy. I'm not going to read a study that I know is skewed and filled with pre-assumptions and as you pointed out, using bad science (shit sample size)

       I wouldn't say its bad science; you work with what you have.  I just wouldn't draw too many implications of it.

       That being said, I've seen a few studies state the same general idea, so who knows?

       It ended up having a Republican declare a Republican to head a special council to investigate a Republican campaign and it's ties to Russia. Somehow, without any Democrat involvement it the Republican on Republican fighting was somehow masterminded by Clinton, who is supremely powerful to do anything and get anything she wants. After purposely losing the election(The Deep State will let hell freeze before she ever becomes president, no one becomes President without Deep State approval (remember Obama coming out of nowhere to run against her and win.).).)

       It always made me scratch my head that somehow it's all Democrats and the Deep State is Obama/Hillary while practically the only involvement is funding the Steele Dossier. McCabe, Rossenstein, Comey, Mueller, and more, none are Democrats. You either have to imagine Obama/Hillary being the mind behind a bunch of Republicans and Independants or have to go down the chain to Lisa Page, FBI attorney, and Peter Strok, FBI special agent, to find the first representation of Democrats.

       I've said it here before. If this was some big plan by Obama/Democrats why the hell didn't they use it before the election? Why didn't the FBI? Comey came out and said they reopened the Hillary investigation but didn't mention one word about the Trump Russia investigation.

       The study referenced seems to be almost directly dealing with posters of this nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       The study can be found here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2504">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a quote to get us started:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A classic way that people’s overestimation of their knowledge has been tested is through the illusion of explanatory depth (IOED) paradigm. In the IOED paradigm, participants initially rate their confidence in their understanding of how an object or phenomena works (e.g., how a faucet works; what we will refer to as the pre-explanation confidence judgment). Participants then provide as detailed an explanation as they can for how the object or phenomena actually works that includes explaining the causal links between steps of that process.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The poster above presents a framework where Republicans and Democrats are represented as fundamentally different kinds with directly opposite political commitments.   Right away we can see how this framing is false, for it denies the bipartisan consensus which exists concerning economics and foreign policy.  That is there is a commitment to neo-liberalism in the economic sphere and an interventionist pro-Nato commitment in the foreign policy sphere.  Moreover the poster omits that through objective analysis, Clinton and Obama governed like moderate Republicans, and moved the party to the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/ZiggyAnimals continues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here is another quote from the study:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Given that the average person possesses only a superficial grasp of many phenomena in daily life they regularly interact with such as zippers or watches (Wilson &amp; Keil, 1998), it is no surprise that the complexity of political events, actors, and policies may likewise not be well understood (e.g.,Conover &amp; Feldman, 1989; Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1996). Perhaps in part because people tend to believe they are more objective and less biased than others (e.g., Pronin, 2007), many express excessive confidence in the superiority of their political beliefs (Raimi &amp; Leary, 2014), despite lacking the ability to properly ascertain their own competence in most domains (Dunning, Johnson, Ehrlinger, &amp; Kruger, 2003).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While it is certainly the case that the Clinton campaign through the DNC sabotaged the Sanders campaign, the sabotage of the Trump campaign did not have to originate in the Clinton campaign, (although we do know from "Shattered", that after loosing the election they decided to blame it and push the Russiagate line) especially after the user brings up the concept of the deep state.   This is an unelected network of intelligence, military, and private contractors.  Trumps proclamation on the campaign trail of voicing an anti-Nato line, of wanting detente with Russia, a political solution to the Syrian conflict and in the economic sphere positioning himself as anti-TPP, and protectionist, went directly against the liberal order created after the end of WWII (incidentally the beginning of the national security state as well) would have, on its own been enough to pit intelligence officers against ihim. Which is exactly what happened.  Russiage came from the mind of John Brennan working in conjunction with Clapper and Comey!

      <p>
       The study goes on:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Simple slope analyses on Clinton supporters indicates that post-explanation political belief confidence was associated with a marginally significant increase in conspiratorial beliefs for participants high in political knowledge (b= 0.29, 95% CI(-0.05, 0.63), p=.09) and among individuals low in political knowledge (b= 0.54, 95% CI(-0.05, 0.63), p=.08), although inspection of the unstandardized coefficients suggest this effect was larger among people low (vs. high) in explicit political knowledge.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What the user above does, is present the Deep State as a monolith.   No networked distributions of power are.  There are nodes, some more powerful than other nodes, and there is always some degree of fragmentation.    That Trump was preferred by segments of the deep state is undeniable. However, Russiagate did originate with the leaders named above who are committed to  pro-Nato foreign policy and neoliberal economic consensus.   Moreover, the pivot against world powers as opposed to the war on terrorism as a justification for the MIC grift has been in the works since 2008, and reached a crescendo with the intervention in Syria by the Russian forces, i,e,. a direct challenge to US regime change intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton was the preferred candidate of powerful nodes.

        The all poweful Deep State allied with the also all powerful Clinton to make Trump President. Russia.

      <p>
       The study goes on:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In sum, we find evidence to suggest that higher post-explanation political belief confidence was associated with increased conspiratorial beliefs, particularly among participants low in explicit political knowledge who voted for the losing candidate in the 2016 presidential election.

       The deep state is not all powerful.  The problem is that it wields more power than elected representatives, de-facto undermining democratic rule.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Our findings support prior research by showing that, among political novices and supporters of the losing candidate, post-explanation political belief confidence predicted pre- to post-election change in both general conspiratorial beliefs and specific conspiratorial theories that provide a causal explanation for the outcome of the election; net controls, higher post-explanation political belief confidence was associated with an increase in general and election-specific conspiratorial beliefs among voting citizens with lower levels of actual political knowledge and for whom the electoral outcome was inconsistent with candidate preferences.

       So in other words, Clintonites believe in Russiagate because they can't deal with her loosing.

      <blockquote>

        There is a huge difference between saying "Given the number of historical examples of world governments engaging in secretive and conspiratorial behaviors, I don't feel confident fully trusting contemporary reporting on current events" and "9/11 was an inside job pulled off by Jewish bankers engaged in insurance fraud" or whatever.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my experience "conspiracy theorist" isn't "a person who is well versed in history and skeptical about things" but somebody who jumps on the crackpot bandwagon either because of mental illness, a desperate desire to belong, a feeling of intellectual superiority (or desire to feel that way), or all three.

       What really bugs me is it said that people that are into conspiracy theories don’t know as much about the topic as people that aren’t into them. I’m like are you fucking kidding me? If anything they know more about it than your average retard because they’ve actually spent time thinking about it and realize how it could affect society if implemented. I also hated that they were trying to make it look like we like to hold information above peoples heads and gloat about it because we know something they don’t. I can guarantee this has absolutely nothing to do with researching conspiracies. I don’t get high or revel in the fact that I know stuff that people don’t know. Why would I like to boast that I know more about Global trafficking rings then your average person? If anything I hate it. It’s one of the reasons why I can’t sleep at night. And to say that I like to be in this state of mind? Fuck all those people. To bring it up isn’t pushing an agenda, its trying to bring awareness to people so that they can do something about it.

       This is not what the study found, nor looked at.  The study was looking at people who have high confidence in their knowledge about politics even after they were tested for their actual knowledge.  Some people know a little, some a lot, but all were confident in their knowledge.   It than looked at the 2016 election voters, trying to gauge an increase in conspiracy ideation.  It found a marked increase in CLINTON supporters, i.e., those of a loosing candidate.  It did not find this in Trump supporters.  Furthermore it found a general increase  in both sets, low knowledge vs high knowledge, but a slightly bigger increase in the low knowledge voters.

       Can you not see that there is a problem with this methodology? Who determined their "actual knowledge" and how did they determine it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the researchers were basing "knowledge" on whether the subject believed the official narrative, then they would obviously conclude that a conspiracy theorist (who knew of , but didn't believe the official narrative) were "lacking" in knowledge. The researchers conclusion was therefore self-fulfilling.

       They used a scale that averaged right answers to the following questions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The number of correct responses to the following items indexed
political knowledge: (1) “What job or political office does Joseph Biden currently hold?” (2) “What
job or political office does John Roberts currently hold?” (3) “What job or political office does Theresa May currently hold?” (4) “What job or political office does Paul Ryan currently hold?” (5) “Which political party currently has the most members in the Senate in Washington?” (6) “Which political party currently has the most members in the House of Representatives in Washington?” (7)“How long is the term of office for a U.S. Senator?” (8) “Whose responsibility is it to nominate judges to the Federal Courts - the President, the Congress, or the Supreme Court?”.

       This really misunderstands what the study showed.  I highly recommend people read it, as it is really not that bad, although it is seriously methodologically flawed.

       So knowing who the current Prime Minister of England is correlates with special insight into what happened on, say 9/11? And by the same token, if you don't know the name of the current Justice Minister of Burkino Faso, you have no right to an opinion on what happened at Sandy Hook?

       No.  It measured two things.  How confident one is in one's knowledge.  So it measured confidence.   Then it measured how well people score on political knowledge test.   It found that among people who are confident in their knowldge, but who voted for a loosing candidate, there was an increase in believing in conspiracy theories.  There was an increase in this belief among both people that scored low on that test, and people that scored high on the test, but there was a bigger increase among people that scored low on the test.  This was from the subset of people that voted for a loosing candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It had nothing to do with actual content of conspiracy theories.

       OP, don't worry about it.  2018 is the year of the conspiracy theory.  The mainstream media has declared war on conspiracy theorists.  This is just a single grenade lobbed in a much larger media offensive.

You whine about how the elite is gonna delete this sub and yet you're still here accusing Jews of raping and killing children. You're not victims in any of this. Your ideas is what causes Mass shooting and violence but you conveniently Dodge responsibility by screaming "false flag false flag" so you don't have to actually examine what you say. you call grieving parents government shills and psychopaths and pedophilies​ when youre the ones acting psychopathic.
