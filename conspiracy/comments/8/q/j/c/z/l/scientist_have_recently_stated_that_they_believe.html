       Oooo it makes me wonder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have had a theory for the past few weeks about our current civilisation being civ 2, in basic terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we had the original humanoid (i'm not going to guess the sub-category) that roamed and ruled the Earth for approx. 100,000-180,000 years before some event wiped out 90% of life/created 90% of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that all conspiracies come from the same truth; that there was an advanced civilisation before us, that possibly colonised Mars or even came from Mars...
      </p>
      <p>
       The little glimpses and shreds of evidence we see of what a lot on this community believe is proof of ancient aliens, is actually just the original 'us'. Most of our previous civilisation was wiped out, through time and ice ages (remember, all metals will corrode and return to their ore-like state at the first chance they get). Some piece have survived though, you can make your own guesses on what these were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanoids did come from Africa, originally. Our civilisation though, actually came from the middle-east. Somewhere around Jerusalem I'm guessing, due to the religious interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adam and Eve did happen, in a way, but the true story was lost in translation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The great flood was a real event, but the dates are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ark of the covenant is a tomb that survived from the original civilisation.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Almost all of the conspiracies surrounding ancient aliens, life on mars, UFO's, advanced tech, religions, archaeological unanswered questions, evolutionary anomalies and advanced civilisations can be all answered with one hypothesis; That we are the second (if not third, fourth, fifth...) intelligent humanoid civilisation to have existed.

       I agree with you completely on the 'previous advanced human civilisation' idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been this developed, physically and mentally, for 200,000 years. Our recorded history goes back about 1 percent of that time. Absolutely anything could have happened before that. Let's assume that mankind didn't spend 180,000 years banging rocks together before suddenly discovering space travel and iPhones, and inventing religions.

       198,000 years of nothing and then religion, settlements, writing, politics. 198,700 years of nothing and then industrial revolution, cars, planes, tv, internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the previous civilisation did 50,000 years of nothing, before inventing the iPhone? That would give them 100,000 years head-start on us.

       If you consider the fact that the global climate was not conducive to sedentism and agriculture until ~12kya, the bulk of that time span is accounted for. The advent of civilization (~5kya) was more localized and probably related to population pressure in particular environmental contexts.

       Think bigger. The climate in the north may only have become conducive since the end of the last ice age, but humans have been through several of them. Who knows what we got up to as we spread from cold to warm areas and back again..

       I found the study. Basically all it concludes is that life is ever evolving. Over millions of years DNA evolves into a new species or dies out. DNA of a certain species now might not reflect that of the same species a million years ago. It’s really not that groundbreaking

       I do believe that God exist but I don't think that he is like most religions tell that he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You theory made me remember about something that my friend said, we all have an idea about God since birth, not that you believe, but that you have an idea about a creator, all culture for more primitive also had an similar idea of a creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we are created by an ancient alien civilization but what is that reason for it ? And why give us the idea since birth of not only a creator for humanity but a creator for the whole universe and why the most powerful and influent one was YHVH, if you really look there's even people who said that we have this name in our DNA

       The belief in a God or Creator comes from psychology, I believe.

       It helps keep the community together for one purpose or something like that. All tribes, no matter how remote or ancient believe in a God though, so maybe it is just nature or an innate feeling within us all?

       So can a spiritual entity be referred to as he or she, if we are to believe the bible saying God created man in his own likeness. And given the reports of abductions being conducted be human like beings, then doesn't take much to go down that route. If I took a stab in the dark I would say we could be an experiment of sorts to find out what makes humans the people they are.

       <br/>
       tl;dr: "According to the genetic bottleneck theory, between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago, human populations sharply decreased to 3,000–10,000 surviving individuals. It is supported by genetic evidence suggesting that today's humans are descended from a very small population of between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs that existed about 70,000 years ago.

       So, if we go from archaeological discoveries; 380,000~ humans became, humans. The around 100,000-200,000 years ago, there was a catastrophic event, then we popped up.

       Ok, that makes sense. I think another part of it is cities, which the word civilization ultimately derives from. There really is no evidence of the sort of cultural interaction spheres you suggest until the advent of dense, settled communities and the mass production of material media expressing the civilization's culture.

       380,000 - 200,000 years is 180,000 years. If that civilisation was around for as long as or longer than ours, would they still be living in small tribes? Genuine question.

       Part of the reason why the human population bottleneck was so profound was because the initial population was very small and only located in a small region of the globe. The world didn't start "filling up" with humans until long afterward (closer to the ~12kya Pleistocene/Holocene transition).
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose one might suggest that a more dispersed group of "humans" like H. erectus was building civilization around that time, but from what we know of their (preserved) material culture, it exhibits qualities (simplicity, repetitiveness, etc.) that suggests a distinct and likely inferior cognitive capacity. Probably not the guys passing on a civilizational legacy of any significance.

       A mass extinction event could also affect the radioactivity of earth’s crust. Ratios of isotopes should never be used to determine ‘time’. Ratios of isotopes should only be used to determine proximity to electrical discharges.

       Well it seems oddly familiar to Noah's ark that's for sure, and that does seem crazy to me, although reality and the facts aren't crazy they objective. Considering it's all life and not just humans or some types leads more to creationism and intelligent design than it does just some type of natural cataclysm imo. This is very extreme and monumental fact to assimilate into a historical world view.

       I'm going to assume you didn't read the study so you are speaking from a place of ignorance. Read this and report back:

       I said "basically every" and the number is estimated over 90% so yes this is true that only the vast majority from 200k years ago. I am interested to know what the number range is like for the other 10%.
