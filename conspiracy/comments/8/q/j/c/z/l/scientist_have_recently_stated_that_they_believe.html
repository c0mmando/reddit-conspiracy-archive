        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Oooo it makes me wonder. </p>

<p>I have had a theory for the past few weeks about our current civilisation being civ 2, in basic terms.</p>

<p>So, we had the original humanoid (i&#39;m not going to guess the sub-category) that roamed and ruled the Earth for approx. 100,000-180,000 years before some event wiped out 90% of life/created 90% of life.</p>

<p>I believe that all conspiracies come from the same truth; that there was an advanced civilisation before us, that possibly colonised Mars or even came from Mars...</p>

<p>The little glimpses and shreds of evidence we see of what a lot on this community believe is proof of ancient aliens, is actually just the original &#39;us&#39;. Most of our previous civilisation was wiped out, through time and ice ages (remember, all metals will corrode and return to their ore-like state at the first chance they get). Some piece have survived though, you can make your own guesses on what these were.</p>

<p>Humanoids did come from Africa, originally. Our civilisation though, actually came from the middle-east. Somewhere around Jerusalem I&#39;m guessing, due to the religious interest. </p>

<p>Adam and Eve did happen, in a way, but the true story was lost in translation. </p>

<p>The great flood was a real event, but the dates are wrong. </p>

<p>The ark of the covenant is a tomb that survived from the original civilisation. </p>

<p>TL;DR Almost all of the conspiracies surrounding ancient aliens, life on mars, UFO&#39;s, advanced tech, religions, archaeological unanswered questions, evolutionary anomalies and advanced civilisations can be all answered with one hypothesis; That we are the second (if not third, fourth, fifth...) intelligent humanoid civilisation to have existed.</p>

<p>We have been this developed, physically and mentally, for 200,000 years. Our recorded history goes back about 1 percent of that time. Absolutely anything could have happened before that. Let&#39;s assume that mankind didn&#39;t spend 180,000 years banging rocks together before suddenly discovering space travel and iPhones, and inventing religions.</p>

<p>If you consider the fact that the global climate was not conducive to sedentism and agriculture until ~12kya, the bulk of that time span is accounted for. The advent of civilization (~5kya) was more localized and probably related to population pressure in particular environmental contexts.</p>

<p>I assume from context, you mean the human population, not &quot;all life&quot;, which would be a major, probably <em>the</em> major extinction event.<br/>
Then yes, that theory (or one of them) is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory">&quot;Toba Catastrophe Theory&quot;</a><br/>
tl;dr: &quot;According to the genetic bottleneck theory, between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago, human populations sharply decreased to 3,000–10,000 surviving individuals. It is supported by genetic evidence suggesting that today&#39;s humans are descended from a very small population of between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs that existed about 70,000 years ago.  </p>

<p>Then the rest of your idea makes perfect sense! (excluding the Martian Origin, but YMMV)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, that makes sense. I think another part of it is cities, which the word civilization ultimately derives from. There really is no evidence of the sort of cultural interaction spheres you suggest until the advent of dense, settled communities and the mass production of material media expressing the civilization&#39;s culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the last 200,000 years.</p>

<p>What about before that? If our population rapidly declined due to catastrophe, how many of us/humanoids were there before the catastrophe?</p>

<p>380,000 - 200,000 years is 180,000 years. If that civilisation was around for as long as or longer than ours, would they still be living in small tribes? Genuine question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason why the human population bottleneck was so profound was because the initial population was very small and only located in a small region of the globe. The world didn&#39;t start &quot;filling up&quot; with humans until long afterward (closer to the ~12kya Pleistocene/Holocene transition). </p>

<p>I suppose one might suggest that a more dispersed group of &quot;humans&quot; like H. erectus was building civilization around that time, but from what we know of their (preserved) material culture, it exhibits qualities (simplicity, repetitiveness, etc.) that suggests a distinct and likely inferior cognitive capacity. Probably not the guys passing on a civilizational legacy of any significance.</p>

<p>Aboriginals look like a mix between African and Oriental. The Aztecs and Mayans look (from descriptions) oriental as well. </p>

<p>Maybe Australians/Aboriginals were the first and migrated North. </p>

<p>Imagine if the very first humans were on modern-day Antarctica and migrated North to modern-day Australia</p>
