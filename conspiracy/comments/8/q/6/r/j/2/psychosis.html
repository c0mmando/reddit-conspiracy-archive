But i just need some re-assurance. I just worried myself just now that i might have psychosis. Im very into Infowars, god, and the fight against the globalist. I only have 2 friends that will even listen to me and look into stuff and they also share stuff with me. Im in year 5 of college and ive been a frequent user of pot (usually only at night) and i want to quit soon so i can be a better leader and help save myself from becoming an alcoholic cause im really close. Now ive been into conspiracies hardcore this year. Alex Jones is one of my heros outside of my family and god. But im irrationally worried that i have psycosis from all the weed.    I just need you guys to put some sense into me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck see this is why. i got off topic and meant to add in symptoms. I have alot of the cognitive ones like thought disorder, confusion, belief that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning, belief that thoughts aren&#39;t one&#39;s own, disorientation and unwanted thoughts. Im not suicidal or don&#39;t have thoughts about killing myself so that&#39;s good. No matter whats wrong, maybe just bipolar, i atill like who i am even if im different. I have irrational fears ( like how i leave my pockets inside out when i enter a pool) and a couple of other symptoms but not the big ones like hearing voices, self harm, limited range of emotions. Do you think this is from drinking? Im 22.5 and have had about 8+ drinks a night for 4 days a week since i turned 21. I have nights with more that 15 drinks at least once a week sometimes a few </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously.  Pretty soon those stomach ulcers and shaking, and body temperature problems, always overheated,   Vomiting often,   Anxiety,    Soon to bowel movements become long and painful while looking at a bowl with blood often as the addiction becomes worse.   Do what you can , you don’t want to have to get to a point where your just hoping for a bowel movement where it ain’t bloody.    Learn to love the feeling of feeling hydrated,   And how good it feels after a good workout whatever that may be.   Look towards feeling good about waking up.  Instead of drinking a bottle to chase to pain away take a jog.   You’ll feel better about yourself.   </p>

For me though sativa and hybrids are my favs. Favorite strains ATM are cinex, granola funk, and pineapple. Blue dream for instance is a no go for me and makes me extremely paranoid. If you download the leafly app or go to their website you can sift through strains and look at their negative side effects such as anxiety and paranoia.

    <div class="md"><p>Let me guess, the nights you don&#39;t drink you don&#39;t sleep either, so you end up needing drink to sleep. You&#39;re in a bad cycle pal, but you&#39;re young and not so far gone you cant get out. You&#39;re probably quite addictive/obsessive, so join a gym and set yourself some lifting/running targets whatever floats your boat. People like Alex Jones will feed your paranoia ,lay off it all and get your head straight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re really brave to own up to what you know is problematic and harmful behavior on your part. A lot of people never even get that far. I have a cousin who reminds me a lot of your situation, but he never got help when it may have really improved things early on. Please do seek help from a trusted doctor and consider therapy. I really believe it can help with these symptoms you described, and help you to lead a cleaner, fulfilling life. You&#39;re so young and you seem like a bright person, I believe you can do this. I wish you the very best of luck and strength 🍀</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve smoked at least a gram a day for the last 20 years. It definitely alters your thinking and perceptions. You need to learn to recognize when your brain is making bad judgments because of the pot. If you spend half your day stoned you&#39;re going to do that a lot.</p>

<p>IMO where we differ most is that I started this journey offline. I started with books that had hundreds of pages of references. That allows the reader to judge the actual sources. That doesn&#39;t happen online. I learned discernment before I was bombarded with information online. I dismissed Alex Jones after a few minutes and you should have too.</p>

<p>If you believe that Jones is genuine then you are not equipped to spend time in the conspiracy media. It&#39;s that simple. If you don&#39;t think he is full of shit then you&#39;ve got no hope of defending your sanity against all the other nonsense out there. I don&#39;t mean to be harsh on you but as someone who has been into this crap since before the X-Files aired please take the benefit of my experience. You could spend years looking in rabbit holes while your family and friends worry about you. </p>

<p>And IMO, <em>that&#39;s</em> the conspiracy. People conditioned to accept nonsense as truth, or made to believe there is no such thing as truth. People who lose all faith in their government and society and don&#39;t engage in either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get off the beam. Take a conspiracy vacation. Conspiracies are fun to study, but are in what I call &quot;secondary reality.&quot; Your primary reality is the present environment in which you actually live and exist. Get back into your senses and enjoy the details of your ACTUAL reality. Turn off the beam, the feed, the secondary reality of story after story after story.</p>

<p>Get your bearings. Once you do, you&#39;ll get a better sense of what is real and what isn&#39;t. What is in your thoughts, memories, and imagination is not real. The contents of your mind is meant for survival and creativity.</p>

<p>So take a vacation from the beam of secondary reality and immerse yourself in creativity (arts, projects, doing things for others) in the present moment in your present environment. You&#39;ll regain your footing, and yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey im really glad reading this. this having thoughts you don&#39;t want to have and having irrational fears and all of that is very &quot;normal&quot; i believe! i am surprised nobody recommanded meditation. listen to guys like eckhart tolle to start with. just listen to him and you will understand much more about our disfunctional minds. im very happy for you to come to recognize this so early in life. im not denying you&#39;re in a difficult life situation but those are opportunities to grow. i wish you all the best my friend</p>

From what I read over here you&#39;re 1) drinking way too much alcohol and it will harm you physically and mentally, 2) weed&#39;s okay if it means you will be drinking less alcohol, 3) You definitely don&#39;t seem to have psychosis (at least while you wrote these posts) but you show lots of anxiety disorder symptoms. </p>
