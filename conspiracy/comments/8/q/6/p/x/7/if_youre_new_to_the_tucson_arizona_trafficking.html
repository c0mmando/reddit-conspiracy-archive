        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-06-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Spiritual_War.html">Spiritual_War</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Welcome. Let&#39;s set aside politics, race, hate, everything, and realize that we have a systematic problem that is finally showing itself to the mass consciousness of humanity. It is time we finally deal with this age old problem and deal with it once and for all. There are videos, pictures, and everything that can easily counter every mis-informational narrative or agenda that is trying to be spun. </p>

<p>You have a right to be skeptical, you have a right to refuse to believe this is not happening. Sadly, this really is happening. Let&#39;s get to the heart of this and get started with a somewhat coherent list. I&#39;ll try to keep this formatted simply so it is not so confusing. </p>

<p>We still start from the beginning.</p>

<p>Around May 31, 2018, VOP started reporting about a disturbing potential trafficking rest point camp. Complete with hair dyes, lubricant, childrens clothes, womans clothes, over 60 pairs of childrens shoes, blue prints for further camps/bunkers as well as trade routes, maps, and a lot more. TPD took away a lot of evidence and a lot of it will be slowly released over time on the internet and other avenues.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with video of the original camp that was found:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4dIjJwwjzE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4dIjJwwjzE</a></p>

<p>Here is a picture of what appears to be dried blood on one of the restraints found on the tree.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/mwgYCuM.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/mwgYCuM.jpg</a></p>

<p>For a &quot;MSM&quot; link on the original camp here is a great link.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kgun9.com/news/local-news/underground-bunker-possibly-used-for-trafficking-found-in-tucson">https://www.kgun9.com/news/local-news/underground-bunker-possibly-used-for-trafficking-found-in-tucson</a></p>

<p>&quot;Underground bunker possibly used for human trafficking of children found in Tucson&quot;</p>

<p>Complete with Craig Sawman Sawyer saying what it appears to be. He has since backed down and done a 180, and has appeared to have been threatened or told to cut ties due to his documentary coming out, ContraLand which deals with trafficking in the USA.</p>

<p>For those that are mostly caught up on all of this already, here is the most recent findings so far. Finally got a mirror to upload, and there are also mirrors on Vimeo if this one goes down as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/HvBo09LpuDY">https://youtu.be/HvBo09LpuDY</a></p>

<p>After this camp was discovered and started making waves, many people started to catch wind of it and tune in. At one point, when VOP found a human skull, they had over 6,000 people watching the live stream. This cannot be stopped and we will demand the government does its God Damn job!</p>

<p>After the original findings, they made a 3 month commitment to further spread out into the desert and see what else is going on. We have to take into account that this desert is HUGE. It is a known cartel corridor and drugs, guns, kids, and woman + families and whatever else. If VOP (Veterans on Patrol) were to do what they had done the past 3 years and apply it to the area where this original camp was, it would take over 30 years to cover all the area. This land is enormous and cartels use this to their advantage. </p>

<p>After this, VOP made a declaration that they will make this their mission to help these kids and woman and shut down these open access points for free flowing hard drugs, arms, and the trafficking of men, woman, kids. </p>

<p>After this started going viral, state police showed up and ILLEGALLY arrested 2 volunteers from VOP. This includes a father and a son. They were completely in the legal and were pretty quickly released.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/oIMMWT7KR0o">https://youtu.be/oIMMWT7KR0o</a></p>

<p>This is somewhat of a mission statement of what VOP stands for and what these volunteers and veterans are working towards.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/FEXF8l_iBSc">https://youtu.be/FEXF8l_iBSc</a></p>

<p>This video is to show perspective of how VOP interacts with local law enforcement and how this is all respectful and cooperative. This is not a stand off... This is about the kids. Also, in these 2 videos, you will see the woman responsible for finding the bloody knife. She is even in the Security Forces on base...</p>

Part 2: <a href="https://youtu.be/uieh8qyHtMs">https://youtu.be/uieh8qyHtMs</a></p>

<p>Here is video footage of when one of the scout teams found human remains.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PYMAgzFap9A">https://youtu.be/PYMAgzFap9A</a></p>

<p>VOP accepts 0 cash. And only takes supplies. They prove this time and time again on their FaceBook. If you want to follow them live, look for VOP Team Pulaski on FaceBook and you will find them! Here is video showing them filling up and shows the independent youtuber that filmed some recent footage of them finding an abandoned house with a strange hog head tied to a tree and a lot more. The link for that is above. </p>

<p>Thank you for your time and if you have any questions I will do my best to ask them or link relevant videos for further understanding. We will win. This is our time to take our world back from predators that have been vying on us not standing up and doing something about it. We can all stand up. Stop looking around for others to do the same. We can all do it ourselves. We Are All One!!!</p>

<p>Further discussion, research, links, knowledge, and love are always appreciated. Thank you and god bless &lt;3</p>

<p>Link to last nights most recent findings: (night of 6/9/2018)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvBo09LpuDY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvBo09LpuDY</a></p>

<p>Maps, Meth Pipes, a Childs room, a fortified house with an open access guest house with loads of clothes and more. Weird objects. A hog/boar head tied to a tree at the residence. Seemingly abandoned yet recent activity at the house. The house itself was unlocked and anyone could walk in, cartel included. Also included is footage of a solar array/battery room that is easily worth tens of thousands of dollars.. just unlocked. Whole house is strange and includes an odd childs room. Later in the video the OP explains how they found cameras and within 5 minutes it felt like he said a rancher showed up claiming it was his property etc. Which begs the question, are the meth pipes yours? The hog head tied to the tree your doing? Why is your house unlocked and easy to get into? Why did someone use the toilet lately, was it you, or cartel members? So many questions and more footage and photos will come out over the coming days and weeks. Don&#39;t give up, keep researching this and keep striving. We are taking back our planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Felon non vet lieing to Sawyer about finding kids in a sceptic tank is what started all this.  Sawyer says there was no knife found at the location, 60 shoes is a complete fabrication.  Louie the Prepper lied about the police not showing up for days, Screwie Louie hid in the tower after the police arrived immediately after the 911 call was made.  Someone actively mislead the world when this became public  and the only conspiracy is if Lewis Arthur did this becuase he was crazy, if he is trying to make money or is he a CI working for the feds or a foreign power in order to run a psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but that is an easy way to discredit something. Imagine you just have the tank underground (with toys inside, too small an entrance for an adult) and the straps low on trees. That is a smoking alarm. Look deeper and investigate.</p>

<p>Now, they add some fabrications (knife, condoms, etc.) and say &quot;these are false, therefor it is all false.&quot; That is a logical fallacy.  It is almost like a Straw Man argument combined with Poisoning the Well one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Meyer&#39;s name has been written using only two or three of his name&#39;s in different combinations in different publications and different places on social media. Afaik, he himself has used different combinations in different places. Also because it seems he has been confused with Craig Sawyer, presumably because of the similarities in the work they are doing as well as both being to the same encampment and posting vids about it to Social media. It doesn&#39;t help that they both look similar at a passing glance either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That dude was controlled opposition ever since Pizzagate broke. I&#39;ve been down in Tucson with VOP since Wednesday and I&#39;m here for the long haul. The child sex camp was real. The rape trees real. The child&#39;s defanged skull real. The girl was killed very recently from when we found the skull. You can tell because the brain matter in the skull was still wet and sloshing around when we looked under the skull. In this dry desert it would have dried up after 3 days easy. But it was still wet. Saw it myself. The other bone we found was moist too. </p>

<p>The search continues. More supplies arrive every day from around the world. More boots on the ground are here every day. The psy-ops won&#39;t work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly just trying to play devil&#39;s advocate. I&#39;ve kinda gone back and forth on this story and there is a lot of misinformation to sift through on both sides. Here in this sub though the number of posts calling for support of VoP are overwhelming the skeptical ones by a wide margain and I think there is a lot to be skeptical of. Those that support Meyer and VoP keep regurgitating talking points that sound disingenuous. For instance, they say he doesn&#39;t accept cash donations like it&#39;s done out of a sense of selflessness, but he does accept pre-paid gift cards. Why the disconnect? Just say he needs help and is accepting donations, straight up. They also keep saying he found a child&#39;s skull without the disclaimer that the medical examiner has deemed it to be the skull of an adult. 
I also take issue with how Meyer has handled evidence like kicking a skull around in the dirt and disturbing a crime scene instead of waiting for a proper cop or forensic worker to collect it. He seems to lack any sort of common sense by alerting every criminal that may have been associated with this operation what&#39;s going on by blasting this shit on YouTube. Hard as it may be, a little discretion goes a long way in taking your time and setting up proper surveillance and tracking leads as far as they can possibly stand to track them. Maybe they did do that and this is just a feint/psy-ops to let the bad guys think VoP got overzelous and bungled things, but that line of hoping is in direct conflict with what I am seeing on the videos. I&#39;d also like to know how much of Meyer&#39;s felony record is actually a cause for concern. Helping vets is great, but lots of organizations help vets and lots of organizations claim to while ripping them off. People need to be wary. The fact he isn&#39;t a Vet yet founded a group called Veterans on Patrol is a huge warning sign. All that being said, if this this guy is really trying to so something right and just needs a chance to prove himself, then he has to prove himself, not just pull on people&#39;s heart strings. The vids I&#39;ve seen suck. They lack details and open up way more questions than provide answers. Craig Sawyer seems to have done a 180° with the guy and that is something anyone who is supporting him ought to know as well.</p>

<p>If Meyer is who he says he is then because of his sloppiness, every high level bad guy associated with this shit has disavowed themselves and cut ties, the mid level traffickers are in the weeds and only the lowest level shit birds are left and they are fully aware they are being hunted and are scrambling to set shit on fire and hope they don&#39;t get caught by either side. I would think a guy like Meyer would have at least had some presence of mind to ask some of the vets or cops he works with how to set up a proper surveillance operation or at the very least how to handle potential evidence so that it is still admissable in court. It&#39;s disappointing because it appears even if Meyer does have good intentions he probably already fucked the whole thing up. At worst he&#39;s a the worst kind of confused. No harm in criticising him either way, as long as it&#39;s justifiable criticism. Asking questions is the only way to get answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough and I hope u r right. However, again, why not just accept cash or be up front about the fact that they do accept gift cards instead of stating that they don&#39;t even accept cash donations like it&#39;s some impressive selfless act or some kind of proof of being legit when it absolutely isn&#39;t? When people mention they don&#39;t take cash and fail to mention they do take gift cards it just sends another red flag up for me personally. It feels disingenuous to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that perfectly, at least you had the integrity to say that. My concern is when people say he doesn&#39;t accept cash and leave it at that, as if it&#39;s some sign of selflessness in and of itself without also just seeing it through by saying that they don&#39;t accept cash because they are not an officially registered charity but they do accept gift cards, gas cards etc. That way no one has any reason to criticise. As it stands it comes off as disingenuous to me, much like many other aspects of their mission.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust Meyer at this point, but if he isn&#39;t guilty of that charge and there is a fake pic going around and being posted up on social media that&#39;s fucking bullshit and needs to be corrected.

<p>You have a video of a woman claiming to have found a knife, not showing it. Sawman says that claim is false. </p>

<p>Claim that a bloody knife was found on the site: FALSE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I’ll throw this out there as possible reasons why:</p>

<p>Sawyer initially put out a video saying he went to the camp because he was told children were there. He himself said he saw evidence of a child trafficking camp and mentioned condoms, lube, and himself said “rape tree”.  He did at least one interview stating such, maybe more? Then suddenly, 180’d and denied everything he had previously said existed.  That alone is a big hit to his credibility. </p>

<p>He ha$ per$onal intere$t$ to protect with hi$ Contraland documentary. I’ll $peculate that he came to the conclusion that $aying what he did with all the negative attention Tuc$on wa$ bringing on $ocial media, he decided to di$tance him$elf, looking out for his bottom line. </p>

<p>He has ties to Hollywood, as well as have done security detail work for Hillary Clinton, John McCain, and Donald Rumsfeld. None of the above are known for honesty and integrity.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is being skeptical of anything Sawyer has said after his 180 is perfectly okay and justified.</p>

<p>Now this I find funny. The people who came here to shut down the conspiracy said the guy is full of shit and you should not believe him. Now that he has done a 180, they believe that he isn&#39;t talking shit anymore, that we should now believe what he says, disregarding the myriad of possibilities that might have caused the 180 in the first place. It&#39;s an excellent display of a complete lack of critical thinking and a obvious display of unconditional dogma to a particular agenda.</p>

<p>By actually seeing them prior to them being deleted. I mean, clearly, you are so very informed about this topic. Surely you had watched the videos before they were deleted, like the rest of us had.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I am aware of all the &quot;evidence&quot; that&#39;s contradictory or just plain false</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know absolutely nothing about this. You aren&#39;t qualified to even have the strong opinion you have. You have essentially not reviewed ANY of the evidence but have based your conclusion on what &#39;some people are saying&#39; and you probably will never go and look at any of the evidence because someone told you evidence is contradictory and false.</p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t have seen it all because you weren&#39;t even aware of these videos that were linked to several times prior to being deleted. If you had looked through the other videos which were linked in the very same threads, you would have seen them. But you didn&#39;t. You didn&#39;t look at anything. The entirety of your knowledge of this is what some people said to you. Was that during a staff meeting for shills?</p>

This Wisconsin scum is in Wisconsin and not Tuscon which is 7 states away, also their is almost a 10 year difference in age according to police reports. What are you trying to link now?

    <div class="md"><p>Part potato? Oh my god I had a really good laugh dude thank you so much. Insultant nostalgic flashback. Yes, man, lol, I know it says Wisconsin, sorry, what I meant to infer was that was a picture explaining that Lewis is not a registered sex offender and that whoever is spreading lies that he is a sex offender, is straight up lying.</p>

<p>In regards to the light pole, I think that is  hilarious, and a rather innocent thing to completely ignore someone over. He even is willing to talk about his past in his live streams... I mean come on.</p>

<p>Regardless, I really hope you&#39;re doing well brother, I really mean no harm around these parts it just can be hard to tell who is who.. Ya know?</p>

<p>as soon as this went viral cemex sent out a bull dozer and dozed over the site (first camp found) and fenced it off and put up signs</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They didn’t know it was there. If they didn’t know, clearly the land isn’t really being used. The only rational reason to bulldoze that quickly would be that they didn’t want people coming to investigate the site further. </p></li>
<li><p>They knew about it and didn’t care and didn’t know about anything nefarious going on beyond homeless people and drugs. Again, in this scenario, the rational for bulldozing would be that no one would have a reason to go investigate further. </p></li>

<p>TPD has a lot of evidence and probably even has the bloody knife as well. VOP is releasing evidence and pictures over time so people can decide for themselves what to believe. A photo of the knife being found will be beneficial and it will be released in due time </p>

<p>You can&#39;t claim some stuff, with no pictures, then claim others with pictures. They were on scene with the knife/cadaver/whatever before the cops were, but have no evidence of them existing, and thus likely were bullshit they came up with to get V4CP out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it appears to me that the septic tank in the ground is very much a holding cell, the straps on the tree are questionable, and the recently used empty house with maps most likely is used for illegal immigration or maybe human trafficking. A knife was supposedly given to LE. The animal head in the tree is not that unusual to country folk who hunt. The fact that the scene was bulldozed is a big indicator of something illegal going on imo. The backtracking of the guy with a Netflix show (and a lot to lose) and the many wild unsubstantiated claims are interesting as well. Controlled opposition or deliberate sabotage when your career etc is threatened? The video clearly shows the holding tank and the suspicious house. The scene was clamped down on (thanks GoatAnon) and bulldozed. Quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope pro VOPs don&#39;t take this as hate, I&#39;m trying to point out things that bother me, your mileage may vary. This group has no accountability, zero. It&#39;s not recognized by the state of AZ or IRS. It was said this group has no monetary reason, but that&#39;s not true, they are set up around receiving donations (or panhandling for an unlicensed cause). I&#39;m not going to say they do this, because I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s not uncommon to sell gift cards on the street for cash. </p>

<p>VOP made some serious claims that IMHO either cannot be proven (speculation) or just not true at all. It&#39;s entirely possible that some of the places they are taping are/were used for illegal purposes, there&#39;s just not any hard proof other than meth pipes. </p>
