<p>It&#39;s no secret that asbestos has led to tons of class action law suits, could this just be an attempt to set a precedent by the EPA that asbestos is safe and shut down lawsuits of mesothelioma victims? Im not sure what the legal situation here is, but I can see no other way anyone is benefiting from this other than maybe the people getting sued. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that once it&#39;s installed it&#39;s harmless unless it&#39;s disturbed. You wouldn&#39;t want to rip asbestos siding off your house or stir up any old vermiculite insulation in your attic which could contain it.</p>

<p>Asbestos was heavily used in residential and commercial applications... I think the propose of letting the public know that it&#39;s safe unless you fuck with it is to ease the minds of the millions of families who do have asbestos in their homes and don&#39;t have the resources to deal with it.</p>

<p>Of course those manufacturers would prefer to not have to pay a cent more to meso victims, but a conspiracy this is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question is who do you trust? Which profiteer is telling you the truth? 
I&#39;ve grinded on, cut and demolished quite a bit without mask or protection. I didn&#39;t know at the time of the dangers. I&#39;m fine and haven&#39;t had an issues, wouldn&#39;t do it again but I wonder how bad it really is. When dealing with asbestos you have spend money to get certified, take costly precautions, pay excessive amounts for disposals. I paid for an expensive special permit for a job, had to have everything double bagged and sealed just to watch the operators at the &quot;special landfill&quot; dump it the same as everything else.

    <div class="md"><p>My biggest reservation with why I do think it&#39;s harmful is there have been so many class action law suits over asbestos exposure that if it truly wasnt harmful the people paying out on those suits wouldn&#39;t have just rolled over and said &quot;meh, I&#39;ll just let this mob conspiracy take down not only my business but also make me pay for health damages. I also just won&#39;t say anything until 2018 when the president choses to uncover this truth.&quot; That scenario seems much less likely than the events that occured. It was determined to be dangerous, became a heath concern, profiteers saw an opportunity to gouge people via &quot;overly safe and redundent practices and permits&quot; and used the government to make those expansive practices mandatory because public fear saw that as necessary when they aren&#39;t informed on what actualy is necessary versus redundant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They said they aren&#39;t looking into asbestos for existing homes, so that&#39;s the exact type of ceilings that would be at risk, homes in older or poor communities that either don&#39;t know or don&#39;t have the money to change these things. Asbestos can be in ceiling tiles, floor tiles,  siding, insulation, there are tons of places it can be in older buildings. But regardless the way this change was done is incredibly suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t realize that Russia was the world&#39;s largest asbestos producer. I&#39;m not sure to ehat extent this exact situation does in that regard because I&#39;m pretty sure the EPA still isn&#39;t putting asbestos in New buildings. But it would be intresting if Trump got this whole &quot;asbestos is 100% safe once set&quot; (which isn&#39;t completely wrong but also isn&#39;t completely right)  idea from a Russian.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing. He waivers back and forth on his positions on so many issues and doesn&#39;t seem to really care deeply about about anything other than his properties, lip service to appeal to his base (&#39;build the wall&#39;, &#39;lock her up&#39;) and mainly, anything that affects Russia. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not <em>trying</em> to hurt the country. He&#39;s just trying to help himself and his business interests, but in the process, he&#39;s super hurting the country. </p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s given any thought to whether it&#39;s legal, illegal, unethical, or unAmerican, he just knows what serves his own interests. And clearly Russia is serving his interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The block of flats where I live from the 70s all had their central heating unit housed upon a huge block of and cased in blocks of asbestos. Over the past couple of decades, these ancient hot air contraptions have mostly been replaced by combi boilers to feed radiators and the taps simultaneously, and some have tried to have their old units removed. </p>

<p>This involved huge anti-contaminations tents all over the fucking place on the street and in their houses because of the asbestos. Even then there was a huge issue because some of this dangerous crap was getting everywhere, just for people wanting to replace their prehistoric heating system, which in Scotland where I can recall having snow in July a few years ago, is important. In the end, everyone has had to have that entire cupboard blocked off forever and install the boilers in the small kitchens taking up space and have pipes drilled through the walls everywhere across the house. </p>

<p>But asbestos isn&#39;t a problem at all... right. Working in respiratory wards I have seen <strong>SO, SO MANY</strong> old men who used to work in the home renovation profession, who were exposed to asbestos over the years suffocating to death due to asbestosis or mesothelioma. Obviously the COPD from all that smoking they did back then was hardly helpful, but it&#39;s a seriously awful way to go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he has a good point. Please recognize it. </p>

<p>Asbestos is an amazing fire resistant. It literally wont catch fire. </p>

<p>BUT WORKERS that work with it WILL fie early from it. </p>

<p>So PICK ONE, hundreds of thousands of dead workers from cancer, or a fire proof skyscraper.</p>

<p>Trump has clearly made his choice. </p>

<p>We have the same tradeoffs with things like coal, gas, fish, logging, etc.</p>

<p>We choose to make instead of care about lives.</p>
