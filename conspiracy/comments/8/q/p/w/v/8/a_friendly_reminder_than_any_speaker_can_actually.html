       Its funny you mention this. My roommate doesn't believe the microphone works the same as the one in his cell phone. A microphone is a microphone and most certainly works in the same manner in terms of targeted advertisments to its users.

       Kinda. The wiring just has to be reversed as far as I know.

       This could be done by software if the speaker is wired up to the right equipment.

       Plug headphones into the mic jack, hit record. Try one side, then the other, only one works as a mic. Its a hardware thing that goes back to the 80s at least, I used it growing up.

       I remember back when I was a kid and my dad had one of those big ass stereo setups with  a record player and all the other components stacked on top of one another. I plugged in a set of his headphones into the mic jack and realized I could use the headphones as a microphone. It was way quieter than using the actual microphone he had but it still worked.

       I mentioned this a few months back in a thread about surveillance and got down voted to oblivion. Hilarious. I was using that trick way back in the 80s and 90s because I never had a mic to record things with, so it's a hardware thing, not software.

       This sounds scarier than it is. If your speakers are wired as speakers, plugged in to your audio output, they cannot be used as microphones in that state.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for them to be used as (shitty) microphones, they would have to be manually reconfigured (Meaning plugged into your mic input).
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if they did work as microphones and speakers at the same time, they would only ever pick up whatever is coming out of those speakers, and maybe very fuckin faintly some other audio which would be nigh-impossible to properly isolate.
      </p>
      <p>
       True, you could work some magic with phase cancelation, but you would have to compensate the original audio to have the same frequency response as your set of speakers as well as the response of the makeshift microphone. And, just going off of my personal experience with isolating vocals in a song, phase cancelation is very difficult to get right even in the best cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR: Yes, speakers can be used as microphones, but it's extremely unlikely and you would know if they were being used as microphones because they would not be functioning as speakers.
       </strong>

       I came here to say this. Anybody getting paranoid that their speakers will suddenly start listening to them has no clue how audio hardware works.

       Exactly. This is one area I actually have some expertise in, nobody else had mentioned it yet. I guess it's to be expected that a conspiracy sub gets paranoid posts like this, but it's important to debunk the misinformed. It's far easier and more reliable for the government to tap your phone digitally or read your emails, etc than it is for them to use your speakers as microphones.

       Spot on. I’ve always been a tinkerer and as a kid took apart my Walkman headphones and a shitty mic my dad used with his tape recorder to record his songs. I saw they looked similar and plugged in the headphones into the mic jack and it worked, but I almost had to put the headphone earpiece all the way into my mouth and growl loudly for it to register anything. Let’s also not forget the physics of this set up. The amount of air movement needed to get even a small 2/3” loud speaker (not headphone speaker) to be able to pick up any vibration on the paper cone would be similar to parking a cement mixer right in front of it. Just not usable in the real world. The other side of things is the electrical current flow path. You feed high amounts of current to the coil in order to counter the static pull of the magnet which causes the cone to move back and forth, moving air and creating sound. A mic needs to be amplified in the opposite direction with a much smaller buffer/preamp. The power requirements each of these circuits are not only radically exponential to each other, but incompatible, making this set up impossible.

       Back in the day we used to use headphones as mics to get a f'd up sound. The sound was clear enough to understand. It would just be one more tool to listen to everyday conversations. It doesn't matter if it's inefficient. If you want to know what people are saying in private it's a possible tool.

       The amplifiers that drive any modern cell phone speaker have a voltage monitor built in for speaker protection algorithms. The measured voltage can be sent back to the phone application processor via serial data. In fact, NXP holds a patent using this monitor of speaker back EMF as an auxiliary microphone for low frequency / high SPL recording.
      </p>

       So basically any phone can listen to you with its speaker. But the audio quality from that transducer is very poor.

        I don't know if it's possible to make this happen through software whilst the headphone is plugged into the headphone jack but it is something to consider.

       No. The TRRS jacks are wired so that the amplifier output is to the headphones. The (mic/line) input amplifier is on a different wire.
Yes, there is crosstalk - it's &gt;60dB down. Probably easier to just hack your mobile phone.

       This is true, but for a speaker to actually function as a microphone, a lot of the wiring has to be altered. Also this isn't much of a conspiracy theory considering that if someone wanted to listen to what you were saying/doing, we're already pretty much surrounded by microphones. Using a speaker as a mic wouldn't be practical in any way shape or form.
