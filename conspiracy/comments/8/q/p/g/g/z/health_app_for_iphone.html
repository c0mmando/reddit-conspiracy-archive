<p>Your argument that international law is something respected by internationally recognized states went out the window at least when they decided not to prosecute Bush for war crimes, but really centuries before that. International law went out the window when the US Congress passed a law authorizing the military to invade the Hague if they ever hold a representative of the US government for war crimes trials. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>All good. Didn&#39;t really expect the edit, but thank you nonetheless.</p>

<p>My question about international law in this context or you declaring sovereignty on an island is, do you truly expect this claim to be respected by other states or the one Sovereign under this law? </p>

<p>My argument is that if they did respect it, it wouldn&#39;t be from adherence to the Law, but because doing so is in their best interests as they understand it. If you&#39;re on some remote island of no value to them, and you pose no threat to them, they might ignore you. I won&#39;t doubt that. But I have no reason to believe they wouldn&#39;t dispose of you however they see fit the moment they find it advantageous to do so, and they would face no consequences. </p>

<p>Laws only matter, they only have force, when there are consequences to breaking them. If you or I are caught breaking US law, we will face consequences. If some entity violates your declared sovereignty under International Law, do they face consequences. If so, how do they face them?</p>

<p>This still isn&#39;t an answer. Specifically, if you declare sovereignty on your island, and some state or non-state actor invades you, will they face consequences and how? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt this, but I have no reason to believe they&#39;d accept you in that club. To be considered a gentleman in their club you have to either be part of a <em>gens</em> they acknowledge, or prove yourself useful to them. Are you either?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a fair argument, but then it wouldn&#39;t require invoking international law at all. You&#39;re just banking on being left alone. That could work for some time, or it might not. All depends on others&#39; interests. </p>

<p>Realistically? No. I think it&#39;s a faulty premise that you can beat them at their game. They&#39;ve been playing at the highest levels for millennia, and have no compunctions about using violence if it advances their interests. </p>

<p>I think we need to <em>stop</em> playing their game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They said that when the world was a very different place. Those are far smarter people than me and I respect them very much. Morally upright, constantly trying to innovate and change their surrounds. With that said....You can&#39;t win by force or resistance anymore. There&#39;s to many people now. At this point it&#39;s more like herding people in the direction you want them to go. Right or wrong people follow. Not just Americans but humans in general it&#39;s like a zombie mob mentality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea it&#39;s weak but you gotta play the game. I&#39;m more worried if we did that and it was working they&#39;d come for me and mine and make it seem like a Jonestown. Is it so wrong to just be left alone? </p>

<p>I got no issues wit taxes if we did do it cuz we&#39;d need services like paramedics/firefighters/garbage/sewage. I&#39;d like to think we could figure out power and be off the grid and hopefully find ground water to tap into. Hunt the land and farm have someone there who knows General medicine like a nurse practitioner</p>
