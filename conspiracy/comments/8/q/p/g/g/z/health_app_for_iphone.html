       My coworker just put me on to this. He showed me and you can tell how active a person was. We joked around about who was the laziest but then I got to thinking this is gonna be a game changer.

       Instead of my 40hr a week work load it's gonna be a daily monitor. It'll say you have to have 10000 steps a day to be qualified to earn a pay check. I'm damn near certain I'll see that before I retire.

       I have thought about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are going to try something like that, you are better of starting a church.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, churches operate for free. Second, if you EVER decided to start your own country on US soil. You are going to have to go to war. And you will need lots of people to do this.

       A. Rules don't matter they'll just kill you
B. I don't want to fight. Doesn't mean I won't but I'd rather pay taxes than start it up with an open checkbook army marines local fuckin police force that's like the military. It'll be all peaceful. And everything would be video tapped. My city would be more video taped than London. Not to persecute but to protect. No way to spin it if you're peaceful Jesus ghandi mlk it's the only way to win.

       The US isn't really shit, TBH, and they are still bound by International Law, which Rome (Vatican) controls. Find an island, Declare Sovereignty under International Law, Declare your Country, and see what happens. I seriously think nothing would. I think we have Stockholm Syndrome, which keeps us from doing it. Fuck that shit. I'm a Viking at heart...

       Lol you retarded as shit. Don't take that the wrong way but to say the us isn't shit. It can destroy the world multiple times over with their nuclear arsenal. They can blow up the entire building you are in with the push of a button, it can turn all of society that doesn't know you, against you. Don't underestimate your opponent.

       Look it up, as in there's some definition you're using that I should agree with? You're missing my point, as usual, but rather than try to understand what I'm saying, you give a vague non-answer that implies superiority.

      <p>
       Your argument that international law is something respected by internationally recognized states went out the window at least when they decided not to prosecute Bush for war crimes, but really centuries before that. International law went out the window when the US Congress passed a law authorizing the military to invade the Hague if they ever hold a representative of the US government for war crimes trials.
      </p>
      <p>
       International law is what the powerful use to violate the rights of the weak. It's laughable to think the weak could ever use it against the strong. Your bullshit semantics are irrelevant in the face of power.

       Nations are not Sovereign, only humans can be. So... Who gives Sovereignty? International Law, or Natural Law. They are one in the same. Listen when I talk to you,  Celine.

       I edited it, mate. I'm sorry, a bit heated tonight. My definition of International Law, is International Law based on Roman/
Papal/Canon Law. It's Commercial. Everything is. There is only one Sovereign, technically under this Law. Guess who? This is where Heraldry comes from.

       All good. Didn't really expect the edit, but thank you nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question about international law in this context or you declaring sovereignty on an island is, do you truly expect this claim to be respected by other states or the one Sovereign under this law?
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument is that if they did respect it, it wouldn't be from adherence to the Law, but because doing so is in their best interests as they understand it. If you're on some remote island of no value to them, and you pose no threat to them, they might ignore you. I won't doubt that. But I have no reason to believe they wouldn't dispose of you however they see fit the moment they find it advantageous to do so, and they would face no consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws only matter, they only have force, when there are consequences to breaking them. If you or I are caught breaking US law, we will face consequences. If some entity violates your declared sovereignty under International Law, do they face consequences. If so, how do they face them?

       This still isn't an answer. Specifically, if you declare sovereignty on your island, and some state or non-state actor invades you, will they face consequences and how?

       I don't doubt this, but I have no reason to believe they'd accept you in that club. To be considered a gentleman in their club you have to either be part of a

       That's a fair argument, but then it wouldn't require invoking international law at all. You're just banking on being left alone. That could work for some time, or it might not. All depends on others' interests.

       Realistically? No. I think it's a faulty premise that you can beat them at their game. They've been playing at the highest levels for millennia, and have no compunctions about using violence if it advances their interests.

       They said that when the world was a very different place. Those are far smarter people than me and I respect them very much. Morally upright, constantly trying to innovate and change their surrounds. With that said....You can't win by force or resistance anymore. There's to many people now. At this point it's more like herding people in the direction you want them to go. Right or wrong people follow. Not just Americans but humans in general it's like a zombie mob mentality.

       Yea it's weak but you gotta play the game. I'm more worried if we did that and it was working they'd come for me and mine and make it seem like a Jonestown. Is it so wrong to just be left alone?

       I got no issues wit taxes if we did do it cuz we'd need services like paramedics/firefighters/garbage/sewage. I'd like to think we could figure out power and be off the grid and hopefully find ground water to tap into. Hunt the land and farm have someone there who knows General medicine like a nurse practitioner
