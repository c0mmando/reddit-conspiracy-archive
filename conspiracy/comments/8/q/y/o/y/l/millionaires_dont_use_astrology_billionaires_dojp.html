    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Great answer. Barnum statements are the use of language that applies to anyone but appears to be very personal. The name comes from P.T. Barnum who was very adept at applying this technique to a large audience. </p>

<p>I hope that you have a response to this question, because I agree with you that when comparing astrological analysis, a poignant observation far outweighs a generalization, and  your point that we are unique as some type of intelligence that can&#39;t be observed outside of our own solar system is truly remarkable.</p>

<p>Thank you for your input. I respect that you have spent a lot of time thinking about this subject, and your answers makes sense. Do you have an example of a poignant astrological prediction or assessment? How accurate is this discipline? How is it applied, and what differentiates pop-culture or lazy journalistic applications from a serious practitioner?</p>

<p>I hope that you understand my skepticism and don&#39;t see it as criticism. </p>

<p>Barnum statements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a way the person listening to these must seek out and want to believe them due to a need for some encouragement or psychological validation. I would say people who accept Barnum statements have done little to no work on maturing and upon suddenly realizing they&#39;re far behind seek out anything that scratches the itch and can pass as insightful. It&#39;s like if a man who&#39;s never cooked tried do to it for his girlfriend, burned a dish and just ordered takeout so he saves face and gets unearned validation. So it&#39;s a perfect match of those who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re saying and those who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re hearing but like it anyway.</p>

<p>Barnum statements are an unavoidable and necessary part of any mystical art as they&#39;re an introduction to the devastating core truths in a superficial way that can be safely spread in the general public. Even when put out to deceive or defraud, Barnum statements do have a valid purpose, so we could say real mystics don&#39;t object these blatant lies because they might get a pupil or two back through them, people with a real yearning for the truth who couldn&#39;t stop digging.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have an example of a poignant astrological prediction or assessment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/carl_jung_108743">one by Carl Jung</a>. I think he attempted to introduce astrology as a valid psychological tool through his idea of archetypes but was some 500 years ahead of his time. I found his work on Animus/Anima to closely coincide with what I discovered independently on the part of personality dominated by the ascendent.</p>

<p>I suggest you let yourself be pulled towards random books and magazines and your subconscious will nudge you towards complete answers with regards to astrology in profound detail. That&#39;s what happened to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How accurate is this discipline?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on the astrologer&#39;s mastery of his biases and ego to not taint the reading. If you were to learn how to distinguish genuine from fraudulent astrologers and found a master you could get to know the exact time and cause of your and your loved ones&#39; love, illness and death but that would generally not help you in the slightest unless you had the presence of mind to know how to use this information. Like that scene with Jack Nicholson, &quot;You can&#39;t handle the truth&quot; and we could call maniacs and schizophrenics those among us who&#39;ve had the blinders off, which again loops us back to psychology. It&#39;s actually safer for everyone that real astrology stays hidden for all but a few who are already going crazy searching for truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is it applied</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Astrology is used to tap into causal threads and verbalize them. Things happen because planets dance and the same thing happened 50 or 100 years ago, though now it&#39;s our chance to play out the part in a different way. Everything repeats in the grand theater of life but never exactly the same and astrology is the program booklet given to patrons, some not even bothering to open or read it. Others just gloss over the contents and think they know everything and so on.</p>

<p>Those who want to know or simply haven&#39;t lost their curiosity have a greater enjoyment of the show and know what to expect, they have a deeper insight into what&#39;s about to happen, they recognize references to other works and can tell if the actors are playing their roles right compared to a viewer who&#39;s just taking it all in. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>what differentiates pop-culture or lazy journalistic applications from a serious practitioner?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t disparage or call anything &quot;lazy&quot;. It all has a purpose but it&#39;s just that it doesn&#39;t satisfy <em>your needs</em>. In the case of simplified astrology, the purpose is to show to the general public that there is always a solution, that things happen with a reason and as a part of a greater story, not just at random. The purpose is also to pad out pages to sell newspapers, magazines, books and so on.</p>

<p>A serious practitioner knows that he is just a messenger and doesn&#39;t attach himself emotionally to the message or assign to himself a grandiose title or position. Such a person would also know things I mentioned throughout this comment. For this is best that you exercise your intuition and you&#39;ll gain an invaluable tool that was always there but you never used it, as if you thought you were a cripple but your arm was just numb and lay unused. </p>

<p>Mainstream (science) is mainly ego-driven.

<p>I&#39;ve seen things occur in predictable patterns and regular cycles through unconscious actors, who themselves were unable to change anything even when I pointed out the pattern and the cycle. I&#39;d say 60% of the world&#39;s population hasn&#39;t worked on themselves or on becoming conscious, which means for them life and development of the personality stopped in early childhood, perhaps at 10. Their existence is nothing more than astrological influences, they are so immersed in their impulses, in hunger, pain, pleasure, fear and aggression that they can&#39;t perceive anything beyond it, <em>they can&#39;t choose</em>, their life and everything around them is chosen for them by the planetary influences.</p>

<p>Brain seems to be a living antenna tuned to the mix of planetary frequencies stamped on it when the baby leaves the protection of the womb and amnionic fluid, which explains natal charts. The influences themselves appear similar to quantum entanglement, where two particles have faster-than-light interactions. This also implies that our behavior somehow influences the planets, we&#39;re feeding our energies back to them and our accumulated tiny reactions matter over the span of infinite eons.</p>

<p>People we spend our time with can filter out both positive and negative influences, they serve as lightning rods for either category and what harms you or me might be amusing or exhilarating to them <em>or</em> what inspires you or me might be toxic or disturbing to them. </p>

<p>People around us mold these frequencies and determine what we can become, so spend time with those you admire, appreciate and are interested in while giving space to everyone else and see if they approach you first. If they don&#39;t or do so only when needing something it&#39;s not a healthy relationship and you shouldn&#39;t foster it. Investigate who you are by analyzing the impulses that drive you and try to catalog them. Observe yourself, watch and feel how your body reacts to things and people and see if you can detect patterns. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would you recommend?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a theory that astrology can help me find a person with whom perfectly clear communication is possible and that something would happen to turn my life around. I tested it out and found a true male friend, though the rules might not have been as clear cut as I thought.</p>

<p>After all these years I can simplify my astrological knowledge as <em>follow whatever and whoever inspires you</em> and your life will change for the better. It&#39;s hard to describe what happens until you experience it but the best I can put it is that unused and seemingly useless affects in me were suddenly dusted off and put to good use for the entire world. </p>

<p>I want to mention that I&#39;ve become richer in all ways after meeting and simply talking on a weekly basis to this person over the course of several years, including monetarily, yet I can&#39;t pinpoint what was actually said or done to bring about that change. He&#39;s gotten a gainful employment through it too because I shared what I learned with him, though he vehemently denies that astrology had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>I will also tell you to start reading physical books/magazines, if you&#39;re not already doing so. My subconscious seems to have influenced me and tried to communicate with me by drawing me to things to read, because I actually first learned about some of these things through certain books and magazines in such a way that could not have been a coincidence. Over the course of my life I&#39;ve been drawn to read certain things that pointed me in the right direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you telling me I can bypass impulses/pain/hunger/planetary influences to some extent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I first thought astrology is a set of ironclad rules for everyone but I&#39;d constantly get these outliers that didn&#39;t make any sense. I eventually concluded free will is equal in intensity to the planets&#39; influence, but only if exercised, and these people were in a sense defiant to the point where they had some influence on what happened to them. We have many chances each day to exercise our free will and those that consistently do have a chance of thinking, feeling and acting freely.</p>

<p>Life consists of major junctures, which is where we either use our free will to go down the temporarily uncomfortable but correct path or just let our innate desires lead us wherever. </p>

<p>Behavior and emotions are always rooted in physiology. For depression I&#39;d recommend riding a bike or just taking a walk, for acute illnesses I&#39;d scrutinize the diet and minimize refined sugars and processed food. In both cases look into eating things such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29671209">radishes</a>, raw <a href="http://thescipub.com/PDF/ajassp.2009.1067.1069.pdf">ginger</a> and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044658">scallions</a>. It&#39;s possible both are also brought about by negativity, such as scathing comments by someone close to us, in which case the person must always respond and deny each and every one such comment in a calm and reasonable fashion as soon as they&#39;re said.</p>

Every conceivable decision making process would work for them: black magic, white magic, coin flipping or gender studies would be just as good as astrology in this environment. </p>

<p>What would you recommend? I don&#39;t feel truly conscious (I don&#39;t even meditate much) but I feel more conscious than the average person....which is not impressive lol. Are you telling me I can bypass impulses/pain/hunger/planetary influences to some extent? I would like to be more in control of my destiny and more conscious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Great answer. Barnum statements are the use of language that applies to anyone but appears to be very personal. The name comes from P.T. Barnum who was very adept at applying this technique to a large audience. </p>

<p>I hope that you have a response to this question, because I agree with you that when comparing astrological analysis, a poignant observation far outweighs a generalization, and  your point that we are unique as some type of intelligence that can&#39;t be observed outside of our own solar system is truly remarkable.</p>

<p>Thank you for your input. I respect that you have spent a lot of time thinking about this subject, and your answers makes sense. Do you have an example of a poignant astrological prediction or assessment? How accurate is this discipline? How is it applied, and what differentiates pop-culture or lazy journalistic applications from a serious practitioner?</p>

<p>I hope that you understand my skepticism and don&#39;t see it as criticism. </p>
