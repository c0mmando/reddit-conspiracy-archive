       No, there is not. There have been claims that this is, indeed, possible but they are unproven. This is the fun part about belief. No one can prove it - or disprove it - so it comes down to who/what you believe.

You have no clue who God is ,you where created by Him ,you don't get to make Him up in the small recesses of your mind. But I offer you hope. I challenge you to read the New testament and you will find a love that is eternally.greater than anything that has ever entered man's heart.then you can begin to speak truth.please take my challenge and the thruth shall make you free.

       Your belief in a "God" is laughingly biased. With all the blatant evil that has happened in History your "God" must surely be the biggest asshole

       I hate to break it to you but there is no God except in the minds of people like yourself. Your belief in it makes God real to you which is fine but the new testament is boring and you shouldn't pretend otherwise. OP is trying to explain his own interpretation of a form of pantheism. You are so quick to criticize and demand he follow yiur God.. this is not a good thing and I suggest you use more finesse next time if you really want to change OPs mind.

      <p>
       You missed the point. Consciousness isn't "recycled". It is always present, but is in a state of inactivity when not part of a human host. In other words when you are born, physically, your consciousness is part of your human host for the whole of your current life. When your human host passes away, your consciousness remains - but with new "data" gained, or lost, depending on what you did while your human host was alive. Think of it as a cosmic Bank account.

       I do kind of have a "philosophy" that I kind of kick about though, sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our consciousness, such as it exists, whether it's its own thing or some combination of ethereal and physical attributes, creates its own afterlife, even if it's just in the last moment before your spark goes black.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a Lutheran?  Okay, did you live your life according to the rules of Protestantism and on the whole you're comfortable with your actions?  You get your vision of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're Catholic?  You lived your life pretty good, you think, but you don't know if you make the grade?  Okay, Catholicism allows for that.  You get your glimpse of Purgatory before you go "poof".
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't speak in detail to the other religions of the world; but whatever your vision of sublimity is based on your beliefs and value system, I think you reach it if YOU feel, measured against yourself and what you "know" to be right and wrong, you've done the right things to reach it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a Hell here?  I think that people who've acted in ways that go against their moral barometer - whatever they've been taught as "right" and "wrong", whatever has entered their subconscious as "right" and "wrong" - will actually measure themselves (based on their perception of a "higher judgement") and experience "hell" in their final moments before the end of their conscious life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe forever - I'm still a heaven-and-hell believer, myself, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... i.e. do serial killers go to hell?  Hmmmm.  Did they act in a way they felt was "right"? Or did they act in a way that deviated from what they knew to be "right"?  Their own consciousness will play the part of the Great Judge upon their death and determine what their final vision will be.

       Interesting. I personally don't place any stock in a, for lack of a better term, "God" (or "Budda" or "Allah") simply because this belief system allows people to shift the responsibility for their own actions onto the "God". Whereas with the Karma system, there is direct responsibility for one's own actions. Now the results aren't manifested in our current life, true, and
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is where the Karma and God systems converge. The reason for this is simply that human nature doesn't recognize
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       belief system at all. It never has and never will. This accounts for your example of a serial killer. He (statistically men) is simply mentally ill, in an
       <em>
        extreme
       </em>
       way. The problem with a "God" is that the notion is considerably biased. I like to repeat a joke I once heard long ago: "God must be a man, because a women wouldn't fuck things up this badly" (George Carlin?). Said in humour, but true, I think, just that same...
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       you believe in God.

      <p>
       No, not at all. I intentionally did not define the actions, simply because I can't. "One's own actions" applies differently to each person. I can only judge
       <em>
        my actions
       </em>
       and mine alone.

      <p>
       Kind of. Remember that for every action there is a corresponding re-action. This is the basis for the saying "What goes around comes around". This is true for every belief system equally - and - for the non-believers too.

       I also have problems believing in a karma "bank account" that goes from one life to the next.  Since most of us are blank slates at birth, with no obvious signs of being developmentally "more along" than anyone else at birth or in childhood (with a few very rare exceptions).
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has any idea how far along in the "process" they are, it would appear.  Or, in your concept of "karma", that what's happening to them now has anything to do with what they've supposedly "done" to someone else in a past life.  That hardly seems fair.

       Consciousness is a freely available shape; it can be reproduced. When you're no longer conscious, there is a filter process. Filter process is passing through a creative judge who peers into your mental abstraction that concerns all of your years: we're you to greedy? And ultimately, are you guilty?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously I can't prove this but, inter alia, given that dreams are true, and lucid dreams too, it shows us that abstractions happen and mind can exist outer body temporarily. Further, it's unfair, if you can sit around for your life eating animals, while I don't and put in effort to be different; there is fairness in life well, I believe it.

       lmfao, good luck with that one. I've studied NDE's for 8 years after having my own NDE's/OBE's and have met others at conferences who remember being forced against their will to reincarnate.

       I can't explain this and I believe it happened, in this case.  Maybe it happens to people who got a raw deal in the time before?

       I just don't wanna believe it happens as a matter of course, to everyone.

       Funniest thing ever, when you NDE, you remember that you are from that realm/existence and you start remembering which part/area you are from.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also memories of your past lives and existence inbewteen lives located in your subconscious, but tapping is hard for most people, though it can be done

       I tell you as a man born and raised in a secular muslim family and these are my currrent goals and toughts, they are getting stronger everyday especially going alkaline vegan, unfortunatly I still live at home and in an scandinavian country so fresh organic fruits and vegetables is hard to come by.. 
But for me psycadelics and deep thinking has really helped me on my path and im thankful for it, abraham religions have always been very silly for me lol and when one studies history, religion and anthropology and see the bigger context everything starts to crumble and break as the matrix unfolds.

       People are in for a rude awakening thinking plants are lower then  Animals and eating plants is the only way...They are just as  A life as you and I and as a cow that's the lie that  Superior vegans feel and the  karment trap they get them selfs in not seeing the plant life is  Just as equal. Life is about  Balance and being  Grateful for what has passed out its lifeforce for you to live. Just like in Nature. Wake up people stop getting drawn to side that say they are better there is no sides there only life and Yes life eats life that's life but the trick is to be great full and thankful  dont be just a plant killer and a Animal killer so thank you for there sacrifice. So many plants scream in pain and no  Bats an eye sad right?

       That's absurd. All life isn't equal. Plants have many lesser attributes to animals as well as many greater attributes IFC you want to nickel and dime the comparison. Even if you're looking at it from a moral interpretation it's still equally absurd. How likely is it that someone would sacrifice themselves to save the lives of 100 children compared to someone sacrificing themselves to stop a lawn mower from cutting a few feet of grass?
