        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’m creating this thread because the shilling of Pizzagate in this sub particularly concerns me deeply. Pizza/pedogate has so much evidence, and much more than probably any other conspiracy discussed on this sub. Today I want to talk about sender of the heated pool email Tamara Luzzatto.</p>

<p>Tamara Luzzatto wrote this email:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736</a></p>

<p>This part is deeply disturbing to a lot of people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People started to investigate Tamara and found her blog, <strong>Evie’s Crib</strong>. First of all, the entry text to the blog is rather weird. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ELHWg">“For a limited time only, you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut. Take advantage of this now, as in the future she will have the power of life and death over you.”</a></p>

<p>When we look further, we can see some <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ELHWg">deeply disturbing tags</a> for a blog about a baby.</p>

<p>Tags such as <strong>Discomfort, Parental Manipulation, Public Intoxication, Skullduggery, Transquilizers, Malpractice</strong> and more.</p>

<p>Lastly, but not least: Swordfish69, famous Pedogate reseacher has <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1786134">uncovered evidence that the Luzzatto family are both linked to occult kabbalah worship and the Black Nobility, a globalist faction based in Northern Italy and Switzerland. Moshe Chaim Luzzatto was a messianic cult leader accused of promoting black magic through a secret cult during the 18th century</a></p>

<p>This is worth the read. It’s amazing what this guy has found so far. You can look at all of his submission <a href="https://voat.co/user/swordfish69/submissions">here.</a></p>

<p>Advertising of webcam &quot;sessions&quot; with an infant child, and referring to them as a chance to see her &quot;raw and uncut&quot;, doesn&#39;t seem particularly innocent to me. </p>

<p>Not to mention the Luzzatos are all power players, some of them with CFR pull.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before joining Hillary’s team, Tamera worked in the office of Senator John D. Rockefeller from 1985 to 1999, rising to the level of chief of staff. &quot;Ms. Luzzatto was his primary adviser on the National Commission on Children&quot; [and] the Pepper Commission on Health Care. </p>

<p>The kids&#39; grandmother wrote this email.  It&#39;s quite normal for a grandparent to find her grandkids entertaining.  She is amused by their childish antics and enjoys their company.  I don&#39;t see what is so disturbing about that or how you can stretch this comment into meaning that she is going to offer up the children to some kind of satanic sex cult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at the rest of the tags in the screenshot, they&#39;re mostly referring to the struggles of raising a newborn baby (#AngryBaby, #MiserableParents, etc).  So #tranquilizer probably is a silly joke about how the parents wish they had a tranq to get the baby to fall asleep.  #Discomfort because the parents hardly get any sleep themselves and so on.</p>

<p>Again, this blog is written by a grandma.  Old people sometimes have odd senses of humor.  I don&#39;t know what else to tell you.  Pizzagaters seem to have already made their mind up that every one of the President&#39;s adversaries is bloodthirsty pedophile, so I doubt that any alternative theories I present will even be considered at all.</p>

<p>Nobody is saying pedophilia rings don&#39;t exist and there is little doubt very rich and powerful people are participating in it. I don&#39;t think many people on this board would dispute this conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>The difference, however, is when you start throwing out accusations against against real people based on a bunch of speculative nonsense, like this post (before it was deleted). This is where I get to ask for evidence and dispute the sufficiency the proof provided.</p>

<p>How do you explain the tags on the blog?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you ask <a href="/u/PUTIN_IS_A_CUNT_">/u/PUTIN_IS_A_CUNT_</a> instead of <a href="/u/Newgunnerr">/u/Newgunnerr</a> or the person who took the screenshot? Why is it that the person who makes the accusations doesn&#39;t have to prove shit, but anyone who questions the narrative has to prove a negative?</p>

<p>It&#39;s very suspicious that they took a screenshot of the list of words, but not their context. It would have only been one click away. But they deliberately leave it out. It&#39;s so suspicious, in fact, that I decided to research their claims and tracked down where those words appear:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/2g30Y">http://archive.is/2g30Y</a></p>

<p>So, &quot;discomfort&quot;, &quot;parental manipulation&quot;, and &quot;skullduggery&quot; refer to the baby getting her shots, being fussy, and their parrents&#39; attempt at placating her. &quot;EWB&quot; are the initials of a woman. &quot;Public intoxication&quot; refers to a picture of grampa holding the baby (possibly referring to his closed eyes in the picture).</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find a backup of the other words, but given that literally every single word in the above backup is completely innocent when we see the context, and none of the the original accusers seems to have bothered to back-up that context, I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say that they&#39;re probably equally as innocent.</p>

<p>My theory: There are people out there conspiring to purposely misleading, cherrypicking, etc. in an attempt to smear specific individuals. The only question is why and why now? What are they trying to distract us from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who are all of these people that come into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> just for the purpose of down-voting and gas-lighting research into elite pedophilia?</p>

<p>Better question, why would a legal guardian offer young children for &quot;entertainment&quot; to creepy elites with fangs? Why would a legal guardian offer &quot;raw and uncut&quot; time with children who they seem to think will one day be in control of even those who partake in abusing them?</p>

<p>It makes perfect sense that these abused children will one day be catapulted into positions of great wealth and power. That is how elite pedophilia works.</p>

<p>The children who are obviously being abused by the Podesta bros will one day be the abusers so that the cycle continues. They will bow down to their masters above them and serve as puppets those who really pull the strings. By that time they will of enacted this type of behavior on film to new victims which will be used to blackmail them for the tenure of their service to the Cabal.</p>

<p>Many of the new victims abused by these children in the email will eventually be put into positions of great power as well.</p>

<p>This fits the narrative perfectly of what many see as the elite pedophile ring that has seized control of the upper echelons of most industries, religions and political systems.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a matter of time before the rest of the world sees what we are uncovering here. There is no way you are going to stop the awakening from taking place.</p>

<p>Because this sub didn&#39;t use to be like this.  I&#39;d love to discuss 9/11 truth, military-industrial complex influence over foreign policy, domestic spying, JFK assassination theories, even something fun like cryptozoology.</p>

<p>But those topics hardly get brought up anymore ever since Trump got elected and his cultist followers that populate this sub only want to push conspiracies that demonize their leader&#39;s political adversaries.  Because that&#39;s exactly what this is.  No one actually cares about the kids.  It&#39;s all about framing those who oppose Daddy as pedophiles.</p>

<p>Harming a child, especially sexually, is literally one of the most heinous and despicable acts that a human being can commit.  It&#39;s really fucked up to toss these accusations around, especially with such a lack of real evidence.  If someone falsely named you as a pedophile I would think you would want others to speak up in your defense, as well.</p>
