       During the years Bush was invading Iraq, it was all we heard about. End the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now Trump is paving a path to peace, and the front page is running stories about the atrocities in North Korea. We all know the situation is very bad in North Korea, it's been that way for decades, and that's why peace and modern relations are so important! There seems to be some pervasive idea in the liberal-leaning parts of the media right now that further alienation of NK will somehow solve this problem. That having a meeting between world leaders conveys weakness. This is childish, and exactly the attitude that has prevented peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seriously seems like some people on the left would rather not have peace if Trump is the one to do it. They would accept it if someone else was doing it, but not Trump. Disgusting priorities. I'm not a huge Trump fan, but I am a huge fan of peace. And he's making peace, so I applaud him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember just a few years ago, right-wing people were talking about "wanting Obama to fail" to show how right they were. And how the liberal media was decrying that at every turn, because if you want Obama to fail you want America to fail. And I agree. I don't want America to fail. Wanting America to fail so you can say "my side is right" is disgusting immoral behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the shoe is on the other foot. And I see an unbelievable portion of left-leaning media trying to undermine this peace process at every turn. For the same disgusting reasons: Because they don't want Trump to look good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that. These people would rather risk literal nuclear war, than have a guy they dislike do something genuinely good, just because it undermines their narratives. Imagine having priorities like that, where you would prefer to literally have the risk of nuclear war so long as it means your team isn't made to look silly on TV. Why have your ego is so emotionally addicted to a narrative that you try to game reality to keep the narrative intact, instead of just finding a new narrative? Social pressure?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tribalism. It gets the best of people and it has infected our polarized mainstream media culture. Tribalism overrides our emotions if we let it. These are weak people who cannot think for themselves outside the emotional validation provided to them by the group they have chosen to align themselves to (although in their minds they certainly believe "it's the only moral choice" so they don't see it as an option). This applies to both hardcore Republicans and hardcore Democrats. Two sides of the same coin of political tribalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people see this. Many don't. Is this the Achilles heel of human culture? Why are some Democrats and some left-leaning media outlets trying to undermine peace by focusing on the negative right after such a historic meeting?

       Perhaps a large part of it is a result of Trump and his attacks on Clinton and the Democratic party.

       It's a bit much to whine about this sort of behaviour now, when the guy in the Oval Office was reveling in it a couple of years ago.

       Yup. One is right-authoritarian and the other is left-authoritarian, and the anti-authoritarians have no representation, and a false appearance of consensus is created. It makes the centrist position look like an authoritarian position. The whole system is biased towards authoritarianism.

       Trump doesn't support legalization (he hired Jeff Sessions), he isn't against spying on Americans, doesn't want to reform the police state, etc. If he truly wants to be less hawkish than the average politician than I will tip my hat to him for that, but he is hardly the outside of the box people's champ that his supporters believe so blindly.

       Actually, Trump does support legalization at the Federal level. Sessions does, too. Both of them believe the intrastate drug trade should be handled entirely by the individual States.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, they also believe it is their job to execute and enforce the law as it currently stands. Get a legalization bill to Trump's desk and he will sign it.

       How the fuck is that 4D chess? That's a standard 10th amendment argument that Trump has made for years including before and after the campaign. Get the bill to his desk and watch what happens. That part isn't his job.

       Obviously some outlets and factions of the Dem establishment will always portray any Trump-related event in the negative. Not sure if this "undermines peace" however. Let's not forget how much shit was thrown at the Obama admin from the right for warming to Iran, Cuba, and even the suggestion of being soft on North Korea. Mentioning their authoritarianism provides context and nuance to a situation I'm sure most Trump diehards would like to portray as an utterly black and white "hero" moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO North Korea has been a huge but ultimately harmless boogeyman for decades now. Let's not pretend some powerful empire has just been brought to its knees.

       Sure it does. The media is repeatedly telling people "This won't work. This will fail." when this is the first time the leaders of these countries have met in 60 years!

      <p>
       But when Israel and Palestine sign a peace deal that will very likely fall apart the media is always "This time is different, this is a new leaf" when there's no real substantial changes.

       Any US president could have met with a NK leader. NK has always wanted to meet. It’s not impressive at all that trump met with him. It’s pathetic, actually, because the US has always demanded concrete concessions in order to meet with a NK leader. Trump threw that out the door, raised NK to a globally accepted power, all without getting a SINGLE CONCESSESSION.

       Here is the full text of that signed document:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        President Donald J Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong-un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a first, historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un conducted a comprehensive, in-depth, and sincere exchange of opinions on the issues related to the establishment of new US-DPRK relations and the building of a lasting and robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.
       </p>
       <p>
        President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong-un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
       </p>
       <p>
        Convinced that the establishment of new US-DPRK relations will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and of the world, and recognising that mutual confidence-building can promote the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un state the following:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new US-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.
        </li>
        <li>
         The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.
        </li>
        <li>
         Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
        </li>
        <li>
         The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Having acknowledged that the US-DPRK summit — the first in history — was an epochal event of great significance and overcoming decades of tensions and hostilities between the two countries and for the opening of a new future, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un commit to implement the stipulations in this joint statement fully and expeditiously.
       </p>
       <p>
        The United States and the DPRK commit to hold follow-on negotiations led by the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a relevant high-level DPRK official, at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes of the US-DPRK summit.
       </p>
       <p>
        President Donald J Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong-un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have committed to cooperate for the development of new US-DPRK relations and for the promotion of peace, prosperity, and security of the Korean Peninsula and of the world.

       But there’s no action taken yet. NK has lied, lied, lied in the past (and even agreed to more stringent concessions). Why do you think now is any different? Why is trump calling this murderous dictator “home table” without getting a single tangible concession from them outside of a non-binding quasi-verbal agreement?

       No they don't.

      <p>
       They still have nuclear weapons. Even if they end all testing and further development of nuclear warheads, they still have a non trivial amount of extremely destructive weapons. Not to mention this summit in no way addressed issues of missile development. So even if the DPRK never tries to make a *new nuclear warhead, they can still keep developing better ICBMs and then they can still threaten regional neighbors and the world with nuclear destruction.

       So do you think they won't try to build a new testing site? Do you think just because they don't have an active missile thruster testing site right now, their nuclear warheads and existing missiles pose no threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen I've never been of the opinion that the DPRK is a genuine threat to anyone but their immediate neighbors. We've known for years that their missiles have been ineffective if not outright failures. I've never been worried that a DPRK nuclear warhead will be launched from the DPRK and hit American territory. However, even though a lot of their saber rattling is bluster, they still have nuclear weapons, and can certainly lob those suckers at Seoul at the very least.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know that even before they had an effective delivery system for their nuclear weapons they never bowed before sanctions or international demands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is as simple as, they can't currently test new missile thrusters thus the threat is gone. This isn't an equation with two parts missile testing site + nuclear warheads = DPRK is Threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       This a multitude of equations, each with multiple factors and variables that interact with each other. Reducing one single variable down to zero doesn't mean the outcome of all the other connected systems also becomes 1 or is changed in a marginal fashion.

      <p>
       You did read, right? The operating clause here is "
       <strong>
        Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration
       </strong>
       . Reaffirming means "to state again as fact; assert strongly". So that line says "Stating again as fact the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration". That's not a concession. A bullet point that to remind everyone that the RoK and DPRK signed the 4/27/2018 Panmunjon Declaration is not in any way a concession.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you argue that the first half of the line doesn't denigrate the point from being a concession, the second half of that line "
       <strong>
        The DPRK commits to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula
       </strong>
       " doesn't mean anything in a substantial manner. That statement doesn't provide details on how the DRPK will work towards complete denuclearisation of the peninsula, nor what the DPRK would require to agree to denuclearizing itself. Based on the vagueness of that statement, if the DPRK were to publicly demand the USA to change it's name to the United States of Ass in return for the DPRK ending it's nuclear weapons program that absolutely counts as "working towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula."
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole summit is the equivalent of diplomatic vasectomy for the US. Yeah we stuck in there, thrusting and doing some work, but once we finished nothing came out. We (President Trump) may have had a good time, but no diplomacy baby batter was splattered on the DPRK's face that day, all while the US got a Pyongyang facial.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a potentially a concession, if and only if it is actually carried out. Notice that there are no details in how the recovery and repatriations of remains is disclosed. Committing to doing something doesn't guarantee it's going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I hope this point is carried out. I don't know how many American soldiers remains are still in the DPRK, but they should be brought home. Same goes for soldiers who fought for the DPRK. But at the same time this isn't a concession that i'd consider equal in value to what the US conceded to the DPRK. This point benefits both nations, not favoring one over the other since there is no real win here, just bringing peace to families and a proper burial for lives lost far from their respective homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand the hand the US gave an incredible amount of propaganda to the DPRK, unilaterally ending joint US-ROK military exercises (without informing the RoK), calling them war games, validating Kim Jung Un, who is a person that should not be praised on the international stage.

       So your point is that Iran deal was bad because of a deal made 25 years ago with a different country? If the goal is denuclearization, then the Iran deal (which Trump canceled) was better than this “deal” which doesn’t have any details regarding verification and compliance.
      </p>

       So why cancel one deal and then pat yourself on the back for at best a similar deal with a different country?

It literally says they can't develop nuclear weapons for 10 years, it doesn't address halting any missile research. It doesn't address improving enrichment techniques. The inspectors have to give several weeks notice before they can inspect a site. No US inspectors are allowed. They were given the right to appeal the request for inspections almost indefinitely. It would take months before anyone would actually arrive at the site to verify compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not to mention that they have already violated it numerous times and Obama did absolutely nothing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal in the Iran deal wasn't de-nuclearization. Sure, Obama said it was. But so did Clinton. And today, NK has nuclear weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confess. You don't really believe the bullshit you are saying, do you? You can't possibly be that ignorant.

       Everyone hopes this works out.  But at some point you have to have more than hope and look at prior acts. Why would NK be compelled to keep their word when Trump proved to the world that the US doesn’t have to.  He could cancel deals with anyone at any time so why would countries negotiate in good faith anymore?

       You know why you don’t know what to think yet?  Because Trump is trumpeting this as NK being denuclearized already while the deal is completely devoid of substance and detail.  How can you think anything other than hope that this vague agreement is going to suddenly make NK an ally with Trump Hotels on the beach?

        Same reason the denuclearization is a valid concession. Of course it's invalid if they don't do it. But then Trump won't lift the sanctions, and NK wants the sanctions lifted.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's a lot here that is based on your ideas of how it should work. The DPRK wants the sanctions lifted true, but they've wanted them lifted for a very long time. Regardless of whatever talks or meeting were held, in the end they still choose their own nuclear program over cooperation for removal of sanctions. Just because you think DPRK wants sanctions removed, it doesn't mean the DPRK will follow thru on appropriate actions to get those sanctions removed. The threat of maintaining current sanctions is not something that has ever moved them towards cooperation in the past. No matter what the DPRK wants the sanctions lifted, and historically we have seen that as badly as they want them lifted, they have never agreed to act in a manner agreed upon by the mediating groups that would merit those sanction removals.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       That's not a concession reached in this Singapore Summit though. As I made clear, the text of the Singapore Summit document clearly states that Kim Jong Un is committed to denuclearisation based on the Panmunjon declaration. So semantically, Kim Jong Un didn't concede to Trump on denuclearisation, instead they both agreed that Kim will uphold his commitment to denuclearisation that was established in the Panmunjon declaration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because we want the DPRK to denuclearize, and they say "hey me and my neighbor agreed to work on denuclearising my country" and then Trump meets him later and says "Hey I hope you stick with that plan of denuclearizing" and Kim says "Yeah I stand by the deal I made with my neighbor" that doesn't count as a concession Trump won here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So strike that from your record books as a concession Trump won. He made no actual headway on the the denuclearisation of DPRK. Equally this isn't the first time the Kim regime has publicly said they are committed towards working towards denuclearisation. If Trump had gotten Kim to sign a deal that said he would allow transparent inspections by the IAEA and relevant bodies from the RoK and USA, I would absolutely chock that up as not only a concession, but a great one. Unfortunately he got empty words that literally translates to "Stating again as fact the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula."
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting a soundbyte  backed by no real actions or controls is not a concession in my book. Especially when its a recycled soundbyte.

       This is bogus theory and historically doesn't hold water. There have been multiple multi-party conferences involving the DPRK and the US to hash out ways to end nuclear arms proliferation the Korean Peninsula. With incentives like economic opportunities, wider acceptance in the international community, massive humanitarian relief efforts and with threats of crushing economic sanctions, every single time the DPRK will at best agree to it and then immediately renege.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DPRK isn't concerned with losing face. They are a pariah in the eyes of the world. The DPRK can't lost face, because they have no good will to being with. Do you really think Kim cares if the Trump no longer has a crush on him? Who can he lose face to that matters to him? He's already sanctioned by the majority of the world, his own people are living in a constant state of humanitarian crisis without access to free, unrestricted information, and he isn't held accountable to his people anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       So tell me who Kim is terrified of losing face to? Cause it's not the US or Trump, given that Kim was the one who coined the rather clever "Donald the Dotard" nickname.

       You understand the man rules his nation as a total dictator and that the state promotes a borderline religious cult like teachings about him and his predecessors. Now he can show his suffering, indoctrinated people that he made the great enemy of DPRK end "War games" without giving anything in return. Now he can say that the enemy of the USA see's him not just as an equal, but as a superior based on all of the video and audio clips of Trump gushing over him.

       So you’re saying it doesn’t matter if we have agreements and promises made, that they’ll just back out anyway? But also that nothing was accomplished here because we didn’t get anything promised...

       There’s no way to paint this move as a negative unless you’re an ideologue driven by animus. What we’re moving towards is better than where we’ve been. If it doesn’t work out, at least we tried. Trump is taking a unique approach and we’ll see if it works. NK is much more desperate than they were in the past and they don’t have China helping them like they did. We can start war games back up tomorrow and make little Kimmy look like an ass to his own people, if he’s bragging about that.

      <p>
       I never painted the entirety of this move as a net negative. This was a success to be sure, given Trump's dangerous approach to diplomacy and his past history of starting a twitter beef with Kim Jong Un. A dialogue is open, neither side is threatening to annihilate the other, or regional neighbors. Given Trump's lack of self control, incredibly thin skin, and bombastic personality, its great that he didn't exacerbate tensions and actually deescalated them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just because the dialogue took a good turn in the right direction, doesn't mean the event was a roaring success or even a good thing. The US gave far too much ground for not a single tangible thing in return, while also giving legitimacy to a man who should never be given it.

      <p>
       Your understanding of the realities of international politics, diplomacy and diplomatic norms is undeveloped. Nothing exists in a vacuum. The DPRK has always been desperate. They have endured far worse than their current situation right now and they refused to move an inch when it came to actions on disarmament. They kept up their bullshit through worse famines and disasters before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there is not upside to making Kimmy look like an ass. He is a total dictator. An absolute autocrat who leads an extremely repressive regime that has somewhere in the ballpark of 100,000 of his own citizens in concentration camps for being dissidents and "political enemies". This is the guy who had his half brother publicly assassinated in a foreign nation. He's the same guy that threatens the world with first strike nuclear doctrine and tries to hold the world ransom because he has nuclear warheads within realistic targeting distance of Seoul. Regardless of how unreliable and shit their missiles are, they can absolutely get a warhead onto Seoul and the devastation of that would be utterly horrendous. If you think making "kimmy" look like an ass, then you clearly haven't been paying attention. I don't think anyone is rooting for the dude barring assholes like Omar Al-Bashir, and Bashar Al Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also do you think his people will ever be allowed to learn in real time, or in a reasonable context about the realities of events. Information is not a free substance in the DPRK. The video of Trump shaking his hand and all the cockgobbling praises Trump laid upon him is enough material for all the propaganda he will ever need. Whatever you side of the political spectrum you lean, if you think western media portrays events and facts differnently based on political leaning just imagine what information is like in the DPRK, a country where the state controls it. Did you know it's illegal to have pictures of Kim Jong Un, Kim Il Sung, or Kim Jong Il that show anything waist down? I'm not kidding. If they police property like that, do you think any news outlets in the DPRK will report on anything that reflects negatively on the supreme leader?

       Who the fuck are you even talking about? No one wants Trump to fail, but it's SO dumb to give him credit for anything yet. How many times has NK lied to every administration? They have done pretty much nothing so far, besides doing a big photo op and giving us their word.

       "“I think I'm very well-prepared. I don’t think I have to prepare very much. It's about attitude, it's about willingness to get things done."
      </p>
      <p>
       And nowhere in that document provides any means of verification, inspections, it literally means nothing. It's symbolic, which is fine, but acting like NK has already been dealt with in, in any quantifiable measure, is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do republicans hate the Iran deal, a deal that was verified that they were holding to for YEARS, so much that they tore it up? Do they want Iran to have nuclear weapons? Do they want war in Iran?

       He explicitly stated "I don't think I have to prepare very much." If you're okay with your leader going to talk to a dictator that brutally oppresses his own people, and has threatened us and our allies with nuclear destruction for years now saying that he doesn't have to prepare much, I don't know what to tell you. You're a lost cause.

       This isn't completely true. The text of the document they signed only reaffirmed the agreement that was already made in April between North and South Korea. I think this is where most of the criticism is coming from, because it was basically an agreement to keep agreeing. There was more significance in the meeting itself than the document that was signed. Republicans are going to chalk this up as a major victory, which it's really not, and Democrats are going to chalk this up as a major failure, which it also is not.

       Do you have a source on that? I watched the press conference he gave in singapore and it sounded like some of the concessions were new, including the returning of US veteran remains (which wasn't in the document, but was verbally agreed on at the end of the meeting).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying "this is a huge victory and we have world peace now", but I am saying this meeting is something no US president has been able to accomplish for whatever reason.

       Yes instead of literally years of detailed negotiation it was 24hrs. It was 24hrs because what was agreed upon were empty non binding promises that so far are of no value. But Trump literally already claimed the threat to be over!
      </p>
      <p>
       He got played. Kim, a ruthless dictator of a shithole country, gets to be equals to the United States. Kim gets Trump to use his language when Trump refers to military exercises as war games. Trump cancels said exercises without informing south korea, weakening their confidence in us. And then to top it off Trump being the super genius he is didn't include any aides in the meeting. So Kim can claim Trump said whatever he wants and then it's a game of he said she said. And since Trump has zero credibility because he lies constantly...

       Is the cancellation of the Iran deal by Trump a step towards peace as well?   Is the increased tariffs on our allies that Trump said was necessary due to national security a step towards peace?

       too many things to consider here, way too risky to let it be left up to home. relationships with china, south korea,  russia and iran are on the table and we could fuck those up leading to a lot of bad outcomes. not to mention, shouldn't you bad at the iran situation if hope is your guiding motivation? at least that scenario had been worked at for years and had international support.

       We'll see what happens over there. I dont really understand how Trump went from talking mad shit to the guy to suddenly being friends. Seems super odd to me the course of events. But I dont think most Democrats are against the talks or pro war now. Trump tore up the deal with Iran and his supporters loved that. That's another foreign adversary that we made a peace deal with. So are Republicans pro war because of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The nature of politics is some people will hate the guy in charge no matter what he does. I wouldn't say that means Democrats are some how pro war and Republicans are the party of peace. Trump also hired Bolton and bombed Syria a couple times. So I guess we'll see what happens in North Korea.

       This is a good question. I think the answer is that NK's nuclear program collapsed in a way that it was clear the US knew about, so NK now has no option but to modernize, so they chose to do it gracefully. Plus the Dennis Rodman connection, he helped set this up. And Obama wouldn't meet with him, but Trump did, and it basically led to these meetings. At least that's what Rodman said on CNN.
      </p>

       The Iran deal is different from this. This is unprecedented. The Iran deal was attempt #3602, and the US has been trying to get back control of Iran since they lost it in 1979, after installing the Shah in 1953

       By collapse you mean it literally collapsed right. The mountain it was under "mysteriously" imploded. After that Kim was friendlier than a house cat.

       Yes, it literally imploded and was destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the NKs actually fucked it up and destroyed it themselves. If the US had blown it up as your quotes seem to imply, I doubt they would be coming to the negotiating table with such a friendly tone.

       If NK wasn't a CIA backed front for geopolitical control/funding then that would make sense. Everything about NK and their military capabilities was fiction my friend. Thats why they came to the table, we simply stopped funding the movie.

       I’m honestly ignorant outside of American politics (and honestly fairly ignorant within. It just seems clear it’s a joke to me) Kim could be a real deal being courted into the big charade, an actor from the start (if north Korea’s media is entirely controlled it could then be controlled on high) or if he really is just a wild card. It’d be extremely interesting to get a real history of the Koreas since the split.

       I personally recalled the majority Democrat Senate voted for war in Iraq. I also recall the interview between Tucker Carlson when he worked at MSNBC with Maxine Waters and she couldn't answer the simple question if Democrats would vote against war in Iraq.

        /r/Conspiracy

       there been posts in the past that have proven how edited and how much history has been rewritten on Wikipedia and it isn't a reliable source. Like how Nazism is a supposed "right-wing" ideology, even though Adolf Hitler supported every left-wing policy?

       It is these kind of blatant lies that show the right is never willing to discuss things in good faith, it is always lies and rewriting of history, and people too lazy to do their own research will believe it . Lets look at the facts for a moment, When we look at the joint resolution for military action against iraq in the house of representatives,  215  republicans voted for it and only 6 voted against it, in contrast to only 82 democrats voting for it and 126 voting against.  In the Senate 48 republicans voted for and only 1 voted against. On the other side 29 democrats voted for 21 voted against.
      </p>
      <p>
       How you can even pretend that is was the democrats you played the bigger role here is hysterical to say the least, when we look at the actual facts it was the repubicans who dragged their knuckles and took the us to invade.

       Telling lies would be considered hiding the truth, you claimed it was the democrats who controlled the house and senate when it was the republicans. You claimed the democrats voted for the war when facts tell us it was the republicans who voted in the majority for it. Sorry you rely on ignorance but history is there for all to see,  it must be tiring having to constantly lie and deceive  to make a point but i guess you make it easier for everyone to see what the right have resorted to .

       Nothing will change, we are not truly free. We  are held hostage by a 2 party system, where money buys influence and influence gets you more money. That's not a democracy. That's how elite and powerful gain and maintain power through political dynasties (Looking at you Bushs, Clintons, and so on...) That's why nothing changes. We are never going to advance until we can pick someone who represents us, as a people, instead of private interests and greed.

       There is no need for a family to be in power that long (not that it affects me, but, looking at you England) unless they're in power based on the merits of their ideas and character.

       Iran buys military equipment in the 70s and never receives it. We reach a nuclear “deal” and decide to give it back. Then it comes out that a good deal of that money was traced straight into the hands of Iranian backed terrorist groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they were only entitled to 1.7 billion dollars. They were
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       entitled to access to over 100 billion dollars like they received with Obama’s “Iran Deal”.

       It’d take a special kind of person, someone that thinks Politifact and Snopes are “legitimate sources”, to get to that kind of conclusion. Being misinformed doesn’t only make

       The WaPo article was about North Korea and the Fortune article was about something unrelated to my original point so there wasn’t much of a reason to reference them. I don’t have any problems with Fortune but WaPo prints bullshit on a daily basis. If you feel comfortable using them as a source that’s on you, not me.

       It absolutely did
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       . It didn’t “denuclearize” the country. It just said they’d agree to do things a certain way and limit their enriched uranium stockpiles for 15 years and only have one facility that enriches uranium.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On 22 July 2015, Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister who led the negotiations, made an announcement on state-controlled television that the recently reached nuclear deal with the world powers did not include limitations on Iran’s weapons capabilities or missile power and that Tehran would keep arming its regional allies. "We have told them [the P5+1 world powers] in the negotiations that we will supply arms to anyone and anywhere necessary and will import weapons from anywhere we want and we have clarified this during the negotiations," Araghchi said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then the following week Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came out and said "Our policy will not change with regards to the arrogant US government.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, it didn’t cut them off from nuclear capabilities. I have no fucking idea where anyone got that idea from.

       But it didn't just limit their stockpiles of enriched uranium, it limited how enriched the uranoim could be, and it was a level significantly below the level necessary for a weapon.  So if Iran stuck to the deal, they would not be capable of producing nuclear weapons.  It didn't denuclearize the country, but it cut off their ability to produce a nuclear weapon.

       Who is going to regularly go there and check the enrichment levels? Russia, that was one of the countries in on the deal certainly won’t be doing it. And the fact that the deal limited them to too few centrifuges for a power program (what they were supposed to be able to have) but enough for weapons is also strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you’ve reached the level allowed in the deal you’re already 2/3 of the way to having 90% enriched that you’d need for a conventional nuclear weapon and with the reduced stockpiles they’d have enough for at least a dozen nuclear weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when the countries top leaders come out after the negotiations and say “Fuck that, we’re gonna do what we want with whoever we want and we will buy and sell weapons from anywhere we please.” it’s probably not a good sign.

       So let me get this straight:  the deal, as written and agreed to, cut off Irans ability to produce a nuclear weapon, correct?

       Was Iran not abiding by the deal?

       On top of that, North Korea is to get 10 billion over 10 years. The 10 for 10 starter pack. Israel gets 100 billion over 10 years. Egypt gets 12 bil if they keep Palestine locked down and not help them lol. Pakistan gets 32 bil. I think US aid is like 1.5 tril over the next 8 years.

       Only $1.7 billion was Iran’s money, and most of it went to Iranian backed terrorist groups immediately after we returned it. But that’s not what I’m talking about. I wouldn’t of said “billions of dollars” if I was talking about less than 2.

       It was about going around Israel's control since the 70's... It was about bringing a new way of working to bring the Shia muslim world into the conversation instead of being a target bc Jews Christians Sunni hate them. I have studied JCPOA a good bit and know that it was about changing culture to allow the educated progressives have power instead of the hardliners. That's why Saudi Israel want the hardliners to vindicate their aggression.

       So look outside the two parties and ignore the US media.  You can better understand the merits of the two deals by seeing how nearby countries that are going to be affected by the diplomacy react.  They are far less concerned about US' internal political gamesmanship, and directly impacted by the diplomacy.
      </p>

       Read the South Korean Prime Minister's
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/zql2tr0owr311.jpg">
        statement
       </a>
       regarding Trump's diplomacy.  He's very, very happy.  He thinks that it's wonderful, and will stabilize the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrast that to how Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt, and the other Gulf States reacted to the Iran deal.  They opposed it, thought that it would not improve regional stability (with SA even stating that they would start their own nuke program), and celebrated Trump's withdrawal.

       The Korea's are different because they have a common base where as the muslim world is split by Shia sunni and then the Jews and christians hate them too. So the korea deal unifies people who could be unified where as the Iran deal JCPOA gave a way for the Shia to have a voice against everyone who wants them to submit.

       I remember when Democrats were called unamerican, unpatriotic, terrorist sympathizing, Neville Chaimberlains for even being moderately pro-war.  I remember when Max Cleeland, who left three limbs in Vietnam, was labeled as soft on American defense, for having a few problems with the creation of the Homeland Security Department and defeated.

       This is about platforms  where Raytheaon and Lockheed Martin can parade their think thank hacks and politicians pushing a profitable line.  Because their stocks are highly reactive to changes in foreign policy.  We have a war economy, and any overture towards peace sends defense contractors down.

        The U.S.’s five largest defense contractors shed about $10.2 billion in value on Friday alone.

       I got into anti-war activism during the first Gulf War by accident. I was trying to pick up a girl and wound up getting interested in this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern liberals aren't anti-war because they don't see it. Due to media concentration over the last 30 years, the military/corporate media has colluded to censor war footage while using propaganda to make war seem justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the 60s, the antiwar left was created due to the Draft and the fact that the US had true Freedom of the Press. Reporters filmed uncensored footage of horrible war crimes and got pissed and it created a lot of activism against the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       They learned their lesson. After Vietnam, they used military 'journalists' but got forced to stop and include embedded journalists who could be censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US government let the giant media companies form an oligopoly. In return, they push pro war, pro military propaganda. Since there is no more free market press industry, everything gets swept under the rug.

       The first link shows true journalism. Back when it was actually mostly free.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second link is gulf war propaganda. Due to the new tactic of using embedded journalists, western media was mostly censored. That clip of the girl testifying about the baby incubators was complete fiction. The US military couldn't stop the foreign press from reporting and when the

       incident happened, they had no choice but to admit fault. That last link, check out the interview with the reporter at 1:55.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the Syrian kid, his photo got put on tv and in newspapers and it was all fake. Due to the reach of all these companies, their influence is everywhere.

      <p>
       It's easy. Use a newswire service like AP or Reuters, sell the stories to hundreds of different owned outlets, away you go.

       I've been openly anti-Trump in the past, like when he appointed 3 goldman sachs members to his cabinet. Or when he dropped the MOAB or the 52 tomahawk missiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have to give credit where credit is due. This is a big deal, and a positive move for the world.

       It's fine to criticize Trump when criticism is due. But standing on the principle that everything he does is automatically bad is a silly proposition. Look at how the democrats have been fighting the tax cuts for example (yes, I get it they're good for business, but they also are good for everyone else, by design. It makes no sense to fight the gains for normal people as well).

       Dude's literally spamming republican propaganda on NK  in multiple subs while doing the "I'm not partisan, both parties are the same!" thing... which is also rightwing propaganda literally as old as the concept of the left-right political dichotomy.

       Nothing pisses me off more than when people buy into this false equivalence that the right and the left are the same. Only one party believes climate change is real, that trickle down economics is bullshit, in centralized healthcare, not alienating our trading partners and allies, isn't openly supporting a corrupt (Russian) administration...

       I don’t disagree that I wish the left did more. HOWEVER, when was the last time democrats passed 1.5 trillion in tax cuts that went disproportionately to the rich and was funded by deficit spending? When did they defund and dismantle the EPA? When did they axe net neutrality? When did they let Russia mess with our elections? These are all things from the past year, off the top of my head. They are not the same. Democrats have issues, no one can deny that. But they’re certainly the lesser of two evils, if you want to look at it that way.

       There are some of those decisions I do not agree with, but I'm not american so domestic things matter a lot less to me. In foreign affairs, the part that does matter to me, it makes zero difference whether republicans or democrats are in power. Bush senior gave us the iraq war part 1, Clinton bombed in former yugoslavia, Bush invaded Iraq and Afghanistan and Obama blasted Libya fifty years back in development, and extended the Syrian civil war by careless funding of rebels. And every fucking time us europeans get to deal with the fallout.

       Internally, I see you are simply parrotting the DNC talking points. May I ask you how much your net income was prior to the tax cuts and how much it is now? And how much federal taxes you paid in both schemes?

       Health insurance was not part of the tax deal. I don't want to root around too much in your private life, but it does prove the point that the tax cuts were tax cuts across the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got the notion that you were simply repeating what democrat politicians are saying about the issues you listed. You didn't show how net neutrality affected you, you didn't list that you actually benefitted from the tax cuts, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to EPA I agree with you that the Trump administration took some rash decisions that potentially hurt the rest of the world as well. But I don't agree with you because of what opposition politicians said about it, I agree because I read enough literature on the subject, which is exactly why I disagree with all these other talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, I hope you do get universal healthcare at some point. We have it and it's really the best way of solving those issues (even though I do realize that ours is affordable because yours is more expensive, so if you do get it, it will become more expensive for us).

       Yup the tax cuts were across the board; I got $25 while corporations got billions. What a deal, right?? And I can't wait to see my taxes at the end of the year, because according to my tax professors, my gains are probably going right out the window (I'm a 2nd year MBA student with a 4.0, by the way. Want to ask me about that too?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Net neutrality hasn't negatively affected me yet, because it was just enacted yesterday. I'll gladly admit I was wrong if my internet prices go down while my speed goes up (LOL).
      </p>
      <p>
       You read literature on American tax code? Then surely you understand the allocation of these cuts disproportionately went to the super wealthy / corporations. If you came to any other conclusion then I am sorry you wasted your time if you weren't going to comprehend what you were reading.

       As I said, you have to correct for what you paid in the first place. If they'd give you billion dollar tax cut the government would actually owe you money.

       There is a single issue with the tax cuts that is pro-corporations, but the amount that is paid less is not it.

       I am American and I agree with you, it does not matter whether a “Democrat” or “Republican” is in office. Domestic affairs are the main focus of most elections - they get people worked up and focused on emotional issues like abortion and lgbt rights and immigration just to keep people distracted. The agenda remains the same in regards to foreign policy because it’s all tied to the military industrial complex. Unfortunately, our government doesn’t represent us - it just works for the war machine. It’s essentially fascism but “they” have 99.9 percent of people here under the illusion that we are free, and that we are the best and most moral country on the planet. I take a step back and look at the globe and see that it is not that way. Anyone who believes that Trump is not working for the same people who allowed him to come to power is a fool - as they all need to be approved by “them” before election results are manufactured. It’s all a sad state of affairs and I apologize for the pain and suffering the United States government and its intelligence agencies have caused to the the world and just wanted to say they don’t represent me or most of us.

       Trump was literally the one war mongering with NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       NK does this about once a decade.  They make threats and then agrees to stop a missile program in exchange for aide, or some similar arrangement. Then they renege. The only difference this time is that our own fucking president was been egging NK on, and making the situation more tense and hostile.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is nothing new. Trump is giving away more and getting less than past presidents got NK to agree to. Trump is betraying an ally for nothing concrete in return to calm down a conflict that
       <em>
        he personally
       </em>
       ramped up. All while trying to promote his business and giving away state secrets on how we know about their missile programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This bullshit about him getting NK to come to the table and doing what other presidents could not is literally republican propaganda. The republicans in power are well aware of the US's history of agreements and negotiations with NK. They are relying on you not knowing and just believing what they say.

       I've wondered that myself. I would guess the answer is because his advisers and cabinet work for the military-industrial complex and they're benefiting too much from the tension and war atmosphere created by the bad relationship with NK.

       He's shit at making deals. He gave them a free pass without any concrete deal on their part. That is why we avoid NK. Even SK didn't know about the end of war games and exercise until NK media announced it.

       There are no detailed parts to this deal. During the Iran deal they had agreed to have video surveillance of the whole shebang. Inspectors to supervise it. Etc. This is just trusting them to do what we say with no necessary restrictions. If it doubtful ly works than props to him. But it's been the same bull from NK for YEARS.

       Funny how inspectors had to give Iran weeks notice before they even were allowed to inspect and its crazy how Iran was able to keep its ballistic missile program and continue to enrich Uranium at a lower level, and in 8 years from now Iran can build a nucleur weapon, but not they are richer since the US lifted sanctions. But other than that the Iran deal was a great deal.

       The detailed part is no more war games. Giant waste of money. Violent domination is counter prosperity in any sustainable context. War and domination is a waste. If nk wants nukes GO AHEAD. What's the alternative nuke them? Murdering millions through starvation? Make friends with the guy and maybe something more productive can happen. Everyone is so brilliant when it comes to war and tough guy bs. North Korea suffers terribly because of sanctions and the actual implementation of a threat of total annihilation. Go read the history. Another victim of us violent domination.. only they haven't been utterly destroyed like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Nicaragua etc.

       Every administration has sought to negotiate with NK, and sent envoys to discuss ending missile programs and denuclearization. Just because the president didn't meet one-on-one doesn't mean they simply continued the status quo.  They used to be a part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. They violated it. Clinton got them to agree to inspections, but that deal was cancelled by Bush who said they had violated the agreement and he would negotiate a better one. He failed. Obama also sought to reach an agreement with NK, and the right flipped the fuck out when he considered meeting on-on-one (there's a fun video of Fox News then and now if you care to look for it). Obama got NK to "commit to denuclearization" as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea is a communist regime lead by a brutal dictator who tortures his own people, slaughters entire families if one person flees, kills Christians, forces abortions on women, and starves his country so he can build military toys. They recently tortured one of our citizens for allegedly stealing a poster, he was sent back blind, deaf, with severe brain damage, and died shortly after his return. They constantly threaten our allies, and us, and have spread propaganda in their country that becoming a nuclear power will force the world to treat them as equal. Trump literally confirmed NK's propaganda, which is what past presidents sought to avoid when they refused to meet one-on-one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is praising Kim, treating him as an equal, is not even bringing up human rights abuses, is offering to pull out of SK, and has received nothing from NK except for vague promises to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and a bunch of (often conflicting) promises they both claim were made but not put in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump hasn't even gotten as far as previous presidents, and has offered more in return for less.

       Other presidents did not want to meet with NK leaders because that legitimizes them.
      </p>
      <p>
       think about how NK sees the meeting: before NK did big missile tests, and nuke tests, no one met us.
      </p>
      <p>
       After several missile tests and nuke tests: The POTUS is now willing to meet with us, and legitimize us as country!
      </p>
      <p>
       this is why clinton, bush and Obama never met with NK. Legitimizing the dictatorship will only increase support for said dictatorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       NK is going to hold on to nukes as long as they can especially considering how Libya turned out.

       I think you're underplaying the gravity of this moment.

      <p>
       From Foreign Policy:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No sitting U.S. president has met a North Korean leader.
       </p>

       That's pretty huge.

      <p>
       What is he giving away? If we want NK to stop testing, we need to offer Kim safe passage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. Can he fuck this up? Probably, I am surprised he is sucking Israel's dick so hard, that he would actually break a treaty before trying to agree one. But who knows. He's probably the right guy to do this, he's not smart enough to overthink it. Too much diplomatic cock teasing imo.

       How about a little more nuance. You can't deny a lot of tribalistic Dems will becry Trump or Bush for any military actions they take and call out their warmongering but will give Obama a free pass for stuff like Libya and Syria. It's called cognitive dissonance and members of both "teams" do it.

       Obama neutralised the anti-war movement almost overnight. But it was the ultimate bait and switch. He ended the war in Iraq .. but then moved all those troops into Afghanistan for a massive surge that was supposed to end the war there.

       Agreed. In to Afghanistan where 90% of the worlds poppy is grown, and it's turned in to the opium the companies like Pfizer use to make all their drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the picture of the US soldier guarding the poppy fields? Ever seen the graph of poppy production over the years and how increased growth aligns with US invasion?

       Honestly they've cried wolf so many times, it's hard to even listen to them anymore. Trump Derangement Syndrome is real... some people just can't even think logically, they just go in to emotional overload the second they hear the name Trump.

       I think it's a serious problem and actually limits real discourse that desperately needs to be happening.

       ups / (ups + downs) = .54
      </p>
      <p>
       ups - downs = 32
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       rearrange: ups = 32 + downs
      </p>
      <p>
       substitute in to first equation: (32 + downs) / (32 + downs + downs) = 0.54

      <p>

        Why are some Democrats and some left-leaning media outlets trying to undermine peace by focusing on the negative right after such a historic meeting?

       This is really telling. Just because the outcome of this meeting was positive (further deescalation of tensions, and vague unenforceable promises of working towards denuclearisation) does not mean the meeting is beyond reproach.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is wrong with criticizing real disappointments or failings that occurred in the summit. Why does the event need to beyond criticism. At that point it sounds like you're saying people are wrong for not being satisfied with whatever the government gives us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it seems deeply disingenuous to dismiss any and all criticism of something because it has to be tribalism. I'm sure some of the criticism is just that, no doubt about it. Lots of people don't have the interest, political literacy or time to fully investigate the nuances of complex topics and are happy to agree to whatever they are told. But to discount all criticism as a product of tribalism is pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you continue to be incapable of seeing any and all criticism as coming from nowhere but tribalism, maybe you need to reconsider who's the one acting under tribalism.

       " Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge, which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible."

        Another example of the moral bankruptcy of liberalism. They are actually making arguments as to why ending military exercises in Korea, a country the U.S. colonized, is a bad thing. And you wonder why I call the democrats a war party.

       Yeah I think that's the exact reason a lot of people chose Trump over Hillary... we had 2 bad options, it was lose/lose, by design.

       Sounds like Trump propoganda. While Trump was egging on nuclear war with NK for months on Twitter, SK was working at making deals with NK. NK nuclear silos were blown up before a meeting with NK was ever set. That's number 1. Number 2 is quite simple.. Trump hasn't done anything. NK has the absolute upper hand in this. Trump had no preconditions. Trump had no plan going into the meeting. Nothing happened as a result of this meeting. Not one thing. Well, except a propoganda video to NK. Want to talk about peace? How about the literal destruction of our closest allies? How about the isolation of the country. This is the thing: NK has been threatening us for 70 years. The one time we thought we had it under control, they lied! I would give this about 6 months to a year before writing another Trump campaign ad on here.

       He explicitly stated "I don't think I have to prepare very much." If you're okay with your leader going to talk to a dictator that brutally oppresses his own people, and has threatened us and our allies with nuclear destruction for years now saying that he doesn't have to prepare much, I don't know what to tell you. You're a lost cause.

       All things will remain the same. Even representatives only speak for a portion of their districts. Not all people in all areas think or vote the same. The two party system is flawed through and through. That's what I was getting at.
