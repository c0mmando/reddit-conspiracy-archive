        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Currently, I am a student studying genetics. This has spurned me to think on the course of human evolution for the next several millenia (if we survive that long). It seems to me that the interesting similarity between greys and humans could be more than a coincidence. I postulate that the greys are in fact a future hominid lineage, that diverged from the original Homo Sapiens some time in the future. If so, then what caused such a genetic shift in appearance? I believe some evidence can be found in our world today.
    A token signature of the grey is their, well, grey skin. An incredibly unnatural skin tone, but not unheard of. We can actually see greyish skin in miners who spend unnaturally long times underground. ( <a href="http://kuow.org/post/underground-cities-and-ghost-miners-what-some-people-do-gold">http://kuow.org/post/underground-cities-and-ghost-miners-what-some-people-do-gold</a> )  It seems that this can hint to Greys being a species that evolved around the absence of light, whether this is due to underground living conditions or incredibly long times in space is up to debate. This means, that generations spent without light has spurned a genetic melanin deficiency to evolve over time. This absence of light can explain their large sized eyes too, which would evolve in size to accommodate for the small amounts of light they receive. In fact, I am willing to bet that the eyes of the grey aren&#39;t black, but could be masked by a blackish contact lense to dilute the amount of light perceived by the eye. All in all the greys seem to show evolutionary traits of a species adapted to a life without sunlight. Their weak frames and lack of reproductive organs could indicate a inbred overall genetic pool that lacks genetic variation. This then brings me to my next point: What are they doing here?
    Most UFO abduction cases center around experimentation of the victim, of those, a majority focus on reproductive experimentation. To me, it seems that they are preoccupied with recording, observing and utilizing various instances of our DNA. Now, if this was an alien species, our genetic makeup would be near useless to them. Its information would only provide our hereditary lineage, which wouldn&#39;t warrant the countless abduction cases; but if we take into account the possibility of the grey being our future relative, we can see that their preoccupation with reproductive studies garners a more serious role. I believe that greys are attempting to restore their own genetic health, utilizing some of our genes to restore the genetic alleles they have lost over the course of their evolution. </p>

<p>This is my explanation but I am curious to hear what you guys have to say?</p>

<p>TLDR, Grey are our distant relatives that acquired malignant genes and are here to restore genetic variation of their species.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> This is my personal opinion based on abduction accounts and observations, I make a lot of assumptions here; but such is the nature of this topic since we possess very little substantial information on this phenomenon.</p>

The more we could observe, the more detailed our conclusions became.

    <div class="md"><p>Your opinion has already been explored. The fact that you came to this conclusion by yourself shows you have an open mind and the ability of entertaining thought you don&#39;t necessarily believe in - a rare and refreshing sight these days.</p>

<p>Regarding this hypothesis, it is not necessary for our two species to be related in any way, for greys to seek genetic knowledge about us. They may be doing to us what we do to what we ethically consider lesser lifeforms.</p>

<p>Most litterature you find take for granted that we are the greys distant cousins, and they were enslaved by a superior race (reptilians in most hypothesis) by depraving them of their ability to reproduce. So greys, wether they are still enslaved or not, are seeking alternative ways to replenish their genetic fitness, such as abducting their cousins.</p>

<p>An alternative hypothesis is the one you came with; greys are the future humans, with a gouged genetic pool. They come from the future for the same reasons. This hypothesis is less popular because you have to consider time travel as factual to believe in it.</p>

<p>If you are interested in further readings, you may want to learn about abductees, who seem to share some genetic variants like the Rh- antigen on their red blood cells.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the last point you made, can you provide links to abductees sharing rh- blood? Also, if true, perhaps a genetic rh incompatability can explain the inability of a grey to reproduce, but then why would they be interested in rh negative blood? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I unfortunately cannot provide a source. I base this knowledge on information i found years ago. I do not garantee in any way that it is true nor proven. But let me a few moments of searching and i may dig up something - i will answer this very post should i find anything.</p>

<p>In my honest opinion, there is no link between Rh- blood and the ability to reproduce. I think the implications are about genetic compatibility. Rumours whisper that Rh- people are descendants of a superior, alien race, which could be the missing link between greys and humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in medical circles an Rh incompatibility between the mother and the fetus will cause the mother to produce antibodies and ultimately attack the fetus.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the study link, ill read it to gauge its veritability. As for the assumption, I merely mention the incompatability as a phenomenon that occurs in human reproduction when there is a parent with a rh + allele and a parent with an rh- allele. I assume if a species is advanced enough to attempt a cross species hybrid, they would be advanced enough to ensure rh compatability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given a Rh- alien parent and a Rh+ human parent, your premise leads to complications for the foetus, assuming we translate human biology to greys (which is fallacious but necessary to comprehend the motivations in seeking Rh- abductees).</p>

<p>Have you considered politics on a galactic scale? Maybe the greys aren&#39;t <em>allowed</em> to genetically modify their own foetus in a lab, despite having the technology for it. This is mere speculation, but it does fix logical inconsistencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t translate human biology to greys, I merely point out the similairty between us and hypothesize that perhaps we are distantly related. Kind of how we cant interbreed with Chimps, even though they are our distantly related cousins. In the wild if two related species interbreed, their ofspring (if born at all) is sterile. Perhaps there is a gentic mutation in the rh factor that creates an incompatibility, and perhaps the rh - negative gene could be reverse engineered to benefit their reproductive cycle. As for politics, that seems to infer a whole slew of possibilities and might comlicate the topic at hand. On a last note, a human/alien hybrid would have to be completely geneticly restructured in order to exist, a no easy feat if I may add.</p>

<p>I think they are &quot;future&quot; humans and that they are suffering from a variety of neurological diseases which they have no cure for. 
But that isn&#39;t mutually exclusive from just a shell of a body, in a way a clone allows for self propagation over long long time periods but you get stuck with no variety to evolve with, and all diseases that you have then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that it&#39;s more probable that the greys are somehow marooned here and under duress of some kind (stressful planetary conditions for them), but in possession of powerful technology they might want to trade (anti-grav, free energy), and a desire to keep us from blowing ourselves up (hence silo sightings). </p>

<p>They have not started inter-sentient warfare as far as we can tell (excepting the tunnel battles) but it is quite possible the planetary authorities, such as they are, have already effectively capitulated in return for a continuance. They seem to want the planetary occupants (us) to reduce the human footprint on the global ecosystem (hence globalism and population control movements), and apparently they need to use some of our biology (human and bovine) for something (mutilations, abductions). Also, they probably pose an insoluble problem for integrating their reality into the World Religions.</p>

<p>Any one of the parenthetical examples above would probably justify multiple classified government programs to clamp down on all relevant information, except for controllable leaks and misinformation programs.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of this, but i think that something that&#39;s key here is that, I think, the greys (which are probably a number of separate species and therefore innacurate to lump all together, but still) are actually in deep deep need of our biology, specifically they&#39;ve reached an evolutionary &quot;dead end&quot;, likely a combination of becoming increasingly infertile (look at male fertility rates recently) and neurodegenerative diseases affecting their ability to come up with solutions. And they&#39;re curious if our two species are genetically compatible, both for our sake and their sake, if we are, we can learn to live together and share all our knowledge.

    <div class="md"><p>I give you credit for a good proposal, but I want to challenge it and see if we can make it stronger, ok?</p>

<p>So where we agree is that maybe, multiple groups of &quot;grey-like&quot; aliens have shown up on Earth, and are essentially trading biological insight, samples, and breeding experiments, which they can only get from us in exchange for high-tech info we would not have without them. Further, that aliens&#39; existence and  technology is being kept hidden from the public, but perhaps released slowly - largely in the deniable and disinfo-prone conspiracy world, but also in some advanced academic/military labs where scientists sign rigorous non-disclosures.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure we have enough solid info to be sure of your &quot;dying out&quot; hypothesis. If they have the technology to move through deep space, or through time itself, then it seems likely they would have mastered biology far better than we have. For instance, they should be able to use energy infiltration to do complex nucleic recomposition - essentially making their own fresh stem cells to regenerate tissues, or to mutate if that were necessary. It seems we are not far from that goal - as in, the conspiracies related to the level of care aging billionaires get, the rumors of human cloning, the conspiracies concerning fetal tissue - all these indicate that human science is close to breakthroughs on the biology front (however morally ambiguous the process is). The same goes for our reproduction tech, such as test tube fertilization of stored haploids, and the next stage will be an artificial womb.</p>

<p>So why, if they are more advanced by far, would they need anything but the raw materials contained in our bodies, which they could just take?</p>

<p>I agree that it seems they are interested in the Earth as a precious habitat that must be protected, as if the materials, processes, and energy of a planet like this may be a rare resource, or the history is worth preserving (home planet?) or something like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m a computational biologist by training and have worked / work in the top institutions so I think I can fill a bit about the seeming contradiction between their ability to travel faster than light and their inability to cure their own predicament.</p>

<p>The ability for them to travel faster than light was likely developed by other &quot;humans&quot; (i think the modern human is likely far older than 13k years and probably in the millions, that&#39;s based on human genetics and this <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/relay.nationalgeographic.com/proxy/distribution/public/amp/2017/12/million-year-old-human-ancestor-unveiled-to-public-spd">footprint</a> among other hints) and many other races over time on other planets, with the greys being one of those offshoots. This involves finding the unified theory of physics (which has been discovered here on earth too but just ignored :/, but that&#39;s for another post) and understanding you can manipulate gravity by changing the concentration of energy in a given volume (think m=E/c<sup>2).</sup></p>

<p>Now with that ability it says nothing about biology except it does allow you to understand biology down to the quantum level, and allows you to begin designing larger things from constituent blocks (amino acids nucleotides etc) but that doesn&#39;t mean biology is solved, in fact it points to it as the next frontier. Think about the human brain as a walking, food and air powered, with huge processing power and operating at room temp quantum computer that relies on viruses to generate diversity in its neural components (which are themselves made up of at least 3billion base pairs). We now have the ability to edit these base pairs with high accuracy using CRISPR and can use it to generate stem cells of pretty much any type (using a variety of culture conditions using strong inhibitors of things like the Wnt pathway). But the brain is different, it&#39;s not just a mass of cells that talk to each other, the quantum component of it makes it on a completely different complexity scale, one that even they may not understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, two responses: So you are saying you think humans are more or less on a par with the greys, at least in this particular specialty?</p>

<p>But I&#39;m more interested in how you integrate your conspiracy theories with your science background? </p>

<p>I have a similar problem btw, as I studied environmental science, but did not agree with the man-made hypothesis of climate change as opposed to a solar-forcing perspective, making me a conspiracy theorist by default. But I enjoy engaging in all sorts of theory, conspiracy or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is the idea that many greys are life made into robots. They serve as proxies for their hideous owners who are hated just by appearing. They are hated because they feed on fear, hatred, suffering, and other negative emotional states in others. The offensive appearance is a product of and a utility for harvesting emotional energy. This addiction gives them their reputation. They are connesseurs of the suffering of consciousness. Sacrifice rituals are elicited by them in the name of gods and demons. They love tricking others into doing the work for them. Then they absorb the emotional energy while they can blame the humans for it exopolitically. </p>

<p>This explains what &quot;demons&quot; are. They are ET life forms that choose the path of the bully, harvesting the joy from others using fear and other negative emotions. The apply science and understanding to it all and so they become an intelligent disease to consciousness and upon creation, as a structure and as a process. They produce entropy. They compel an immune system response. So, they use insidious methods to operate to avoid such a reaction.</p>

In this future a human colony (I don&#39;t know if its on this planet or not) was invaded by an insectoid race. Most of the race was killed or sold into slavery but they kept the psychic ones. They were put into balloons filled with golden liquid this allows them to stay in a trance state for extended periods.  During these trance states they can be guided to go back in time and control/manipulate the present populace in order to create favourable conditions for the future conquest.  The skin changes to absorb nutrients via the golden liquid. The suspenscion in the liquid also explains the body shape changes. And the head grows to accomodate the overused psychic abilities.</p>

<p>Some current day greys are trying to stop this time line.  They take  samples of peoples light bodies to create programmable clone light bodies that can be placed into surgically altered grey clone bodies used as ship parts. If someone proves to be more psychically awake they will be passed on to another race that can make better use of them. Im sure they do make hybrid babies but its only one of the things they are doing.</p>

What if they&#39;re just an advanced version of us from a fallout-esque world where one million billion years into the future, we(they) have pretty much harnessed anti-gravity, free energy, all sorts of fun stuff. The shitty part is, none of this stuff can help them turn their home planet from a radiated hellhole back into anything capable of bearing life. Which, by some form of Arnold Schwarzenegger based god logic, they have decided time travel was the best way to deal with the problem. Now, this is a major redpill here, but what if travelling in space(read:outside the gravity of earth) is and was(why am I using these terms?)basically just travelling in time. It would make logical sense that once this was discovered(please read, anyone that ever travelled in space coming back to earth and subsequently being told to just not tell anyone) it would be covered up because someone would get the bright idea to travel into space using some amalgamated form of transistors and electronics and thus alter timelines. See, this is where the ET&#39;s come in. Altering timelines is a big no no. Also, nuclear, atomic, and dimensional-alterance weapons are a big no no, hence them literally crash-landing on our planet in not one but multiple locations in literally what was a attempt to get humans to stop thinking of anything that scared them in the middle of the night as &#39;demons&#39;(and also stop the nuclear weapons that dropped 2 years prior). As it turns out, the people that investigated the roswell crash, decisively thought just that when they saw a grey being with a big head show up in a cornfield somewhere. Literally would&#39;ve thought it was a demon, so what do they do? Oh, they torture the crap out of it and corrupt it so the flesh-and-blood alien can&#39;t even differentiate between good and evil(please remember that the greys are just us, a million years in the future. They still have opinions too, you know)so when it eventually went back to report to it&#39;s leader, they&#39;re entire species decided to enslave us. I guess somewhere along the lines they had decided we had suffered enough and actually, a part of me hopes that if it hasn&#39;t already happened that these greys could now be considered god-fearing christians. That is, once again, the basis of logic I am using. There are also a number of them that could be satan-worshippers but it really makes my blood boil for that common logic to be used against all aliens when they&#39;re literally over here stopping the massive amount of other timelines that exist where we would have bombed into nuclear oblivion over 60 years ago..like hundreds of times every year. I&#39;m not even joking. So this brings me to my point:aliens are real, but by the majority they came to save us, not to nuke us or enslave us. A little hard to swallow, I know. However under intergalactic politics they kind of have to keep us here for the time being, so when we go to space and find out that literally every other planet is inhabited by some form of life, whether it be a dimensional oddity or not, and then come to the foregone conclusion that we must go invade and conquer it. No, they want us to not fuck everything up. Hence we don&#39;t have a working space program. There has to be peace on earth before they would let us do some shit like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Xeno biology is an interesting topic that we can only make guesses at.  I would offer the hypothesis that they originated on a planet with a very dense and thick atmosphere, almost like living underwater, because that&#39;s more of what their supposed physiology speaks of to me, a species adapted to a low light environment.  It may also be very oxygen rich if they in fact respirate the same way as we do as they generally do not seem to have large capacity lungs.  Who knows about gravity and other issues.</p>

<p>If they are adapted to an environment very different from ours, that could hinder our interactions in weird ways.  The only thing i can otherwise gather from the supposed evidence is that their actions seem clandestine in nature.  There doesn&#39;t have to be an ethical reason to gather samples from us.  Maybe they can sell our dna or flesh on some sort of black market?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but we don&#39;t hide our existence from the apes, we just shoot em with tranquilizers and go about business.  I think that if they could hide from us completely, as they are won&#39;t to do, then we should never detect them.  However, we have, and they are slightly sloppy about what they do.  It seems to me that the sloppy encounters are done against whatever protocol keeps them hidden from us entirely</p>

I&#39;m getting really turned off by the ufo crowd hijacking threads about serious issues to make all about aliens and ufos.

    <div class="md"><p>I lean somewhat toward this idea. There was a set of videos I watched of an interview with an alien abductee, and in [one video (relevant part from 9:45 to ~16:30)](<a href="https://youtu.be/OPpjQCc79HQ">https://youtu.be/OPpjQCc79HQ</a>] he discusses his pre-birth memories and being with the alien who he remembers abducted him as a child/teenager, while looking down on earth before his human incarnation.<br/>
There&#39;s 3 videos in all, and the links to each are in the recommended videos part. I recommend watching them all, it&#39;s really interesting and the guy seems really sincere and genuine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing how many of the posts below speak of Grey&#39;s and UFOs as if they are real.
The fact remains there is not one solid shred of evidence E.T.s exist unless you count Tyler and secure team as proof.
No bodies..no ships...nothing but yet people still create delusions of government cover ups and underground battles with aliens shooting some dudes fingers off.</p>

<p>Give me a call when an actual ship lands and films the &quot;greys&quot; walking out on video which isn&#39;t 5 miles away or so out of focus and shaky you haven&#39;t the slightest clue what you&#39;re looking at.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be obtuse...I just feel there hasn&#39;t been any  proof of their existence but yet people speak about them as if they are real.</p>
