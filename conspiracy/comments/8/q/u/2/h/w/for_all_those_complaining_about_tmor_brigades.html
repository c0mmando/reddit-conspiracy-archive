<p>Lets be honest: a majority of this subs moderating team tends to lean slightly right politically. Therefore, any left leaning user who is banned from here will immediately head over to TMOR to join the discussion (and complaining) over there. Most feel theyve been wrongfully banned because of their political views. </p>

<p>So when you see certain posts getting heavily upvoted/downvoted/gilded, its because that entire userbase is still present here, they just cant comment/post. Every left leaning user that has been banned is still lurking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and voting accordingly.</p>

<p>What does this mean? What constitutes a &quot;genuine user&quot;?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this thrown around constantly by people, but I&#39;ve never seen it actually substantiated. I&#39;ve seen this used way too often when people&#39;s opinions or comments don&#39;t go over well and they then blame shills and brigaders and say some cringey nonsense like &quot;it&#39;s not the genuine users who disagree with me&quot;. </p>

<p>Show me the litmus test that proves who is a genuine user and who isn&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t need to be the universal standard r /conspiracy litmus test for genuine user, I&#39;m fine with seeing yours. I just really want to understand what type of formula is used to easily dismiss any other user.</p>

<p>Most of the conspiracies around Trump are bullshit. Best I can figure, some Russian oligarchs bailed him out of his Atlantic City problems back in the day and the investigation is hoping they&#39;ll be able to dig their way back to that. A lot of the guys caught up in the Russian investigation look like sleepers to me. I&#39;m far more concerned about the Awan Bros. and whatever cabal it is DWS is covering for. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is running the show at all, I think he&#39;s a front for the military and they&#39;ve identified the parasite eating the country away from the inside and are slowly moving against it. Trump was the rare guy who wasn&#39;t part of CFR, Bilderberg, etc. He&#39;s a prick, but he&#39;s America&#39;s prick. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see Russia as the worst enemy. They&#39;ve got a ton of oil, they&#39;re run by a nationalist gangster, we can do business with them. I&#39;m far more concerned about the globalists running Europe, Saudi Arabia, Israel. Putin is no globalist, which makes him the lesser evil. </p>

<p>So essentially people you don&#39;t like or agree with are not genuine users in your eyes. Doesn&#39;t that seem like an extremely flawed and biased way of classifying contributors on this sub? What skills, talents or achievements do you have that make you general instincts so superb and superior that you can assess and then publicly dismiss other opinions as being non-genuine and only here for the purpose of spreading mis/disinfo.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So you think most of the Trump theories are bullshit, but provide no proof for why and use convenient excuses to dismiss them. Again what information do you have access to that conclusively proves most of the Trump theories are bullshit. There&#39;s mountains of evidence that can&#39;t be dismissed, yet you are saying the theories are bs. Why?  What guys look like sleepers? And sleepers for who and for what end? What cabal and theories concerning the Awan Bros. have more evidence than any of the major Trump theories? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is running the show at all, I think he&#39;s a front for the military and they&#39;ve identified the parasite eating the country away from the inside and are slowly moving against it.

</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that all of the evidence that Trump is involved is just a coincidence or misrepresented? He&#39;s not just a useful idiot, but the biggest idiot possible so he&#39;s not involved in any way. What &quot;military&quot;? Do you think the entire military is operating in concert with everyone sharing the same knowledge, aims, goals and ideas? Or is it just a few higher ups in each group? Why would they be free from any connections to this supposed parasite? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So invading sovereign nations, tremendous human rights abuses, upholding a culture of extreme corruption and graft are preferrible to whatever the &quot;globalists running Europed, Saudi Arabia and Israel&quot; are doing? And what are they doing? Why is Putin not a globalist? He&#39;s had an active part in trying to spread Russia&#39;s sphere of influence through Syria, Ukraine and other nations. If you could, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it if you would explain what the evil of being a globalist is in an objective way.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not really into pop conspiracy theories like alternative assassinations of Lincoln, or Kennedy. The ones I&#39;m interested in tend to be possible different reasons behind major policy, political, historical decisions, and different understandings behind reasoning and viewpoints of historical sources. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well the first part is that I think you&#39;re a much higher grade of mis/disinfo; the second part is now moot, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean by this? Why am I a source of mis/disinfo? What information have I been spreading that is false or misleading? Where is your proof that I am actively spreading mis/disinfo? What are your qualifications to be able to dismiss everything I say as mis/disinfo. You may not mean it, but by labeling me as a &quot;higher grade of mis/disinfo&quot; you are tacitly declaring everything I say to be not in good faith and not worth evaluating. Why do you think that is an ok thing to do, especially when you haven&#39;t proved I&#39;ve said anything that constitutes mis/disinfo? </p>

<p>Why do you see nothing wrong with labeling most everything you don&#39;t agree with, or that aligns with your ideas and views, as mis/disinfo? Doesn&#39;t that seem like an impediment to supporting and sustaining an open forum for genuine discussion? Do you see nothing wrong with actively trying to silence voices because you don&#39;t like them, and doing so without any evidence? Wouldn&#39;t actively working to silence differing opinions as disinfo mean you are not acting as a genuine user since that goes contrary to acting in good faith? Your actions of labeling differing opinions as disinfo and dismissing those seems like you are trying very hard to control the narrative for this sub and that doesn&#39;t seem like something a genuine user, or one acting in good faith should be doing.</p>

<p>Big difference between that and simply being indifferent to your opinion. I answered a couple times for others who might be on the fence about all this stuff, and because you were so courteous, but at some point you&#39;ve got to wonder why you would be putting in so much effort to debunk conspiracies on r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>Never said I&#39;m an expert. I just said those are the theories and topics I&#39;m interested in. Don&#39;t know where you got the expert part from because I never said that. One I am interested in is the historical treatment and writings on the Roman Emperor Gallienus by  his contemporaries. I&#39;m also interested in the the question of Scipio (not Africanus) was aware and perhaps even complicit in the plot to kill his cousin Gaius Gracchus.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not putting effort in to debunk anything. When I see a topic I&#39;m informed on I provide my opinion. If I see a theory that seems absurd and is lacking in substantive evidence in it&#39;s favor and there is a significant amount of evidence disproving the theory I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong of me to mention that. Simultaneously I support theories on this sub like the many Trump administration/Trump related theories. </p>

<p>You say your indifferent but you&#39;re not even addressing the topic of this whole chain which is what authority you have and what benefit is there for your behavior of dismissing anything you don&#39;t agree with as disinfo or from non genuine users. Your doing it right now, questioning my right and reasons to be here even though I&#39;ve only acted in good faith in this sub. Because I don&#39;t agree with your ideas, because I do believe in the Trump theories, and because I find your persistent habit of dismissing any opposing opinions as non geniune users you have keep saying how weird it is I&#39;m in this sub. </p>

<p>That will never happen without embracing the ideas and ideals of the Bernie wing. Neoliberal policy has helped bring this country to where it is today. You advocate for more of it. The Party must be taken or the Country dies too, whether you realize that Reality or not. </p>

<p>Lol no. We merely band-aided over the problems of 2008. The reckoning is still to come. Some numbers from an odler post of mine:</p>

<p><strong>copypasta</strong></p>

<p>41% of jobs lost in 08 were High Wage jobs, but only 30% of jobs created since then are High Wage. 37% of jobs lost in the Recession were Middle-Wage jobs, but only 26% of jobs created since then are Middle Wage. And 21% of all jobs lost in &#39;08 were low wage, service sector jobs...yet a staggering 44% of all jobs created since &#39;08 are low wage, service sector. This means millions of Americans are literally locked out of the Middle Class.</p>

<p>US Credit Card debt has reached record highs as of Q4 2017, at $1.023 Trillion. This is higher than in &#39;08. Student Loan debt is at 1.2 Trillion, and rising. Auto Debt is up to $1.2 Trillion, and delinquencies jumped in Q3 and Q4 from 6.5% to 7.2%. Mortgage debt is up, and the average new home price in the US is higher than in &#39;08, at $250,000. The economy isn&#39;t doing good. The US Middle Class is drowning in debt, and when &#39;08 part two hits, sooner rather than later, it is going to be a shit show of epic proportions. QE 1-3 only postponed the pain, so enjoy these times now, because the reckoning is coming.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>LOL. HRC, Bill, Obama, and the majority of the ruling Party apparatus are Neoliberals. Not sure where you get the idea they aren&#39;t from. Bill helped <em>create</em> the Neoliberal, 3rd Way Dem Party of today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Republicans are aggressive neoliberals the ones in control right now and in every branch of government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we can&#39;t change a goddamn thing until we ensure the Dems cleansed of their Corporatist ilk so we can actually challenge the Republicans for meaningful change, not a different flavor of bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Lol i don&#39;t know if you realize you&#39;re spouting the same talking points that are always spouted, but alas. I don&#39;t really care if you would vote for Bernie. The majority of registered Party members support and like him (party members being citizens, not actual pols). His policies such as Medicare For All have majority support when polled nationwide. You can stand aside or be swept away by the tides of change- your choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Republicans will always vote Republican. You can&#39;t beat them. Especially now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can once we take the Party from the corrupt Neoliberal Corporatists you are so quick to defend and parade as paragons of Leftism and virtue!</p>

<p>No thanks bud. Your trick is easily seen through- those you endorse and support have helped to destroy this country, and we <em>will</em> stop them, or the country will be destroyed too.</p>

<p>I think all of us, maybe more your generation than mine, need to focus on what’s happened in this country when in the very mainstream, I mean at the highest, most influential levels of the political establishment, this kind of discourse is no longer considered an exception. It is the norm. </p>

<p>We hear it daily from MSNBC and CNN, from the New York Times and the Washington Post, that people who doubt the narrative of what’s loosely called Russiagate are somehow acting on behalf of or under the spell of the Kremlin, that we aren’t Americans any longer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. I’ve seen instances where certain Twitter accounts served as the basis for major media stories about Russian interference in the election, but when you go and look at them, they have thirteen Twitter followers. Sometimes it’s that level of absurdity. Other times it’s a little more substantial, but the scope of it, when you put it into the broad context and the fact that Hillary Clinton spent a billion dollars on her campaign — Donald Trump spent, I don’t know, roughly half that, maybe two-thirds of that — is an infinitesimal, barely detectable fraction of the messaging that Americans were inundated with officially by the campaigns. Then when you factor in dark money and super PACs and ongoing nonelection propaganda, I find it extremely difficult to believe that any rational person in good faith would say that it was significant in terms of its impact.</p>

<p>They&#39;re choosing the nuclear option because they&#39;re upset with the way the sub runs, because it didn&#39;t cater to their anger filled rhetoric, lack of sourced material, and doxxing.

<p>That&#39;s not true, though.  Several months ago several of us were banned by one mod (I think the number was up to 15) in one thread.  We didn&#39;t break any rules whatsoever.</p>

<p>TMOR calls out the hypocrisy here.  Are they over the top?  Apparently so, I don&#39;t pay enough attention to them to know or care.  But the hypocrisy <em>is</em> happening here.</p>

<p>This sub is weird sometimes - it has this ridiculous team mentality when it comes to TMOR.  &quot;You are either with us or against us.&quot;  But that&#39;s not how it always works.  Mods in this sub have made mistakes and they&#39;ve definitely made some shitty calls.  If TMOR calls bullshit on those calls, they aren&#39;t wrong.  I have no idea what TMOR does with the rest of its time, nor do I care.  But me relating a time they helped me when I was wrongfully banned shouldn&#39;t equate to me &quot;speaking up for them&quot;.  That&#39;s childish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh get over yourself and the persecution complex, you&#39;ve said nothing inflammatory besides admitting your ignorance to what TMOR actually does and is.</p>

<p>When did he ban you, and why? If you&#39;re actually scared then pm in the details then lol. I want to get to the bottom of it if you viewed that you were unfairly banned (I&#39;m not one for taken random internet stranger&#39;s word for it). I&#39;ve got a disdain for TMOR, but if you&#39;re speaking true I&#39;ll take heed to it.</p>

<p>However, TMOR has discord raids, follow and harass mods so it&#39;s more difficult for them to act, follow users until they leave the subreddit. It&#39;s literally siphoning the users who are providing sourced content in favor of backbiting partisan wastes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wtf, dude - get over myself?  There&#39;s no persecution complex, I&#39;ve relayed what happened to me and recognize there&#39;s a chance I could be banned for speaking out about it.  There&#39;s another user in this thread who said something similar because he <em>also</em> knows the chance of being banned for speaking up - why do you think that is??  I&#39;m not scared, nor do I have any desire to &quot;PM you details&quot; or change your mind when it&#39;s obvious you have zero desire to &quot;get to the bottom of it&quot; with the way you are coming at me.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t attacked this sub nor the users nor the mods.  I&#39;m not here starting shit.  The topic was brought up so I relayed my experience. 
 This sub is like any sub discussing controversial subjects - there&#39;s going to be issues.  If you can&#39;t see that and you want to believe these mods are perfect and unbiased and never get emotional towards users they disagree with, go for it.  But I&#39;m here to say that isn&#39;t always the case.  And when the mods go rogue, TMOR has a field day with it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this comment denotes fear or a persecution complex, but whatever.</p>

<p>If I really thought you were interested in what happened, I&#39;d take the time to dig through months worth of history to find it, because it certainly stirred up some shit around here for a couple of days (though not enough to remove the mod).  But I&#39;m not going to waste time trying to prove a point that will fall on deaf ears.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t think I&#39;m fear-mongering.  It was well known around here for quite some time that pissing off certain mods would get you banned - and it didn&#39;t always involve breaking the rules.  There were several shake ups with popular contributors getting banned for questionable reasons.  I never really had a dog in the fight until I was banned, then I realized it wasn&#39;t just the controversial users, but also those just speaking up at the wrong time.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here as often as I once was, so I don&#39;t know if it is still happening with the same frequency (this sub seems to have improved in the last few months), but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised, hence my comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understood, well if you do come across it, I&#39;ll be willing to look into it. I understand your hesitation in believing that I&#39;m actually interested. I cannot prove that to you in anyway other than I&#39;ve taken a shine towards these issues. I&#39;ve watched this sub morph into what has become today and the amount of kneecapping that I saw done. I believe we are further from any semblance of decorum than we&#39;ve ever been here.</p>

<p>The brigades are designed to scare us, divide us, and ultimately change the free discussion nature of the sub towards a more hostile tone. </p>

<p>If anything, my comments will be buried soon as I&#39;m starting to see. I don&#39;t get downvotes unless I speak against brigades, which I find troublesome when it&#39;s fairly obvious JDIF, T_D, TMOR, and other agents have strong propaganda pushes on here, but it&#39;s often only singled out to one group. It&#39;s fraudulent, manipulative, and downright just dirty tactics for a free online forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turns out it was easy to find by searching a few keywords.  Oddly enough, it was in a discussion similar to this one, about TMOR.  I recognize it now makes me look like a TMOR shill or whatever, but at the time I didn&#39;t really know what TMOR was - just that axolotl_peyotl seemed really intent on stirring the pot A LOT at that time with these meta posts and it was annoying the hell out of me.  I had forgotten until I read through some of the posts - he didn&#39;t ban me for a comment in that thread, he searched through my history and banned me for a completely unrelated comment from a couple of days/weeks prior.  And THAT&#39;S what pissed me off.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the original thread.  MANY of the comments were deleted:</p>

<p>Totally.  And TMOR hate seems to come in strong waves here.  I&#39;m not here all the time (I often have to take breaks because this places gets too nutty for me) - but it&#39;s definitely one other thing this sub seems divided on.</p>

<p>But they were cool and welcoming to me when I was banned and helped me navigate addressing it.  And a lot of the times they call bullshit on this sub, I agree.  Funny enough, I <strong>never</strong> go to that sub.  I only know what they do and post because people here whine about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can confirm and agree with OP.  I was part of a massive ban here months ago due to speaking out against a mod massively banning other users in a thread due to political opinions.  I had no idea what happened, as I had broken none of the rules (seriously, the ban was b.s.).  </p>

<p>I only figured out what happened because TMOR posted about it, so I went over there to figure out what was going on.  I commented on my experience, then was told by a mod here that I wouldn&#39;t be unbanned because I was commenting in the TMOR sub, which I clapped back at because I never would have been over <em>there</em> if I hadn&#39;t been wrongly banned <em>here</em>.  The original mod who banned me apparently caught so much flack, I was unbanned by the end of the day (though unfortunately he is still a mod).</p>

<p>The entire thing was petty and a bunch of bullshit.  TMOR may have their issues, but they aren&#39;t wrong <em>all</em> the time.</p>

<p>I spoke up because what the OP claimed also happened to me.

So while I can&#39;t speak on the TMOR sub as a whole, I <em>can</em> say that for 12 hours they were a helluva lot cooler than <em>our</em> mods were.</p>

<p>Citing “lessons learned from online engagement with ‘Bernie Bros,’” a pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC is pledging to spend $1 million to “push back against” users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hold on that line from the article you listed said it was pledging to spend $1 million between twitter, facebook, Instagram and Reddit. So I guess not all of that $1 million is going to shill on reddit right now...</p>

<p>Hold own, that article is from 2016. I don&#39;t CTR is frugal enough to make the $1 million stretch all the way through 2018 while actively influencing reddit...</p>

<p>Hold on CTR as of 2018 on <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00578997&amp;amp;cycle=2018">OpenSecrets</a> only spent less than $30,000 so far this year. I don&#39;t think much of that is going to reddit. </p>

<p>So while your source does show that political action groups do spend money to spread their information on various social media platforms, it in now way provides any evidence that Shareblue or &quot;topminds trolls&quot; are actively constituting</p>

<p>Roughly 90% of that</p>

<p>that being reference to pro/anti trump bs. </p>

<p>So to clarify you provided no relevant evidence, only an article that showed CTR pledged to put $1 million into spreading their ideas and message across 4 social media platforms. Sure you can draw strings between actions like that and an organization like shareblue. But in no way does that prove or back up your claim. </p>

<p>Feel free to provide a relevant source for that big claim.</p>

<p>Where did you provide explicit evidence of shareblue or &quot;topminds trolls&quot; being responsible for &quot;90% of the pro/anti trump bs&quot;. The link you provided above was about CTR efforts in 2016 split between 4 platforms. It was neither timely or relevant as CTR was not involved in your claim.</p>

<p>Your new link does show that David Brock, as of 1/17 did intend to raise 40 million for his various organizations and super pacs geared towards promoting democrat/left leaning agendas, ideas, and taking aim at president trump. I can&#39;t deny that. It also certainly gives credence to the idea that some of that money going to shareblue could be used to for efforts your claiming. However that article is from 2017 and in no way proves the claim that shareblue and topminds trolls are responsible for 90% of pro/anti trump bs on this sub.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t do it like the way you did. It&#39;s a bit jarring. Maybe try writing something like: &quot;so basically you&#39;re saying &quot;X&quot;&quot;. Cause when I first saw that comment I thought you were meaning to reply to someone else.</p>

<p>That out of the way, its better to ask for clarity on things instead of posting something meant to represent another persons words and ideas incorrectly. What you posted implying I had said is not just wrong but a incorrect characterization of how I&#39;m conducting myself. It doesn&#39;t speak well to the idea that you are participating in good faith if you are purposely presenting false ideas of the other participant&#39;s actions and words.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not asking for that. But you&#39;re the one who made a very broad claim that &quot;90% of the anti/pro trump bias is done by shareblue and topminds trolls&quot;. You provided no evidence that proves that shareblue employees or contractors are coming in this subreddit and posting 90% of the pro/anti trump bs. You likewise provided no evidence proving &quot;topminds trolls&quot; are doing the same. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t make claims if you have no evidence to back it up. Equally don&#39;t post links that are tangentially related (in a very loose way and only to one of the groups involved in the claims) and act like it is proof. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t back up the claim you made but thats your problem. Nothing is stopping you from looking for more substantial proof, but just cause you haven&#39;t provided any and then accused me of ignoring the proof you did post (even though it does not prove your specific claim in question) doesn&#39;t mean your claim is true. You still have provided no proof for the specific claim and instead are whining that I&#39;m asking for relevant proof. If you can&#39;t find it, that&#39;s fine. You don&#39;t need to continue this thread if you don&#39;t want to. But posting irrelevant and outdated things and acting like it proves your claim won&#39;t fly with me, nor can you convince me that I&#39;m just being stubborn over it. </p>

<p>&quot;Why do you make claims you can&#39;t possibly back up with pertinent evidence and then pretend that the irrelevant stuff you do provide backs up your claim?! REEEE!!!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Like the hundreds of different accounts I&#39;ve run into that uniformly spout the same left wing talking points, in 8 hour shifts, use all of the forum disruption methods in the shill handbook and run ridiculously obvious vote bots, like 50 points on dozens of comments saying the exact same things?</p>

<p>I think you are having difficulty understanding what I am writing because you tend to respond without answering or adequately addressing the points I make. </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking you for your definition of a &quot;topminds troll&quot;. After all you use the phrase in your claim that we&#39;ve been discussing so it makes sense that I get your complete and realized definition of the term so I can continue to build an understanding of your claim. I&#39;m interested in figuring out what you mean by it because I don&#39;t want to attribute inaccurate ideas to your claim. </p>

<p>By the way my point was:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>which included a few questions that I assumed you would use tot help provide a narrower or more detailed definition for what you consider to be a &quot;topminds troll&quot;. If you are unwilling to provide you definition for the term that you use in your claim, thats fine, but you should say so. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>So you think its odd that people share similar opinions or ideas? Does this issue only apply to left wing talking points?
What do you mean by 8 hour shifts? Do you check each of those accounts and record that the majority of them are only on reddit in 8 hour shifts? Where are you records or numbers for that because that sounds like a claim you can&#39;t back up. I&#39;m not even touching that forum disruption methods shill handbook thing because every time one user brings it up it turns out everyone from every side of that thread is actively employing a bunch in every comment. But do you have evidence that users are using those tactics knowingly and for a purpose? Do you have evidence of users activating bot scripts for vote manipulation? If so how? Why do you find it odd that people upvote popular ideas? Do you think your ideas and comments are always entitled to be popular and praised? Why do you think it is wrong if ideas you don&#39;t agree with are upvoted or popular? Why do you assume you understand the demographics and interests of all users on this sub to such an extent that you can easily spot artificial voting and manipulation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or the posts I&#39;ve made where topminds instigated a brigade?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What evidence do you have that topminds instigated a brigade on those posts. Do you have comments stating such? Are all of this posts linked on TMOR? Are some of them? Are any of them? If all of them are, how do they perform vs. posts on the same topic that are not linked to TMOR. If only some are of these purported brigaded posts are linked to TMOR and some are not linked there, how do you know that the ones not linked were brigaded? Do you analyze what the effect of the time of posting has on each post, what the effects of hitting the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or all does? Do you have some analytics that prove the points you make statistically should have higher votes than they do given the demographics that are accessing said post?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My vote is better served in the Dem Primaries. They are far easier to drag Left than the Reps ever will be. </p>

<p>What is there to talk about concerning the Reps? I don&#39;t support their economic policies, I don&#39;t support their social policies, I don&#39;t support their candidates. But the candidates I do want to support will only ever get elected if they win Dem primaries- and that is what&#39;s important. The Right wing grassroots have to fight their own battles. </p>

<p>The only things I&#39;ve agreed with Trump on were his withdrawal from TPP and his NK overtures. His tax policies, social policies, and foreign policies I consider to be naive at best and disastrous at worst, for the most part. I don&#39;t believe in Russia collusion so would rather base my Trump criticisms on his actual policy initiatives. </p>

<p>I speak often about the Dems because that is the best vehicle with which to transform the nation. Right now it&#39;s a choice of Right wing economics and Right wing social policies with the Reps, or Right wing economics and Left wing social policies with the Dems. Well social policy is worthless without economic policy, so we must focus on the corruption in the Dem Party if we ever want to change the country. </p>

<p>I am not a fan of Neoliberalism, 3rd Way Centrism, New Democrats, or any associated movements or ideologies. And unfortunately HRC, Bill, Obama, and most of those in power within the Party apparatus are members of these groups or believers in these ideologies. </p>

<p>First we take the Party. Then we take the Country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you provide some analytics that can prove irregular voting patterns that correspond with any mention of TMOR?</p>

<p>Have you ever entertained the idea that certain threads where the brigading and shill alarm is rung is a false alarm. Not all conspiracy users have to agree on the same topics, the same opinions on those topics or on the standing of said topics and related evidence. Maybe try to consider that certain threads or comments or opinions get down voted because regular old conspiracy users don&#39;t agree with them or more importantly are really tired of seeing it. I see tons of different threads for the same topic with no new evidence, findings or theories proposed, all from like one or two source and posted by one or two users religiously. I get sick of those after the first (what i deem) unnecessary duplicate of it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of threads of people complaining that the last time they posted about a topic it didn&#39;t receive enough attention and that it was shills/brigades. That just makes me want to downvote something even more. I&#39;m cool with a user posting something like that if they can provide some hard evidence of shilling and brigading happening to artificially suppress a topic. Even if I disagree with the topic at hand, a post like that that backs up the claim that the prior post received no attention due to artificial means would absolutely be worth upvoting solely for further investigation of why the original was originally artificially manipulated. </p>

<p>It was at +25, then TMOR linked directly to it and it&#39;s now heavily downvoted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh okay, I didn&#39;t pick up on that it was that comment specifically, my bad (I just clicked on both links and assumed the TMOR link was referring the the conspiracy thread in general).</p>

<p>Well I do see that it is still sitting at a negative score. Although I don&#39;t think that is necessarily due to brigading. Anthony Bourdain was a very charismatic guy. I&#39;ve been watching his shows since 9th grade, when I saw the new notification on my phone that he had died, i literally texted my friend who has always been a massive fan of Bourdain about it. </p>

<p>I think the negative score for that comment could absolutely be influenced by TMOR, but also by the fact that it was about a highly respected and loved cultural figure. Walk thru the village or by Les Halles the day or two after his death and you see things everywhere paying respects to him. As that post got more popular more and more people probably went thru the comments and I&#39;m sure a fair few fans down voted something they felt was offensive. </p>

<p>At the same metric people also get fatigue from the classic Clinton killed schtick, so that could also account for the down votes.</p>

<p>And regarding Cadet&#39;s comment, I assume you&#39;re talking about the one mentioning the elections. I don&#39;t see how thats suspicious. The comment he&#39;s responding too, either joking or seriously claiming one of the most famous and scrutinized political figures in the nation had a beloved celebrity killed is outlandish and dumb. Equally if the logic goes that Hillary Clinton can easily have a celebrity, currently working and abroad in France, killed and staged to convincingly look like a suicide, along with all the nonsensical stuff people accuse her of in this sub, then why couldn&#39;t she steal either election for herself.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s a point I agree with and something I&#39;d upvote. She&#39;s also described as some indescribable boogeyman on this sub. From the stuff she&#39;s accused of one would assume she is one of the most powerful people on the planet, capable of maintaining vast crime syndicates, plots and conspiracies, and yet those same people on this sub also posit that she&#39;s utterly incompetent, feeble, dying and that she was unable to use her vast imagined power to steal herself either election.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s what they seem to claim everytime. They also claim <em>none</em> of them have alt accounts and none of them are able to post on this sub in any way.</p>

<p>It all just sounds like a lame excuse being put on audio tape and played nonstop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lets be honest: a majority of this subs moderating team tends to lean slightly right politically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know, nor do I care. Everyone has a political view. Most conspiracies have a political core. Pretty much any conspiracy that involved a &quot;cover-up&quot; can be political.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, any left leaning user who is banned from here will immediately head over to TMOR to join the discussion (and complaining) over there. Most feel theyve been wrongfully banned because of their political views. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is where they lose their credibility. They act like TMOR is the <em>only</em> place left in the world for them to hang out. If you&#39;ve been wrongfully banned, make a new account and just start over. Who the hell cares. I did the same a while ago because I was banned for calling a mod, indirectly, a f*cking idiot.</p>

<p>Also, if they are wrongfully banned for their political views and feel like they have absolutely no other place than TMOR, then why is that sub literally filled with threads mocking other subs? Why is there barely any discussion about conspiracies over there? Why is every comment section filled with mocking statements? And when you ask about it, even when done nicely, you&#39;re gonna get mocked, downvoted and bullied.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 100% sure barely any of them are old conspiracy sub users. Anyone that is banned here and goes to TMOR will be handeled the same way as if they are not banned.</p>

<p>They simply don&#39;t talk about conspiracies at all and when you show you are into conspiracies they will ridicule you into oblivion. Nothing about them seems to show they are old conspiracy users.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So when you see certain posts getting heavily upvoted/downvoted/gilded, its because that entire userbase is still present here, they just cant comment/post. Every left leaning user that has been banned is still lurking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and voting accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TMOR mods have, on multiple occasions, confirmed that they don&#39;t want tmor users to up/downvote on this sub and when caught they will insta ban you. Which I do not believe at all.</p>

<p>What&#39;s their reason for still being active here when &quot;Therefore, any left leaning user who is banned from here will <strong>immediately head over to TMOR</strong> to join the discussion&quot;?</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious they have some sort of agenda.</p>
