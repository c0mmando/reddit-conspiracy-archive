       I find it funny that this rather new psychedelic is gaining mass mainstream popularity yet it is one of the most misunderstood and underestimated substances in the known animal kingdom. Am I the only one who feels like it's being pushed for a reason, and possibly a negative one at that? I mean if time travel was possible, then could it be possible that all the positive research done on it could have been forged or fabricated to push the agenda more? Just a thought...Please give me your insight as well as your personal opinions on the matter.

       Yes it’s in your lungs, liver, and is released by your pineal gland in NDE and very heavy REM sleep, it’s in 1000s of plants and the only reason we aren’t affected by it is because we have enzymes or some shit in our stomach and intestines that are resistant to it

       Pretty organic development imo. 
About 7 years ago, it started becoming more popular among college students due to its ease of production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up until about 5 years ago, research on psychedelics was banned, so there is currently a resurgence in main stream culture that corresponds to the greater amount of study.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ketamine as well is making a resurgence due to the reopening of research as an antidepressant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joe Rogan has a good bit of influence on the popularity of dmt as well. Not really a fan of his methods of sensationalizing it, but it's definitely something worth talking about.

       Ketamine is also being used by medics in the military to calm down wounded soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was watching a documentary about golly green giants in Afghanistan a few months ago. They used it on a wounded GI that was in full freak out mode. I had to rewind the documentary to make sure I heard right when the medics called for dosing the patient with it.

       It's nothing new, it's just coming back into the mainstream now that they realize how powerful psychedelics are for healing. Listen to Michael Pollan's recent JRE guest appearance and pick up his recent book, it details how this research and push for re-legitimizing pyschedelic use has been happening in the background all along.

       This is a thing. The Catholic Church made moves to demonize marijuana and declared that wine would be the only communion acceptable. This happen in mid 1400’s if my memory serves me correctly. Which is rarely does bc I smoke. Jk

       There are SO many reasons but, mainly the internet and entertainment. People like Joe Rogan having people like Michael Pollan on and exposing millions of viewers (including other celebrities and influencers that listen and tell their fans) to this information. People just browsing YouTube stumbling upon a Terrence McKenna video will be exposed to it. Humans have been using psychedelics for a
       <em>
        long, long
       </em>
       time, only recently has humanity tried to lock them away and classify them as bad, what you're seeing is just a reintroduction or rediscovering of something that's always been here.

       <p>
        Archaeologists have provided fossil evidence that shows humans have used psychoactive
plants for 10,000 years during ritual ceremonies. Psychoactives were important in the
development of human society and there is historical evidence of cultural use over the
past 5,000 years (Merlin 2003). Dr Ronald Siegel (1989) suggests that the human urge to
intoxicate is so strong that it is the fourth most primal instinct after hunger, thirst and sex.
He argues that people all over the world have historically always used psychoactive
substances and that the desire to take mind-altering drugs is inherently programmed into
our biology as a natural drive. It has even been claimed that the psychoactive alkaloids
must have played a part in the evolution of consciousness

       there are a few articles on this sort of thing. Not all are DMT exactly, but one is, and if i look for more than 3 minutes I assure you I can find a pile more resources. If reading the evidence you demand is something you are into.

       It's Sorcery (pharmakeia).  Using it opens you up to be influenced by Lucifer's spiritual principalities and powers who will represent themselves as whatever wonderful nice thing you wan to see.  Aliens, higher self, ancestors, angels, spirit animals, Jesus, etc.  Whatever you want but they will be lying to you.  You have familiar spirits that know you better than you know yourself.

       Can you please elaborate on this?  What are these principalities you speak of?  Is it bad?  Why?

       I personally have 'blasted off' about 30+ times and have several times had the feeling that some of the entities I encountered didn't have my best interest in mind.  I wasn't sure if this was a reflection of my own psyche or what.  Your comment interests me and I'd love to hear more.

       Eph 6:12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
      </p>
      <p>
       2Co_11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically the spiritual realm is very real but right now where we are is kind of like the movie Escape from New York.  We are in a prison of sorts cut off from God and down here with us are many other fallen creations that are spirits.  There are no good spirits down here aside from the Holy Spirit of God which is only in saved believers of Paul's gospel of the uncircumcised (i'll explain below.)  The biggest and most powerful one being Lucifer/Satan (aka prince of the power of the air).
      </p>
      <p>
       Eph_2:2  Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
      </p>
      <p>
       He's got 1/3 of God's Angels to rebel with him and they all got kicked out of the 3rd heaven and now reside in the spiritual world here that we humans can't see without what the Bible calls Sorcery or Witchcraft.  Sorcery is basically psychedelic drugs (DMT, Iowaska, Salvia etc).  Lucifer runs this world (all insinuations such as education, Hollywood, media, religions etc he runs through spiritual control)  There are plenty of people here who have made a covenant with him for temporal power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 4:5  And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is also the small "g" god of this world.  He has been given control here and that's why it's such a mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       2Co_4:4  In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
      </p>
      <p>
       He deceives many into thinking he is actually God as well or some good guy trying to free us from a tyrant.  It's all lies.   So anyway, though his influence he makes everyone think Sorcery is throwing fireballs and Witchcraft is riding brooms.  It's all to discredit the King James Bible.  In reality Witchcraft is doing things like Astral Projecting or Meditation.  This allows you to exit your body and experience the spiritual realm but it's basically set up like Disneyland for us.  Their goal is to make it super awesome so they can tell us all sorts of lies about who we are and why we are here and to get you to come back for more.  That way more of them can have access to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mat 12:43  When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mat 12:44  Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mat 12:45  Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice men are homes for unclean spirits.  When you do these things you clear your mind out and allow these spirits to enter into you.  Their thoughts become your thoughts.  Ever just had a crazy thought and wonder "where did that come from?"  That's these spirits.  The more room you make the more will come in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucifer hates humanity because we were created to replace his rule after he fell.  He got us to fall and got his rule back for a time, but we have the chance to be redeemed by God and he doesn't.  He's going down with the ship and wants to take as many of us with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people who go deep into this stuff will eventually get the feeling you had.  Their goal will be to eventually torment you but they won't want you to know why.  The more you do it the more they will have access.  Many people end up thinking they are being gang-stalked by the government or any myriad of other things but it's just spiritual attacks from these devils (fallen angels and spirits).  All they want you to do is die without knowing who you are and how Jesus Christ is and what he did for you.  I'm going to paste a salvation message I've pre-typed up to explain that part to you.  Hopefully you have experienced enough to be able to repent and believe what is below.  I will be praying for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       -------
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single one of us are sinners and all good we do is nothing to God:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
      </p>
      <p>
       Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Repenting is just changing your mind about what you think of yourself, what you think of sin, what you think about God.
      </p>
      <p>
       2Co_7:10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law existed to expose what sin was and to show us that none of us can keep it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom 3:20  Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jas 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ is the Word of God who is God who came in the flesh:
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  Joh 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God.  Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.  Joh 1:14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ has the fulness of the Godhead bodily (Godhead is the real word, not the Catholic trinity)
      </p>
      <p>
       Col 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.  Col 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ the man is the son of God but his deity side is God the Father. He was both man and God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh_10:30  I and my Father are one.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is hard for us to understand but it is a GREAT MYSTERY. Nobody understands how God works or how he can be Jesus and the Father and the Holy Ghost and all that. Don't get caught up in it. He is God and he is the only God. Anyone claiming to understand exactly how it works is deceived or lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Ti_3:16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you need to do to be saved is repent and believe the Gospel which is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       The wages for sin is death but Jesus died for us and was resurrected to pay the price we owe:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ died the most horrible death you can imagine. He did this for YOU personally. He did all the work for you. His blood washes you clean. There is nothing you can do to save yourself. You can only be saved by believing the above gospel. Once you are saved you have Jesus Christ's perfect righteousness:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom 3:22  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a free gift from God. He saves you in the state you are right now. All religions lie about this part:
      </p>
      <p>
       Eph 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
      </p>
      <p>
       Eph 2:9  Not of works, lest any man should boast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply cry out to the Lord in the best way you know how telling him you understand all of this and you know what he did for you. Ask him to save you and if you are repentant and truly believe the gospel in your heart he will.  Then he will send you the Holy Spirit!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you are saved, you cannot lose your salvation in this dispensation. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise:
      </p>
      <p>
       Eph_4:30  And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
       God spiritually circumcises your soul from your flesh so when your flesh sins, it no longer pollutes your soul:
      </p>
      <p>
       Col 2:10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: Col 2:11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

       DMT isn't new, maybe more accessible. Hell you can get it in carts like wax from some people.  I feel like the first time I had it was around 2008 or so and it was everywhere at the time. I'm fairly certain it is also easy to make and most of the ingredients are legal.

       I used naphtha. Maybe it was just the tek I was using, but it made very feasible to accomplish. Just a painstaking process. So much so, that I have a jar of black sludge (my dmt jar) but no will power to extract any. I should, though.

       Naptha, that's it. Thanks. You're right about it being painstaking. It just seems too dangerous to atempt. But, who else can you trust except yohrself I guess. Glad you had success with it. When you've travelled on it, was it like an Astral Projection?

       DMT is organically produced by your Pineal Gland. Fluoride that is being added to our water and toothpaste is an agent that crystallized and hardens your Pineal Gland. which causes your brain to stop producing natural DMT. DMT also is produced in most (if not all) plants and animals. it is a chemical that gets you connected with your inner self. just like thc makes your use more of your brain and opens your mind to different things (creativity boost), DMT allows your brain to be aware of more stuff around you, be it physical, visual or emotional awareness. pineal gland is also referred to as the third eye. and DMT is one of the ways to activate it. DMT is not for recreational use tho. it is a very strong chemical that should be used only by those who are ready to experience and understand more about themselves and the reality they live in. it is not a social trip like weed or shrooms

       If you are interested in reading, there’s is a book called DMT: the Spirit Molecule. Talks about the government studies with DMT.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I recall, the experienced had some common threads such as seeing a white light, feeling at one with the universe, being abducted by aliens etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to time, don’t know about the time travel aspect but perhaps a phase shift.  DMT is released when we die. Could act as a door of sorts..
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the high is curious from a perspective of reaching a peak immediately and then coming out of it without a feeling of hangover or depletion.

       DMT is a technology designed to show us extraordinary, seemingly unbelievable, things. The "breakthrough" experiences involve a direct contact with a separate higher intelligence. I've had that experience myself, and you have to have it yourself to truly accept it, though two scientific studies have confirmed that these sort of claims are very common. Join us on

       I theorize that it’s because of the very popular Joe Rogan podcast, Joe has a massive following and talks about psychedelics and DMT as a way to enlighten yourself, I think this is all genuine because he seems to be independent of working for a corporation.

       CERN is something I feel is correlated with the emergence of dmt's mainstream popularity and I believe our history is being altered by the strings and fabrics of our own existences.
