<p>(-3)   SS: Recent sucides, many fishy connections, lots of connections to pizzagate, people saying they were related to NXIVM fallout. Kate Spade&#39;s husband goes out with a Rescuers mouse mask, Bourdain was dating a witch that was raped by Weinstein. Lots of weirdness. Tweets about pizza/ping pong.</p>

<p>Well, could have let this just die, right? thats what they wanted! But, with comments calling to <strong>get this to the front page</strong>, I thought shit, I&#39;m trying it again, and I&#39;m learning from my mistakes... r/conspiracy of all places needs to see this! </p>

<p>So here&#39;s a outline of the juicy stuff, and help me call out CTR trolls in the comments. It&#39;ll be so much fun, and with YOUR HELP, we can get this story out!</p>

<p>CONCLUSION:</p>

<p>After the arrest of Raniere in March (which fits our timeline), certain celebs got spooked and wanted to start talking to try to get ahead of this thing ‚Äì because Harvey wasn‚Äôt planning on talking then, himself (he still had AG Schneiderman in power as his protection). Sure, it‚Äôs probable that Bourdain did some horrible things ‚Äì but if you can make your deeds pale in comparison to someone really evil, you might still make it out alive.</p>

<p>Unless that really evil person catches wind of what you‚Äôre trying to do, and pulls a few strings, calls in a few last favors.</p>

<p>Yeah, to me, this is looking more and more like Harvey (or someone above him) has ordered some kind of hit squad.</p>

<p>Will we see more deaths? </p>

<p>Will there be more fallout from Raniere/Weinstein? </p>

<p>This kind of thinking actually stops any debate or real understanding from happening. Then you have situations where you are listening to someone explaining their claims of a conspiracy theory, putting your fingers in your ears and shaking your head going &quot;No, no, wrong, no.&quot; If you&#39;re going to be critical of it and help provide true understanding for those reading, why don&#39;t you address the points of proof made by the claim-maker and provide your own validity/proof to your claims. Burden of &quot;proof&quot; works both ways in the discourse to evaluate truth.</p>

<p>It is most likely a well done hair transplant. The very product he&#39;s posing with in that photo netted him ~165 million dollars. Who wouldn&#39;t buy one at that point?

    <div class="md"><p>It would be nice if the words were arranged into coherent sentences and paragraphs. Not only is this not written like a professional article, it&#39;s not even written at the level of a high school senior. Perhaps the author, &quot;Neon Revolt&quot;, could take a refresher on how to write an essay at the high school level. You know: <em>Write your thesis statement. Write the body. Write the main points. Write the subpoints. Write the introduction. Write the conclusion.</em> That kind of thing.</p>

<p>If this were a coherent article, instead of a collection of pictures and links, it might have paragraphs like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/174475373/">anonymous message</a> posted on the web site 4chan by a person who claimed to be a paralegal claimed that Anthony Bourdain&#39;s name &quot;came up on a list of NXIVM clients who asked for underage girls (ages 6-9) so he chose suicide.&quot; The anonymous poster did not provide any evidence to back up the claims, even when challenged by other commenters on the web site.</p>

<p>The anonymous poster stated that the name is &quot;on paperwork filed with the NY state attorneys office shared with Mr. Bourdain‚Äôs lawyers (who are lawyers representing the production studio who has a contract with him)&quot;. The anonymous poster did not explain how such a sensitive document, if it exists, came into the possession of the lawyers. The poster did not claim to have seen the document, but says that &quot;names rumored in our office so far&quot; include Roger Stone, the Bronfman sisters, Doug Rutnik, David Letterman, Jerry Seinfeld, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah, John McCain, Joe Biden. The poster also included old picture of Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, saying &quot;pic related&quot;, perhaps implying that one or both of them were on the list, but this was never clarified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, if you want to be understood and believed, you should state your thesis in as plain and explicit way as you can and clearly state what the evidence is. Otherwise, people will ask things like &quot;What supposed Musk connection?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL.</p>

<p>Write your own articles, if you don&#39;t like the specific style I&#39;ve chosen. Let&#39;s see how many people engage with your style of communication.</p>

<p>As it stands, I&#39;m doing the work of putting all this stuff together. And I&#39;ve chosen this style for a very specific reason; reasons you probably wouldn&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>Sure, I <em>could</em> write it all like a collegiate essay, and waste my audience&#39;s time meandering around the point and boring them to tears. I could puff up my verbiage and pretend that&#39;s somehow impressive. I could string sentence after sentence after run-on sentence together, all so that the common man would think I was erudite.</p>

<p>But nah. I&#39;m having so much more fun this way.</p>

<p>Peace, ya pompous pleb! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks. I totally forgot. Black nobility is linked to them by some independent researchers. Didn&#39;t check yet how valid this information is, but will at a later date.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the best proof I can offer of the existence of the Committee of 300 is the Rank Organization which, in conjunction with Eagle Star, IS THE BRITISH CROWN. It is also the black operations center of MI6 (SIS). Between them, these two Committee of 300 companies control Her Majesty‚Äôs Dominion of Canada, using the ‚Äúhofjuden‚Äù Bronfman family to carry out their orders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trizec Holdings, ostensibly owned by the Bronfman family, is in reality the main asset of the Queen of England‚Äôs in Canada. The entire Southeast Asian opium trade interfaces with the Bronfman empire and is one of the means whereby heroin is brought to America. In a sense, Canada is like Switzerland pristine snow-covered landscapes, big cities, a place of great beauty, but underneath lies a deep layer of filth and dirt arising from its massive heroin trade.</p>

<p>i think tying elon to this is the work of disinfo, we clearly saw a campaign against him ever since his trip to israel that did not go as israel wanted</p>

<p>and what he is doing is, i think, actually good and i have never caught a perv vibe off of him</p>

<p>what they want to get the story away from is all the pgate stuff about bourdaine, kate spade and mcqueen and rest of the wierdness, the rescuers mask, that all of these artists had the one eye thing and other symbology going on.  now that bourdain was pals with abramavich, i believe he could have been at some wild parties and seen things.   a chef, two designers, these are people who could have cooked and sewed for the parties...</p>

<p>bourdain may have said too much in these tweets, and he clearly said some things weinstein didn&#39;t like</p>

<p>yet in a thread like this the largest back and forth is about elon musk....mmhmmm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is the resistance you get for compiling evidence in a recent celebrity &quot;death.&quot;  Can you imagine what it&#39;s like trying to discuss much larger conspiracy topics like evolution, vaccines, fake history, etc?</p>

<p>Thanks for the post though, I really enjoy your way of dealing with CTR types or recruited posters or whatever we are allowed to call them now.</p>

<p>If you try to post about many actual serious conspiracies here the mods will join the non-serious posters and simply annihilate you - that is if they don&#39;t outright delete the thread or ban you for the outrageous crime of trying to talk about conspiracies in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>This was not an attempt to derail or change topics or anything sinister - just wanted to pay you a compliment and say there are surely countless more who are sick of the blatant censorship and non-genuine posters who are always turning this place into a shitshow.</p>

<p>Cheers and thanks for compiling, sharing, and caring :)</p>

<p>They <em>way</em> Anthony bourdain was so excited and even started getting aggravated when they weren‚Äôt handing him the heart fast enough to ensure it was still beating while he ate it... was strange to say the very least.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll answer this one. Not with inside knowledge, but with logic. The difference between you or I calling him a rapist is that AB was an actual insider. He would actually know things and know people that could be damaging. He was dating someone that was previously intimately close to Weinstein, who would know very specific details.</p>

<p>You and I and the billions of others are just people making comments. We don&#39;t &#39;know things&#39; and are no real threat regardless of what we say.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like AB was just some random person making the comments.</p>

<p>I have no idea. I am just some random person. Just using logic to answer your question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The piece of evidence that I found most interesting was Kate Spade&#39;s husband wearing <em>the Rescuers</em> mask.  If people aren&#39;t familiar with the Disney movie <em>the Rescuers</em>, here is a quick synopsis from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rescuers">wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the film is about the Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization headquartered in New York City and shadowing the United Nations, <strong>dedicated to helping abduction victims around the world at large</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I understand that people act irrationally when they are dealing with loss, I still find the use of the mask curious. </p>

<p>Pure Speculation:</p>

<p>Andy Spade is wearing the mask as a message to others.  He might be telling them that this is the reason for Kate&#39;s death.  If it is a message, then it could mean a lot of things to different people.  It could be a signal to warn others, or it could be a signal to threaten others.</p>

<p>As of now, I think it is a coincidence.  I think Andy Spade wanted to hide his face in public, and the mask was available for use.  Because he was not thinking clearly, he did not recognize that the mask would bring more attention to himself, instead of hiding him from others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good information. How the hell did you get past the submission statement? I been stuck there since. I like your findings.  I honestly don&#39;t think this guy committed suicide. I personally think that he was killed.  I don&#39;t believe in conspiracies I believe in facts.  My only reason to believing such is the simple fact that they announced his death to be suicide the minute they found him. Later they try to spin the story and state that they had done certain checks and there was a specialist who found no malice.  Also, there was so much weight on this guy.  I personally want to hear from Eric Ripert.  The media stated that he claims the past 5 days Bourdain was in a dark place. What does that mean? Was he in a dark mood? Was he locked up in some dark place and killed? Also, what if Eric Ripert was also involved. You just never know how people around you can be involved.  You are trying to go after the devil and the people around you associate with it. You have no knowledge and BAM you get killed.</p>

<p>I made a video simply raising the question and I been getting hit left and right by people on twitter for saying that is it a SUICIDE? or is it MURDER? crazy - Check out my link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwU0CervPeU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwU0CervPeU</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking at this and all the issues being brought forth. It reminds me of an old story I followed on reddit:  </p>

<p>[‚Äì]<a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/LawOfAttraction33"><strong>LawOfAttraction33</strong></a>[<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/">S</a>] 172 points 5 years ago </p>

<p>The head of the investigative committee, known as the Franklin Comittee, Gary Carodori, was also convinced of the rampant child abuse and was determined to bring perpetrators to justice. As a side note, you can view Caradori&#39;s interviews with the victims <a href="http://archive.org/details/GaryCaradoriInterviewsOfFranklinScandalVictims">here</a>. Early on in the investigation, Gary Caradori would meet an untimely death, during a flight on his way to Chicago to review new evidence. There was a scattered wreckage pattern, indicating that the plane broke apart in the air, and not upon impact <a href="http://franklincoverup.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;do_pdf=1&amp;amp;id=43">36, OMAHA WORLD HERALD</a>. The new head investigator would repeatedly lead the committee in the wrong direction, away from child abuse and satanic ritual claims. A state senator resigned from the investigative committee and said, ‚Äú&quot;I really don&#39;t think the things Larry King knew will ever be made public,‚Äù <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=141:king-expands-into-food-service-something-on-every-burner-jan-12-1985-&amp;amp;catid=6:news-articles&amp;amp;Itemid=14">38, OMAHA WORLD HERALD</a>. He also cited concerns about the change in leadership.</p>

<p>^^^ Once this guy &quot;Gary Carodori&quot; started digging into the pedo ring. He was basically found dead after a wreckage. What a coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The witch stuff is ludicrous, Asia is an actress, and AB is an actor more than a chef these days. They are both angsty, immature over-the-hill millionaire &quot;punks&quot;. It&#39;s clear why they got together, they&#39;re basically the same person. Anthony tried to &quot;marry up&quot; with his last wife, who came from an old money Roman family. It seems she just wanted a baby from him, and he just wanted an authentic European woman who appreciated good food and living, but there wasn&#39;t a real love connection. Then he met Asia and they compared tattoos and teenage-era musical preferences and it was ON. </p>

<p>Anyway I find many celebs have shallow personalities like this, and like to borrow from their roles to fill in their personalities. Asia&#39;s father directed only horror films, w witches often as the featured villain. Asia was in a film about witches, at least one that I can think of (Mother of Tears). imho her tattoos, his tattoos, both of them with their stereotypical aging punk aesthetic - they are clinging to the image and the image alone. Anthony, in those bloody pics, is only following the latest in chic &quot;underground&quot; food enthusiasm, which he probably imagines he is partially responsible for but really like I said he is just another shallow over-the-hill, fragile actor.</p>

<p>That said I think it&#39;s quite possible Weinstein had him killed, as a message to Asia if nothing deeper. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more along the lines of &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; and not jumping to conclusions so rapidly. The word pedo gets thrown around here and voat almost like &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;bigot&quot; on leftist forums. Let&#39;s not split hairs here, what we are researching here is a pedophilic system of control over the worlds governments and institutions. Nonetheless, one shouldn&#39;t say people are defending pedos (which hasn&#39;t been proven) when they&#39;re just questioning the tactics of &quot;researchers.&quot; Guilt by association and confirmation bias aren&#39;t productive. People should be looking for clues, connections and possible evidence of wrongdoing not just making assumptions and claiming anyone who critiques or outright disagrees with the truth about what&#39;s being discovered is a pedo defender. I found the old p gate sub on its 6th day and I&#39;ve been following p gate through the franklin scandal for years so I know there is a lot of truth in these horrible discoveries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tony tweeted that ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt fun‚Äù being on the receiving end of Hillary‚Äôs cronies. To understand why the Clintons have a reputation on the right as secretive schemers, and on the left as victims of vindictive witch hunts, you have to know a thing or two about the Whitewater scandal. He also was all over Michael Cohen who has mob connections. Bourdain tweet: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd tweet but I‚Äôm waiting for a FAX with my instructions from the Deep State‚Äù. His Twitter is full of harsh remarks on very powerful people. I could see any of these people wanting to shut him up. Russia was the one country where a guest on Tony‚Äôs show was shot to death for having an opinion (Nemtsov). Bourdain‚Äôs tweets were under a microscope since they get millions of tweet impressions, yet he didn‚Äôt watch what he tweeted.. he even said ‚ÄúI forget sometimes that I‚Äôm not just like anybody else tweeting over breakfast...‚Äù I‚Äôm all for free speech and not censoring oneself but you can‚Äôt say things like he says when you‚Äôre that famous. It‚Äôs risky. I think he was murdered and it was an easy suicide coverup because of Bourdain‚Äôs dark past. Oh he probably relapsed <em>insert old interviews talking about drug problem</em>, or his girlfriend was cheating on him and he was heartbroken! <em>insert paparazzi photos</em> or maybe, you paranoid, ignorant-to-the-mental-Health-Crisis idiot, maybe he just wanted out of this shitty life. Ok, so let‚Äôs say that the media reports are true and he did hang himself with the intention of ending his life, riddle me this: WHY were the initial announcements of his sudden passing immediately issued as ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù? Eric Ripert, his best friend, walks into the room and finds his body hanging, and how does he know his intention? It could‚Äôve been an accidental fatality. Someone could‚Äôve planted him in that position. But no, this information is irrelevant because despite the absence of suicide note, there is lack of evidence that he intended to take his own life. No investigation either! Case was closed quickly. No one but the deceased would know if suicide was the goal. Some homicides are wrongly reported as suicide until further investigation. How do you know he wasn‚Äôt drugged and hung by someone else? </p>

<p>but similar lines. Books Weinstein was holding: &quot;Rodgers/Hammerstein&quot; (casting couch), &quot;Kazan&quot; (witch-hunt, #MeToo is a witch-hunt, by literal witches), black book (list of names to be punished) are key. May need to refine my theory in light of your neonrevolt article tho. Cheers.</p>

<p>Apologies, should have been more clear.  The story was not that bourdain was going to expose paedos, but that he was a paedo client of nexivm and was exposed by the investigation.  The other narrative from CDAN is that he was murdered as a warning to his GF that was a rape victim of and is now fighting Harvey Weinstein.</p>

<p>Witches and satanist are known for rituals involving eating human meat.. and taking beating hearts out of people.. they are also known for pedophilia and ritual child abuse.   </p>

<p>They <em>way</em> Anthony bourdain was so excited and even started getting aggravated when they weren‚Äôt handing him the heart fast enough to ensure it was still beating while he ate it... was strange to say the very least.  </p>

<p>It just lends to my point that Anthony bourdain was a character on television that only allowed us to see what he wanted us to see.  </p>

<p>Was he a pedo... I have no idea, and will probably never know.. but to assume he wasn‚Äôt based on the personality portrayed on television, is foolish.<br/>
He‚Äôs an actor... his show was good, but scripted and edited.<br/>
