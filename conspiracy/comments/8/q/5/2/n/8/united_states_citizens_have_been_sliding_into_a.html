       do also consider people building their own businesses from scratch, and proceeding to achieve millionaire status. Supposedly, this same scenario has increased many times in China and of course many other industrial izing nations. It's not impossible to achieve advanced socioeconomic levels, starting from relatively nothing. Yes, the fed is fucked, but some are 'allowed' success to mollify the hopes and dreams of dullards and gluttons.

       Just looking at the graph you posted, there was fluctuation in the 1970's during the period of oil shocks, but the trends really cut away from each other in the early 80's -- and there was no oil shock then to explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you look at the wages versus productivity graph, you will see a similar phenomenon -- the separation of the trends in the early 1980's.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what happened in the early 1980's?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ronald Reagan squeezed the money supply, causing the worst post-war unemployment to this day, gave giant tax cuts to the rich while increasing taxes on most everyone else, expanded deregulated international trade, permitted consolidation of industries and especially the media, and deregulated much else including massive bank deregulation.

       WTF is up with the food prices? Clearly inflation is in play, but its ridiculous what it costs to get a few days worth of groceries now, and almost everyone I know hasn't had a raise in years.

       Minimum wage should be keeping up with inflation. It was made to make sure every American had a living wage. There were no issues back in the 70s when a person could work a summer job to pay for college. Buy a house when they got married at 23. And own a car and feed their family and have disposable income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buying power has been going down for over a decade with no minimum wage increase. Blaming it on minimum wage is silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       People making minimum wage spend 100% of their money. Most of it into local economies. Creating more jobs and increasing consumer spending. This is demonstrated like 70 times the minimum wage has increased. Its not minimum wage thats causing the issues

       Just cut everyone a basic income check and let them figure out how to get housing.  If the government is providing housing then they'll be sure to find a way to fuck it up.  Like how rent control distorts neighborhoods and prevents development.

       The horrendous decline caused by privatisation of public services is an issue we are currently facing in the UK. We look across the pond and see what's happened with capitalism getting its ugly claws into what should be basic civil services, and panic. Our awful conservative government going through our already strained NHS firing half the staff who are already understaffed, then selling the hospitals and trusts off to their friends in the industry for profit. It's disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the kind of soft-socialism that's popular in Europe is something abhorred by a lot of Americans, but I am so glad I live in a country (Scotland) where our sub-parliament is resistant to these sorts of things. Our parliament is struggling hard to try to keep public amenities like healthcare, education and such like free at point of use and kept in the public/civil sector. In terms of quality and accessibility this is a much better way, at least as it works here, but while our governments are controlled by money-grabbing, green-eyed monsters, these privileges we enjoy are at risk. On your side of the pond and ours.

       Remember Tenet Healthcare around 2004 when the news broke that their hospitals across the country were performing completely unnecessary surgeries.  Tenet's stock fell almost overnight to $2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, Tenet's doing a-okay now and their stock is back up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often wondered if former CIA Director George Tenet (who was CIA director at the time of 9/11) was related to Tenet Healthcare in any way.  I mean Unnecessary Surgeries....Unnecessary Wars.

       I have heard arguments that there really has been little economic growth in the US since 1975. Instead, they have created mechanisms like 401(k)s, illegal immigration, oligopolistic price fixing, bailouts, and war to transfer wealth from the lower classes to the wealthy.

       I would say a large part of this is the push for everyone to attend universities and approving everyone's loans. It raises tuition and floods the market with degrees lowering wages for college graduates.

       It doesn't necessarily have to increase tuition. Here in Scotland anybody who wants to get a degree and is capable of the entrance requirements can go to university. Higher education is seen as a human right to us, and the government will pay for your tuition fees, and depending on parental income give you a bursary for living costs and stuff on top of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason, I can't understand why even though yes, the huge numbers of graduates and not enough jobs issue is common here too, it could be considered a bad thing. Universal Higher Education is important for a modern, forward-moving society.

       Also a 4 year degree could net you $80,000 in debt and cost you 4 years of making a full time salary. Even if out of school you make $10 an hour more, which is a bit higher than average, you will have less than someone with their highschool diploma for 10+ years.

       Also people are terrible with their time and money. Few are skeptical, thrifty and strategic. Most are easily deceived and have superficial understanding of business and markets. Pedagogy has not aimed to teach people that they live in crony-capitalism. If everyone had understanding of their true environment, from a young age, they would be empowered to unite and take on their masters.

       Cooperation always produces better outcomes than competition, Nash showed this with his work on the prisoner's dilemma.  That's why the rich use it and go to such extreme lengths to prevent poor people from joining together to advocate for their common interests.

       It's due to Marxism and trickled down capitalism that been taken over by politicians and bureaucrats who are paid of by mega corporations and big banks. If we lived in a true democratic capitalistic state we wouldn't be taxed, competition would always be in full swing, innovation would always be promoted, but when big banks got involved which our founding fathers were against that's when it went down hill. Marxism and trickled down capitalism took over. Capitalism is great if done right and by the right people who understand what it is intended and how our founding fathers intended capitalism to be in the US, but sadly it isn't and it has been taken advantage of.

       Obama came into office. Healthcare costs were going ever high to where people couldn't afford them and the same was happening with predatory student loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of fixing the collusion in healthcare and pharma price gouging problem Obama and his admin basically subsidized the out of control costs through the insurance side. He was effectively trying to decrease bankruptcies and defaults on the over priced bills using tax money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of fixing the predatory student loan lending the Obama admin jumped on the band wagon to make a profit too.While at the same time removing regulation, oversight, and  bankruptcy protections.
