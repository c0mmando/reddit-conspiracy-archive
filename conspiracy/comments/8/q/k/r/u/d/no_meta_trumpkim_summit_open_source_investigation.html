<hr/>

<p>I would like to have a [No Meta] thread for the US/NK Summit. We have a full spectrum of information sources being pumped into our heads and it would be nice to have a thread focused on the details of what we are seeing from all perspectives.</p>

<p>To start, here are the four components of the agreement outlined in the document:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new U.S.-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean peninsula.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/12/17452624/trump-kim-summit-transcript-press-conference-full-text">Summit Press Conference full text</a></p>

<p>Detracting Forces:</p>

<p>Detractors argue this <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/dont-meet-with-kim/">legitimizes NK</a>. I&#39;m not sure whom it legitimizes it to or what the practical impact of that is. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-kim-conclude-historic-summit-in-singapore-live-updates-today-2018-06-12-live-updates/">The rhetoric used to reach this point was inappropriate</a>. Does this matter?</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/aW3bF">Ceasing of war games</a>
&quot;I don&#39;t quite understand why Trump felt the need to stop the war games,&quot; a senior fellow at the Asia Society&#39;s Center on U.S.-China Relations. &quot;They are something that shows U.S. resolve in the region, not only to North Korea but also more importantly to China. And it seems like there&#39;s this whole idea of Trump as this great negotiator and yet he gave up one of the most important cards we have in the region, seemingly for free. So I think I am baffled by that and I am baffled by a lot of things that came out of Trump&#39;s mouth.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/06/12/daily-202-in-kim-he-trusts-trump-sounds-naive-after-meeting-north-korea-s-leader/5b1f1bbf30fb04775d8813c9/?utm_term=.96890a3eb60b">Whining and pretending it&#39;s news..</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180612000961">South Korean Detractors</a> - Are they detractors because they haven&#39;t seen progress and would change their minds if they did or do they have something to lose?</p>

<p>Is there a legitimate fear of Kim not following through? If so, is the assumption that he is buying more time to grow more lethal? </p>

<p>What is the required time and process to denuclearize? Here are <a href="http://foreignpolicyi.org/north-korea-denuclearization-step-by-step-process/">one</a>, <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-05-04/what-it-will-take-denuclearize-north-korea">two</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/trump-and-north-korea-are-using-different-definitions-of-denuclearization.html">three</a>, different perspectives. I have a feeling I won&#39;t be the only one working to understand this topic better at a technical level. </p>

<p>For the next leg of this wild ride, Bibi is dropping Trump off on Iran&#39;s front doorstep. <a href="https://archive.is/7xgLv">Israeli Intel: Trump&#39;s Pressure on Iran Working Better Than Expected</a></p>

<p>All of these points are on topic for this thread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is NK knows something we don&#39;t, there is no way, no way that he would quickly change his stance quickly, something is going on there, there is few theory, one of which the collapse of his mountain, NK lost all his nuclear power and now playing the peace card and still make us believe to have strong firepower which is really plausible because he would needs to lift some bans in order to acquire some materials to restart his program.</p>

<p>My second theory however, I remember that before Un change his stance, he met with Russia and China so I guess they discussed something and shared with NK. To be honest these day the strongest weapon is not nuclear missile anymore it is cyberweapon, this is the future of war as a specialist of IT Security I can confirm you that in future war would be conduct via cyber attack and cyber defense. And there is no secret that NK has strong hacker and such and they also have spies all around the globe too...</p>

<p>These are my personal observation and theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too think that NKs nuclear program is beyond repair after the mountain collapse.  The Chinese finally putting UNs sanctions on NK destroyed what&#39;s left of their economy to the point of collapse and now NK is going to play the denuclearization card on the US so we heavily withdrawal our position in the korean peninsula and take some heat off china.  Then china will ease up on NK.  China doesn&#39;t want a country full of starved disease ridden illiterate north koreans flooding their borders so they wont let the country collapse.  This is all about reducing the USs position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s another theory, but your theory looks flawed for me because it raises more question for me, first of all in my head the POTUS has zero power, it been runs behind by the same power since JFK went down. So I don&#39;t see why NK would change stance since the game remained the same in US, and for SK, NK never ever saw them as a threat, they see them as a victims of US imperialism, their vision and propaganda is to save South Korea from NK, again I don&#39;t see why NK would care who were in power in SK since they didn&#39;t recognize their authority (because for them it was planted by USA). Again I don&#39;t see why Trump election would change anything, I am pretty sure it doesn&#39;t matter who would be the president, I think the scenario would be the same if Clinton was elected too, since the radical change doesn&#39;t see to be impacted by current state of sanction or US relations. I stand by my own theory for that, I too though the same as yours but I decided to go with these more tangible (in my head) theories.   </p>

<p>I disagree entirely here, and it seems your theory hinges on this statement being true. The power of the executive office has been increased with every passing administration over the past 30 years. IMO the office of the presidency has more power than people realize, and this is why Trumps victory caused such a shitstorm among TPTB, <em>he was never supposed to win</em>.</p>

<p>I think that depends on what you consider TPTBs goals ultimately are: to maintain the status quo, or to accelerate us towards armageddon?</p>

<p>If you subscribe to the latter, then Trump is, and has been the perfect catalyst to sow discord within America and between the US and its allies, pulling us out of the Iran deal, installing corporate figures in positions of power who have destructive intentions towards the institutions they are supposed to be running (DeVos, Pruitt, Pai, Perry etc), State Department hallowed out, withdraw from Paris accord, repeal of Wallstreet regulations, allowing for Russia to continue its fuckery, etc.</p>

<p>If their intentions are to maintain the status quo, then Trump was a huge screwup and Clinton should have won most likely as she was a pretty hardcore establishment politician whos business interests were obvious.</p>

The &quot;war games&quot; are a total bullshit pissing contest, the US doesn&#39;t have to show any &quot;resolve&quot; in the region, the US is the greatest military power in the world, it has the biggest dick and will gladly whip it out to any country that chooses to challenge it. </p>

<p>What ending the war games does, (and let&#39;s be honest, they are merely put on hold and all Trump has to do is snap his fingers to put them back on), is to put the pressure on NK and KJU to play ball. It&#39;s makes the US look reasonable and willing to work with NK. If KJU doesn&#39;t follow through with the agreement he opens himself and his country up to the wrath of the US which will then have all kinds of justification to move in on them. </p>

<p>That said, what bothers me the most about the reactions I&#39;m hearing from the mainstream media and people in general is that there is a hypocritical and idiotic skeptesism about the summit and the results. Clearly progress has been made, more progress than has ever been made and all people can do is shit all over it? Does this make sense? Shouldn&#39;t the US, it&#39;s people and media be rallying behind the President? Jimmy Carter was canonized a saint for opening relations with China so why doesn&#39;t Trump deserve the benefit of the doubt and the support of his people? </p>

<p>SUCCESS is the biggest &quot;FUCK YOU&quot;, so what if this summit actually works? It&#39;s such a crazy time that it would not surprise me in the least bit if it all pans out for the better of both countries. What I can&#39;t tolerate is this stupid blanket opposition without anyone offering a better resolution. The US has tried the usual diplomatic tactics for decades to no avail and with no progress. The meeting alone between the two leaders was extraordinary. Think about what Trump did only weeks ago by &quot; cancelling &quot; the meeting. Did the tactic work? Yes it did because the RESULT is the only thing that matters and the result was a positive one. The BAD PEOPLE will want to sabotage the efforts of the summit, but ultimately it&#39;s success is the success of both countries. </p>

<p>If Trump can get NK to denuclearise while securing a lasting peace agreement it would be one of the greatest accomplishments of any president in modern history. Think about Trumps ego,  you think he doesn&#39;t know that? Of course he does. </p>

<p>North Korea already agreed on terms of denuclearization over a month ago with South Korea. I guess you can argue that this summit may be &quot;extra motivation&quot; for North Korea.</p>

<p>Are you aware that Mike Pompeo is the current US Secretary of State? Back in the first week of April he secretly met with Kim Jong Un when he was still the Director of the CIA. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/17/politics/mike-pompeo-kim-jong-un-visit/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/17/politics/mike-pompeo-kim-jong-un-visit/index.html</a></p>

<p>The NK / SK summit happened on April 27th. </p>

<p>Since then he has made another visit to NK on May 8th to secure the release of three detained Americans among other things. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pompeo-heads-to-north-korea-for-second-visit-as-anticipation-builds-over-trumps-summit-with-kim-jong-un/2018/05/08/796eea12-52de-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html?utm_term=.c972ac4536ab">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pompeo-heads-to-north-korea-for-second-visit-as-anticipation-builds-over-trumps-summit-with-kim-jong-un/2018/05/08/796eea12-52de-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html?utm_term=.c972ac4536ab</a></p>

<p>All these meetings and others we don&#39;t know about have contributed to the NK SK summit/peace agreements and the NK US summit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a lot of the media that I&#39;ve been reading about Trump and Korea and that, the worry isn&#39;t about progress or the lack of it, but how cheaply it came to America. A lot of these things that Trump is doing, while arguably good, come with strangely little tangible benefit to the US. </p>

<p>With North Korea, the meetings between South and North, and this Singapore summit have essentially spread peace, hastened denuclearization, and ensured the removal of US troops from the Korean peninsular. All things that both Korea&#39;s want, and all things they would have paid good money and trade for. But there&#39;s no promise for increased trade and no guarantee of any benefits to the US except for the soft power aspect of increasing peace. If Trump had only said: &quot;<em>We&#39;ll withdraw all troops now, but you need to build a factory that makes buttons of my face and you give them to me for free</em>&quot; NK would have build that factory and given the US this tangible product for free. Instead, the US is probably going to bring it&#39;s troops home and there&#39;s the idea that trade will probably increase in the future, because that&#39;s what the global trading system will ensure. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a similar story with the US embassy. Israel would have paid good money and other benefits for the US to move that embassy. Instead Trump just moves it, and there&#39;s no promise of any tangible benefit, except the soft power that the US will accrue. </p>

<p>And with China. Trump could easily have demanded a change to the intellectual copyright laws in China, and Xi would have agreed to it. But instead he just gives in when China agrees to a slight increase of the trade deficit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a similar story with the Iran deal, the renegotiation of NAFTA, the trouble at the G7 and his desire to let Russia join again, his attacks on France and Germany, his involvement in Syria. It&#39;s not that he&#39;s acting badly, it&#39;s that he&#39;s acting without much thought to the real tangible benefits coming to the US that he could easily have negotiated within any of these engagements. </p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t like Trump, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a Russian asset. I think he&#39;s just not very good at making deals and I think this Korea situation has really shown this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that there is nothing more tangible than peace. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but it sounds like what you ate saying is that the United is not profiting from bringing peace to the region and a eliminating the greatest threat to a global nuclear war? Hmmmm. So Donald Trump has made a bad deal? The US could have secured some really great trade deals? </p>

<p>Well, I would argue that you can&#39;t put a price on peace. It would cost the US and the rest of the world everything if a nuclear war would be started over some stupid misunderstanding or communication. That said, if money and financial benefit is your main concern, I would say that the dealmaking has only begun. It&#39;s to the benefit of both NK and SK to secure good trade relations with one of the wealthiest countries in the world, the US, and I think KJU will be much more open to agreeing to US favorable terms after he&#39;s sat courtside at an NBA a game and fucked a few good old American blond haired blue eyed cheerleaders. Obviously the old way of &quot; doing business&quot; between countries has its benefits but is it the only way? I think the events of the past few days clearly shows its not. As far as the G7 summit and how Trump has handled that situation, I don&#39;t think those deals are done quite yet. Call me crazy but I don&#39;t think it will be long before North Korea is littered with good old American institutions like McDonalds &amp; Walmart and I bet the plans for the Pyongyang Trump Tower have already been drawn up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peace itself is fairly intangible, but has tangible effects; effects which in terms of this peace, won&#39;t affect the US as much as regional actors; China, Russia, Australia, Japan, and others. Profits from this peace will come to these countries first, then their regional blocs and then to places like the US. In terms of soft power Trump will benefit right away, and should probably win the Nobel Peace Prize or something, but that can only extend so far.</p>

<p>Just because you can&#39;t put a price on peace doesn&#39;t mean that Trump can&#39;t. He has put a price on peace. And his price is really cheap in the grand scheme of things. He is promising to withdraw US troops from Korea. That&#39;s his price. He wanted to remove troops as soon as he could, and now he has the perfect opportunity and impetus. There was no dealmaking, and further deals in the future are going to swamped by China. Their Belt-&#39;n-Road initiative will dwarf anything the US can offer, and will only be emboldened by peace in the peninsular. </p>

<p>Money, finance and trade isn&#39;t my only concern or worry, but we live in a globalized world and countries need to their relationships effect each other. Trump has given this peace so cheaply that it seems as if &quot;business&quot; wasn&#39;t actually &quot;done&quot; at all. </p>

<p>With this Singapore summit Trump has seemed to take things away from Japan and South Korea and gave peace to North Korea, and all in pursuit of achieving his campaign promise of bringing US troops home, and not any grand economic or financial plan. Likewise he&#39;s threatened to end trade with all his allies, Canada, The EU, and India in the last few days; not because of a grand plan, but because of some cheap campaign promises that hes stuck on. </p>

<p>To be fair, i Think this is a good thing, I just think that he doesn&#39;t have a plan, doesn&#39;t know how to make deals with other countries, and is giving away all of this stuff very very cheaply. </p>

<p>It is a good thing, and you seem to think it happened easily and out of nowhere. That is not the case, surface-level perceptions can be very deceiving. This deal is done, the war is over. Kim crossed into South Korea, people seem to be dropping that little fact in to the memory hole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is an ELE?</p>

<p>But it has been cheap. With Obama the Kims brought fire and bombs and demanded peace at the point of their crappy missiles. Obama didn&#39;t give that to them because that was all they demanded and all they were offering. </p>

<p>Trump is offered the same and he takes it. </p>

<p>NK are offering nothing now that they weren&#39;t offering 25 years ago. </p>

<p>The War is over, and that is a good thing, but it owes more to South Korea than to the US. The US turnaround has come quickly and with such little precedence that insiders in the military are shocked. Clinton, Bush, and Obama were holding out for better terms to the deal, and they never got offered them. Trump was offered shitty terms with no deal and he took as soon as he could. </p>

<p>To be clear, I&#39;m trying to talk more about this Singapore summit than any other bi or multi lateral meeting with these players.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>North Korean summit...trade wars and coal and the future of North Korea&#39;s mineral resources exports.</p>

<p>Who stands to lose the most? Australia.</p>

<p>In the last 5 years North Korea&#39;s coal exports have dropped from 1.34 billion to 403 million..(sanctions)</p>

<p>Australia tops the list of coal exporters by a huge margin.</p>

<p>Understanding the dynamics of future North Korean exports of mineral wealth is the key to understanding this whole situation.</p>

<p>South Korea stands to gain alot by the unification through its geography...(shipping)</p>

<p>North Korea stands to gain alot through lifting of sanctions, energy grid infrastructure and the wealth from trillions in mineral resources.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s getting what is the question...</p>

<p>Which countries are going to get the energy grid contracts? Mining contracts? Export contracts? Personnel training contracts?</p>

<p>Will Kim give the US important contracts knowing that the CIA is famous for infiltrating countries using mining company employees as fronts for their spies? It&#39;s an important question...and could very likely be a huge sticking point when it comes to these deals.</p>

<p>What will the dynamics be for Russia and China? What about the EU?</p>

<p>If Kim is serious about reunification with South Korea (a very strong possibility when factoring in Moon) then there are numerous countries that view the lifting of sanctions as a threat to their future wealth...and numerous countries that view the lifting of sanctions as a blessing.</p>

<p>Figure out those dynamics and you&#39;ll have a good idea of who will try to sabotage the whole thing...and who will do everything they can to make it happen.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this..what would actually happen if North Korea ever launched a nuclear missile on another country?</p>

<p>Ask yourself this...how is North Korea going to solve their energy grid problem? Nuclear reactors? Doubtful at this point. Look at Iran...</p>

<p>Ask yourself this...why is the EU so committed to the Iran deal? Is it because they believe it negates a nuclear threat? Or is it because of the trade dynamics...here&#39;s an interesting graph...</p>

<p>When Trump says he&#39;s willing to forego trade with allies what&#39;s the message he&#39;s sending? Remember, this means NATO...so the whole NATO agreement of who foots the bill is on the table when this is discussed.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some serious dynamics at play here. </p>

<p>Right now I see know reason why Kim and Moon don&#39;t understand how much their countries have to gain by unification. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to look at North Korean news (insofar as it is possible in English). From what I’ve been able to gather, the NK propaganda revolves around these points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There shall absolutely be no “normalization” nor “assimilation”. North Korea shall stay North Korea.</p></li>
<li><p>“Be vigilant, be on your guards”, the USA cannot be trusted. North Koreans were to prepare for the eventuality that Kim might get killed while in Singapore (or for an invasion/coup while he was away).</p></li>
<li><p>This proves/vindicates the fact NK was correct in acquiring nuclear weapons. Such discussions wouldn’t have happened otherwise.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also the “chess game” that Kim “won” against Trump is being made a great deal of (has this been covered in Western propaganda, or only North Korean?).</p>

<p>Of course, the following tidbits are missing from all sides:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>NK can thank Israel for its “nuclear program” (as can Iran btw.). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8gdiad/why_isnt_the_media_mentioning_the_obvious/dybbhhi/?context=3">See this</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The East vs West dialectic, i.e. the USA vs China “strategy of tension” is fake and scripted. Hence the “Korean conflict” is similarly orchestrated/phoney. See <a href="http://jewishjournal.com/news/world/179731/">this</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale-China_Association">this</a>.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Due to the increasingly bankrupt U.S Corporation Trump and the US military are simply asking themselves how they&#39;re going to draw down the military without losing face in the region. Many pundits are asking why Trump would give away our long-standing practice of military war games around Korea including Keith bogue CBC Washington correspondent. Trump is blunt as usual quote we&#39;re going to save a lot of money. But the administration also makes it seem like he&#39;s got a big win here.  whatever it is it&#39;s a dramatic change of posture from the United States and the Koreans are simply reacting and acting the way they always have hoping for reunification. When has the president ever said let&#39;s draw down the military operations to save a lot of money. The military industrial complex has fully shat the bed and all are allies particularly Israel are wondering if they can rely on American Military protection anymore. This is really only a bad thing if you support American imperialist aggression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listened to Ben Shapiro (radio) last night, and he definitely sounded like a voice of reason, in comparison to Fox News (on one side) and CNN (on the other).  </p>

<p>He says that the deal that Trump gave is basically like an advance from a publisher for writing a book.  They give you cash as incentive for you to work on the book and get it to a state that it can be published.  When royalties begin coming in, they first go towards paying off the advance before you get to keep any for yourself.  Trump has given DPRK a pretty nice advance.  If they follow through, then Trump will have accomplished something amazing that previous administrations were unable to do.  But, there&#39;s always the chance that DPRK may completely backstab us, and given how bad they have been at honoring agreements in the past, this is a very real possibility.</p>

<p><strong>In defense of Trump:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rhetoric</strong>: The rhetoric used by Trump earlier was called foolish by many in the media, but it was the stepping stone to this process.  When Reagan wrote his famous &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall&quot; speech, even his own advisers told him to take that line out.  But in both the case of Reagan, and now with the case of Trump, that rhetoric was exactly what was necessary to move things forward.  </p>

<p><strong>Human Rights</strong>: The critics of Trump are angry that he is giving Kim this opportunity, considering the human rights violations in that country.  These same people (CNN, et al.) were saying that Trump needed a more diplomatic tone back in January based on his &quot;My nuclear button is bigger&quot; tweet.  Now they are saying he is too soft.  These critics should not be taken seriously.  They have no intention of being a fair critic, they just want to find fault everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Trump&#39;s mistakes:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Current Rhetoric</strong>: After comparing Trump favorably with Reagan, it is only fair to show the contrast also.  Reagan famously said <em>Trust But Verify</em>.  Even though he gave Gorbachev opportunities that other presidents had not, he did not claim victory immediately, or tell us that we could all sleep easy now.  In contrast, Trump has tweeted that <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1006837823469735936">&quot;There is no longer a nuclear threat&quot;</a>.  This is presumptive.  No missiles have been destroyed yet, and DPRK is not trustworthy to keep their promises.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>

<p>DPRK media (Korean Central News Agency) has stated that the agreement guarantees complete de-nuclearization on both sides.  We are not going to completely de-nuclearize.  We would be mad to do so.  </p>

<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>

<p>This is not the boondoggle suggested by <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Y2g2mis.jpg">images like this</a> posted in <a href="/r/politicalhumor">/r/politicalhumor</a>. Things will be done.  Likewise memes like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8qnts9/i_didnt_make_this_but_i_laughed/">this</a> in t_d are not entirely showing the situation fairly.  </p>
