        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Actress Rose McGowan has been accused of cocaine possession, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/06/11/rose-mcgowan-indicted-on-cocaine-charges-says-harvey-weinstein-may-be-behind-it.html">Fox News reports</a>. She faces up to a year in jail if found guilty. She has pleaded innocent.</p>

<p>Rose McGowan claims she has been set up. She believes, she says, that the supporters of a certain Mr Harvey Weinstein have planted the substance in her possession to make her look guilty. The cocaine was allegedly found in her wallet, which had gone missing and was found by airline staff. Rose McGowan claims the wallet went missing when she was flying to Washington DC.</p>

<p>This is fascinating. And the thing is, she could be telling the truth. I’m sure the case will be thoroughly investigated first. Anyway, I wish her the best of luck. She’s going to need it.</p>

The fact that it went missing also makes it suspicious, but she&#39;s an actress so nobody will bat an eyelash cuz of course they all do blow. This definitely looks like a set up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if she uses cocaine, it doesn’t negate the fact that she’s been doing some good work pointing out flaws and abuses in society.

    <div class="md"><p>You know, it is so usual for guilty parties to cry ‘conspiracy’ that I almost don’t believe her. But part of me thinks, ‘hey, what if she’s telling the truth?’ She could be.  I guess there’ll have to be an investigation. Then, hopefully, the truth will come out. Harvey Weinstein has been accused not only of sexual predation, but of omnipresence too. It’s a little weird in a way. Like is there nothing the guy can’t do, according to his enemies?</p>

I spoke from experience in regarding to gravitating towards a substance when your mind has a paradigm shift.<br/>
The truth coming would be nice, but who runs the investigations, who can be trusted, how do we know evidence and information are not being tampered with. Open up a can of worms and you gotta b ready for the dirt that comes with it.  </p>
