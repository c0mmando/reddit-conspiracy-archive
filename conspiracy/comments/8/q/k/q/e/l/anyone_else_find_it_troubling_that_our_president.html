<p>I mean, I am not a fan of the G7, where the richest countries come together to decide things for the entire world, nor am I particularly a fan of Merkel, Trudeau, definitely not a fan of Theresa May, etc. But to pretend that they are just as legitimate as &quot;so-called&quot; dictators, who rule their countries by putting people into work camps or having them killed by firing squads? Really? You think Theresa May - who again IS AWFUL - shouldn&#39;t be treated better than the leader of North Korea? <strong>REALLY</strong></p>

<p>President makes a pathway to peace and no nuclear weapons as well as Korean unification </p>

<p>You react by claiming its a shady business deal with dictators </p>

<p>You know: trump has been accused of being a sleazy shady business man
You know: the most well known dictator is Hitler
You claim: we&#39;ve betrayed our allied </p>

<p>So lets ready again, I find it troubling that our sleazy shady businessman president is doing business with Hitler. </p>

<p>Is it that far removed from what we&#39;ve seen every other major paper blasting? I&#39;m surprised the word appeasement wasn&#39;t included in your title to further illustrate your point. I don&#39;t need to speak for you, you spoke yourself. </p>

<p>You made the title, you came here and defended your position I am talking about nothing other than than the title and what is implying directly and indirectly. You are framing him as an enemy for no other reason than the fact that he established a pathway for peace. </p>

<p>Please sir, further explain your title if this is not your sentiment. I&#39;m already fully aware that both the content and context of the title are not of your original creation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually refrained from referencing President Trump&#39;s business dealings and also the nuclear summit in this title.  That is beside the point.

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t refrain from anything. I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re backtracking about what you wanted to do with this text thread. Why? Stop it. Just admit that it&#39;s your view point that peace is a negative thing in this context because it&#39;s Trump. I&#39;m sure you can go to CNN and find a pretty large list of why. They&#39;ve dedicated quite sometime to finding every single piece of what ifs there. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t uncomfortable for me to come here and say &quot;hey peace is a good thing I am glad we have a President who is moving this forward&quot;. We don&#39;t consume the same types of media, because I don&#39;t consume media. This implies I am being fed the information. I&#39;d much rather look at everything, analyze and come to my own conclusions and if need be defend them here logically. </p>

<p>You however? Your tone isn&#39;t even the same as your title. You sentence structure hasn&#39;t once even been close to it. Those little observations of mine aside you keep going for some subtle jab about my intelligence without actually making it. (puzzling to me). I think you believe that by playing this grey line of &quot;maybe I said that, maybe I didn&#39;t&quot; you&#39;ll accomplish your task of confusing people enough that they&#39;ll see peace and think betrayal. </p>

Hasn&#39;t the US been installing dictators in countries? I find it a little weird for OP to complain about legitimizing a king in essence when all our Islamic allies in the middle East are lead by Kings. </p>

<p>Criticizing a guy for helping two nations broker a peace is just hating the guy for who he is not what he&#39;s doing (there&#39;s plenty of reasons to criticize Trump, this isn&#39;t one).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate Netanyahu and especially how he treats American politicians/presidents as little trick poodles he can control (or else), but comparing him with a true dictator, like Kim, is really not on. He&#39;s back by the democratic system of Israel in everything he does - which, if anything, makes the crimes in Palestine almost worst, as so many people allow them to happen and vote in politicians who will continue the genocide.</p>

<p>So I get your point, but Netanyahu and Kim are not very alike. They&#39;re both awful and destructive in their own unique ways.</p>
