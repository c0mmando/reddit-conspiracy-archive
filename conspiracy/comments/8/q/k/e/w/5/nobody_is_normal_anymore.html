    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right. I kinda always thought that a lot of social media, specifically Facebook, was a way for many people to pretend they are still &quot;cool&quot; after highschool. 
Especially seeing as how so many people are obsessed with posting about how much fun they are having every night. Like if you don&#39;t post it to Facebook, it didn&#39;t actually happen. That and the daily/hourly selfie that&#39;s the exact same as all the other ones they&#39;ve previously posted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, it&#39;s become a social dick measuring contest. The people who are into it the most are the most deeply unhappy I feel. </p>

<p>I was shocked to hear recently that people actually fake vacations on social media. Like, they&#39;ll go to Mexico and take 200 photos but only post half and post the rest later on and act like they went on another trip, when really they just ordered a pizza and watched GoT like everyone else that weekend. It&#39;s pathetic and I really do feel bad for someone who will go to those lengths to seem like their life is more spectacular and glamorous than it really is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I&#39;ve never heard of anyone going as far as faking a vacation. It really is sad though. I&#39;d have to imagine the person would be unhappy and probably has some mental issues with needing the attention or approval from others.</p>

<p>What times we live in. I truly hope the social media dick measuring dies out one day soon. Social media would be a lot better of places to be on to just keep in touch with family or friends. The way it is now is just unbearable to use. Well, aside from Reddit and a couple other &quot;discussion&quot; based forums.  </p>

<p>This world wants to be childish in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the &quot;real&quot; world, and to conceal the fact that true childishness is everywhere - that it is that of the adults themselves who come here to act the child in order to foster illusions as to their real childishness.</p>
