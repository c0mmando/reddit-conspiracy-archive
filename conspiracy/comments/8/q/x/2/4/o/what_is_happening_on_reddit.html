    <div class="md"><p>Just my personal opinion, but over the years have noticed if you say literally anything that doesn&#39;t flow with what&#39;s currently popular and accepted, the down votes will rain down upon you.</p>

<p>Things that will always get you upvotes</p>

<p>Cats, Hillary is good, Trump is bad, repost of a meme that already made it to the frontpage but is politically correct and has a more thought out title. Many more but these are sure fire karma.</p>

<p>But I totally think the up vote down vote system is being used to censor at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you completely on this. I find a lot of people are presumptious as well, rather then asking someone what they mean exactly or their reasons behind what they said, they will jsut go trigger happy with down votes to censor them as well.</p>

Dear, reddit
We need to go ahead and shut down any real political discussions or theorizing that occur on your website. Shutting it down outright will create outrage, so make it happen in a way that might seem organic.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve done nothing right in the past few years, and I don&#39;t see them suddenly reverting to how it was 5 years ago, so like Facebook, they&#39;ll probably push me into canceling my account with their shitty changes.</p>

<p>Do you find yourself slowly NOT wanting to visit these forums? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I&#39;ve just started thinking that. When I first used forums like reddit, there was just constant amazing conversation, discussion and enlightenment. It slowly started to sour in the early teens, and then in 2016 it became that it was literally nearly impossible to have a remotely fruitful conversation. Just pure unadulterated ugliness.</p>

<p>For a long time I assumed it was oriented around just a few controlled subjects, but it&#39;s starting to become clear that it&#39;s the whole platform of online community that they&#39;re destroying. Their henchmen believe it&#39;s about tearing down the hubristic Babylonian tower of Globalism. The people who are actually paying to do it however are just trying to prevent the People from organizing and retaking the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit a real person. I&#39;m a visitor here. This is exactly what is happening over at /pol/. I&#39;ve picked up on this specifically - they respond to you in an attempt to make you feel like you&#39;re wasting your time by using the site. If they&#39;re bots, they&#39;re damn lifelike and can bypass captcha which is terrifying. If they&#39;re human, they&#39;ve got so much money behind this that it&#39;s horrific. I&#39;m not sure which possibility is worse. I believe it&#39;s a combination of both - many proxy &#39;accounts&#39; being posted by a single user who rapidly switches between them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just now browsing all (ya I know) I realised the beautiful simplicity of it.</p>

<p>They are making Reddit more dumb.  Intelligent people won&#39;t want to visit.  Anyone who stays is filling their mind with divisive, idiotic trash.</p>

<p>Think about it.  Reddit 10 years ago was like the pre-revolutionary American pubs and alehouses.  Smart minds coming together eventually forming the basis of major change.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t have those forums existing, now can we?</p>
