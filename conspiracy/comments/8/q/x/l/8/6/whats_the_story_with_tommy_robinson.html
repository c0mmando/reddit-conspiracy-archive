    <div class="md"><p>He was trying to bring attention to the so called grooming gang epidemic in the U.K. Basically young men of the Islamic faith are systematically coercing and forcing girls as young as 11 to have sex with them. Tommy was a lone journalist out side of the court house while multiple young men were undergoing trials for their sex crimes. apparently in the U.K. Journalists can be bared from reporting on a trial before the proceedings are finished and the gag order is lifted. Tommy thinks there is a serious lack of coverage for what he considers an epidemic. The U.K. . So he defied the gag order and reported on these sex crimes and gets arrested in the process. He sentenced
To 13 months in less than 12 hours and is currently in a Muslim majority prison where he will undoubtedly face violence for being a journalist who doesn&#39;t bend over for the government. </p>

<p>Robinson was found to be in contempt of court, and he violated his previous suspended sentence. </p>

<p>This article also mentions the retrial that may have been caused by Robinson&#39;s shite actions: <a href="http://theconversation.com/tommy-robinson-the-martyr-how-the-far-right-builds-its-victim-narrative-98261">http://theconversation.com/tommy-robinson-the-martyr-how-the-far-right-builds-its-victim-narrative-98261</a>      </p>

<p>Robinson is an expert at being the victim and y&#39;all are playing right into it because it fulfills your masturbatory fantasy of hating muslims AND being persecuted. Robinson quote from his book:     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the whole place was going to gang up on me and that I would come off as the victim … it was exactly as I wanted it to go”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is a far-right wackjob, who isn&#39;t a journalist, and represents barely anyone. </p>

<p>Last year he filmed and &quot;reported&quot; from outside of a court where a trial was in session. In the UK this is illegal, because there is the fear that it will derail the trial and the defendants will be sent free. He was bringing attention to the accused, which could influence their standing in the court and is against our idea of &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot;, he was bring more attention to witnesses, which could influence their testimony  or cause them to drop out of the trial which would set the defendants free, and he was showing the lawyers for both sides, which is fucking stupid because anyone could have found them and attacked them or ruined their impartiality. In the UK there is a period of time where no one can report directly on a trial that is happening so it is allowed to run its course. The people in that trial were guilty, but his attention could have meant they were set free. He was arrested and given a suspended sentence which meant that if he broke the law again he would go directly to jail without much of a trial if he plead guilty. </p>

<p>Then this year he filmed and &quot;reported&quot; from outside of a court where a trial was in session. Police arrested him, <em>as they would arrest anyone who was filming outside of a court where a trial was in session</em>. He immediately went to jail and plead guilty, so because of the terms of his suspended sentence he went to prison. </p>

<p>I think he was being retarded for the way that he did it, but the issue he was trying to report on is an important one. The problem is that he was jeopardizing the trial, and if there are any problems with a trial the defendants will be set free. He&#39;s a fucking idiot and it&#39;s important to note that he isn&#39;t a journalist, and this has nothing to do with free speech. </p>

<p>If I didn&#39;t know better, I would say he was a plant in order to paint the &#39;far-right&#39; as racist wank-rags.</p>

<p>Not only did he break the law, ruin the terms of his probation but he also went AGAINST the will of the people by trying to record in a court house. You just don&#39;t do that in this country and get away with it.</p>

<p>Of course, the fucking muppets have taken it that the UK is trying to cover up crimes of immigrants, it is and it has, but this is not the way we do things.</p>

<p>I hope you get bummed in jail you fucking cock sucker. You&#39;ve pushed the immigrant debate back by ten years and split the right in half. Now everybody is a stereotype blaming Muslims for the ban on &#39;free speech&#39;.</p>
