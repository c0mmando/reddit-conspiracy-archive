<ol>
<li>Earth is not flat, but a spinning ball.</li>
<li>Earth is a flat stationary plane.</li>

<p>If 1 is true, obviously people will see it as a Psy op and argue against flat earth.</p>

<p>But what if 2 is true? Simple, shills will act like 1 is true and flood message boards attacking flat earth truthers.</p>

<p>The question is, how can you truly know without a shadow of a doubt? You can&#39;t. Most of us aren&#39;t in NASA, so knowing if they&#39;re lying is a trust issue, nothing more, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Measuring the temperature of moonlight is the simplest and cheapest I&#39;ve found so far.</p>

<p>Moonlight has cooling properties in the same way sunlight has heating properties.  At night during a full moon (or within a couple days of a full moon), put a thermometer in the moonlight and one in the shade.  The one in the light will read cooler every time.  You can prove it&#39;s a property of the light by using a magnifying glass.  When you focus the light, it will become even colder.</p>

<p>Total cost of experiment - about $10-20.</p>

<p>In the heliocentric model, they claim that the moon merely reflects the light of the Sun - which is obviously not true due to the existence of Selenelions - this even happened in 2014 but no one seemed to notice or care.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t directly address the flat and motionless earth, but it proves that the heliocentric model is wrong.</p>

<p>If you want to up the budget a bit you can get a nice zoom camera and start investigating the limits to our line of sight and you can prove that the math they give us for the radius and size of the earth is totally wrong as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t - I&#39;ve read it many times.  The lens in my experiment intensifies the cooling effect of the light - it doesn&#39;t block &quot;radiative cooling&quot; and cause warmer temperatures like wikipedia claims.</p>

<p>The lens in the experiment proves this explanation is total bunk.  Anyone can do this to prove it to themselves or whoever else for less than $20 when the moon is near full.  Thanks for playing :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical of very bad attitude and previous attempts to provoke me.  I don&#39;t owe you anything and you are not in charge of this conversation.  In fact, you have no power here.</p>

<p>I just wanted to post about an experiment that I&#39;ve done dozens of times that proves that moonlight is cooling, and people always show up to try to bash me and claim it&#39;s all &quot;radiative cooling&quot; every single time I do.  It&#39;s hilarious, predictable, and I generally feel sorry for people like you that feel like they have to do this sort of thing - for whatever reason.  I pity you.</p>

<p>But you don&#39;t have the power to upset me - I&#39;ve been through too many times.  I know it&#39;s not personal :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to get in an argument with you because that would be pointless.  If you read into seismic waves on a deeper level then an internet article, you&#39;ll learn that they are not as simple as wave from point A travels to point B on the globe where a measuring device is.  They need to be compiled from various sources and only then, can the source roughly be determined.  Of those multitude of seismic waves (there are several types) only a very small percentage go through the Earth&#39;s core, most are lost at a depth of around 400-600km.  The waves that do make it through the core, can almost be written off as anomalous.  They aren&#39;t and there is a good argument that they are travelling through something, but it is far from definitive answer.  If you read into seismology properly you&#39;ll see that it is full of assumptions, contradictions, and not at all conclusive.  </p>

<p>So while the Earth <strong>may</strong> have a solid core.  It is nowhere near scientific fact.  Ten years ago they taught every school kid it has a core of molten iron, which is impossible because magnetism is lost at those temperatures.  Now here you are claiming with utter certainty that the core is solid, which if it truly was the case, it would mean almost all seismic waves would pass through it.  </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is modern humanity has no fucking clue what is going on beneath the surface of our world.  And attitudes like yours, blind support of theories you don&#39;t properly understand, is part of a very serious problem of fanatical and dogmatic scientific notions.</p>

<p><em>Above the Curie point we do not have ferromagnetism. However, we can have a magnetic field above the Curie point. A straight copper wire that has electric current running through it has a magnetic field around it, even though copper is not ferromagnetic.</em></p>

<p><em>The magnetic field of the earth is caused by a macroscopic electric current, analogous to the magnetic field generated by a hollow solenoid. There is a bistable electric current at the equator of the earth and in the molten core that causes the magnetic field of the earth.</em></p>

<p>That would have an impact of weather patterns and have an effect on the orbits of satellites neither of which we observe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP&#39;s view of humanity is deeply infantilizing. Of course you can know the shape of the earth, with a very high degree of certainty.</p>

<p>To start with, I&#39;d recommend looking into pre-calculus, especially trigonometry. This will allow you to tackle issues that come up with angles and circles, which will better equip you for trying to rigorously test claims made by both camps. It would really help if you got comfortable with the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/trig-equations-and-identities-precalc/inverse-trig-functions-precalc/v/inverse-trig-functions-arctan">arc-tangent function</a>, but basically all of trigonometry will help you immensely.</p>

<p>However, with just the arc-tangent, you can certainly rule out the earth being flat. Every flat earth model I&#39;ve seen puts the sun orbiting in a circle above the earth, somewhere in the tropics. Well, you can use the angle to the sun and the distance to the tropics to calculate the altitude.</p>

<p>Once you have the altitude, try to calculate how far away it&#39;d have to be to get 10 degrees above the horizon. Do it again for 5 degrees.  Then 2, 1 and 1/2 a degree. You&#39;ll quickly realize the sun would have to get tens, even hundreds of thousands of miles away for perspective to make it look like it&#39;s getting close to the horizon.</p>

<p>Educate yourself on things like mathematics, and you&#39;ll be equipping yourself to tackle these kinds of problems without having to take anyone else&#39;s word for it. You&#39;ll be able to check yourself, and see if these things add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are other possibilities - I&#39;ve come up with at least two theories myself but only one of them is relatively plausible. I&#39;ve even seen others with videos saying basically the same thing as my second theory.</p>

<p>It could be a geocentric stationary ball that seems flat from our perspective because flat earth map occupies such a small portion of the surface that it is literally almost flat - the rate of curvature would be much less than what we are told (explaining why flat-earthers think it is flat.) Something on the order of 0.25 inches per sq. mi. instead of 8. In this scenario the Earth would be about 1.5 million miles diameter (and we would occupy an area of the surface that spans only 25,000 miles of this - surrounded by &quot;Antarctica&quot; on all sides.)</p>

<p>The whole globe is frozen over except for the habitable portions. An &#39;alien ant farm&#39; where there could be an untold number of other habitable zones that we would be oblivious to.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>how can you truly know without a shadow of a doubt?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To answer your question - the way we would know would be by accurately measuring the curvature of the Earth we inhabit (assuming this curvature is uniform over a globe Earth.)</p>

<p>This should not be difficult to accomplish - it would only take some relatively sophisticated equipment on a stationary mount. Shine a beam over a span of one mile onto a precise target and measure the discrepancy. The rest is just math to get the observed curvature.</p>

<p>For example if you measured a discrepancy of 0.25 inches over one mile then the true size of the Earth would be aroun 1,500,000 miles diameter.</p>

<p>I am actually surprised nobody has done this yet.</p>
