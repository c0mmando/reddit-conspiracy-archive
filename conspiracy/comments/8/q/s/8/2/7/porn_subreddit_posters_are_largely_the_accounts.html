    <div class="md"><p>Why is there so much free porn? I would hesitate to say that it&#39;s because that&#39;s the way to maximize profits. It&#39;s a remarkably effective tool for pushing ideas into the collective consciousness. Look at the rise of incest porn. So much role-playing about moms, &quot;daddy&quot; videos, etc... And not the type of &#39;daddy&#39; they were talking about a few decades ago when that was common slang and used more to signify a general dominant male figure but actual fathers. That shit is gross and doesn&#39;t come about naturally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>great comment</p>

<p>the rise of taboo kinks and weird fetishes go hand in hand with destroying a people from the inside out</p>

<p>why come in with a group of terrorists when you can instead upload porn to americans to get them to destroy themselves and their personal relationships to woman through weird sexual vices and grips. Look im not kink shaming here but yeah I agree with your comment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cuckolding goes hand in hand with this. It&#39;s almost always a white guy being cuckolded by a black guy. How much do you have to hate yourself to enjoy that shit? How much self doubt do you have to have about your own masculinity to outsource making love to your partner? I believe the entire idea of cuckolding entering into the mainstream is to create that self doubt if it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>&quot;This is normal. You don&#39;t measure up. Just give in to it.&quot;</p>

<p>I understand what you mean by not &quot;kink shaming&quot; but it&#39;s important that in our quest for tolerance we don&#39;t lose our ability to objectively analyze the cause or effects of every action we can undertake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s disgusting. I hate that kink more than anything. I pity but am also angry at cuckolds. It&#39;s hard not to view someone who views themselves with such disgust with the same amount of disgust. Don&#39;t get mad at me for looking at you with empathetic disgust when you willingly admit to viewing yourself as a worthless piece of shit. It doesn&#39;t even stem from hate. It stems from wanting to grab them by shoulders and shake some self respect into them. I wished they had someone who would shake them out of their self loathing. We all need help sometimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even the notion of transgenderism came from Weimar Germany. That was a seriously fucked up place. Hitler came to power for any number of reasons but one was the absolute depravity that German society had fallen into. One of the dangers of a completely subjective moral structure is that you create a directionless people. People crave direction. </p>

<p>I believe in the r/K selection theory of politics but I think not everyone fits into this mold. Social engineering can steer the in-betweeners. Left leaning people don&#39;t subscribe to hierarchical structures naturally. This is the core problem with communism in that their safeguards against subversives consolidating power are laughably naive. It will always result in authoritarianism and a state with complete control. Sometimes it ends up with someone like Stalin, sometimes Hitler, but it&#39;s always someone who knows how to steer people. </p>

<p>The left in it&#39;s current manifestation is full of people who don&#39;t understand they&#39;re creating what they fear the most. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t normally like VT but here goes. <a href="https://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/09/24/sexual-decadence-weimar-germany/">https://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/09/24/sexual-decadence-weimar-germany/</a></p>

<p>Ignore the topic of Jewish involvement in it because that&#39;s not the topic at hand. I just gave this link because it goes into a ton of different sources on the absolute depravity going on in Berlin because Germany was so poor. Here&#39;s a few highlights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mel Gordon writes: “One French journalist, Jean Galtier-Boissière, described, in sickly pornographic detail, the creeping horror of feeling a nine-year-old girl’s tiny, but proficient, fingers stroking his upper thigh while the broken-toothed mother covered his face with hot sucking kisses.</p>

<p>He was then escorted to a cubicle where his “medicine” awaited him: a 12-year-old redhead. (9) Telephone-girls (often billed as “virgins”): expensive child prostitutes (ages 12-17) ordered by telephone like a takeaway meal; the nymphettes were delivered by limousine or taxi. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t find a source for this one right now but one author I read spoke of a sex act performed on stage performed by an entire nuclear family that would make the Aristocrats joke look take while Weimar officers sat in the crowd with underage boys on their laps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easier to placate your natural reproductive desires than to improve yourself to the point that someone chooses to be with you or to direct that energy elsewhere. Masturbation is one thing but moderation is key. Many incels probably wouldn&#39;t be that way if someone had ever given them some tough love and taught them that self improvement is an attainable goal. Our society places so much value on the here and now, the short term reward over the more solid long term ones that come from a strong bond with a partner. </p>

<p>While I&#39;m not trying to judge people who don&#39;t choose a monogamous, long term lifestyle with one partner I fear that the benefits it can provide are not only downplayed but seen as old fashioned. I can only speak for my personal experience but I&#39;ve found that the longer I have been with my wife the more I only have eyes for her. I&#39;m not trying to get sentimental but I&#39;d be with her a million times over instead of with any combination of other women. The faults she sees in herself I don&#39;t see and it&#39;s not because of a lack of options. The longer we&#39;re together the stronger that feeling gets. I fear that people who grow up viewing sex as a purely physical phenomenon and divorce as something always on the table will not be able to create that same bond. And I&#39;m not religious so I&#39;m not coming from a moral angle, just a pragmatic one. I understand people will disagree.</p>

<p>And no, my wife doesn&#39;t look at my Reddit account, nor am I the type to kiss her ass lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant that very pragmatically. Let me try to put it another way... Why is there the option to pay for online porn when there are quite literally millions of hours of it available for free? Put yet another way... There is the option to actually send money to Pornhub... what does one get in return for that money that one does not get from the millions of already free videos on Pornhub?</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not that I&#39;m thinking you personally have the answer or that there is an answer, so I guess it is more of a philosophical question.</p>

<p>Although to be honest, there&#39;s not a ton of variety to the content even when its nominally different.  It really is the same thing over and over again.</p>

<p>Maybe better streaming quality (bandwidth, video resolution, etc)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess in my attempt to answer I went off in an only halfway related tangent. I was rambling a bit about the mindset one would have to be in to be that consumed by porn to send them money. Looking at Pornhub right now and it looks like the only benefit is some of the locked content and 1080p video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was intrigued by this line of thinking so I did some additional research and it looks like the porn smorgasbord of the last 5 years is a calculated move on the part of Pornhub to put some people out of business. So they might be doing it at a loss and really making all their money from ad revenue. </p>

<p>I mean their bandwidth alone must be insane. Of course, maybe their reward is in the work itself...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great point. People like to explain this with &quot;advertising dollars&quot; but the big names who spend the most on advertising don&#39;t typically advertise on porn, because it doesn&#39;t make their name look good. The ad revenue is probably a lot of money but simply can&#39;t be enough to have funded and supported the earthshakingly enormous amount of porn there is being made and hosted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>RIGHT?? It&#39;s not like the ads they show before a porn video are for Call of Duty Black Ops 4 or Dr. Shoals foot powder. They are for other porn-related things that are completely optional to buy.</p>

<p>And yet billions of dollars go into porn every single year. It boggles the mind. I have to think that right there is almost proof enough that it is some kind of societal weapon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not too into that sort of explanation myself, though I&#39;m not claiming you&#39;re wrong. I&#39;ve just always looked at it like it being a huge physical drain but your body knows you&#39;re lying to it. You didn&#39;t really fulfill the biological imperative. Thus, Fapper&#39;s Regret, which in and of itself is incredibly depressing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you all don&#39;t know how the business is run.</p>

<p>A lot of random ass-hats take girls with issues and make money off them doing videos.</p>

<p>Then when a girl becomes famous, guys can pay to either watch her live, or be with her for real.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sick and a twisted place we live. But there is a lot you are all leaving out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not some big group. The group y&#39;all thinking of was behind the VHS to DVD press.</p>

<p>Once the internet came into play, those businesses became a &quot;niche&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s disgusting. I hate that kink more than anything. I pity but am also angry at cuckolds. It&#39;s hard not to view someone who views themselves with such disgust with the same amount of disgust. Don&#39;t get mad at me for looking at you with empathetic disgust when you willingly admit to viewing yourself as a worthless piece of shit. It doesn&#39;t even stem from hate. It stems from wanting to grab them by shoulders and shake some self respect into them. I wished they had someone who would shake them out of their self loathing. We all need help sometimes. </p>
