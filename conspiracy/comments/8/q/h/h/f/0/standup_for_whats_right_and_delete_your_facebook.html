        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Almost five years ago my wife and I deleted our Facebook Accounts and it was one of the best decisions we ever made. People used to think we were crazy for deleting our accounts. They just couldn’t see living a day without it. Unfortunately we both got caught up in some drama so we just decided we were both better off without Facebook. For us it actually made our relationship so much better. I’m not sitting here saying that everyone gets caught up in drama, and I also agree that some people can utilize their accounts for positive things; like keeping up with family or even running a business. I totally get it and I see how Facebook can be a great platform for the masses, but what mark and his team at Facebook have been doing is illegal. Everyone has an option to keep their accounts “private” or “not private.” (I can’t remember the exact settings but I think I’m pretty close) So when Facebook sells a users information after giving that same user the right to privacy, Facebook has broken the law, haven’t they? I’m just some guy up too late but I wish the remaining Account Holders with Facebook would get pissed off, because they should be, and delete their accounts. This nerd has made more than enough money, not only by just advertisement revenue, but too from stealing your personal information and selling that too! Don’t believe the B.S. you keep hearing about how because you setup an account that your information is fair game. We were all tricked into believing when we hit that “set to private” option that our personal information would remain private and it’s been proven several different times that this just isn’t the case. I hope this strikes a cord with you and pisses you off because it should. Trust me, you’ll be fine if you delete your account and probably be much happier. My wife and I did it and haven’t missed Facebook one bit. DELETE YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still have mine for a few reasons. 
1. All my army friends are on there and always a few years in time someone will me like hey you in wherever still I&#39;ll be there lets meet up, it&#39;s easier to keep track of someone on facebook then there phone number as they move around all the time 
2. I only use facebook for that, so I litterally have nothing to hide, I don&#39;t let them have my phone number or anything like that
3. Even if they could track everything I did, I still have nothing to hide. I am a spec of data among millions, it&#39;s not like omg look at this dude we just tracked him at mcdonalds, so what?
4. People think deleting facebook solves the problem, where they are a small portion of the problem. Deleting it is like throwing pebbles at a tank, you can do it but in the overall scheme of things it doesn&#39;t do shit. Every single other company takes our data.
5. We are getting more and more technological, the more we get rid of things and replace it with tech, the more we get tracked. Soon everyone will need a chip or card to do anything. You go eat, scan, you go on a train scan, everywhere will be monitored by cameras and such. It&#39;s going to happen, people are going to want it to happen because convenience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you disagree with Facebook and their data harvesting, or do not like to have the capability to read about everyones life, then delete (+ save if you want) all your posts/photos/messages that you are able to, then delete your account. Create a fresh alt account with fake info solely to keep with all the events. It is unfortunate that local events are so tied in with facebook, but thats the way it is generally, though do check out the alternative web resources that might be able in your area. Keep in contact with friends via phone/email or other IM/voice services.</p>

Post about your chewed gum collection, your new job and home in another state, your timeshare in the Caribbean, your aboriginal dance lessons, your failed date with a blind Scientologist.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I don&#39;t really see the point in deleting Facebook.  In my opinion, you are either on the grid or off it.  For those who want to pull the plug and get off the grid - I agree wholeheartedly and respect their decision.  I&#39;m too involved in working/parenting/life&#39;ing to make such a big move, but I&#39;m keeping it in the realm of possibilities.</p>

<p>But Facebook, Reddit, Google, Yahoo, your bank, your electric company - all that shit has your information.  I respect people who don&#39;t want to be on Facebook because they aren&#39;t enticed by the pull of social media - but if it&#39;s for privacy reasons, that ship has sailed.  Thinking that staying off Facebook will somehow save you (and your info) is naive in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>although i have deleted my account long ago, i sometimes wonder if all this anti-facebook talk going on is exactly what they want. show the masses how it doesn’t work and keep us disconnected from eachother. the worst thing to happen to tptb is having the whole world connected. they will put an end to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont use it for anything expect messenger (which u can use without a FB account now) and just never did anything on it. I basically deleted mine without actually doing it, but since I keep hearing how FB is taking data and selling it, I just did it. Too bad I still use insta. At least now employers can&#39;t look at my social media I guess.</p>

They are the same scum who create all the problems for everyone in their mindless self indulgence. From people who use microsoft products and buy apple goods and do business with amazon as I was stores all over shut down and hear them whine about income inequality.</p>

<p>Fuck everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was suggested to me by an ex-spook.  Don&#39;t delete your facebook or social media accounts, just fill them with nonsense.  Sign up of things and/or join groups that you have nothing to do with.  Misdirection is greater than concealment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got put in Facebook jail for 30 days for posting a meme that didnt even get reported. Facebook just picked up on it. I made a fake account with a fake name just to let my friends know I wouldnt be on. It&#39;s been a nice break honestly. People, me included, get so sucked into Facebook we dont care what they&#39;re doing. We don&#39;t care what we agree to. It just sucks because people in my circle dont want to text. They want to use messenger. So i dont hear from many people any more.</p>

Well you just agreed to let them use your camera.
