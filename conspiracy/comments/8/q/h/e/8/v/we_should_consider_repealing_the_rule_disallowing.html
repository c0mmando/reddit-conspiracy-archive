        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The reasoning I have seen is that we have the rule to promote civility and if we were to allow it to be used, then shills would just call real users shills and we&#39;d devolve into a shill screaming match. I would argue that this is not the case, so long as the majority of users are real, which is true for this sub. Take a look at /pol/ on 4chan: They allow any and all name calling, including the accusation of shilling, and it works very well. Yes there are examples of shills calling real users shills and sometimes it can detract from discussion, but by and large it has developed into a system wherein the users&#39; intuition has triumphed and it is pitifully obvious when an imposter, whether JIDF, ADL, or other shill teams, tries to turn it back onto genuine, organic users. </p>

<p>We are hobbling ourselves through fear, mod bros. If we became a free-speech sub dedicated to uncovering conspiracies without the censorship and limitations now self-inforced upon us, I guarantee that we could increase our impact and ability to work together, as counter-intuitive as that might seem at first glance. </p>

<p>And please don&#39;t misconstrue this as an attack on the moderation team. I know a few of you well and there are some truly good guys among your numbers who genuinely desire to make this sub better. </p>

<p>He who wishes to take control of the world and acts upon it,
I can see that he will not succeed.</p>

<p>For the world is a divine vessel,</p>

<p>It cannot be acted upon as one wish.</p>

<p>He who acts on it fails.</p>

<p>He who holds on to it loses.</p>

<p>Therefore some things move forward while some follow behind.</p>

<p>Some try to warm with exhaled air while some try to blow it cold.</p>

<p>Some are strong while some are weak.</p>

<p>Some are successfully accomplished while some are declined and failed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen shill hunts go pretty poorly in the past.</p>

<p>There was a user here who sent suspected shills pm&#39;s with an IP logger. The logger was getting hits from Amazon&#39;s cloud servers and the user took that as meaning shills were using Amazon as a VPN, they posted it and it really took off. </p>

<p>However the user didn&#39;t properly test this, as even fresh accounts who didn&#39;t view the message were apparently having their IP&#39;s logged. I tested this and so did other users. The hysteria was over a link checker. </p>

<p>So yeah, after seeing shill hunts like that in the past I don&#39;t have much faith in future ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny story, that same user came back with a new account (after that one was banned) and started posting in a very politically partisan subreddit trying to organize brigades. The brigades would pose as left-leaning users and spam a bunch of subreddits with political comments.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/UCcER">https://imgur.com/a/UCcER</a></p>

<p>That account was banned as well, along with the new one they used after that. I wonder if they ever went through with those brigades though. It sure would be easy to hide any topic you don&#39;t like by brigading it yourself in the most obvious way possible and then letting the mods shut it all down. I wonder if that user is still around? He always used these silly, rhyming usernames so it should be pretty easy to recognize them... </p>
