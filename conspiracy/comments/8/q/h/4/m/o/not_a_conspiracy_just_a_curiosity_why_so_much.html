    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree in principle, although profitibility seems like only one element of a larger effort which does seem to be supported by a huge range of private industries and public institutions and their representatives.. </p>

<p>It may indeed be indulgent and shortsighted to answer everything as symptoms of the grand conspiracy, especially as interests will demonstrably conflict amongst these groups, but it depends on one&#39;s views regarding the actual authenticity of the various representatives, and whether or not one can accept, that perhaps there&#39;s a case where people in the appropriate positions are in fact, prepared and comfortable to sustain apparent disadvantage, as the grand conspiracy is proceeding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it as Money being the key motivation, as Money = Power and all humans (more so men) strive for Power. I believe the rest is incidental. </p>

<p>Games have to be played to gain money, that&#39;s the only reason those games are played. It isn&#39;t to screw over the working man or to rob the poor or deceive nations, that has to happen to gain money. If money was gained through love, growth and unity, then that&#39;s what the world would be like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay yeah I can agree that more often than not, be it the &#39;long game&#39; or the &#39;short game&#39;, it could just be about money. Very likely preserving it, increasing it, applying it surgically to furthering the opportunity to obtain even more.. Sure.</p>

<p>However, we need a definition, and we need to measure the parameters, of the &quot;games&quot;, as you say. This is where &#39;conspiracy&#39; is inserted, as you know. Nothing more, nothing less. It&#39;s just a way to describe what actors are doing to further their interests.</p>

<p>So if there&#39;s a long game underway, then it&#39;s not exactly certain that profitibility is the immediate objective. It could be social change first, with the end goal being profitibility... For example, destruction of a country through conflict, and then obtaining monopolies over the industries that would rebuild said country. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just not clear how far along in to the process of pursuing the Endgame, that one is stepping in and starting to analyse and make conclusions on what it&#39;s all being carried out for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no problem. </p>

<p>I still think ideology, be it religious or political is an element for some conspiracy angles, but definitely the higher entities, whoever they are, probably ancient aristocracy or something, aren&#39;t particularly plagued by belief systems. I think they&#39;re more creative than to be bogged down by rigidly believing in anything that confines them to predictable steps. And they don&#39;t exactly need money.. So.. it&#39;s pretty hard to pinpoint.</p>

<p>In some cases.. They may just wish to &quot;cut the grass&quot;.. Or even practice &#39;Ordo Ab Chao&#39;.. </p>

<p>Who knows.

    <div class="md"><p>Last point from me then. </p>

<p>Could it be possible that the conspiracies are true or at least some are true and that TPTB know that if these become common knowledge it will effect their bottom line? Like, they aren&#39;t fussed about us knowing the truth, it&#39;s just that us knowing the truth would cause them to lose money, power and influence?</p>

<p>I know that&#39;s kind of the whole angle of conspiracy theories but I&#39;m just saying trying and view it from a point of money, rather than hiding the truth. One causes the other?</p>

<p>Cheers to you to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends what conspiracies though. But yeah I do imagine that lot&#39;s of theories out there, like 9/11, banking families, freemasonic engineering, intelligence agency subversion/assassination etc, are at the very least, yielding useful information that is closer to the truth than official stories let on.. So, in that regard, I think that it&#39;s better than not, to consider a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; as PROBABLY containing some degree of insight, and shouldn&#39;t be flatly ignored just because an entire filing cabinet of evidence isn&#39;t provided along with it... Worth listening to, in other words.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a big subject so forgive the rambling.. </p>

<p>In many cases, I think enough TIME has gone by, enough books were written, enough websites have attempted explanation, enough scrutiny has been undergone, WITHOUT measurable consequence, that the conspirators, dead or alive, are comfortable that the full truth is not going to ever be known, or if it is discovered, they know it will have no negative effect on them or the &quot;event&quot; that had occurred. </p>

<p>I know personally someone who&#39;d just recently &quot;gone to the grave&quot; with some knowledge and noone is any the wiser.. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, it&#39;s difficult to imagine that any of the top conspirators will have their &quot;bottom line&quot; affected by the revealing of truth, but what is observable, is that if the writing of history does yield contradictions and inconsistencies, and if it can be demonstrated to be intentional, then the effort alone to write history incorrectly reveals an importance that they themselves placed on the issue. </p>

<p>If we can see that it&#39;s important to them, then it probably should be important to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;not a conspiracy&quot;.. I think overall collective social change by the masses isn&#39;t a conspiracy when individual people are unconsciously just adapting to a climate which is incrementally changing. So, agreed, individuals within the environment aren&#39;t in on a conspiracy so to speak.</p>

<p>However, IF, and it certainly appears to be the case, there is indeed a concerted top-down effort to activate, facilitate, educate, and inevitably collaborate on, directly influential societal platforms, be it media, politics, culture and arts, charity and welfare, and academia, to name a few, then perhaps there is a conspiracy. &quot;The Long March Through The Institutions&quot;, Frankfurt School etc.. does illustrate the premise and the potential.</p>

<p>Whether or not a crime is being committed, producing the definition of &quot;conspiracy&quot;, by altering culture, particularly in advance of actual measurable violent acts, it&#39;s doubtful.. although through history, a pattern does exist, where a group can successfully transform their ideas with the correct input and stimulus, into a tangible movement which permits violence in support of its objectives. </p>

<p>To include media portrayal of anti-western violence in a system of intentional cultural manipulationbas OP alludes to, doesn&#39;t seem farfetched to me. Particularly with many other observable parallels in the current cultural change occuring in most &quot;liberal&quot; western countries, who practically all share the same media and political landscape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I mean I was just exploring the possibility of conspiracy, but yeah, essentially the culture is changing, people are adapting, but what of the change agents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its an agenda. First it was the blacks and Asians, then the browns (Arabs, Mexicans, Indians/Pakistanis), and now the whites. You have to understand; they&#39;ve been gauging public reaction to blatant discrimination for decades. Creating divisions here and there, with the result being a society of people who are apathetic to the suffering of others; even moreso towards the suffering of those in other racial groups. </p>
