        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So basically my friend thinks that everything we know or think we know about the Mandela effect is false. His take is that the Mandela effect is actually caused by time travelers who are changing our timeline as we know it, and causing things to either disappear completely or change slightly. He claims that the first time our timeline was ever changed was in twenty twelve, and thats why things have felt so different ever since then. He claims that this would explain the false memories and why people claim they remember the scenes from Shazam, and why they remember how stupid it was that Shaq would release Kazam two years after Shazam was released. His theory is that the reason time travelers are changing our timeline is because they are most likely testing the butterfly effect and how much small things like changing a line in a movie or deleting a movie off of the face of the earth would change the world around them, and that obviously they would not test something to big for fear that it might destroy or drastically change their timeline to the point of no return. </p>

<p>I think we don’t have any possible way to know what actually is the truth.
 Some people believe that there is only one universal conscious, every brain is connected to each other. This could mean that maybe someone misread or misinterpreted some logo or a situation( basically anything which people claim has had the Mandela effect) and since the brains are interconnected, somehow majority of the people start believing that what they saw earlier has now been changed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me most Mandela effects are easy to explain. For instance people remember Darth Vader saying &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot; when it is actually &quot;No, I am your father.&quot; Wouldn&#39;t it be more plausible that it is misquoted because out of context starting a phrase by answering &quot;no&quot; is very awkward. Then it spreads from people misquoting it. I heard it quoted with &quot;Luke&quot; repeatedly before I ever saw the movie, and I picked up on it immediately when he said &quot;no.&quot; </p>

<p>Sometimes things are explainable, or even just unimportant enough that you didn&#39;t remember it until you saw a video of Mandela effect. Seriously who actually remembered how Berenstain Bears was spelled? Is it Mandela effect when people misspell lose as loose too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off topic a bit but I&#39;ve always thought that if time travelers come back to change things then this has already &quot;happened&quot; as far as time goes.  Our &quot;history&quot; is set, both past present and future, and the chance that anyone goes back in time has already happened.  If a person was to travel back in time to stop the assassination which started the great war something would happen to them.   They would not be able to follow through because everything is set.  They may break a leg or fall off a cliff by accident.  Who knows. I explained horribly but maybe you will understand.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But many of the biggest alleged Mandella effects include changes of the wording in the Bible, like the most influential text to modern civilization, allegedly some continents/land moved, the earth itself in a different part of the galaxy than before. Also new plants &amp; animals. Did they create the new species and plants?  I&#39;ve seen plenty of claims about new organs in our own body.</p>

<p>How much thought did your friend actually put into this? So he has some knowledge about it, I guess believes in it and comes up with this theory? The effect is based on something that supposedly happened in the 90&#39;s, not 2012. Also going against your/your friend&#39;s theory the name of the effect does involve changing the life/death of an influential figure. How is that much different than assassination?</p>
