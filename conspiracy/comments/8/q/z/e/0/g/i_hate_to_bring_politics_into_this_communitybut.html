       so, in your opinion, if someone mentions boys town alongside the hillary scandal, we are neutralizing the divisive tactics tptb employ?  what do you think would be the best way to approach this topic?

       There are many connections, but, don't fall for the partisan trap. Reagan and Bush fucked kids (ie. boy's town). They are all puppets and dirty. CIA/MIC/Bankers control this "country".

       AB has spoken out against her publicly on multiple occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like other dirty politicians in this country...No dirt he potentially had will ever amount to her seeing the inside of a cell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that Clinton and trump have been lifelong friends, and any facade of rivalry put on during the election was just an attempt to sway voters...they both play for the same team in the end, and as long as real independents like Bernie Sanders don't gain political traction, the wealthy donors to both Republicans and Democrats don't really care who wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same story it's always been, create false narratives to keep the American people from uniting under and independent candidate who would change the corporate welfare system we currently have. As long as common Democrats keep blaming Republicans and vice versa, nothing will ever happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that 70% of this country is not associated with either party, and the only task for both parties each election is to keep those people from banding together and electing real populist candidates.  At this point, we are so far in debt, that we are completely subservient to corporate interests to keep our economy viable....even if someone like Bernie were to be elected, those corporations could easily cause economic disaster and blame it "socialist policies".
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get caught up in any celebrity garbage that tries to implicate one candidate or the other...your only recourse is to educate your peers about the need for political overhaul led by politicians not associated with either party...beyond that, all of these stories are a waste of time

       If Clinton and Trump are "lifelong friends", why did Trump pound home the fact that Clinton should be in jail?  Doesn't sound very friendly...and sounds quite different than merely playing adversary for the election.

       imo? not a ruse, she is morally bankrupt and i personally want time in the ring with her..  he's controlled opposition. trump will fix things, in some ways that will affect us both negatively and positively... at this juncture, i believe trump is a very specific manchurian candidate... he will build the country back up financially, make them feel all special again, and then he will sit back as the economy crashes... our whole political focus is narrowed at two very small people in the grand scheme... there is a whole world outside our domain... that whether we talk about it or not, it does affect us. the suiciding of queen maxima's sister... the saudi princes' arrests, the saudi princess's yt video... savile. heath. hastert. bush. bush. clinton. podesta.

       they will sink the dnc to maintain order, if they have to (in a couple years time, there would be a "reimagined" and "reformed" dnc, mark my words)... right now they have that in donald trump... his stances on Israel, for example. with the exception of donald trump, zionists and some, not even all, Israeli's, who supports their continued malevolence?

       The mere fact that his accusations have completely fallen by the wayside shows exactly that all those election-time rhetoric was just that... posturing for votes, nothing  more. Any president that actually wanted to could very easily put her in jail (or at least in substantial legal hot water requiring years of legal maneuvering).
The fact that none of these threats have ever come to fruition makes it obvious what's going on

       Trump campaigned to chants of "Lock Her Up", everyone was expecting him to prosecute her, only to be surprised when he drops the idea in what, like a month after taking office?  If she's half as bad as the Republicans see her as, it shouldn't be hard or controversial at all.

       The trial itself, possibly.  The fact that she was charged, not so much.  Occam's Razor makes me think there was all smoke and no fire and Trump knew this, so push it until elected, once elected drop it like a hot potato.

From what I've understood he's dropped it totally.  You come in here saying he tweets about her still, but can't prove a link.  Hence, what you are saying cannot be taken as true until we see a link.

       Not really that interested, just want to stop people from coming here, making extensive claims with no evidence, and expecting people to just accept what they say.  You wouldn't trust a new article that says "anonymous sources said", why should I trust what you say?

       The amount of work you are putting in to talk about ME could have been spent finding tweets.  And that's not an "extensive claim".  Like I said, you have ZERO interest in the actual citations or "context".

       Every presidential election cycle is chalk full of dirty politicians that every president could put in jail...and they don't....not because they're dictators, but because the institution of politics is wholly corrupt (save a few small exceptions).
