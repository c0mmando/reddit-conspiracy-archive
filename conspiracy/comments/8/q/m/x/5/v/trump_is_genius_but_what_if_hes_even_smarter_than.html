       Ok, President Trump always seems to be a few steps ahead of EVERYONE and proves it again again, practically weekly.  He has obviously spent some time in Hollywood in the past and undoubtedly has ties to some of Hollywood's elite actors, actresses, producers, ect.  The hate that some of these people have for him is irrational.  What if Trump is pulling the strings  show only conservatives ever have to face consequences? What if DeNiro and company come out in the near future and say, "We're Trump supporters and always have been.  Our contribution to helping President Trump has been by publicly berating him.  Our messages have helped turn the liberal party so far to the left that most moderate liberals are beginning to convert to Trump supporters and will now vote for him in 2020"

       Controlled opposition you say?  Maybe...
      </p>
      <p>
       My take is that he is not afraid of what other people think, and loves to antagonize people as he realizes that if people are emotionally upset, that they have already lost the first battle in a war of wills.   Call it extreme egotism or ignorance if you will, but really its a very base tactic that most politicians either don't have the panache to pull off, or chose not to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they fake supporters?  I don't think so.  If anything they feel his swing to the right a betrayal if anything, but mostly from the point that he enabled them to make more money and not from a shared ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he a genius?  Probably not, but he is adept at the games he likes to play.

       This. Trump or whoever is advising him is always thinking 2 steps ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media knows that Trump has provided GREAT revenue for clickbait and readership. At the same time, Trump is able to use that as his advantage.

       In the last two days he has misspelled "missile" "stopped" and "too" on Twitter.

       Many people misspell words, of course, but a genius shouldn't have problems with those, or with working a spell check.

       Yeah that's the thing though, these great awakening folks have seen Q say several times that "misspellings matter" so now they think Trump is sending out secret code messages with his typos and only pretending to be stupid. It's hilarious.

       Sure am...look, we're both here checking out a conspiracy sub &amp; we've got that in common.  Look into some of the "coincidences" in this q thing, you'll be right on board next to me.  Politics aside (as much as possible) it's the best conspiracy, and most probable, I've ever looked into.

       Nah, I've read a lot and all I've seen is hundreds of predictions which haven't come true. I'd advise you step back from the bubble and realise this: when every single event on earth can be somehow tied to this guys 4chan posts, the chance of coincidental numbers and times and dates becomes is 100%. He keeps saying "how many before it becomes mathematically impossible" but honestly, nothing he's done has been remotely unlikely. I can almost see how inside the bubble where every leaf that falls in autumn is proof, people believe it. But from the outside you guys just look silly.
      </p>

       Ps I hope you haven't gone to voat, that place is like super keen on CP themselves (bit like 8chan weirdly).

       lol or maybe its autocorrect? or maybe its a ploy for media to  report in his misspellings to attack and slander him. Seeing as he just reconciled with North Korea, the media is going to risk a lot of backlash if they attack Trump for something silly like his misspellings, rather than stick to the real issues....

       His most recent was attacking Robert Deniro on twitter for taking too many (or "to many" according to Trump) punches to the head and being stupid.

       Thanks CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said:  Maybe DeNiro and some of these Hollywood folks may not really have the hatered for Trump that they project - mainly because I can't comprehend that type of hatered towards anyone, let alone the elected president of our country.  Terrible, terrible things happen all over the world.  For all anyone paying attention can see, Trump is doing what he can do to make the USA meet it's potential.  For these "stars" to go off on him the way they do, it's irrational.  These rants that some of these "stars" are responsible for are turning more citizens towards Trump than away from him.  And I don't declare it's a conspiracy between Trump and DeNiro and company, but it's a possibility.   They're actors, and they are soooo over the top when they express their hatered towards him...to me, it seems fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       You hear:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump is a genius and everyone who thinks hes a complete retard is just merely pretending right now. Because apparently it's not possible for anyone to not like Trump or think hes an idiot.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not what I said or suggested.  Hence the CNN reference.  Also, as long as we are putting words in each other's mouths, I can't help but assume by your use of the word retard that you are also okay with terms like fag, queer and any various racial slurs - yet oppose illegal immigration.

       Point is that the word retard is equally if not more offensive than the sexual preference slang, as being born with a disablity is not a choice and men humping men is.  He/she is cool with using derogatory language towards some, but not others.   Hypocritics.

       Yeah must be crazy to see other people not like someone you love. Obama got a lot of hate too. People thought he was a Muslim terrorist from Kenya who wanted to bring down American democracy from the inside. What I saw was a family dude who wanted to get me some cheaper healthcare and didnt feel the need to provide large tax breaks for himself and his rich friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never for one second though that the hatred for Obama must be fake and everyone is secretly rooting for him. We have a divided country and Trump is a gigantic dick. That's kind of his act. Hes like the Andrew Dice Clay of presidents. So yeah people dont like him, you might want to get used to it.

       I think he approaches the job with the least amount of class of any president I've seen in my lifetime. He needs to get his ass of twitter at 3 in the morning. I know his fans love him trolling people but it's hard for the rest of the world to take him seriously. I dont understand these trade wars he keeps starting with our allies. I've got money in the stock market and the market takes a hit every time he announces some trade beef on twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the cutting taxes for himself and his billionaire friends was a weak ass move. Considering Bush did this when he was in office and the only people it helped were his rich friends. The trickle down theory is complete nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there a bunch of reasons I dont like him. Not all of it has to do with how he directly effects my day to day life.

       Boi he's BEEN strategic since the moment he announced his run for presidency lol. The media, shitposters, and various Trump Derangement syndrome types love to say otherwise though....Trump is the king of strategy.....Even now with NK he has sent a wave of cognitive dissonance to his opposers as he could (and SHOULD) be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize.
Hell even "covefe" could have been used as a way to make the media look even more stupid in the wake of them reporting any stupid thing about Trump.

       I like to watch MSNBC or CNN for a few and find hypocritical statements.  Just turned it on.  "KJU is a complete idiot and fell into his position, he doesn't deserve the time to deal with the USA, and any previous Presidents could have accomplished the same meeting, but it's pointless"
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn station.
      </p>
      <p>
       "KJU plays Trump and is in the midst of a big strategic play"

       Ok, is KJU an idiot or super genius? The left is giving me mixed signals... they'll take any story as long as it fits their main narrative, Trump is a bad guy.

       I just can't find any logic behind the hate.  Nobody gives answers....just "he sucks" or comparable rebuttle...you know, facts backed by science haha
