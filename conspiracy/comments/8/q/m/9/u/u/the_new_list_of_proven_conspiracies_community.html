The purpose was to determine the dispersion and geographic range of biological or chemical agents. Principally, the operation involved spraying large areas with zinc cadmium sulfide.[2] The U.S. Air Force loaned the Army a C-119, &quot;Flying Boxcar&quot;, and it was used to disperse zinc cadmium sulfide by the ton in the atmosphere over the United States. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_LAC">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_LAC</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/smWSp">http://archive.is/smWSp</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>The Imperial Japanese Army&#39;s notorious medical research team carried out secret human experiments regarded as some of the worst war crimes in history. Its scientists subjected more than 10,000 people per year to grotesque Josef Mengele-style torture in the name of science, including captured Russian soldiers and downed American aircrews. The experiments included hanging people upside down until they choked, burying them alive, injecting air into their veins and placing them in high-pressure chambers. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/7236099/Human-bones-could-reveal-truth-of-Japans-Unit-731-experiments.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/7236099/Human-bones-could-reveal-truth-of-Japans-Unit-731-experiments.html</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/hojxN">http://archive.is/hojxN</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Guatemala syphilis experiment: American medical research project that lasted from 1946 to 1948 and is known for its unethical experimentation on vulnerable human populations in Guatemala. The Guatemala experiments remained a largely unknown event in U.S. medical history until the early 2000s. The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment">https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/8OmW9">http://archive.is/8OmW9</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for &quot;bad blood&quot;, a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. &quot;Bad blood&quot;—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/xGIQp">http://archive.is/xGIQp</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>In its self-described &quot;pied piper&quot; strategy, the Clinton campaign proposed intentionally cultivating extreme right-wing presidential candidates, hoping to turn them into the new &quot;mainstream of the Republican Party&quot; in order to try to increase Clinton&#39;s chances of winning, telling the press to take Trump, Ben Carson, and Ted Cruz seriously, rather than marginalizing them. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/">http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/</a></p></li>
<li><p>The CIA infiltrated the presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater on behalf of President Lyndon Johnson. They obtained copies of speeches and other material from the Goldwater campaign and gave them to President Johnson so he could respond to the points made before he read his speeches. CIA officer E. Howard Hunt was in charge of the spying operation. Hunt later retired from the CIA in 1970 and was hired by the White House in 1972 to lead a unit known as the Plumbers that was dedicated to plugging leaks within the Nixon administration, playing dirty tricks on Nixon’s opponents and obtaining political intelligence. <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/22/cia-fbi-spy-presidential-campaign-trump-goldwater-218415">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/22/cia-fbi-spy-presidential-campaign-trump-goldwater-218415</a></p></li>

Newly discovered documents show how in 1957 Harold Macmillan and President Dwight Eisenhower approved a CIA-MI6 plan to stage fake border incidents as an excuse for an invasion by Syria&#39;s pro-western neighbours, and then to &quot;eliminate&quot; the most influential triumvirate in Damascus.  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/27/uk.syria1">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/27/uk.syria1</a></p></li>

<p><strong>The Government&#39;s influence in TV shows and movies:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think. &quot;On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.&#39; Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html</a></p></li>

<li><p>Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they&#39;re depicted. That&#39;s important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, &quot;Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things.&quot; The spots played in cinemas, and exit polls of 17- to 24-year-olds leaving the movie theater found that those who saw the ad were 25% more likely to say they would consider joining the Army. <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821">http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/01L57">http://archive.is/01L57</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>How the CIA Helped Make “Zero Dark Thirty” - Behind the scenes, the CIA secretly worked with the filmmakers, and the movie portrayed the agency’s controversial “enhanced interrogation techniques” — widely described as torture — as a key to uncovering information that led to the finding and killing of bin Laden... but the massive Senate torture report released in December 2014 found that the program was brutal, mismanaged and — most importantly — didn’t work. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/watch-how-the-cia-helped-make-zero-dark-thirty/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/watch-how-the-cia-helped-make-zero-dark-thirty/</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/zIRh0">http://archive.is/zIRh0</a>)</p></li>

<p><strong>Surveillance</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Four Central Intelligence Agency officers were embedded with the New York Police Department in the decade after Sept. 11, 2001, including one official who helped conduct surveillance operations in the United States, according to a newly disclosed C.I.A. inspector general’s report. That officer believed there were “no limitations” on his activities, the report said, because he was on an unpaid leave of absence, and thus exempt from the prohibition against domestic spying by members of the C.I.A. Another embedded C.I.A. analyst — who was on its payroll — said he was given &#39;unfiltered&#39; police reports that included information unrelated to foreign intelligence, the C.I.A. report said.&quot; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/nyregion/cia-sees-concerns-on-ties-to-new-york-police.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/nyregion/cia-sees-concerns-on-ties-to-new-york-police.html</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/yKwIa">http://archive.is/yKwIa</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The C.I.A. monitoring of journalists in 1963, 1971 and 1972, including wiretapping their phones and setting up observation posts across the street from their offices to track their comings and goings and their visitors, was a practice that the White House itself employed during the Nixon administration.&quot; <a href="https://washington.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/project-mockingbird/">https://washington.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/project-mockingbird/</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/pp4YM">http://archive.is/pp4YM</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Operation Chaos, Project Merrimac, and Project Resistance were three related CIA domestic spying programs. The purpose of &#39;Chaos&#39; was to &quot;amass files on Americans suspected of being domestic dissidents&quot; and look into any foreign influence on leftist movements. Under Merrimac, &quot;CIA agents infiltrated peace groups and black activist groups with the aim of anticipating attacks on the agency itself.&quot; The aim of project Resistance was to &quot;compile information on radical groups that might target CIA activities or assets. The program compiled information from around the country, but specifically targeted college campuses in its search for radical elements. The CIA obtained additional information from local police, and campus officials.&quot; <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/03/20/8_times_the_cia_used_american_spies_to_spy_on_americans_partner/">https://www.salon.com/2014/03/20/8_times_the_cia_used_american_spies_to_spy_on_americans_partner/</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/GJyNa">http://archive.is/GJyNa</a>)</p></li>

Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”. <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf</a></p></li>

<li><p>Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/">http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/</a></p></li>

It was arranged by the big public relations firm of Hill &amp; Knowlton on behalf of a client, the Kuwaiti-sponsored Citizens for a Free Kuwait, which was then pressing Congress for military intervention.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d just like to ask a question. If there are so many confirmed conspiracies (as there clearly are based on the list), why aren&#39;t there any that originated in this sub 6 months, or a year or two or three ago?</p>

<p>Are we discussing actual conspiracies that will eventually be confirmed, or are we just going back and forth about bullshit propaganda?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The problem is there&#39;s just no way to know a priori. Many of the conspiracies on this list were only proven long after the initial event had happened. So some may very well be confirmed eventually, but many will not. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I find the idea of conspiracy debunking kind of odd. There are many theories claimed on this sub which I don&#39;t believe to be true, or in many cases even plausible. I tend to just avoid them, rather than try to convince a believer. The truth will out eventually. </p>

<p>This sub is what you make of it and what you contribute to it; nothing more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How long has <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> been around though? I ask because, many of the conspiracies discussed here carry the implication that these are current events, and that it won&#39;t actually take that long for them to be proven or disproven. We aren&#39;t talking about ancient aliens or the hollow earth, we&#39;re talking about mundane political conspiracies. Surely something would have been confirmed by now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that statism in any of its current forms is necessarily a conspiracy. You have people, often meeting in secret, for the sake of using violence and threats of violence to impose the will of one faction or coalition upon the people. Any conspiracy that we see coming out of the state or its corporate elements should be expected; it&#39;s the rule not the exception.</p>

<p>As to more specifics, the Bilderberg Group is something that 10 years ago was known in conspiracy circles, but is now more public about at least its existence, thought not its discussions. It&#39;s literally some of the most powerful people in the world, meeting behind closed doors, in secret, to decide how they will use their wealth and power to shape the future. </p>

<p>If you are aware of any additional links that should be added to either post, I would gladly have a look. There is only so much room in a self post, but I might be able to add a link or two here.

    <div class="md"><p>While there can be a tendency for some to conspire and forget that the ones they harm are human, I think there is also a lot of potential for good. It is important to be aware that powerful people may get together to commit a harmful act, but there are also plenty of honest people in this world. That&#39;s how some of this gets exposed, either through a whistleblower or some other way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something you could do. Take those facts (the underlying citations, not just a blog post), put them in a post, make it easy to read, and title it &quot;9/11 conspiracy finally proven.&quot; Post it to other subs as well. &quot;9/11 finally proven, why is the media ignoring this?!&quot; I am honestly curious to see what people will say. My guess is there will be alternative explanations, people will find holes in some of the reasoning, and plausible deniability will be maintained. I&#39;d like to be proven wrong. Put your name on the claim and make a bunch of posts about it. </p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the evidence only <em>highly suggests</em> a conspiracy, and some people believe that means &quot;proven,&quot; then I will have to disagree that it has been proven. People claim things have been proven when they have not all the time. I have spent countless hours going through lots of information about 9/11, so I&#39;m debating whether I should catch up on whatever happened in the past 2 years that I missed or not. There are many other things I&#39;d like to read instead of risking a chance that I will have to spend hours and hours to get let down again. </p>

<p>How about direct qutations form high US officials that directly contradicts official version? Maybe you should put 9/11 in half-proved section? ;-)</p>

<p>EXCERPT from Marshall, Philip &quot;<em>The Big Bamboozle: 9/11 and the War on Terror</em>&quot;:</p>

<p>(...)After submitting an 800-page report to the American public, moderate <strong>U.S. Senator Bob Graham of Florida, the co-chairman of the 9/11 Inquiry, said, “There was a ‘direct line’ between the terrorists and the government of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government had provided logistical and financial support to at least two of the 9/11 hijackers while they lived in Southern California.”</strong> [1] One might think a statement of this magnitude would draw significant media attention. It didn’t. For some odd reason, the American media wasn’t interested in the Saudi government being behind the 9/11 attack.(...) Graham published his own book in 2004 entitled Intelligence Matters, where he described a top-heavy coverup by the Intelligence Community. Senator Graham did not mince words, writing that “<strong>the Bush White House was determined to cover up Saudi involvement in 9/11 – and that the administration had found an eager accomplice in the FBI</strong>.”</p>

<p>ONE MORE EXCERPT: (...) Later, we see similar officials come forward including the 9/11 Commission’s own General Counselor John Farmer, who also wrote and published a book in 2008 entitled The Ground Truth. Farmer wrote, <strong>“What government and military officials told Congress, the 9/11 Commission [on which he served], the media, and the public, was almost entirely, and inexplicably, untrue.</strong>” Additionally, we see that the two co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission, the top two, also had more allegations of conflicts of interests and wrote yet another book entitled Without Precedent. They made an astonishing allegation: “The 9/11 Commission was designed to fail.” [3] So, for those of us keeping score, there have been two official federal investigations into the September 11th attack and three out of four of the co-chairmen have written and published books to tell us that something is seriously wrong with the Bush Administration’s version of events. The more we focus on 9/11, the more we see that anyone who has truly investigated it has tried to speak up. But like Graham and Farmer, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, Steve Pieczenik’s interview was simply ignored by the commercial, corporate media. In today’s America, if any revelation is not reported in the six top media conglomerates, it simply never happened (...)</p>

<p>&quot;Most of the testing which occurred in the early years at Suffield Experimental Station,
during the 1940’s - 1960’s was done using real chemical warfare agents, and toxic
solvents on live troops, who had no idea what they were being exposed to. However, the
Department of National Defence, Health Canada, Canadian Forces Surgeon Generals,
Suffield Staff, and the Canadian Government knew.

<p>The Canadian government doesnt like admitting anything, our press is either a joke or nonexistent and this didnt even make the news when it all broke in 2002/2003.</p>

<p>Canadians love pretending that their police, courts and government are all just peachy. They really dont even give a shit. At least americans are <em>sometimes</em> aware of a federal governments BS at large. Canadians? Not so much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edwards was one of 60,000 enlisted men enrolled in a once-secret government program — formally declassified in 1993 — to test mustard gas and other chemical agents on American troops. But there was a specific reason he was chosen: Edwards is African-American. While the Pentagon admitted decades ago that it used American troops as test subjects in experiments with mustard gas, until now, officials have never spoken about the tests that grouped subjects by race. And it wasn&#39;t just African-Americans. Japanese-Americans were used as test subjects, serving as proxies for the enemy so scientists could explore how mustard gas and other chemicals might affect Japanese troops. Puerto Rican soldiers were also singled out. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/06/22/415194765/u-s-troops-tested-by-race-in-secret-world-war-ii-chemical-experiments">https://www.npr.org/2015/06/22/415194765/u-s-troops-tested-by-race-in-secret-world-war-ii-chemical-experiments</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent compilation! Along the lines of the Scientology document theft is a smaller scale one involving a Clinton associate. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Berger">Sandy Berger</a> smuggled all copies of a classified document out of the National Archives (in his socks), just before testifying before the 9/11 commission.</p>

<p>In the true spirit of conspiracy, it was difficult to find the document theft story in the above referenced Wikipedia article. It&#39;s in there, and accurate, but kinda buried.</p>

<p>What I want to know is who put him up to this and why, or did he do it alone? That would determine if this is a conspiracy or not (2 or more people get together to commit a harmful/illegal act). </p>

<p>Apple insists the updates were made with a different goal in mind: It said the performance of lithium-ion batteries degrades over time, which can sometimes cause phones to suddenly shut down in order to protect their components. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/21/technology/apple-slows-down-old-iphones/index.html">http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/21/technology/apple-slows-down-old-iphones/index.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always wondered if England&#39;s &quot;Hillsborough Disaster&quot; could be considered a conspiracy, and if so, it was indeed one that was ultimately proven to be true.</p>

<p>The official story was that drunken, violent football fans (&quot;hooligans&quot;) stormed the gates, overwhelmed the police and caused the tragic crush. To make matters worse, those same fans then urinated on dead bodies, attacked police and ambulance crew, and stole from helpers. This was all supported by police statements, testimony from the police, and presented to the public by the British media. The Government supported of all it.</p>

<p>It was later revealed, however, after countless years of protests, inquests, and campaigns for justice, that the entire thing was made up by the Government, the press and the police together. Evidence came to light of eye witness statements being edited and deleted, false stories being planted in the press, and people being threatened and blackmailed to ensure the blame was placed on the fans and not the police.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a conspiracy in my eyes anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False Flags: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident">USS Liberty Incident</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The USS Liberty incident was an attack on a United States Navy technical research ship, USS Liberty, by Israeli Air Force jet fighter aircraft and Israeli Navy motor torpedo boats, on 8 June 1967, during the Six-Day War. The combined air and sea attack killed 34 crew members (naval officers, seamen, two marines, and one civilian), wounded 171 crew members, and severely damaged the ship. At the time, the ship was in international waters north of the Sinai Peninsula, about 25.5 nmi (29.3 mi; 47.2 km) northwest from the Egyptian city of Arish.</p>

<p>Israel apologized for the attack, saying that the USS Liberty had been attacked in error after being mistaken for an Egyptian ship. Both the Israeli and U.S. governments conducted inquiries and issued reports that concluded the attack was a mistake due to Israeli confusion about the ship&#39;s identity, though others, including survivors of the attack, have rejected these conclusions and maintain that the attack was deliberate.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theory believers find comfort in thinking that there is a group of people running the show and in control of everything.  When in actuality it’s just chaos and events just happen.  Something to that effect.</p>

<p>Also I’ve been wanting to do some research on the kid who tweeted about helicopters on that bin laden mission in abbotabad. Remember that? Within a few minutes  the news had picked up this random Pakistani kids tweet and that was like saying it’s proof the raid went down.</p>

<p>Personally I think they may have killed some brown man that night, but I don’t think OBL is a real person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel exactly the opposite. I think most of these are far TOO recent and far too much importance and weight is being placed on modern conspiracies, and the list just seems to be the result of a cursory google search based on recent news articles and press releases. There is no real attention paid whatsoever to any historical conspiracies at all. In fact I couldnt find a reference to anything that occurred before the 20th century.</p>

<p>History is a much better teacher than modern world examples. This list gives the impression that the idea of a conspiracy is a modern invention and is completely unprecedented or somehow new or unique to the human condition. Conspiracies are embedded within our evolutionary makeup. This is one reason why conspiracies can continually exist unchallenged, because they work, and we are designed to fall for them in many ways. If you dont learn history you are doomed to repeat it. </p>

<p>Conspiracies have existed as long as humanity. Its just a matter of how far you are willing to go back. From the time there were 100 humans, 10 of them were conspiring to fool the other 90. There are examples of conspiracies in the bible, ceasar&#39;s assassination was a conspiracy, the early Catholic church and the papacy and the Roman and Egyptian empires are all rife with confirmed conspiracies. The Knight&#39;s templar, and all the monarchies through the middle ages. Sun-tzu and Machiaveli wrote plainly worded instruction manuals for exactly how to plan and execute conspiracies.</p>

<p>Even just since the 1500&#39;s there are tons and tons of conspiracies. How about the conquistadors, or the fact that the entire institution of piracy on the high seas was nothing more than an admitted and confirmed conspiracy. England paid and equipped rogue pirates to harass, rob and kill the Spanish in the Caribbean, but pretended these were just random pirates doing what pirates do.</p>

<p>Thousands of stories involving Native Americans from broken treaties to outright genocide. The founding of America, the American and French Revolutions. The civil war. How about the fact that many of the slave ships were owned and financed by rich people in New York who continued to fund slave smuggling missions long after slave importation was banned, even during the war, and how these same people profited from the destruction on both sides. The only Southerner to ever be paid by the US for destruction of property in the war also had a house in New York and was the biggest cotton merchant at the time.</p>

<p>The man who we were taught in school invented the great American sport of baseball turned out to never have actually existed and his whole life was a complete fabrication.</p>

<p>I could go on and on and on. I understand that this is far from an exhaustive list, and is intended to be an introduction to conspiracies for dummies. This is designed as a convenient link that we can send to our more skeptical friends who say &quot;oh, &#39;they&#39; would never do that.&quot;  But I think a far more compelling argument that isnt being made here is that &quot;they&quot; have been doing &quot;that&quot; since the beginning of time. If you are informed of this fact then it requires an indefensible leap of logic to say conspiracies don&#39;t exist and conclude that modern governments would refrain from engaging in conspiracy when the government and elites of all societies have done this since before civilization began. </p>

<p>Then of course, if you focus too much on the past our skeptical friends will argue, &quot;well of course they did all that abd stuff in history, but we are more evolved than that now.&quot; Some people will simply never be convinced. Their minds just dont work that way.</p>

<p>To truly understand something you have to understand where it originated from. This list gives the impression that conspiracy is a modern invention of corporate greed and modern influences and that somehow modern leaders just woke up one day in 1901 and decided to resort to conspiracy. The truth is, most of the institutions that control us were FOUNDED in infamy and conspiracy. Thats where they originated from. That is their very root.</p>

<p>Of course this isnt a concept that can be easily understood or forwarded to your buddy&#39;s inbox, or communicated in 140 characters or less. This is a concept you either grasp or you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>The more people that exist in this world, the more potential for conspiracy and deception exists. You can bet on the fact that a vast majority of people will continue to fall for deception as they have time and time again. The elites make this bet every single day and have forever, and they havent lost a bet yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What constitutes a “proven conspiracy”?</p>

<p>Acknowledgement by mainstream institutions?</p>

<p>I personally don’t care what’s been acknowledged or not. It doesn’t seem to make much difference to the average person anyway.</p>

<p>As far as I’m concerned the absolute preponderance of evidence proves 9/11 was a false flag. You literally have to be a shill to honestly examine the evidence and conclude that the official story is still correct. </p>

<p>But because it will never be openly acknowledged by government or media, it’s unproven?</p>

<p>Truth is truth even if nobody knows it. </p>

Barry owned a generic drug company and was a big philanthropist, and believed in sticking up for the little guy against big Pharma, from what I&#39;ve read.  Their murder was originally believed to be a double suicide(both found with belts around their neck) but police now believe it was murder. </p>

The German Embassy in Chile collaborated and the leader of the prison camp had connections to the German conservative party. The chairman of that party even visited the colony himself.

    <div class="md"><p>Checking in here from Canada. I believe there is a conspiracy here to deliberately poison, weaken and sicken First Nation aboriginal people living on the reserve system. Their water quality is terrible. Loaded with lead, mercury, aluminum, and God knows what else. We are told there is no money to improve infrastructure on native reserves to improve potable water.</p>

<p>Yet, many supermarkets in Canadian cities have Reverse Osmosis kiosks where we can fill up on purified water, free of toxins. Also, portable tabletop water distillers are available to order online, for about $200. First Nations reserves have electricity, so these distillers are feasable! Also, ZeroWater pitchers and filters are widely available -- I have both this and a portable water distiller -- yet our government -- Trudeau Liberals -- don&#39;t seem to think that native reserves need to have communal reverse osmosis kiosks or water distillation. They are not even recommending or providing them with ZeroWater filters in the meantime while water infrastructure is built.</p>

<p>Also want to mention WaterCone, a simple technology which uses the power of the sun to purify water from any source, which would be feasible in hotter climates such as Africa....</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe there is a deliberate, concerted effort to deprive marginal communities of clean, drinkable water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Dugway sheep incident, also known as the Skull Valley sheep kill, was a 1968 sheep kill that has been connected to United States Army chemical and biological warfare programs at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. Six thousand sheep were killed on ranches near the base, and the popular explanation blamed Army testing of chemical weapons for the incident, though alternative explanations have been offered. A report, commissioned by Air Force Press Officer Jesse Stay and first made public in 1998, was called the &quot;first documented admission&quot; from the Army that a nerve agent killed the sheep at Skull Valley.</p>

<p>coincidentally the wikipedia page was edited 10 days ago to add &quot;Despite evidence to the contrary&quot; at the end of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit! That Italy link is really incredible. That is one hell of a read. I am 1/4 Italian and never knew any of this. Although everyone knows about Italian corruption and the reputation the country has because of the mafia, I have never seen Italy&#39;s modern corruption spelled out with names, dates and proof. </p>

<p>Pretty much an indictment the entire Italian government, their banking system and even the papacy. This story has everything. Espionage, international finance, stolen WWII gold, terrorist funding, rogue masonic lodges and of course CIA funding and involvement.</p>

<p>This is like 30 conspiracies in one and it all centers around one man who was a former mussolini fascist and was called &quot;the puppet master.&quot; He lived to 96. All these truly evil motherfuckers reaching their 90&#39;s (kissinger, Bush1, Larry Silverstein) makes me question if karma really exists and leads me to think think mass evil must be really good for your health.)</p>

<p>This should DEFINITELY be on the list. They need to make a movie about that dude, this shit seems way to crazy to even be real. You couldnt imagine or make that shit up if you tried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This should go on the list for proven false flag, crisis actor, AND assassination conspiracies. Bush is so horrible he actually openly planned several conspiracies in a meeting where there was a guy TAKING NOTES. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/27/world/europe/bush-was-set-on-path-towar-british-memo-says.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/27/world/europe/bush-was-set-on-path-towar-british-memo-says.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At their meeting, Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair candidly expressed their doubts that chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be found in Iraq in the coming weeks, the memo said. The president spoke as if an invasion was unavoidable. The two leaders discussed a timetable for the war, details of the military campaign and plans for the aftermath of the war.</p>

<p>Discussing Provocation</p>

<p>Without much elaboration, the memo also says the president raised three possible ways of provoking a confrontation. Since they were first reported last month, neither the White House nor the British government has discussed them.</p>

<p>&quot;The U.S. was thinking of flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in U.N. colours,&quot; the memo says, attributing the idea to Mr. Bush. &quot;If Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach.&quot;</p>

<p>It also described the president as saying, &quot;The U.S. might be able to bring out a defector who could give a public presentation about Saddam&#39;s W.M.D,&quot; referring to weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>A brief clause in the memo refers to a third possibility, mentioned by Mr. Bush, a proposal to assassinate Saddam Hussein. The memo does not indicate how Mr. Blair responded to the idea.</p>

<p>And what about the Snowden revelations about American state spying on its population and foreign governments?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Bernays">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Bernays</a></p>

<p>&quot;His best-known campaigns include his work for the United Fruit Company connected with the CIA-orchestrated overthrow of the democratically elected Guatemalan government in 1954.&quot; - Also known as the Banana Massacre:</p>

<p>But he&#39;s also responsible for some of the most crucial texts on propaganda and social engineering. He&#39;s also responsible for why bacon is a breakfast food, why we buy diamond rings for engagements, and a lot of things people just take for granted. His written works include &quot;The Engineering of Consent&quot;, &quot;Crystallizing Public Opinion&quot; and &quot;Propaganda&quot;. </p>

<p>His books were also found in the library of Goebbels. He believed that people as a mass can and should be told what to think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding your fourth link from the top (US testing carcinogens in western Canada).</p>

<p>While the States may have tested things back in the 60s. Suffield (one of the spots that is mentioned in the article) is actually owned by the British. You can see the view of the base from google maps, it&#39;s just off of the TransCanada highway. </p>

<p>I&#39;m very sure they still do some sorts of testing there because the area has a 30% increased risk of MS (on top of Canadian&#39;s high risk already due to lack of sun/vitamin D).</p>

<p>If you are in Med Hat you&#39;ll sometimes see the British people who work there at the bars picking up fat girls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately just some crappy google links and such</p>

<p>&quot;Most of the testing which occurred in the early years at Suffield Experimental Station,
during the 1940’s - 1960’s was done using real chemical warfare agents, and toxic
solvents on live troops, who had no idea what they were being exposed to. However, the
Department of National Defence, Health Canada, Canadian Forces Surgeon Generals,
Suffield Staff, and the Canadian Government knew.

<p>The Canadian government doesnt like admitting anything, our press is either a joke or nonexistent and this didnt even make the news when it all broke in 2002/2003.</p>

<p>Canadians love pretending that their police, courts and government are all just peachy. They really dont even give a shit. At least americans are <em>sometimes</em> aware of a federal governments BS at large. Canadians? Not so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Are we discussing actual conspiracies that will eventually be confirmed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is there&#39;s just no way to know a priori. Many of the conspiracies on this list were only proven long after the initial event had happened. So some may very well be confirmed eventually, but many will not. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I find the idea of conspiracy debunking kind of odd. There are many theories claimed on this sub which I don&#39;t believe to be true, or in many cases even plausible. I tend to just avoid them, rather than try to convince a believer. The truth will out eventually. </p>

<p>This sub is what you make of it and what you contribute to it; nothing more. </p>
