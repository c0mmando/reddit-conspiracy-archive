<p>&quot;The truth, of course, is that the percentage of the population that is employed has barely budged since the depths of the last recession.  According to John Williams, if honest numbers were being used the unemployment rate would actually be 21.5 percent today.&quot;</p>

<p>As you are about to see, if honest numbers were being used all of our major economic numbers would be absolutely terrible.

    <div class="md"><p>Any economic numbers are doomed to being hopelessly inaccurate, since they don&#39;t include the massive black economy. A <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2001/2848dope_money.html">2001 report</a> estimated $521 billion per year in drug sales by the CIA/British axis using official numbers, with speculation that the real number is above $1 trillion. </p>

<p>Hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money were used to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/dec/13/drug-money-banks-saved-un-cfief-claims">bail out</a> the banks during the Great Recession.</p>

<p>Until we get some real solutions to rapidly grow the economy, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium-based_nuclear_power">thorium power</a>, a space elevator to create a space economy based on solar power and asteroid mining, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Water_and_Power_Alliance">NAWAPA</a>, etc. we&#39;re just putting band aids on a world that is slowly going bankrupt because we are producing less and less per capita in the real economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Williams’ findings, while controversial, corroborate a variety of other data points. Median wage gains have been stagnant for decades. The U.S. labour force participation rate remains at multi-decade lows. Even our own light-hearted Big Mac deflator suggests that the U.S. economy is in a depression.</p>

<p>Another clue is to evaluate the U.S. economy just as economists would a third world nation whose data they don’t trust. They do this by resorting to figures that are hard to fudge.</p>

<p>There, too, by a variety of measures—ranging from petroleum consumption to consumer goods production to the Cass Freight Index—the U.S. economy appears to have not grown much, if at all, since the turn of the millennium.&quot;</p>

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,</p>

<p>Every time the mainstream media touts some “wonderful new economic numbers” I just want to cringe.  Yes, it is true that the economic numbers have gotten slightly better since Donald Trump entered the White House, but the rosy economic picture that the mainstream media is constantly painting for all of us is completely absurd. </p>

<p>As you are about to see, if honest numbers were being used all of our major economic numbers would be absolutely terrible.  Of course we can hope for a major economic turnaround for America under Donald Trump, but we certainly are not there yet.  Economist John Williams of shadowstats.com has been tracking what our key economic numbers would look like if honest numbers were being used for many years, and he has gained a sterling reputation for being accurate.  And according to him, it looks like the U.S. economy has been in a recession and/or depression for a very long time.</p>

<p>Let’s start by talking about unemployment. </p>

<p>We are being told that the unemployment rate in the United States is currently “3.8 percent”, which would be the lowest that it has been “in nearly 50 years”.</p>

<p>To support this claim, the mainstream media endlessly runs articles declaring how wonderful everything is.  For example, the following is from a recent New York Times article entitled “We Ran Out of Words to Describe How Good the Jobs Numbers Are”…</p>

<p>The real question in analyzing the May jobs numbers released Friday is whether there are enough synonyms for “good” in an online thesaurus to describe them adequately.</p>

<p>So, for example, “splendid” and “excellent” fit the bill. Those are the kinds of terms that are appropriate when the United States economy adds 223,000 jobs in a month, despite being nine years into an expansion, and when the unemployment rate falls to 3.8 percent, a new 18-year low.</p>

<p>Doesn’t that sound great?</p>

<p>It would be great, if the numbers that they were using were honest.</p>

<p>The truth, of course, is that the percentage of the population that is employed has barely budged since the depths of the last recession.  According to John Williams, if honest numbers were being used the unemployment rate would actually be 21.5 percent today.</p>

<p>So what is the reason for the gaping disparity?</p>

<p>As I have explained repeatedly, the government has simply been moving people from the “officially unemployed” category to the “not in the labor force” category for many, many years.</p>

<p>If we use the government’s own numbers, there are nearly 102 million working age Americans that do not have a job right now.  That is higher than it was at any point during the last recession.</p>

<p>We are being conned.  I have a friend down in south Idaho that is a highly trained software engineer that has been out of work for two years.</p>

<p>If the unemployment rate is really “3.8 percent”, why can’t he find a decent job?</p>

<p>By the way, if you live in the Boise area and you know of an opening for a quality software engineer, please let me know and I will get the information to him.</p>

<p>Next, let’s talk about inflation.</p>

<p>According to Williams, the way inflation has been calculated in this country has been repeatedly changed over the decades…</p>

<p>Williams argues that U.S. statistical agencies overestimate GDP data by underestimating the inflation deflator they use in the calculation.</p>

<p>Manipulating the inflation rate, Williams argues in Public Comment on Inflation Measurement , also enables the US government to pay out pensioners less than they were promised, by fudging cost of living adjustments.</p>

<p>This manipulation has ironically taken place quite openly over decades, as successive Republican and Democratic administrations made “improvements” in the way they calculated the data.</p>

<p>If inflation was still calculated the way that it was in 1990, the inflation rate would be 6 percent today instead of about 3 percent.</p>

<p>And if inflation was still calculated the way that it was in 1980, the inflation rate would be about 10 percent today.</p>

<p>Doesn’t that “feel” more accurate to you?  We have all seen how prices for housing, food and health care have soared in recent years.  After examining what has happened in your own life, do you believe that the official inflation rates of “2 percent” and “3 percent” that we have been given in recent years are anywhere near accurate?</p>

<p>Because inflation is massively understated, that has a tremendous effect on our GDP numbers as well.&quot;</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all numerical magic. Look at all the numbers. Now watch them,   DISAPPEAR!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll just leave some numbers/copypasta from an old post of mine. I&#39;ll preface it by saying that nothing has changed for the better since &#39;08. </p>

<p><strong>copypasta</strong></p>

<p>41% of jobs lost in 08 were High Wage jobs, but only 30% of jobs created since then are High Wage. 37% of jobs lost in the Recession were Middle-Wage jobs, but only 26% of jobs created since then are Middle Wage. And 21% of all jobs lost in &#39;08 were low wage, service sector jobs...yet a staggering 44% of all jobs created since &#39;08 are low wage, service sector. This means millions of Americans are literally locked out of the Middle Class.</p>

<p>US Credit Card debt has reached record highs as of Q4 2017, at $1.023 Trillion. This is higher than in &#39;08. Student Loan debt is at 1.2 Trillion, and rising. Auto Debt is up to $1.2 Trillion, and delinquencies jumped in Q3 and Q4 from 6.5% to 7.2%. Mortgage debt is up, and the average new home price in the US is higher than in &#39;08, at $250,000. The economy isn&#39;t doing good. The US Middle Class is drowning in debt, and when &#39;08 part two hits, sooner rather than later, it is going to be a shit show of epic proportions. QE 1-3 only postponed the pain, so enjoy these times now, because the reckoning is coming.</p>

Economic nationalism tends to be much better for workers than laissez faire favoring of globalist corporations.

<p>Public debt is literally a banker conspiracy by the Federal Reserve. We cannot pay off the national debt because the Fed controls the currency supply, and the total currency supply is far lower than the national debt. We cannot issue currency without <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/19-reasons-why-the-federal-reserve-is-at-the-heart-of-our-economic-problems">borrowing from the Fed</a>.</p>

<p>Two presidents (Kennedy and Lincoln) have been shot for trying to get us onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Note">national currency system</a> instead of a <a href="https://openjurist.org/275/us/415">private currency</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s a very strange thing to inject into a technical discussion about the implications of tariffs and nationalist economic policy. Almost like you&#39;re trying to discredit this without actually making a substantial claim that can be debunked...</p>

<p>The question was whether high-wage jobs can be brought back to the country, not the portion of the training that will be born by the employer or the employee. Different questions.</p>

<p>No. I&#39;m arguing for a 25% tax on certain goods. A 25% tax on imports is not the same as a 25% increase in the cost of those goods. You&#39;re assuming consumers will absorb 100% of the cost of the tax increase, which is false. It&#39;s more like <a href="https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/users/jcalhoun/Courses/Growth_of_American_Economy/Chapter_Supplemental_Readings/Chapter_20/Irwin-Tariff_Incidence_in_America%27s_Gilded_Age.pdf">60%</a>, and that&#39;s assuming that American producers don&#39;t step into the gap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone put it better than me, in a comment below, the Fed is a for-profit corporation, it is in existence to earn a profit. so, we don&#39;t need t worry about the billionaires collapsing our economy, it won&#39;t happen (debt might tho, but that is controllable).</p>

<p>There are more jobs right now than people seeking work - the pool of available workers has shrunk to very nearly 0. This might cause prices to increase at the same rate as wages, but many economists think this is a good thing, as it tightens the money supply, and makes investing a fantastic option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are downvoting the truth here. In my experience, the companies keep a very small group of actual US based employees but the majority is outsourced through companies like Wipro, Tata, Cognizant, etc. They can quickly scale up and down the workforce, and get people with BS/MS &quot;degrees&quot; (although I know nothing of the colleges) much more cheaply. On the other hand, most of them don&#39;t care about the company and are switched between US companies frequently.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nurses and tech jobs are pretty much the Only jobs people dont really have a lot oftrouble finding work for. </p>

<p>I did a boot camp for javascript full stack development then taught myself ruby/rails. I did a simple blog and a simple forum, put it on github, and got 8 interviewed for 9 applications and 3 offers from the 3 companies I wanted. I withdrew from the others bc the culture wasn&#39;t a good fit. As a developer I can be picky. I work from home and I can make jewelry on the side bc I dont have a long ass commute</p>

<p>I wish every industry was this easy to get a job. Its a struggle amd I feel for people I was one of those before doing this </p>
