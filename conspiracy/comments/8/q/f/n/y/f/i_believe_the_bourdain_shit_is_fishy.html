People like Alex Jones might have serious issues and I hope all of you don&#39;t think every death of a famous person is a coverup. But I look at this situation, I just feel something is up. I believe avotnof death are overblown. For example, the Prince death I think was just a legit death. I mean prince was a washed up singer so I doubt people would think of him as a threat. But Tony was a current traveler with a following. He was dating a Weinstein accuser. There were rumors he was going to expose something. I am not the best with facts but have read posts last couple of days. I didn&#39;t watch Bourdain a lot, but I did a little win my dad now and in the past. I know Bourdain had his problems but I don&#39;t buy it. He was filming his own show and he had no signs of taking drugs currently. I don&#39;t think there is the illuminati or government does all this crazy shit like people think but I keep my eyes open. I truly think there is a pedophile ring and sex chain that Weinstein and the Zionists do in Hollywood. I hope the public ends their evil rain and out these cunts in real prison where they get what they deserve.</p>

<p>All wrong. no. He was prob offed. Look at the detailes and timeline of his own label and then recent re-signing with his nemesis and then ooops. Elevator od. I&#39;m no prince expert, but I know he&#39;s fucking huge. There&#39;s no &quot;washed up&quot; w him imo.</p>

I hope Tony was never part of these things and I doubt it. He was repeatedly outspoken against these Hollywood people. He probably knew something from this August girl.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I gotcha. It just seems to me like there is wild speculation every single time a celebrity dies. I feel like being a celebrity is a heavy situation to be in and it doesnt surprise me that we see this type of thing happen from time to time.

    <div class="md"><p>The Bourdain death hit me hard.  I really enjoyed watching his shows since &quot;No Reservations&quot;.  I&#39;m having a hard time thinking he killed himself, especially the way he did.  That being said, I&#39;ve was addicted to heroin years ago and I know the empty spot it leaves in your life.  I know how that with any little tragedy in life you want to turn to it.  I know how it is missed and coping without it is absolute shit.  With that being said, I&#39;m thinking that the Tweet his girlfriend put up and removed after finding out about his suicide is telling.  It pictured her in a ripped shirt, saying &quot;Fuck Everyone&quot; with her label &quot;You know who you are&quot; may be more important and revealing than people think.  It&#39;s total speculation but I think maybe they may have had some physical argument in the days before, her shirt was ripped.  It was probably in regards to the man she was pictured being affectionate with in Rome.  I&#39;d say after seeing her Tweet he knew it was over, his name was about to be smeared and he just caved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said.  It was really hard to believe when I first heard it, because he was so outspoken and grounded.  </p>

<p>But the more I read about him and his girlfriend, he seemed somewhat infatuated by her.  Considered her a soul mate.  She was 20 years younger and recently seen being affectionate with an even younger guy.  Then her message.</p>

<p>I think he was heartbroken, devastated, tired and said &quot;fuck it&quot;.</p>

<p>Yep, this is what I&#39;m leaning to.  It really sucks man.  Bourdain gave alot of people like me hope.  He became successful in his 40&#39;s <strong>after</strong> a heroin addiction.  That, as far as I&#39;ve seen, is pretty much unheard of.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure.  But as someone who is around his age when he became suddenly successful, and shares many of his viewpoints - I can totally understand hitting 61, having my heartbroken, being tired and just saying &quot;fuck it&quot; on my terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  I&#39;m just surprised he did it the way he did.  As someone that knows the way heroin makes you feel I&#39;m stunned he didn&#39;t just go out and buy enough to make a &quot;hot shot&quot; with.  That&#39;s what perplexes me.  I guess it kind of shows his state of mind at the time.  He just absolutely said &quot;fuck it&quot; and checked out with whatever was handy.  He didn&#39;t give a shit about the pain, his best friend finding him, the show that was partially filmed, etc.  Whatever triggered him did it quickly and absolutely.  </p>
