        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just a year ago Isis was portrayed as the world&#39;s #1 threat and the seeming descendant of AL-queda as well as the last remnants of Iraqi &quot;insurgency&quot; resistance after the US invasion and they were painted as the worlds public enemy. They served as continued justification and motivation for the ongoing &#39;global war on terror.&#39; There were all these videos of terrible violence supposedly carried out by them that were all over the internet and there seemed to be a concerted propaganda effort to portray them as the most evil force known to man and they were associated with every evil thing that happened in the world. </p>

<p>Supposedly they controlled 1/3rd of Iraq and now they are supposedly completely gone in Iraq? Was this just a boogeyman that was constructed in our minds to take down so the modern world could look like victors and liberators? Is it as simple as a &quot;chock one up for the good guys, on to the next enemy&quot; kind of narrative?</p>

<p>Is it no longer politically expedient to invoke the name of ISIS to rally support against an easy target that everyone agreed was so inherently evil? Seems like they could be used as a very effective political tool to perpetuate the globalist agenda. Why did they suddenly abandon this as a lightning rod?</p>

<p>Just strikes me as really weird how this seemed to be political foreign policy agenda #1 just a few months back and there was all this emotion and attention devoted to making us feel a certain way about ISIS, and how quickly the entire subject immediately disappeared from the headlines and public consciousness seemingly overnight. Why dont they want to scare us about ISIS anymore?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a gorilla style war just because you&#39;re not attacking doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not winning. You&#39;re assessing, you&#39;re recruiting. It&#39;s fucking stupid to just presume that because there aren&#39;t attacks they&#39;re not progressing. They were working on the laptop thing recently. They  are a small group of multiple cells. Pointless chaos would be stupid and they are smart, at least their leaders were. Throwing bodies onto the pile never won anyone anything. I&#39;d be stupid if I just presumed well no car attacks means no more jihad... If you were losing a war would you just throw more shit on the fire that doesn&#39;t seem to be working 24 7? There have been years where terrorist attacks weren&#39;t that big then every now and then there is a big one. Does that mean anything? No but it remains to be seen what exactly is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But way less in 2016 than say 2013-2014. Late 2015, early 2016 was the turning point for IS, untill then their territory kept growing. They were portrayed as an unstoppable force till then. I am pretty sure they were at least partly directed and funded by American and other covert ops, so I guess they&#39;ve served their purpose or US interests no longer align with their goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may recall where this started:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump pulled the funding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone was trying to give DJT partisan credit for the apparent lower activity of ISIS without providing any information to support the claim. You didn&#39;t question that. But you question my response. </p>

<p>You can play with the details and nitpick the very difficult issue of <em>exactly</em> how much activity or coverage ISIS got in this year or that year but the big facts remain. </p>

<p>In 2016, ISIS was a huge issue. The issue quickly disappeared when DJT arrived. My initial assessment applies as better analysis then &quot;but Trump saved us&quot; exactly as stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Create a fury over ISIS before the election to discredit Obama then it disappears after to make DJT look good. </p>

<p>Why are you omitting any events about how George W. Bush was installed into office on the PNAC agenda, got his desired &quot;new Pearl Harbor,&quot; and used that and other lies to extend wars throughout the middle east, thereby creating ISIS?</p>

<p>Dealing with your implied question:</p>

<p>ISIS was on its last ropes at about the time of the 2017 transition. It was a huge story and covered extensively here in r/conspiracy. Maybe that has more to do with the lighter coverage if ISIS than say &quot;Trump pulled the funding,&quot; or your answer, &quot;Saudi Arabia and CIA pulled funding.&quot;</p>

<p>Please answer my question now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting take because it&#39;s rare to see an article on ISIS that goes any deeper than just describing religious punishments - 
I&#39;m guessing a few locals would have been happy to keep living under ISIS if the armies had left them alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First it depends on where you live and get your news.</p>

<p>2nd ISIS is doing bad, the quick rise has become alsmost a quick fall.</p>

<p>3rd most countries arent fighting against IS. The once that are are mostly in mali, and the US and turky in syria (beside the conflict they where there for in the first part).</p>

<p>4th almoste no claimed terror atacks in the west for a few months.</p>

<p>5th, we have stopt calling then ISIS (or well they didnt even call them selfs ISIS but yeah)</p>

<p>6th one could say the biggest battles have been done against them and its just another insurgent/terror group now like the taliban, hamas, bokoharam. </p>

<p>7th i still see news from time to time.</p>

<p>8th news is NEWS, if they keep recalling everything they could better make a TV show called IS.
There is more happening in the world, eyes are now on Nkorea that will pass in halve a year and by then who know what we will be shit showing about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one is easy to answer.</p>

<p>The US (Zionists) were using ISIS in order to have an excuse to enter and destroy Syria. They have now served their purpose and the enemy has been switched to Russia which was actually destroying ISIS, thus allowing the MIC, elitists and Deep State the ability to further enrich themselves. ISIS are now a liability as the US backing of terrorists in the FSA (White Helmets, al-Nusra Front) has now been exposed. The Zionist controlled media continues distractions now in order to hide this from the American people. The last thing they want now is people looking closely at what they have done in Syria, because of that becomes mainstream then the whole 9/11 narrative is very likely to fall apart due to people realizing the US has been on the side of the terrorists all along, and all these attacks around Europe and the US are orchestrated false flags.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>ISIS served its purpose after Trump&#39;s election. Enemies abroad quickly shifted to enemies within and nearby (Latino immigrants). </p></li>
<li><p>MBS completed his coup in Saudi Arabia by arresting/fleecing not those who had funded ISIS but those who were aware of the state&#39;s funding of same. Let&#39;s not forget that one significant ISIS attack prior to MBS&#39;s takeover was in Iran, classical Saudi/Israeli/Neocon enemy #1.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s lot of hovering Putin in this thread re: his fending off ISIS in Syria. In reality, a great deal of ISIS members were likely Chechen in origin, sent off south by the FSB after threatening the Sochi Olympics. Maybe Putin stopped playing his ISIS hand? Recall also Erdogan&#39;s son buying oil from ISIS, neither Turkey nor Russia has their hands clean there. </p></li>
<li><p>Less speculative in origin is the fact that Mosul was retaken and regional footholds in Iraq were increasingly crushed. Obama admin fostered ISIS (if they didn&#39;t directly fund it), but had gradually knocked them back, up to and including the &#39;16 election era. That left ISIS with diminishing returns in Syria and whatever alliances they hold with groups like Boko Haram in Africa, who I think we&#39;ll be hearing about sooner rather than later. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Because ISIS was US and Isreali/suadi funded efforts to distabile that entire line of countries: iran iraq syria. After Russia came out of the woodwork and said enough, did that one day blitz last year and took out most of the isis, forever shifting balance of war in syria. </p>

<p>Then reports of isis popping up in afganistan, the other fron russia is engaged in on its geopolitical territory and then it doubled down in syris and iran. </p>

<p>Since western plan to take over middle east through terrorism and insergency failed, they shifted to false flag chemical attacks and later full on rocket fire but on &quot; strategic targets &quot; using US military. This was met with global opposition as the support on syria and iranian invasion, was very low in contrast to iraq invasion. Only UK, france, US were really the major supporters in UN. </p>

<p>Basically meaning now ISIS is not only destroyed for the most part, but the efforts of insurgency warfare by the western coalation is not longer working. Plus seeing as USs own citizens are being bombarded with information that brings to light how US israel etc funded and supported isis. This lie and deception warfare is no longer working. </p>

<p>So we are switching up to more direct infomational warfare, sanction warfare is pretty much at an end. So its trade wars, political oppositions, propoganda and flase flags. </p>

<p>But ISIS, is now dead for the most part. It may attempt one or two major haymakers in the end, to try and get something done in the near future. But in the long game, its done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t hear about them because they are on the death throes and now exist solely under the custodianship of the United States.  Since 2014 they slowly but surely lost ~100,000 their men via attrition.  Their worldwide recruitment channels were cut off and people don&#39;t believe in the movement enough to commit their lives to it as they once did.</p>

<p>At first it was superficial, Obama&#39;s air strikes didn&#39;t have much of an effect, ISIS would release propaganda videos of them in the midst of battle, harassed by F-22 and they&#39;d film them in the sky and laugh as they turned around and went to base after depleting its ordinance, but ISIS on the ground would continue the assault.  This was a time that was widely reported how ISIS continued to gain territory despite the early stages of Operation Inherent Resolve.</p>

<p>Once Russia joined it the end of 2015 it was kinda the beginning of the end.  Putin was furious and claimed that the majority of Islamist forces in the Middle East that had become a problem were essentially mercenaries who worked for whichever terror outfit paid the most.  They also accused the US of &quot;absolutely unprofessional politics&quot; for providing material aid, weaponry, training, and Special Forces operatives to various terror groups including the entire creation, fostering, and utilization of ISIS.  Although they didn&#39;t attack anybody but US-proxy forces at first, but IS targets were definitely on the kill list, and around this time CENTCOM also started targeting ISIS leadership for assassination.  A series of several successful leaders assassinated via drone or otherwise led to disarray that began to cause a lack of control and command that essentially left ISIS vulnerable and easily defeated in all of their strong holds across Iraq, Syria, and Libya. They were attacked on the ground by Iranian militias, Syrian Army, Kurdish, tribal militias, and ultimately pushed out of everywhere.  The battle of Mosul and the battle of Raqqa were some of the most cataclysmic fighting on Earth since WW2.  And after ISIS lost in their capitals, they never attempted to resist again, when they were advanced on they&#39;d just fall back and flee out to the desert...</p>

<p>Now the ISIS directives have changed and they have reverted to an insurgency group.  You don&#39;t hear about their propaganda because their output is at an all-time low, almost 100% still images released of how pathetic conditions on the front lines have become.  They don&#39;t have any offensives any more, they don&#39;t win battles, they&#39;re not the predominant force in the Syrian war any more, they&#39;re exposed and hated by the Sunni world, excised as cancer.  There&#39;s nothing to sensationalize.  They&#39;re a defeated army.  </p>

<p>Most curious of all is how they continue to exist today.  Many people speculate what the next iteration of ISIS will look like.  This much is clear:  the ONLY territory they hold is a pocket within a massive territory in the East of Syria that is essentially held by the US.  There have been many reports of a convoy of US helicopters hoisting away ISIS commanders away from besiegement or battle since last year.  Recently it was captured on video.  Recently a tribal militia alligned with Assad attempted to attack the ISIS area under US control.  They were met with the F-15/F-22/A-10/AC-130 treatment and obliterated.  The Syrian governement wants the United States OUT of the country.  They&#39;re there illegally.  But the US refuses to leave until &quot;ISIS is defeated for good&quot; - Very curious that they&#39;re keeping the group alive and nursing it back to health, to be dispatched again another day as a weapon of subversion against the enemies of the US.</p>

<p>Ya know they never killed or captured the Caliph... although some say he&#39;s quietly retired living with a new identity under the protection of the security services in Tel Aviv ;)</p>
