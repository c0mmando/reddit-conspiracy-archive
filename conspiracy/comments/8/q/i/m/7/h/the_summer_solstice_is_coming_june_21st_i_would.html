       I'm working out a theory that what "they" tell us is our solstices and equinoxes our false and they mark the true ones with tragedies.  It seems to be within 2.2 weeks after our solstices so far. I think the Vegas shooting was 2 weeks after the equinox. Our calendar could possibly be false.

       It has to b bigger than that imo. That's more like controlled choas. It will probably be an orchestrated attack but not nearly as big as Vegas because that had a lot more meaning and purpose than just marking the calendar. I mean I have no clue, it's a pretty new theory of mine. Had it before Vegas and that proved me right so I'm 1 for 1 so far.

       That's a casual correlation, not a causation.

       Totally. Whether it's because of my false calendar theory or just coincidence or what; I  just happened to predict the weekend it happened, the country(america), and the massive scope of it. I wasn't very confident in the theory but I told a few family members.

       Well that Soros backed fake neo nazi Spencer has been quiet. Jason Kessler and what's the other one some fake name Enoch but he got found out because of Jewish wife I guess.

       I would hope those sad boys that fell for their con would get a clue and find better ways to manage their anger than falling into a trap like thay again. Tiki torches. Really?  And it would be nice if they'd not be raxist too but who knows what's rralky up with that. Poor woman died for a damn narrative. What else is new. =(

       Not to reel off a huge list but there's the obvious ones like Egypt, Princess Di, The British Royal Family, Hitler, the Jesuits, phantom time hypothesis, the Catholic Church, Paul is Dead, etc etc.

       I am concerned a lot about that because also the Saudi Crown Prince is going and the unusual overlapped Bilderberg, NATO defense and G7 meetings last week. On the itinerary was Russia, Saudi Arabia and I think Iran. Also amassing ships closer to Russia.

       Well that's a nice way of shutting down the discussion.  U sure do have a lot of karma for a conspiracy theorist. I guess we'll both just have to wait and see.

       I have other interest and I guess I get karma that way. You have any cassette tape or Baltimore related questions?

       How am I shutting down discussion?  You claimed that the date for the solstice is false.  I've showed how you can check for yourself that they are or are not fake.  Set some alarms for sunset and sunrise on those three days and see for yourself if the 21st is the longest day.

       Ok I'll do that. But I cant really continue talking about it until I've done it now, ya know? I'm just sayin, nine days, dunno why or how. Just speculating and the false calendar theory helped me predict before so I'm resting pretty much all of the prediction that. I really should measure it myself tho so thanks for the link

       I measured it while taking astronomy in college. It's a real thing. You can also just record when the sun goes down every day and see the summer solstice is the longest day

       Nice. Appreciate your input.  That's all I need to drop the false calendar angle. But I still stand by my prediction.  The why of it having to do with solstices and equinoxes is to be determined. Whether they do or not. It Could be sun worship or Masonic codes or anything

       So here is the thing. You could look at this as the elite using or current calendar system as a perversion of our natural cycles. If you think logically about our current system it does not align with what happens in nature. So the winter solstice is on dec 21 it the shortest day of the year afterward the days become longer. In many ancient cultures this was the beginning of the new year. We have went against that logic and have shifted the new year around 10 days later. So maybe this does have credibility if things are happening 10 days after events. Just a thought hope that makes sense

       Oh beautiful. Nicely put. Also the year is messed up by the leap year and daylight savings time which is complete bullshit and everyone knows it. 365 is a weird number of days. It seems weirdly so close to 360 which is the amount of degrees in a circle. I like where ur heads at. Why have a fake new year? Why not have 30 days to every month? Or 28 like the lunar calendar? Idk, the math is beyond me. The clock time is probably there to fool you, so ur math would be fudged to begin with. There's probably more or less than 24 hours in a day. it would just be difficult to prove

       Yeah our system for keeping up with time is terrible. None of it makes any sense to me. It is pretty sad when the supposed "most advanced civilization" the world has know is the worst at keeping track of time. The Mayan calendar was by far Thur most advanced calendar system our planet has ever seen and that was thousands of years ago.

       So, you are predicting that some unspecified but significant event is going to happen at some unspecified time after the Solstice. Y'know, you might just be right. Let us know when it happens and we'll give you full credit for your perceptive prescience.
