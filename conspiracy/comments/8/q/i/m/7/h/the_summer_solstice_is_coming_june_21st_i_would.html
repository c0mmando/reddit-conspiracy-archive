<p>How am I shutting down discussion?  You claimed that the date for the solstice is false.  I&#39;ve showed how you can check for yourself that they are or are not fake.  Set some alarms for sunset and sunrise on those three days and see for yourself if the 21st is the longest day.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice. Appreciate your input.  That&#39;s all I need to drop the false calendar angle. But I still stand by my prediction.  The why of it having to do with solstices and equinoxes is to be determined. Whether they do or not. It Could be sun worship or Masonic codes or anything</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here is the thing. You could look at this as the elite using or current calendar system as a perversion of our natural cycles. If you think logically about our current system it does not align with what happens in nature. So the winter solstice is on dec 21 it the shortest day of the year afterward the days become longer. In many ancient cultures this was the beginning of the new year. We have went against that logic and have shifted the new year around 10 days later. So maybe this does have credibility if things are happening 10 days after events. Just a thought hope that makes sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh beautiful. Nicely put. Also the year is messed up by the leap year and daylight savings time which is complete bullshit and everyone knows it. 365 is a weird number of days. It seems weirdly so close to 360 which is the amount of degrees in a circle. I like where ur heads at. Why have a fake new year? Why not have 30 days to every month? Or 28 like the lunar calendar? Idk, the math is beyond me. The clock time is probably there to fool you, so ur math would be fudged to begin with. There&#39;s probably more or less than 24 hours in a day. it would just be difficult to prove </p>
