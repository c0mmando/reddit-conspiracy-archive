       I do wonder if my linking to this comment was what prompted the removal (if so, I somewhat regret it, but again if so, this exposed has exposed the corrupt of
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews

       Ceddit appears to have gotten most of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see [censored], I think it's typically automod which removes the comment before pushshift (ceddit's backend) has a chance to save the comment.

       I think you just have to wait a minute for it to load. Ceddit/snew.github loads the removed content async after the page load and can sometimes take a bit of time.

       If by demonstrating when certain threads are being actively targeted and brigaded is "making a point", then yes, that's why I personally think this is an effective way to help illustrate what has been occurring on a much more frequent basis as of late.

       To ban totes, but then to manually approve certain post by the bot only when it fits the mods stance, is pretty lame tbh. But I get it. Needing a boogieman is a good way to keep a conspiracy going. Easy to blame a brigade when there is no evidence that there might be one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods picking and choosing what the users see? Should be a conspiracy in itself. Hell, that is what this very topic the top mod here is complaining about!

       Sir, I wish you the best.  At this time there is in our nation and in our lives a crisis of confidence.  The unity required to resolve these issues is not impossible.  Whereas it will take a degree of patience and compassion to achieve this it is not impossible.  I understand if you are comfortable and confident about the future.  Many many of us are very skeptical of what is to come and how best to communicate our concerns.  The measure of this condition and the nature of our attention will confirm whether or not we possess the discipline to rectify the imbalances.  I felt it was necessary to write this comment in response to you because intentions such as yours are counterproductive, antithetical and entirely irrelevant.  Have a great day.

       The 2016 election caused me to despise the DNC due to its actions in Nevada and other states and at the convention.   After which a nationwide "TROLLING' of HRC went on with both Bernie supporters and Trumps crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared this to the 2008 Obama commercial that borrowed shamelessly from the Apple/1984 tv add.  HRC was mercilessly hackled online and throughout social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it seem like a concentrated effort is underway to get ahead of the game for the next election cycle?  Silence dissent, manipulate social media, dismiss criticisms, retaliate,document dump and astroturf negative media stories?

       I was talking with my wife about this in our car trip today. I used starbucks and the kardashians. The next recession will see someone that loses it all taking out a government building or a senator. There will be people that are just getting their lives back in order (repairing credit from forclosures and shit) that get rocked again and that's going to set some people off.

       There are probably some Timothy McVeigh type people out there, losing their minds and it will take is another round of financial misery, outrageous medical bill, perceived Mis-justice by the government... something that will trigger.  Look at how a rash of officer involved shootings resulted in some unstable people actually taking independent action and attacking the police.

       Well, one optimistic way to look at it is that they seem to need to put so much effort into manipulating the people to vote the way they want, so at least they still need us. It shows that we can actually knock them out of power (or at least provide serious disruption) if we were to just wake up. And we should before it is too late.

       By voting for the people that obviously were not supported by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit some bias as a Trump supporter. But I do believe that is exactly what just happened for the first time in a very long time. I think it is pretty obvious how angry he has made the establishment that chose who their two puppet choices would be. It could have been someone like Bernie, just the same. It's just that the DNC had brigaded itself too well that Bernie stood no chance. The Republican party was reeling quite a bit from what they had done in 2008 and 2012 to their supporters. They almost didn't have a choice. And they were willing to burn their own party down to prevent Trump from winning, but the republican party can't so easily get away with brigading at the primary level as the dems can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will do something a lot of people won't do. I will admit my bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a Trump no matter what cultist, but I do very strongly believe that for once, in decades, we did beat the establishment. I didn't even feel that way about Reagan because Bush was foisted on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I am conservative (not a Republican loyalist). I will proudly admit my bias. I would be more likely a libertarian if that party hadn't become infiltrated with anarcho-communists and single-issue stoners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, from my perspective I am winning. And we can't have winners without losers. However, I do believe we, as a whole we should agree that we won a battle against the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we do with that is incredibly important because you can absolutely certain they aren't going to ever allow that to happen again if we don't do something to prevent it now. This is where I have to hope that Trump will be aware of this and do what needs to be done even if it makes the brainwashed masses nash their teeth.

       During the inauguration I could almost taste the resentment and bitterness that both parties held for Trump as they sat behind him, and it made me happy to see their frustration.

       It’s very fair for our political elites to taste the frustration that Americans are forced to eat every day.

       Hillary will be a 74 year old woman wearing adult diapers because she pisses herself every time she coughs.  But you're probably correct.
Nobody born before Color TV, Microwave Ovens or Personal Computers needs to be in political power.

       I remember reading your comment and agreeing. Over 70 years there’s be US/NK tension. If any other president did what trump did yesterday it was be blasted all over. 
Of course it wasn’t stickied. It was trump.

       Definitely got me at the time. I didnt vote but I was rooting for him. The idea of change was very alluring.  I trusted him. I was young and naive. He flopped on almost everything he said he was going to do. Jokes on you Obama. You may have gotten me at the time but you taught me a valuable lesson. I'm sure many others can say the same.

       I was listening to CNN on serius xm to see how they were spinning it.

       They were talking about how trump ending military drills with sk was a concession for a vague promise to denuke

      <p>
       You'd think the thing the left would attack would be the open ended war authorization trump asked for. Instead they attack him for a deal that may lead to unification in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left is not the left of the bush era and before when they were anti war. I don't get it.

       Like I hate trump and I think hes a deep state tool. But if he does something I support...like this thing with kim...I support it.

       They were literally arguing last week that NK had a right to hate us because we had weapons pointing at them and remember how angry they were at Trump for holding the exercises before the Olympics?

       I started listening to NPR right before the election because they nukes our local left leaning talk radio channel just as our local talent became nationally syndicated, didn't renew their contract. NPR suddenly went Russia mad and still reports as its a proven fact.

       The left abandoned those people decades ago, the only time they acknowledge them is to cast derision their way.  Oh, and then when they inevitably freak out when blue collar middle class people didn't vote for the candidate the new left is pushing on them after sidelining and insulting them the past 4, 8, 12, etc years.

       When you want to feed your family do you vote for the guy who says he'll open the coal mine again or the guy who says coal is dirty and we should move on in a nebulous way that won't actually help your situation?  Second guy isn't wrong, but you can't expect a group of out of work coal miners to put a check mark next to his name when the guy hasn't made any gestures that he's going to make your life better and his supporters have spent the last 4 years calling you a backwards hick.

       Had a similar occurrence last night. They posted a "NowThis" propaganda video, and then just nuked the thread when I called out the blatant misleading efforts in it. Sad state of affairs, although what we saw last night with all the good folks coming out and fighting for real Reddit was a wonderful thing.

       Does anyone know if anyone's put together an chart/infographic/video etc. showing just how much r/politics switched after Bernie dropped out. Also, 9/11/16 when HRC collapsed and the day after the election would be interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone on the difference was palpable, but it'd be interesting to quantify it. Like, which accounts started/stopped posting on those days, or changed their habits or opinions?

       I thought the switch was hilarious and obvious, and I even joked about reposting all the anti-Hillary articles after she won the nomination.  It seemed really “We’ve always been at war with Eastasia” in there afterwards.  Fox News articles critical of Hillary we’re hitting the front page, if I recall correctly.

       For all the know Hillary is a ruthless bitch, so I'm glad she's not the president. Even though some people think she's an innocent political Angel. This bitch is crazy, once she lost she moved the focus of her bots to push an excessive anti-trump narrative on Reddit. Some hate is understandable but not that extreme to where I have to block politics, because that shit is ridiculously bias. Reddit was never pro Hillary, but once she started realizing this made a quick call to Soros. If the data of the number people singing up for Reddit accounts around that timeframe was available, It would be interesting to analyze.

       It was such a rare, brutally honest moment from someone who's seen things from the inside. It'd be like a priest posting that there is no heaven or something. We expect bullshit from the politicians, so we always take their words with a shaker of salt, but this is so flayed-open and raw like finding your parent's credit report.

       I would beg to differ and state that their goal is to appear so, when in actuality, they are deep state paid stooges who simply are conducting censorship and seek to divide and conquer the American people. I have had some experience with them and had my antiwar posts and previous account shadowbanned by the moderators of those groups you mention. Their behavior is not progressive, nor is it liberal minded. It is instead fascist in nature and extremely controlling.

       The gatekeepers have the News, World News sections of Reddit locked down tighter than they have Wikipedia locked down. As a matter of fact they have ALL major forums locked down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've managed to post news that was censored after being up in the news section at Reddit for a while. On the day it went up it received 22,000 views. It took the gatekeepers about 12 hours to realize it was there and didn't fit the allowed narrative so they removed it. Then my Wordpress site quickly revealed no views. I posted it in Conspiracy the next day and it received roughly 450 views. Just goes to show how influential those news sections are and why they want them locked down and steered. By the way, that post that I put up was from The Independent UK and had to do with the White Helmets in Syria who are terrorists. So its quite obvious why they wanted that one hidden from public viewing. Have no doubt, what we are allowed to see information wise is completely controlled by censors.

       My favorite is when people I'm debating (often about censorship, hilariously enough) will reply with shit like "hah! You couldn't take the heat so you deleted your comments". I'll then post a thread screenshot of my unedited comments and explain to them what shadow-banning/shadow-deletion is.

       They banned me and have some way to see anyone who connects to my router at home or work and bans them too. Its the biggest shit ever. I posted a well sourced response that shirt down the Israeli army shills and so I was banned for antisemitism even though I am a jew. In that thread they let 6 comments calling to kill Jews and remove Israel so they could say "see look at what Jews anf israel face. Fuck r/worldbews

       Dude, you're saying it's good these comments are getting upvotes, while linking to those comments, and then asserting with nothing even approaching proof that anyone linking here is brigading. TMOR uses np links too, but it doesn't count when it's someone you don't like.

       No, and thats what I'm trying to figure out. Its not about the content, but it is about one sidedness. Insisting he was doing things he wasn't, but then saying they were a kin to doing them, but not. Did he follow the rules? It appears so. Why are you complaining? I would be willing to bet that he has had to delete peoples shit that he didn't want to just because of the rules. Is he able to skirt the rules? Yes. so are you. whats the fucking problem my friend? why are you here? What is your motive?

       I checked TMOR just now.  I saw no np links being used for reddit on the first page.  I did see an automod comment saying not to participate, but that's lip service.  AP used a np.reddit link which means he's not being hypocritical here.

       np.reddit links don't actually prevent you from voting though, they just tell you "hey don't do that". It's just as much lip service as what you say the automod there is.

       Sure, you can still vote on a np.reddit link but for many subreddits, visiting with np literally prevents your votes from showing up on the actual page, unless you manually change the web address or have CSS disabled.  It.is designed to mute the brigade effect considerably.

       If you really want to go into the church and shout "fuck", just point to the many ample examples of media bias and yellow journalism that NPR provides.  They don't like that shit.  That's dog whistle central for the DNC - it's like a cult.

       Whoever nuked your comment also deleted all sub comments. For regular mods, this is actually quite difficult to do, since they have to click on each individual comment and click delete one by one. For a default sub like worldnews, the rate of growth can out match a single mod. I suspect whoever did it has site admin privilege that allows them to do tree transversal to wipe out the entire tree.

       Yeah, Reddit seems to have become nothing but a large speakeasy for the unhinged left. r/NoShitSherlock is just a bunch of random memes and “stories” making fun of trump. r/politics is nothing but SJW idiots. Most subs that are supposed to be political in anyway are full of imbeciles who downvote and or ban you for having remotely “right wing” views
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s kinda sad actually .., luckily the idiots on Reddit don’t really represent the population as a whole , which is why trump won in 2016, and if the Dems keep up this idiotic charade they’re on... will win in 2020

       The mods here aren't much better themselves. I've seen some of the childish nonsense they engage in with the other posters here. This whole website has been compromised to be honest. I come here to glance from time to time but I try to avoid Reddit aside from my hometown's sub. Can't take anything I read here serious since it's a brainwashing tool

       Yeah whenever I see a whole thread nuked I always pull up removeddit just because I want to see what happened.  Sometimes comments are removed too quickly to be saved which makes me wonder why they we're deleted.  What's the point of forming any kind of meaningful discourse if the mods can just shut you down if they don't like your opinion?

       There are probably some Timothy McVeigh type people out there, losing their minds and it will take is another round of financial misery, outrageous medical bill, perceived Mis-justice by the government... something that will trigger.  Look at how a rash of officer involved shootings resulted in some unstable people actually taking independent action and attacking the police.

Nobody born before Color TV, Microwave Ovens or Personal Computers needs to be in political power.
