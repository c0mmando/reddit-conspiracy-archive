<p>This is clearly a set up for Trump to let his guard down. When the big day comes, North Korea will likely reveal mothballed nuclear weapons and turn its backs against the US.</p>

<p>The US no longer cares for its allies in Europe, Japan and South Korea and instead begins thinking the communist superpowers like Russia and Korea are his allies as well as Israel, and it is going to pay for believing the wrong people are its allies.</p>

<p>Murica FIRST!</p>

<p>NK isnt doing this for the good of their people, they have a brutal dictatorship and Kim didnt just wake up one day and decide to be a decent human. </p>

<p>They want something, and I have a feeling it will directly counter America and its allies. </p>

<p>Im anticipating Kim requesting America remove its troops from the DMZ and when we of course refuse Kim can use that as fodder to show how the west doesnt want peace and revamp his nuclear ambitions guilt free in front of his people</p>

<p>Lol NK is a long ways away from miniaturizing a nuke to fit on an ICBM. Not only that but SK has a dozen missile defense systems in place. Shelling would do more damage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I think it&#39;s probable that Kim wants to go the way of China and open up to foreign business (especially American) to come in change things in terms of wealth flowing into the country. The way China did. NK could be another cheap labor market just like China. </p>

<p>I would like to see NK open to the world some more, but I have a problem with the fact that Kim is a brutal dictator. That has to change.</p>
