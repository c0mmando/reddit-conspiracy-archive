       I think it's really funny how everyone who's posting on reddit is focused on net neutrality repeal as a means to bleed cash out of consumers with various bundles and packages. It's not about money; bundles and packages aren't going to start cropping up because any sane telecommunications company will simply out do the competition by posting a "complete" internet package for X dollars (the previous internet rate) and the others will have to follow suit (I do get that many parts of the rural US have no competition but Satellite internet is also a thing becoming widely available which broadens the range of companies accessible to all). If anything, repealing net neutrality might cost some telecoms because certain users may only want to use the internet for news and videos and choose to save money; instead of paying for the entire internet like other people they will pay less for a smaller package.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, we've been having the "fake news" narrative thrown in our face for months as the media tries to retain the yoke it has on the opinions of the populace and this gives telecommunications the legal grounds to entirely restrict access to anything they want.
This is about American telecommunications restricting your access to any information or opinion they deem unfit and simply not having a website come up and/or return a 404. They have legal grounds now that net neutrality is gone.

       So it's about money then?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the base rate for the internet will be any less than what you are paying now, then you are extremely optimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       About 10 years ago I was paying £15 a month, all in, for my mobile phone (minutes and data were unlimited). Before I downsized, I was paying £35 a month for 500 mins, limited data and unlimited (3000) texts, which fell under the 'fair usage policy'.
      </p>
      <p>
       "but your phones do more" Is a bullshit excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet will only become more expensive. No board members are going to want to take a cut.

       I think you are misunderstanding me; I am not insinuating that base internet will be cheaper, but the basic all access internet package we've all enjoyed will stay the same price. When cellphones did only calling and texting the price to just call an text was the same when internet became available on a phone, now you just pay more if you want internet on your phone...in fact, rates for national/international calling have all but plummeted because the internet has made long distance calls insanely cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless there is widespread collusion across all telecommunications companies there is no reason for prices to go up; the cost to render the service is unchanged and the service itself isn't being improved upon....you can only gouge the consumer for so much and they've kind of ironed out that number since some providers are the only game in town already.

       There will be widespread collusion between the telecommunications companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime there is a shift, environment change or any opportunity, companies will put their prices up and then go out of the way to confuse the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Euro was introduced, the price of shit skyrocketed for the first two years because the general public was still getting to grips with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       DLC in computer games is exactly the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mobile phone plans (already discussed)
      </p>
      <p>
       Air travel has increased due to 'internet' and 'terrorism'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Car costs have increased due to 'high oil prices' 'green taxes' 'congestion zones' all the while the roads are still in a dog shit state of repair.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the internet goes through a shift, the prices will go up. The only positive side is, like you say, people will go for the 'social media' package (twitter, facebook, reddit, youtube, Instagram and some cheap shite msm sites thrown in).
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at Sky. They started with some modestly priced packages, then redesigned the packages so you had one channel you liked, filled with guff and bumph.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be the same. The price will go up, the public will push-back and we will see the Dotcom bubble burst for the second time.

       You've provided a huge array of examples that aren't really analogous though....
      </p>
      <p>
       The Euro is a more complex issue than you're letting on.
The price of shit skyrocketed because most commodities are tied to the price of oil; Transportation of goods, growing crops, running construction machines, plastics, all oil. The fact that Russia is the primary source of oil in Europe and wasn't included in the Euro might have something to do with the change in prices associated with bootstrapping a currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       DLC from games has also experienced open revolt from the consumer; developers that create complete games that don't need DLC have flourished (Witcher 3, God of War etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mobile Phone plans have only gone up in price to match inflation and increased services. Texting has gotten cheaper and cheaper (unlimited packages!), as has national and international calling. Are you complaining you have to pay more because there is a new service being sold (the internet on phones)?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Sky makes a shitty package and any other telecom company makes a not shitty package then Sky loses money.

       I know what you're saying but i'm a lazy poster so I will just say :
      </p>
      <p>
       Euro prices went up and confused everybody. I was in France a week after the change-over and it was crazy. Every country since then that has changed their currency has seen huge increases in prices across the board. Infact, in one Eastern European country (again, I was there for the change) has dual currency and prices are cheaper in the native currency than the EU. Yes, there is some fiddling on both sides, retailers will offer higher prices on the Euro if they don't want to change to the Euro. However, prices rising across all of Europe after the change was a universal effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       DLC used to be free. All content made off of the backs of the love of the art of making games. Now we celebrate companies that offer shit for 'free'. Let's not get started on the GOTY editions...Most games, especially online shooters have got to the stage where you have to pay in order to 'play' (be anything other than a walking target) to the point where skill comes a huge second to buying better guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mobile phones, like I said in my other post "more shit" doesn't count. I had free texts, unlimited, like truly unlimited and free calls. International calls across the EU are now charged at a standard rate and why the fuck should I pay extra for phone calls I will never need? (Added service, increased price for something I don't want). No new services are being sold outside of the internet, which if I could have a service where I don't pay for any internet at all I would be chuffed, seems as I spend 99% of my phone time on my wifi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sky made shitty packages so their competitors made a shitty package. There was a very brief time when Sky and NTL were battling, but Sky ran away with it and now offer ridiculous packages for the prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we bring inflation into this and wage rises etc, these packages should cost less.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, any time a company can have you for more money they will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll add a bonus one in : Sugar tax/reduction of sugar in chocolate bars. My mars bar has shrunk, yet I pay more for it. There is less shit inside the package, yet I pay more. Why? Because the company saw a chance to downsize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one? When Kraft bought Cadburys, they launched a 5 pack of crème eggs (that taste like shit) of the same price as a pack of 6. Yet, these eggs were cheaper to produce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cigarettes, constantly going up in price, yet I can only buy a maximum of 16 in a pack, instead of 20. Tobacco, of the hand rolled variety, had to chance its' packaging to hide the brand name. Guess what? The minimum pouch went from 25g to 30g with a small price increase to boot. Yet, the packaging is all universal now, so that will save some money, economy of scale means I should pay less for more...
      </p>
      <p>
       It happens everytime and the internet will be no exception.

       A large corporation can negotiate to make sure all ISPs share their content equally.  When ISPs can silently manipulate the content they provide, that means they can limit competition not just from other ISPs but from other products their corporate overlords also sell.

       That and the lobbying efforts of the major ISPs to prevent any more competition from entering the market. There is no credibility to the competition argument; it was cooked up by major ISPs like Comcast and AT&amp;T.

       Dems didn't pass a law, because no one thought there needed to be a law until 2010.  After the Comcast/Bittorrent case, Dems didn't control the House in order to pass a law, so Obama went through the FCC.

       It was assumed the FCC has the power to regulate these internet companies until Comcast v FCC in 2010.  After that, Democrats thought it was important to preserve the government's ability to regulate.  Republicans were, and are, opposed to it so they weren't going to get a law passed due to GOP control of the House.

       Why would telecommunications companies have to restrict anything? That's what google, facebook, youtube, and reddit are for. They already control and censor the opinions and information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you want the president's appointee of the regulatory body that censors TV to control the internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       NN is a power hand off from one regulatory body to another. NN takes the power from the federal trade commission FTC, the body that protects american consumers, and gives it to the FCC the body that censors TV.

       Well if your sphere of websites is only those 3 then you have nothing to lose I suppose (I guess we know where you get all your info....), but if you decide you want to browse multiple news sites like BBC, Al-Jazeera, Xinhuanet or any other multitude of outside sources of information to get a better idea of what is happening in the world or maybe it's just research/lectures what have you then you could be cut off very easily from gaining perspective outside of the US.

       Personally I think if US elite fail to convince the world that they need their "freedom". US will close itself off by closing the internet. Google already does this, some search resukts are utter trash, and only go for 2 pages. Where as speaking to US people some dont have any problems with it.

       YES! Its hilarious because at my age (in my 20s), you remember mobile companies offering unlimited internet plans (cingular...) way back in the day. As phones got better (iPhone) and social media/mobile internet usage rose, companies started selling internet into packages (3GB a month for $X etc).

       However, T-mobile started offering unlimited internet and now most companies, if not all, have an unlimited option again. Dont underestimate competition.

       You've provided a huge array of examples that aren't really analogous though....
      </p>
      <p>
       The Euro is a more complex issue than you're letting on.
The price of shit skyrocketed because most commodities are tied to the price of oil; Transportation of goods, growing crops, running construction machines, plastics, all oil. The fact that Russia is the primary source of oil in Europe and wasn't included in the Euro might have something to do with the change in prices associated with bootstrapping a currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       DLC from games has also experienced open revolt from the consumer; developers that create complete games that don't need DLC have flourished (Witcher 3, God of War etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mobile Phone plans have only gone up in price to match inflation and increased services. Texting has gotten cheaper and cheaper (unlimited packages!), as has national and international calling. Are you complaining you have to pay more because there is a new service being sold (the internet on phones)?
