       That is true,maybe there's nothing of value like oil/gold and the like but then there is a decent population that could be exploited.

When asked if was worth it, Madeleine Albright replied that it absolutely was. Ruthless and heartless is a dangerous combination. Anyway, check out Venezuela for another example. Economic sanctions are devastating, and

       I've heard the theory that Gaddafi was overthrown because he was creating his own currency. Sidney Blumenthal said in an email that one reason France was willing to join the fight was because Gaddafi's currency was challenging the

       I've never seen any evidence in favor of the petrodollar theory. Do you have some?

       Also, that doesn't explain why the rebels would set up a bank so quickly. Why would it matter when they set it up?
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious explanation is that they needed money.

       Almost all central banks are owned by the state. In what way was the new bank "tied to the Western central banking system"?

       Saddam largely switched to euros and pissed off the dollar side of the cartel but the euro side was happy.  He had to go.  Gaddaffi pissed off both of those currency cartels in addition to every one one in the world.  He absolutely had to go immediately.

       I've never seen the slightest evidence that
       <em>

       cared that Saddam switched. He requested the change to euros in the UN's Oil-for-food program and it was approved within a few weeks without any opposition.

       The theory that Saddam's switched to euros caused his downfall apparently originated in the 2005 book, "Petrodollar Warfare", by William R. Clark. I looked through it to find what evidence he had that it was a motivation for the war, but I didn't find any.

       It's a fairly common conspiracy, but one that doesn't actually have any basis in fact. Iran hasn't used the Petrodollar since 2003, China is more and more using the Yuan, and I think there are other countries starting to use the EURO to buy and sell oil.

       We must live in quite simply different realities.  It has made dramatically more sense since the 1970's after the US exited the Bretton Woods system.  They went from gold backed to oil backed, meaning that you needed dollars to buy oil.  The US was a huge economy and due to this oil &lt;-&gt; dollar de facto situation it became the petrodollar.  You saying that this is exactly the moment it stopped making sense is bizzarro reality flipped on its head and shaken.

       But that has fuck all to do with what currency they use to trade oil. Even if the US invaded and forced a regime change, they don't necessarily need them to change back to using the dollar. The dollar as a global currency to trade oil is only used because it is easy, not because warhawks demand it. Changing from using the dollar to using some other currency often comes with anti-Americanism and other factors that accumulates with a confrontation with the US, but there is no real evidence to suggest that the US will invade any country that stops using the dollar to see oil. Iran isn't an enemy of the US because it stopped using the dollar to sell oil, but because their rhetoric is violent and they do shitty things.

      <p>
       I have no idea what you're implying here. China is using the RMB and the EURO more and more to sell commodities internationally. They are moving away from using the dollar. And the US doesn't care, because the dollar as a currency for international trade is only a convenience, not a necessity to forestall an invasion.

      <p>
       Just because countries find it easier to use dollars to buy oil doesn't mean that the US has an oil backed economy. Since the oil shock in 1973 the US has benefited more from the free fluctuating oil prices than any other country, but this is a side effect, not some diabolical goal. During the 1970 and early 1980's oil was being traded in London using the Pound Sterling, but this was stopped in the 1980's because it made it more difficult to stabilize the British economy. Countries stopped using Sterling because the dollar was an easier currency to use to trade with other countries because it was easier, not because the US forced them all to.  A currency backed by the price of oil is ridiculous, because it fluctuates so much. No country would do it willingly unless it has a larger economic or industrial base that can help to support it. The petrodollar is a sign of a strong global economy, but as a foundation of a national economy it really isn't a good idea. The Arabic OPEC states have controlled the worth of oil since the 1970's and this determines the cost of oil, which if the US economy and currency was really dependent on the price of oil would meant that OPEC controls the US economy and currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The petrodollar is real, but the reasons for it and the extent that the US "values" it is mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, in the last 15 years or so the US has become so independent in oil production that the global oil trade hardly effects domestic prices.

       Most people confuse "petrodollar" with USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Petrodollar" just means revenue made from oil exports. It does not refer to the USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       It matters nothing for the USD in which currency oil is traded.

       No central banks are owned by the state, except in Syria, Iran, Cuba, Russia and North Korea. Formerly, the banks in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya (and other countries surrounding Russia, and various other countries elsewhere, depending on how far back you go) were owned by the state, but no longer. China has it's on deal on this racketeering.

       I hope the pattern is obvious. Search this sub for that topic; many people have done a great job explaining it.

       I agree. Should the smart ones not be able to profit from their research and hard work while simultaneously diluting the stack of the whale? The money comes in and we get ahead of the trend, but make no mistake, that trend is only going up because this technology truly is revolutionary.

       Sure, and that debate is robust amongst the entire sector. There are already stable coins, coins that are pegged to one USD and backed by a basket of crypto assets. the only problem is simplicity for new users. That will come with time, but the underlying tech is sufficiently decentralized at this point.

       Just look at China and the facilities it is building in a number of Pacific islands. The loans will be structured in a way that they will seem affordable initially, but will require that more sovereignty and infrastructure is given over to the money lenders.

       5 years after the Corporations take the lions share.  Then a wealthy influx of cash from the populace with a great rate of return 15-25% to garner interest then it will slowly melt and end up with an 8-12% rate for about a decade or two before slowly falling to a baseline 6%.

       So, only Iran and Cuba left without a BIS bank? Probably only Cuba since Iran deal with euro, which is also a part of BIS? I think even Cuba is gone.... I imagine Cuba must have global dealing, how do they do that without getting involved with BIS, directly or indirectly.
