        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>God forbid you have any doubts or questions. All hail Trump and Q no matter what. According to this sub they are a biblical prophesy come true.  Everything is “trust the plan” no matter what happens. “No coincidences” no matter if they simply are. I am intrigued by Q but I learned long ago that blind trusting faith is what leads sleep to slaughter. I was banned for being a voice that asked questions. I think we all know how that will end. If Trump fails or if Q ends up being a false lead they will cling to the idea that the bad guys won over our true saviors. They quote scripture and repeat meaningless chants to shut out all discourse. This is exactly why CBTS was shut down. It’s selective racism at best. Thoughts immediately pivot to praise whatever Trump does. NK.? Trump is a peace warrior. Canada? They are screwing us over. Russia? Trump is winning. Mexico? Hell yeah we need a wall. Syria? He is playing them. Israel? Trump knows best. Iran? Listen to Bolton his latest pick. None of it makes sense or is consistent. Ask why and you are told to trust the plan of a failed business man who operates from the art of the deal.  A tired old strategy of bullying and bullshitting. He is a master of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want o live in an unchallenged echo chamber and hear no ideas that run counter to yours you might not belong in a democracy. I get how it sucks being the minority. I was in it after 9/11 and the Bush war march. Then when Obama continued it after promising hope and change. But I certainly stood up for my beliefs and engaged my fellow citizens no matter how much I disagreed with them.  I didn’t seek for them to be silenced. On the contrary, I talked with them. One of these approaches is not like the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may be true that it is more of a conspiracy sub, but digging through the sub is difficult. It&#39;s a bunch of blind, fanatical, sheep that who follow to their master&#39;s tune. The amount of nationalism and worship they have for trump and this country is nauseating. They themselves are only slightly more awake than the average person hanging by the thread their master Q has them strung up by. &quot;Oh are you hungry?  Here is another little bread crumb to feed my puppets.&quot;   </p>

<p>Btw I do think Q is an insider but don&#39;t give a shit about sifting through all that nonsense.  I really feel like people think by trying to decipher his post that they themselves are helping to change the world and that is really crazy. Figuring out what he is posting about isn&#39;t changing anything about the world. It&#39;s all ready happening. If they would only follow Q&#39;s advice and trust the plan and shut up about it a little maybe someone could actual figure some of it out. I do know one thing for sure Donald trump is not the second coming of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p>What is a sanctuary for you? Is it a place where a minority (of opinion) can gather and share their thoughts without censorship?</p>

<p>What about a majority (of opinion)? Would the vast abstract place they occupy also be considered a sanctuary, for the purpose of propagating their own ideas with no opposition?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He won, get over it. You can&#39;t claim to be the minority any more, assuming the implication is that real Americans voted for him.</p>

<p>Either way, for me it comes down to fair moderation. No one&#39;s banning right-leaning folks from <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> or <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> for voicing their opinion. People are free to downvote if they want to. The same cannot be said of the right&#39;s signature safe spaces here on reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe not for all your points, but the psychology behind Q supporters and supporters of political parties is the same. They each think their chosen idol has the power and the inclination to &quot;fix the system;&quot; that the problems we face are not due to our political system itself, but only the wrong people running that system. Once the &quot;good guys&quot; get in power and rid the government of the &quot;bad guys,&quot; everything will be better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would imagine that there are 3 reasons people are drawn to their beliefs. Part logic, part social, and part emotional. To me, the Q group leaves out the logic entirely. Because they look at the world and say all this must not be true because the emotional and social aspect to this belief structure are more important. </p>

<p>So they see Trump is being investigated. They say this must not be true, Mueller must be secretly working for Trump and the reality everyone else sees is fake. </p>

<p>Trump clearly has had some problems with Sessions. But Q keeps saying trust Sessions, so they look at the reality the rest of us see and say that must not be true. It&#39;s all a show so the deep state doesnt know what&#39;s coming. </p>

<p>Q told them Trump made a deal with North Korea months ago. So they see the talks going on right now and think it&#39;s all a show. </p>

<p>These are illogical concepts where their beliefs are entirely driven by the emotion theyve invested into what some messiah on the internet as told them to be true. And that&#39;s why it doesnt matter what Q says, hes right by definition just by saying something. So I understand people are drawn to groups. But this Q group doesnt act like every other group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s certainly a difference between your average Q supporter and your average Dem/Republican supporter, but I think it&#39;s more a matter of degree than kind. I don&#39;t think most D/R voters <em>are</em> using much logic to arrive at their conclusions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>their beliefs are entirely driven by the emotion theyve invested into what some messiah on the internet as told them to be true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true to a large, though lesser, extent with D/R voters as well. People support major party candidates because they like the promises these politicians make, and they think the politicians are capable and willing to fulfill these promises. When they fail to fulfill them, their supporters accept the stories that it&#39;s just &quot;the other side&#39;s&quot; fault. </p>

<p>Sure, some D/R&#39;s lose support and reject their former candidates, but so have many one-time Q supporters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want o live in an unchallenged echo chamber and hear no ideas that run counter to yours you might not belong in a democracy. I get how it sucks being the minority. I was in it after 9/11 and the Bush war march. Then when Obama continued it after promising hope and change. But I certainly stood up for my beliefs and engaged my fellow citizens no matter how much I disagreed with them.  I didn’t seek for them to be silenced. On the contrary, I talked with them. One of these approaches is not like the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left dominates with sound logic, not by banning dissenting opinions. That’s the difference. The left doesn’t have sanctuaries aside from maybe late stage capitalism.</p>

<p>The right demands safe spaces because their ideas don’t hold up to scrutiny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He won, get over it. You can&#39;t claim to be the minority any more, assuming the implication is that real Americans voted for him.</p>

<p>Either way, for me it comes down to fair moderation. No one&#39;s banning right-leaning folks from <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> or <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> for voicing their opinion. People are free to downvote if they want to. The same cannot be said of the right&#39;s signature safe spaces here on reddit.</p>
