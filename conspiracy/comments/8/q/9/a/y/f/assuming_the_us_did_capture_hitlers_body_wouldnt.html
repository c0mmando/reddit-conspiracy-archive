I know some people will say for ethical reasons they wouldn&#39;t but come on.  Look at the history of science, ethics get put to the side when there is some extremely desirable information to be had.</p>

<p>So wouldn&#39;t it make sense that, if they didn&#39;t secretly have the tech at that time, they would try and preserve the DNA for a later date at which point they can create a Hitler baby... maybe plant him with some unknowing adoptive family, maybe stick him in a Truman show type scenario... or maybe full on artificially inseminate someone either without their knowledge or via some false &quot;abduction&quot; experience..  </p>

<p>I realize this all probably sounds far out even for us... but like I said it&#39;s not so much that I believe this as my mind just wandering to, &quot;why wouldn&#39;t they take the opportunity to learn about this person who is such an enigma and made such a drastic impact on the world.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My twitter account with over 1000 followers was shut down in 2016 for being a russian bot.  I&#39;ve emailed them dozens of times and they won&#39;t even respond to me.  My youtube went from getting 100k views in one month spread out over 4 political videos and then suddenly I went to virtually zero month after month.</p>

<p>I have been systematically removed and shadow banned from any possible forum where I can have a voice and it&#39;s actually a bit maddening because these days internet is the forum of choice for public communication.  So it&#39;s like we just don&#39;t get rights because we all had computers shoved in front of us and they can call it private property.</p>

<p>Coming here and getting downvoted as well as constantly suspended by the admins is just like the straw on top.</p>
