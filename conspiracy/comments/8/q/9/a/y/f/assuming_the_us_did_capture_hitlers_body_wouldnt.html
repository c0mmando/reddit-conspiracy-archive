       This isn't so much a "I believe this" as much as it's a "if they have the capability why
       <em>
        woulndn't
       </em>
       they".  I know some people will say for ethical reasons they wouldn't but come on.  Look at the history of science, ethics get put to the side when there is some extremely desirable information to be had.
      </p>
      <p>
       So wouldn't it make sense that, if they didn't secretly have the tech at that time, they would try and preserve the DNA for a later date at which point they can create a Hitler baby... maybe plant him with some unknowing adoptive family, maybe stick him in a Truman show type scenario... or maybe full on artificially inseminate someone either without their knowledge or via some false "abduction" experience..
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize this all probably sounds far out even for us... but like I said it's not so much that I believe this as my mind just wandering to, "why wouldn't they take the opportunity to learn about this person who is such an enigma and made such a drastic impact on the world."

       I understand that the general consensus is that Hitler fled to Argentina and lived out the rest of his life there.. but they could still have managed to capture his body if they were able to track him down.

       My twitter account with over 1000 followers was shut down in 2016 for being a russian bot.  I've emailed them dozens of times and they won't even respond to me.  My youtube went from getting 100k views in one month spread out over 4 political videos and then suddenly I went to virtually zero month after month.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been systematically removed and shadow banned from any possible forum where I can have a voice and it's actually a bit maddening because these days internet is the forum of choice for public communication.  So it's like we just don't get rights because we all had computers shoved in front of us and they can call it private property.

       I mean how would they replicate a fully developed person shaped by a lifetime of unique circumstances

       Many people could probably end up a dictator if they lived an identical life to what he did.

       No no no they aren't trying to replicate the personality.  I'm saying they take the person, put him in a
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       situation and see how he develops.  I would imagine they would want to see if he turns out similar or totally different.  You know?

       Lol. DUDE actually that's funny you say that because I was watching the g7 and at one point I saw her and kinda thought "Whoa does she kinda look ilke hitler?"  It's in the eyes a little bit for sure.  I actually googled comparisons and one interesting thing is that pictures of both their mothers came up and
       <em>
        they

       looked reeeeal similar.

       If you post in a conspiracy forum about how interesting it would be to study Hitler DNA then you should expect the reaction you are getting, and I expected thicker skin from you, my comment was pretty mild.

       Thicker skin?  All I did was reply to you, my comment was pretty mild too.  I don't think saying "save that crap" when someone comes at me telling me I'm "buying into" anything without knowing me is unreasonable.

       If you post in a conspiracy forum about how interesting it would be to study Hitler DNA then you should expect the reaction you are getting, and I expected thicker skin from you, my comment was pretty mild.

       I am more speaking along the lines of this type of perspective btw:

        these are not premises, these are assumptions

       If Hitler was legit -- that is, he truly did fight the global banks and lose -- the vengence would have been extreme. Something like... clone baby Hitlers to serve as rape/torture/cannibal fodder for centuries.

       Guess we will see.  If it was real it was a big fuckin deal.  Quote from EU official, "He is disrupting the global order."  Like I said, I don't see how he lives if it's real.  But then again maybe they can kill him without killing him... martyring is not the preferred way anymore.  Public humiliation is.
