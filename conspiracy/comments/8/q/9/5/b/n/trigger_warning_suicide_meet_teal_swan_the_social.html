        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been listening to a new podcast recently called &quot;The Gateway&quot; by Gizmodo. You can find it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-gateway/id1387560474?mt=2">HERE.</a></p>

<p>The podcast follows the reporter’s investigation into a “social media guru” named Teal Swan. Here are a few of her quotes and ideas: </p>

<p>&quot;You cannot say suicide is wrong without saying death is wrong.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t make mistakes.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You need to decide to commit to life or don&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Death is like a reset button for a life that&#39;s become to miserable... maybe the best option for some people.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Death feels incredible -- a gift you would give yourself.&quot; </p>

<p>Teal has been known, when confronted or questioned, to accuse followers who do not personally feel suicidal that they are suicidal, and claims that she can &quot;see their thoughts.&quot; </p>

<p>Teal claims to have special abilities, such as seeing people&#39;s &quot;color,&quot; and I don&#39;t think she&#39;s referring to race.
Teal has encouraged followers to discontinue the use of anti-depressant drugs so that they can achieve some sort of spiritual awakening. </p>

<p>Teal claims to help folks uncover &quot;repressed memories&quot; of sexual abuse that may have occured during childhood, but some wonder if she is actually planting false memories in already vulnerable people.</p>

<p>Teal is on all the major social media sites, and has a fuckton of followers. I&#39;m not going to link to her pages aside from the youtube video below, but you can easily find them if you want to go down the rabbit hole of her craziness. </p>

<p>You can find one of her youtube videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXi7vcnvl5c">here</a> WARNING: Batshit crazy.</p>

<p>This woman is dangerous, and she has amassed a HUGE following online and has a commune in Costa Rica. </p>

<p>Again, you can listen to the podcast where I heard all this information <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-gateway/id1387560474?mt=2">HERE.</a></p>

<p><strong>Please, if you or a friend or family member may be suicidal, reach out for help. REAL help.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>An internet guru named Teal swan has amassed a huge online following despite her controversial views and teachings. Teal has a lot to say about suicide, and it&#39;s not usually what you would think one would say to someone in an already vulnerable emotional and mental state. In fact, one of her first &quot;clients&quot; did in fact kill herself, and many claim that Teal and her tactics may have played a role in her death. Oh, and Teal has a commune down in Costa Rica. Very Jim Jones-esque, if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well heres the thing.... You don&#39;t understand the new age religion. She is speaking on her beliefs in this religion. It&#39;s no different than the huge population believing that some invisible dude in the sky is overseeing everything and listening and responding to prayers. So in the new age religion they believe life will continue after you die, and that you will re incarnate as either a new human or as some other creature. So when she talks about ending life here to begin new is not that far fetched from her beliefs. People have thought like this for many many years, so if someone comes along sees her video and goes hey if i kill myself i can come back then they go do it, it&#39;s not her fault. Is it a beers company fault if they provide beer and someone chooses to drink  themselves to death? No... She is just providing her beliefs just as a beer company provides the beer.</p>

<p>Beliefs are one thing. But to try and convince people who are not suicidal that they in fact do want to kill themselves and say she can read their thoughts is just plain wrong. That is not religion that is some crazy bullshit and it needs to stop, point blank period. </p>

<p>Neither should Teal’s delusional ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol no she is not making people commit suicide. I&#39;ve seen many of her videos as I&#39;ve dabbled in trying this new age beliefs system. She claims to see colour as in peoples auras, many people believe in auras especially in the new age spirituality religion. I don&#39;t believe in all the hooplah but I could make a video talking about having the power to see your colour, does that make it true? No but some people will believe it. So I do think she is a fake, as is every new age spiritual religious person. Well all religion to me is bs so w.e. She just takes the new age stuff and puts it into videos, no powers no nothing. She&#39;s not luring people to live in a sanctuary and stuff to work for her and then to drink the wine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Her whole story is just bizarre, if not completely made up. I&#39;m leaning toward it being bullshit. </p>

<p><a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_Swan">Her Wiki</a>- sorry, it&#39;s in Spanish </p>

<p>One of the reference sources: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006124438/http://jerryjournal.com/the-astonishing-story-of-teal-scott/">Here</a> Terribly written but details of her past. Long story short, she was placed in a cult, tortured for 13 years and then escaped at 19. </p>

<p>Yet we see <a href="http://www.vegasinsider.com/models/photos.cfm/model/4">on this page she was just a small town girl that loved horses and wanted to be a model</a></p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.celestialhealing.com/2013/11/who-and-what-is-teal-scott.html?m=1">this write up to be an interesting take on her as well</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you draw from her various bios, including the since deleted ones on modeling sites, you come up with a CV that looks something like this: </p>

<p>From age 6 to 19 she was in a torture cult which her parents somehow never knew despite the fact that she was living with them and a brother in a two room cabin. At age 12 she was spotted in a horse supply store by a modeling scout from a New York agency and began traveling the world as a model. That would make her 16 in these photographs. </p>

<p>She was also an accomplished equestrian, archer, Telemark skier, fly fisher, and speed skater, some of which is documented. At age 6 she started her apprenticeship with a shaman/accupuncturist which lasted roughly 13 years. One assumes that&#39;s not her crazy cult leader but the timelines do kind of, more or less, rather, exactly coincide. Meanwhile she was being mentored in quantum field theory, which she started apparently at birth, because it was &quot;throughout&quot; the first 19 years of her life. She graduated high school at 16. After that she was off to Beijing to study Qigong and energy healing. And she still found time to become a Wiccan High Priestess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The quotes above aren&#39;t just reflective of one person.  I tend to believe that death is not the ultimate end and that we reincarnate many times as our soul chooses to do.  I think there&#39;s a lot of people that aren&#39;t afraid of death that wouldn&#39;t find much offense in those comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. What I saw was someone who has been in the same mindstates as the people who may be watching the video at the time. There&#39;s no other way of helping someone out without climbing down into the dark and letting them know they aren&#39;t alone. </p>

<p>I quite enjoyed her video and got a lot from it, even as someone who is not suicidal. If anything, it does take awareness to know that the video is NOT meant for everyone, and in fact may be unhelpful for healthy minded people. </p>
