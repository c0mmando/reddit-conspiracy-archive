<p>&#39;&#39; Controversial billionaire George Soros is up in arms about Donald Trump again, claiming the US leader wants to “destroy the world” and needs to be kicked out of office. Donald Trump is the “ultimate narcissist” who “is willing to destroy the world”, Soros told the Washington Post on Saturday. He added that, if the Democratic Party wins the general election this November in a “landslide” and proceeds with an impeachment, he would support removing the president from office.  &#39;&#39;</p>

<p>This system is designed to syphon all wealth into the hands of the very few, the 0.1% (think Rotshchild and co, not bill gates and co)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What will happen to economies, wages international relations if this banking system is dismantled?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Temporary short term turmoil</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who benefits and how from this central banking system being dismantled?</p>

<p>The people, because we get a chance at implementing <em>our</em> banking system, we don&#39;t need those bankers, we can do peer to peer</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are the downsides of it being dismantled?</p>

<p>Short term turmoil but long term fair banking solutions. A public ledger as cryptos have are the banker&#39;s worst nightmares, how do you launder cash you gained illicitly if all the books are public and anyone can look at them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That article you posted doesn&#39;t directly address your topic of a central banking system. The article also offers a very bleak outlook based on Trump&#39;s actions stating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The result will be a world that is less free, less prosperous, and less peaceful, for Americans and others alike.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what was the purpose of posting that article?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Petrodollar and anything connected to it, money based on debt is going down, so the current USD, CAD, EUR and a bunch of others I&#39;m sure but just those 3 is a lot of trouble already</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you might be counting chickens before they hatch here. While global economics are far from calm most of the time and can become turbulent rather quickly based on events, do you really believe FIAT currency will really be done away with so quickly? Do you think the massive economic structures and institutions that have functioned for decades will be simply cease to be if the US president continues to stir the pot and propose economically unsound ideas?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This system is designed to syphon all wealth into the hands of the very few, the 0.1% (think Rotshchild and co, not bill gates and co)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re not wrong that that the 1% and .1% and .001% have benefited tremendously, often gaining the lions share of wealth created, yet can you provide on ideas or evidence that dismantling the current system and replacing it with something else would prevent that from happening. We saw something like this unfold during the birth of the Russian Federation where the control of the economy was &quot;functionally reset&quot; with the opportunity presented to allow people to be involved in a capitalist economy. And the results of that were disastrous. Without strong institutions to enforce fair implementation of the methods used an extreme few managed to wrest the entirety of the Russian economy away from the people using crime, threats and violence. To this day the Russian economy is incredibly anemic, relatively weak for its potential, a victim of extreme graft and corruption. </p>

<p>A hard economic reset in any form presents considerable dangers if the right institutions and rules are not present and enforced to prevent what happened in Russia.</p>

<p>What structures or ideas are in place to mitigate the incredible amounts of damage that would follow a dismantling of current economic systems, and prevent the already extremely powerful from capitalizing on such an event?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Temporary short term turmoil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is your idea of &quot;Temporary short term turmoil&quot;? What evidence or theories are you basing this off that says it would be temporary and or short term? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people, because we get a chance at implementing our banking system, we don&#39;t need those bankers, we can do peer to peer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does that mean though? Which people? where are the numbers of how many people want this? is it 80% of the population? 50%? 30%? How literate are national populations on this issue? What justifies this? &quot;Our&quot; is a peculiar word to use since its inclusive, but who is being included? Is it everyone? Does the global population know that they are being included in this desire to radically change global economics at potentially tremendous expense? Also you say chance, that implies that it won&#39;t necessarily happen. What happens if the chance is missed? What measures are in place to prevent something worse from happening? What is there to stop the extremely powerful from using this chance to seize even more power and wealth?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Short term turmoil but long term fair banking solutions. A public ledger as cryptos have are the banker&#39;s worst nightmares, how do you launder cash you gained illicitly if all the books are public and anyone can look at them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know the turmoil will be short term? Are there systems in place that will guarantee everyone an even start with this new banking system? Why can&#39;t useful banking reform be done to prevent the collapsing of the current economic systems? Why can&#39;t bank reform be done in tandem with integration of cryptos? Why do you think the ideal solution is to smash the machine and replace it with a new one instead of trying to improve upon the good of the existing machine with new parts? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He got asked to run to accomplish certain goals and he&#39;s doing that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When and where was he ever asked to dismantle the Central Banking System? Doesn&#39;t that seem to run counterintutive to the things he&#39;s claimed before and the opinions of most of the big donors in the GOP and all GOP politicians? Why would he constantly push bank deregulation if he was in favor of instilling fairness? Bank deregulation actions under his administration only give the 1% even more wealth? What actions has he done where the most benefit went to the middle class and not 1%? We know that the Tax Cut was a flop because 80% of it went to the 1% and corporations which have not put that wealth back into the economy. Doesn&#39;t that run counter to your claims?</p>

<p>Why does he have the right to fundamentally change/destroy current global economics systems in a unilateral fashion? Shouldn&#39;t something of this magnitude be a decision of the people and not one man? Is it fair to give this right to only one man representing one nation and exclude billions of other voices and 190+ nations? </p>
