        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At this point, it has become obvious to many <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> members that this sub is being brigaded and has been since before the election. It is also apparent the reddit administration is complicit in this, since they can see precisely how it is happening and who is doing it. Additionally, the subversion of other major subs (<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, etc) makes it clear that the admins are dedicated to pushing an agenda. </p>

<p>The agenda that is being pushed is very clear. Any post regarding the corruption associated with globalism/neo-liberalism or the their agendas (disarmament, immigration, censorship, etc) is immediately brigaded. Occasionally, the moderators will invent an excuse to delete these posts using Rule 12 or 13 as their rationalization. I suspect that this is  being allowed because the outright deletion of a large sub like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (much like T_D) would result in very negative publicity that would make even non-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> redditors question the site&#39;s objectivity. We all know how that went for Digg. </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracyundone/comments/8pgc13/why_i_am_leaving_reddit_thank_you_to_all_of_the/">The case of /u/polkadotgirl is very instructive.</a> As you may know, she was a longtime <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user who started her own sub; <a href="/r/conspiracyundone">/r/conspiracyundone</a>. Despite this being a relatively small sub, by reddit&#39;s standards, <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a> received sufficient threats and harrassment that she left reddit altogether.</p>

<p>By all accounts, her chief antagonists were members of <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>, which is a non-organic sub with the primary purpose of discrediting subs that allow opposition to globalist propaganda. Despite much speculation, it isn&#39;t clear who is behind <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> (ShareBlue, CTR, SPLC, ADL, hasbara, or some combination thereof.) What is clear is that they are not grassroots, are obviously organized and funded, and they are in bed with reddit&#39;s administration. </p>

<p>For certain, TMOR is just a symptom of the greater malady. Their mods have been linked to other pro-globalist subs indicating that this subversion is sitewide and is most definitely non-organic. </p>

<p>I believe that it would be very informative for current and former <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderators to create a forum on another medium, such as Voat, and disclose precisely how this sub has been subverted and why. </p>

<p>Particularly on the main subs, I feel like now when you sort by Controversial, you just get &quot;extreme&quot; views from the left, like &quot;Trump should be killed&quot; or whatever, that gets more downvotes than people pointing out that the headline and story are completely false.</p>

<p>Rather than make things controversial, they just keep them balanced at +1 vote, in order to make them look inconsequential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s definitely fair to say. I&#39;d say a big &quot;MSM opinion&quot; that causes a lot of strife in this sub is the Trump-Russia conspiracy.

<p>True, I don&#39;t agree with that either. Just look at things like pgate and Tucson. You have countless people claiming that since there isn&#39;t any hard evidence, that it&#39;s fake an therefore shouldn&#39;t be talked about.</p>

<p>However, the one thing I will say, is that this sub in particular, almost NEVER agrees with or tows the same line as the MSM. So when you have people here every day posting Washington Post articles about something Trump-Russia related, everyone should be suspicious. </p>

<p>I look at it like this; if at any point you find yourself agreeing with the MSM, you need to pause, take a step back, and reflect on your opinions for a moment. They are <em>not</em> here to serve us, they are here to serve their corporate overlords. </p>

<p>This sub was one of the only places aware of and actively discussing a &quot;deep state&quot;, aka shadowy people pulling the strings <em>above</em> Washington DC, loooong before Trump ran for President. We didn&#39;t trust the MSM for shit, and recognized the corruption of our politicians and celebrities in the media. Now, all of a sudden, when a candidate that got into the White House by promising to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; or corruption from our system, is tirelessly attacked and discredited by the very same people we&#39;ve always known are bad, we&#39;re suppose to take their word for it that Trump is the evil one? That I don&#39;t buy for a second. The fact that so many people fail to see through that, combined with the radical changes that have taken place here on reddit in the last 2 years, makes me and many other, highly skeptical when we see MSM narratives being pushed here.</p>

<p>this is a strange standard to me, because the washington post also is reporting that the golden state warriors won the nba championship, something I saw happen with my own eyes. its fine to be suspicious, but looking at the evidence presented and seeing if it jives is what everyone should be doing at every moment anyways</p>

<p>yes they are. the multiple outlets also are competing and ostensibly have different motivations and angles. so when they all agree on something there just might be something to it. even fox news has to cover the same evidence coming out that cnn is seeing. they might interpret it and spin it differently, but we can all see the evidence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what that is.</p>

<p>That being said, anyone who looks at the Washington Post as a credible, and thinks that just because multiple outlets report the same thing makes it true, clearly hasn&#39;t done much of a dive into the deeper layers of conspiracy theories. Probably doesn&#39;t know about things like the Council on Foreign Relations. Probably isn&#39;t aware of the incredibly small group of corporations that run almost ALL media.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I mean by, doesn&#39;t sound very much like a conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>If the extent of the conspiracies you believe in are 9/11, UFOs, and Trump-Russia hackin... I mean, &quot;collusion&quot;, then you&#39;ve still got a looooong way down the rabbit hole to go.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a perspective of the situation though.  Just like, for me it seems odd that in a place that knows about the corrupt controlling forces behind things (bankers, the fed, illuminati, etc) suddenly believes that the president is somehow not corrupt or being controlled by corruption.</p>

<p>You&#39;re buying the words from someone in one of the most powerful positions in the country.  Doesn&#39;t seem like something that used to happen here.  Definitely not something that would&#39;ve happened before.  </p>

<p>It could be just as likely that this is the well-run political campaign that gave you things to buy into - which is what happens all the time in politics.  </p>

<p>See how these differing views could be discussed and possibilities talked about rather than just blaming and censoring?</p>

<p>First of all, this sub generally has long been a fan of JFK. Completely understood what he was trying to do, and recognized that he faced the consequences for doing so.</p>

<p>Second, remind me again the % chance of Trump winning was, according to CNN MSNBC CBS ABC etc.? I believe at one point they had it at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/sam-wang-princeton-election-consortium-poll-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-victory-a7399671.html">99% for Hillary</a>. The fact that he won, despite the media blitz against him, and threw all of DC into an absolute PANIC, and caused the media to go into overdrive against him, doesn&#39;t even come close to comparing with when a candidate like Obama gets into office (which if you remember, was nothing but the media pushing that whole &quot;Hope and Change&quot; bull shit narrative).</p>

<p>I love how often I get this excuse, that now I&#39;m suddenly pro-establishment, because I give the President that nobody thought would win the benefit of the doubt, and give him a chance (unlike EVERYONE in the MSM). </p>

<p>Are you seriously trying to say that Trump is now leader of the Deep State??? Because that is completely baseless, except the fact that he now has power that no one thought he&#39;d ever get. The Deep State are the ones STILL GOING AFTER HIM AND TRYING TO IMPEACH HIM AS HARD AS THEY CAN! I mean seriously? If he&#39;s a plant, why work so hard to get him out?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a republican. I&#39;m not even necessarily pro-Trump. I&#39;m simply anti-MSM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, my entire point was that this is not cut and dry one sided.  There are multiple perspectives of it that can be viewed.  If you weren&#39;t so eager to try and fight back against what I said, maybe you&#39;d see that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope, didn&#39;t say that at all.  I&#39;m saying he&#39;s part of the establishment, and that it&#39;s surprising that conspiracy theorists are for an establishment candidate.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Deep State are the ones STILL GOING AFTER HIM AND TRYING TO IMPEACH HIM AS HARD AS THEY CAN! </p>

<p>That&#39;s what you think, sure.  I think the &quot;deep state&quot; is the boogeyman he&#39;s exploiting to make it seem like he&#39;s the outsider under attack.  It works for him because he knows his audience will eat it up.</p>

<p>Again.  2 different perspectives.  I&#39;m not arguing for being right.  I&#39;m arguing that there&#39;s different ways to look at things.</p>

<p>So you think the politicians that were there before him are the good guys, and he&#39;s the bad guy just playing to peoples emotions? News flash, the ONLY reason why his message resonated with so many people is because everyone was well aware of the cesspool that is Washington DC. I&#39;m assuming that you supported a lot of those establishment politicians like Hillary or Obama or Schumer or Pelosi (or Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell or John McCain if you&#39;re on the right), but THAT&#39;S who half of this country were voting to stop.</p>

<p>I totally understand both perspectives. What I am arguing here, is that, typically speaking, the <em>true conspiracy theorist</em> angle, consistent with the general belief system of most conspiracy theorists, is that the die-hard anti-Trump people in DC and the media are the ones being controlled by the Deep State. This is a bi-partisan issue.</p>

<p>The people who bought into the anti-Trump agenda from the MSM are not bad people. They&#39;re not even &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;unintelligent&quot; (as the left would say about Trump supporters). They are simply misinformed by the media that they once were able to trust. There&#39;s a reason why conspiracy theorists all gravitated towards Trump. And there&#39;s a reason why conspiracy theorists calling bull shit on the MSM Russia narrative. <em>(Hint: the answer isn&#39;t &quot;Russian propaganda on Facebook)</em></p>

<p>Nope, precisely the opposite.  Politicians are politicians.  They say what they think you want to hear.</p>

<p>It sounds like you really do not.</p>

<p>No true Scotsman again.  Your beliefs don&#39;t apply to everyone, and everyone doesn&#39;t have to conform to your beliefs to qualify.  You may know a bunch of people who are into conspiracies and believe that, but that doesn&#39;t make it true, or any more likely than another conspiracy or belief.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people who bought into the anti-Trump agenda from the MSM are not bad people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither are the people who bought Trump&#39;s word or believed they were doing good with meme warfare.  They simply wanted something from him that he was supposed to be, but isn&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a reason why conspiracy theorists all gravitated towards Trump. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, because  they marketed it towards people that would buy it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And there&#39;s a reason why conspiracy theorists calling bull shit on the MSM Russia narrative. (Hint: the answer isn&#39;t &quot;Russian propaganda on Facebook)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it goes against Trump&#39;s narrative.  In case you haven&#39;t heard, there&#39;s still an ongoing investigation that isn&#39;t about propaganda on Facebook.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re buying into propaganda from your preferred source in your preferred echo chamber as they tell you things you want to hear combined with things you already believe.  </p>

<p>At the very least, realize that just because you believe something, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the Washington Post and NYT and &quot;MSM&quot; journalists everywhere are some of the big powerhouses of investigative journalism that have unearthed some of the most significant conspiracies that we&#39;ve confirmed so far.  Atrocities in foreign countries, war crimes, government cover-ups, bribery.  They have obtained through their dogged reporting and sourcing and later published for us (the public) all sorts of documents that have shined a light on conspiracies.  </p>

<p>Not to get corny here, but The Post (the movie) was another reminder of the ethical courage journalism demonstrates over and over in the USA.  I, for one, am grateful for them (and their large budgets to send reporters and photographers around the world to document the truth for us).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are saying, and it is true that there are some people here who wrongly assert someone as being a shill, when as you say, its just a perspective that goes against their own. However, there is a real issue with shills here, and once you have become exposed to the kind of techniques they employ (you can find many examples of such pre-written &quot;Guides&quot; on reddit), and the patterns in their line of argument, so long as you are not someone charged with dogma, you are able to distinguish shill, from troll, from honesty.</p>

<p>Good reading: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/</a></p>

<p>Every internet user should familiarize themselves with this because it&#39;s the best way to prevent yourself from being fooled when reading a thread or a comment somewhere. If you understand that the comments and posts aren&#39;t always from organic users, you&#39;re less likely to fall victim to the misdirections, distractions, and the various ways they censor information. If you know that someone could easily pay for a comment to be at the top of a thread, you might decide to fact check that comment instead of just trusting it because it has a lot of upvotes. If you know about all of the different governments and corporations that manipulate social media, you&#39;ll have an idea of which topics deserve more skepticism and fact-checking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>welcome to my life</p>

<p>it is coming to my attention that if i wasn&#39;t actually in danger of becoming popular, my ideas would not garner nearly this much attention</p>

<p>like ali g says about video games, if you encounter the bad guys, that means you are going in the right direction</p>

<p>but it&#39;s not a game, and i feel sometimes like a mouse dangling by the tail over a pit of snakes.  i kindof thought i would be rich and have a lot of good connections by the time i ran into problems like this.  </p>

<p>check out privacy workshop over at steemit when you get a chance lmk what you think </p>

<p>thanks for the kind words, this kindof makes my day btw fwiw</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scott Pruitt, the embattled director of the Environmental Protection Agency, is at war with what he calls the “regulatory state,” but to aging Republican environmentalists, Pruitt is a “disgrace” who wants to unravel President Richard Nixon’s proudest domestic achievement. The latest example of this is Pruitt’s April 2 announcement that he plans to revise the fuel-efficiency regulations for cars and light trucks put in place by President Barack Obama’s administration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has stricken “climate change” and associated verbiage from its strategic plan, on the heels of one of the most expensive years of natural disasters in modern U.S. history.</p>

<p>The plan, published on March 15, says that one of the agency’s major strategic goals is to “ready the nation for catastrophic disasters.” As NPR noted, it does discuss the potential for rising disaster costs:</p>

<p>Disaster costs are expected to continue to increase due to rising natural hazard risk, decaying critical infrastructure, and economic pressures that limit investments in risk resilience. As good stewards of taxpayer dollars, FEMA must ensure that our programs are fiscally sound. Additionally, we will consider new pathways to long-term disaster risk reduction, including increased investments in pre-disaster mitigation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the budget cuts investments in early-stage research by axing ARPA-E, the Department of Energy&#39;s $305-million advanced research program. The budget also calls for nearly a <strong>40-percent cut to the department&#39;s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, even after accounting for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018</strong> (BBA), which recently increased FY2019 spending levels.</p>

<p>At the same time, the budget calls for <strong>increases in spending on fossil fuels</strong>. Including the BBA, the Department of Energy&#39;s budget calls for an extra $281 million on fossil-fuel R&amp;D, $200 million of which would be spent on “clean coal.” (Can coal ever be clean?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>china thanks pruitt for that, surely coal is the energy source of the future!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in its 2019 budget, the Trump administration is seeking to slash Department of Energy funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives by 72 percent.</p>

<p>Congress would likely oppose such steep cuts in any future budget negotiations, but the move further signals the Trump administration&#39;s avowed support of fossil-fuel industries.</p>

<p>News of the proposed cuts comes the day after <strong>President Trump praised “beautiful clean coal” in his State of the Union address, and several days after Trump announced steep tariffs on imported solar panels</strong>. (Find out more about the myth of “clean coal.”)</p>

<p>In a speech delivered in Hazard, Kentucky, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declared that he will sign a proposal on Tuesday that would eliminate the Clean Power Plan (CPP), claiming that “the war on coal is over.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Rolling back fuel-efficiency and emissions targets would make zero sense economically for anyone but oil companies</strong>,” says David Richardson, the executive director of business development at Impax Asset Management. “In fact, it would set back American car companies and those working for them because the global automotive market is moving the opposite direction, away from gas guzzlers and toward cleaner, more efficient cars and associated technology.”</p>

<p>Trump not signing TPP &amp; Paris Agreement (while the governments of the rest of the world rallied against him for it) proved that to a certain degree, Trump has been against some aspects of Globalism, something that this sub has been against prior to Trump.</p>

<p>So as you can see, we have been against these things, that T_D&#39;ers rallied around, for a long ass time, for many going back to the 80&#39;s/90&#39;s with folks like Art Bell and William Cooper&#39;s Behold a Pale Horse.</p>

<p>Now NeoLibs and r/politics invaders in tandem downvote all the things we have always been against, but they take to be &quot;right wing&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that the above topics are talked about, circulated, and accepted by only right-wingers, it&#39;s more like the alt-right adopted those beliefs after they were already in existence.</p>

<p>Most conspiracy theorists are already skeptical of MSM and establishment rhetoric - you have to be of skeptical mind to call yourself a true conspiracy theorist, but that doesn&#39;t make them right wing. Only until recently did it become fashionable to question the MSM, Trump has given every Alex Jones listener a platform to stand on now and they basically believe the opposite of whatever the status quo says to believe.</p>

<p>Does this make sense? It&#39;s not that this sub leaned right or leans more right than before, it&#39;s that the alt-right now believes many of the same conspiracies. The idea of rampant pedophilia amongst ruling global elites is much older than Trump followers. </p>

<p>I never said the sub currently doesn&#39;t lean right-wing. What I said was that the right-wing adopted r/conspiracy because of Alex Jones, because Trump is a conspiracy theorist, and because they were witnessing conspiracies before their very eyes: Wikileaks, 33k emails, Seth Rich, Clinton Death list, Soros funding Hillary, etc</p>

<p>It was a natural and organic process and personally I didnt mind because it brought in more people into the conspiracy realm and made us look less like tin foil nutters, and more as having predicted a lot of the stuff they were witnessing.</p>

<p>Other scholars note that neoliberalism is associated with the economic policies introduced by Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the United States.[6]
Scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of Mont Pelerin Society economists Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman and James M. Buchanan, along with politicians and policy-makers such as Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Alan Greenspan.[5][24] </p>

<p>During her tenure as Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher oversaw a number of neoliberal reforms including tax reduction, reforming exchange rates, deregulation and privatization.[71] </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So all of a sudden one group of people should stop discussing theories that might involve political party X, because another group of people that support political party X says its not true. That isn&#39;t how shit works. If there is weight to a conspiracy theory, right or left, this side or that, then it will gain traction and an active discussion/investigation. </p>

<p>Things gain the most traction when many of the people who live outside the right/left democrat/republican dichotomy actively contribute, rather than entering into a bullshit theory in a liberal or conservative echo-chamber. </p>

<p>There are many people who followed Pizzagate who would associate with the left and who also implicated Trump and other members of the right with Epstein. To label everyone who was looking into pizzagate as &quot;alt-right&quot; / right-wing, is a warped, dogma-laden perspective of reality.</p>

<p>trump went on alex jones, admitted 9/11 being a conspiracy, and in general has tacked about a variety conspiracies which attracted alot of conspiracy theorists to T_D and T_D&#39;ers to r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>All of that was actually organic and I witnessed it all because I was regularly going to both T_D and the Clinton sub, and r/politics to watch the debates/discussions. I saw before my own eyes r/politics mods get replaced and that sub go to shit (share blue, correct the record, media matters, david brock cronies)</p>

<p>And on T_D I organically witnessed crossposts posted there from r/conspiracy and conspiracies in general really organically picked up steam there.</p>

<p>not really. If I am &quot;independent&quot; then its a label that&#39;s true. If T_D co-opted this subs majority Indie conspiracy theories, and noe leftists are here from r/politics downvoting everything that goes against their brainwashed narrative, then labels are suitable</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only ever browsed on mobile and don&#39;t have the luxury of programs like RES, but it doesn&#39;t at all surprise me that people have their little lists of people they find suspicious for one reason or another. I have a few posts in my history in which I tracked users who posted to the same site/blog that were spreading disinfo. </p>

<p>I understand people don&#39;t necessarily make a list like that for that specific reason, but I do agree that bans are a tool that can be implemented to attempt to slow down users who are only around to disrupt an otherwise reasonable exchange of ideas.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with naming names in a hidden space; I prefer to call people out directly. Got nothing to hide really, and occasionally get a little riled up while defending the free exchange of thought. I&#39;ve actually made some decent &quot;friends&quot; here by starting out disagreeing with people. </p>

<p>While I don&#39;t agree with naming names in a hidden space, I do (in a way, kinda sorta) understand the idea behind the general need for a place to have discussion, not <em>without</em> certain people, but rather <em>with</em> people who have a proven track record of replying to posts and comments with a degree of thoughtfulness. Where you may see some elite &quot;in-group,&quot; I truly feel it&#39;s something more akin to a group of people with a provable history of cooperative discussion. </p>

<p>It was my understanding that it would be a place to talk policies and procedures such as the newer rule 13, and that the end results of any talks would become policy, ergo, public. I think a lot of people ignored those lists of proposed bans because that&#39;s ultimately not what the goal of the discussion was. Sabremesh was asking at the conceptual level if banning deliberately disruptive users was something people were comfortable implementing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the detailed answer! I&#39;ve always thought you were a great contributer to this sub, and I&#39;ve had you RES tagged as such for a long time now. If that&#39;s actually how this secret conclave worked, I wouldn&#39;t be quite as opposed to it. I still think it&#39;s a terrible idea in a conspiracy subreddit, but I could at least understand the logic behind it. Instead what we have are some good users and some awful ones all meeting secretly to discuss what is acceptable for everyone else.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see it in this batch of screenshots, but the ones that were posted after the mod elections showed that a well known troll user was nominated to be a mod. The same user had a comment in the screenshot bragging about how many times they had been banned already, and how they liked to break the rules in the most creative way possible. Why are they a part of this conclave and why were they nominated by one mod and another user? Or how about the ex-mod who tried to stage a coup and remove all of the other mods? Seems weird to include them as well. </p>

<p>The reason I seem so butthurt about all of this is because as you may have noticed, I was included in that persona non grata list. I know I&#39;m not the most upstanding member here, but I feel like I&#39;m constantly choosing my words carefully so as not to be banned. Even the reason given in that screenshot is absurd. I asked too many questions? And it wasn&#39;t long after that list was made that a mod banned me for &quot;vote manipulation, brigading, and using alt accounts.&quot; I asked for any proof of this and offered to give whatever proof they wanted to show I wasn&#39;t doing these things, and the mod just called me a dick and unbanned me. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m ranting at you with all of this, but as an insider maybe you have some perspective I&#39;m missing here. Or maybe I&#39;m offering a perspective of the conclave that you haven&#39;t seen yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ayy, thanks! I saw your name on the list originally and was surprised.  I don&#39;t have RES but I recognize regulars. I don&#39;t really agree, and it didn&#39;t even sound like the user who put your name there was really set on it either. Granted, it&#39;s not me and I don&#39;t know what interactions you two had or didn&#39;t have, so I may not be privy to everything you are. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure which user you&#39;re talking about who was up for the mod spot and bragged about avoiding bans, mostly out of ignorance though. I honestly don&#39;t go on that page much at all, so you may in fact know more about the conclave than I. What I do know is that from what I saw, there was a good amount of healthy disagreement as to how the sub should be run, and I often understood the merit to both sides. Unfortunately my day job mostly involves discussing minutia, so on my off time I prefer not to debate policies and procedures. Generally I&#39;m of the &quot;don&#39;t censor until they earn a ban&quot; and to earn a ban, I think people should be given warnings and a chance to defend their stance as well. </p>

<p>As for the ex mod coup, I wish I knew the whole story there! I imagine they had their reasons and would love to find out exactly how that went down. As we know from studying conspiracies, it&#39;s seldom just a &quot;lone gunman.&quot;</p>

<p>I get the ranting, no need for explanations. I was a moron and did a bit (read, a lot) of doxxing in the wake of the Vegas shooting. Got temp banned and it was a huge bummer to not be able to &quot;move freely about the cabin.&quot; I&#39;d imagine being branded a conspiracy pariah would have similar if not greater consequences. Sorry dude, but I do think people live and learn and that it&#39;s likely not a huge deal. </p>

<p>Everyday, there&#39;s somebody on this subreddit claiming that they got brigaded because their alt-right conspiracy theory got downvoted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Topics which counter the MSM narrative are massively down-voted, not &#39;alt-right&#39; conspiracy theories.   Point out the lack of evidence about Russia collusion (MSM narrative), get massively down-voted. Point out that the intelligence ran a domestic operation to undermine a political campaign, (anti-MSM claim) get massively down-voted, post an alternative journalist covering the Syrian conflict giving a different line than the State Department (MSM narrative) get massively down-voted.   These are not right wing conspiracy theories, but now, right wing will more likely believe them.   </p>

<p>The picture this paints, is that there is support from PR companies working for  the MSM doing damage control in conjunction with military  and private think thanks pushing a particular line.  Real people, that are interested in a topics and want to have a  discussion, share their thoughts, provide evidence and counter evidence, and consider the arguments.   Meaning they engage in deliberative activity.  Propagandists don&#39;t. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>See, this is kind of what I mean.  This is a talking point. It is not a real, or meaningful sentence.   I gave three examples.   Lets start with the last first.  Denying the MSM narrative on Syria has nothing to do with Trump.   If anything, Trump seems to believe the shit fed on the news.   So we see right away that  your talking point is simply a false proposition.  </p>

<p>The claims about Russia collusion, while used to prepare a platform to attack him in 2020 can be seen in a Trump neutral light. Even if the &#39;special investigation&#39; finds that Trump and his campaign did not collude with the Russian government, the main claims made in the DNI report would still stand.  Russia hacked the DNC, they gave this to Wikileaks, etc, etc,.   The real target here is creation of an antagonistic relationship with Russia.  This is in line with Nato and Ukraine affiliated think thanks.  </p>

<p>The second point is about the unelected foreign and domestic bureaucrats interfering in an election process to influence an outcome of a &#39;democratic&#39; election.  The democratic party left should be outraged about this, and be happy that the &#39;right&#39; is coming around to recognizing this as a problem, seeing how historically it was social movements on the left that were undermined by intelligence and law enforcement.  This is a  moment for a bipartisan led investigation and reform into the survaillance state.  Instead, this abuse is denied in a knee-jerk way. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a political atheist, and these many efforts to get me to &quot;convert&quot; to one side or the other (or to at least portray it that way) are laughably insulting at this point.</p>

<p>What the fuck do you want anybody to say? The same <strong>AWFUL</strong> foreign policy that everybody oddly forgot during Obama&#39;s 8 years that continued from Bush&#39;s admin and all prior is continuing now. The oligarchy wins.</p>

<p>It was criticized on this subreddit throughout.</p>

<p>It was criticized, albeit with weird justifications, on this entire site throughout.</p>

<p>I have no idea what point you&#39;re trying to make, here.</p>

<p>&quot;le cheeto&quot; has nothing to do with what I&#39;m saying, it&#39;s just your point of deflection away from reality. Do you want me to debate &quot;le cheeto&quot;, or do you want to avoid reality?</p>

<p>That seems clear to me. </p>

<p>If you have a point to make, I&#39;m happy to indulge you. But you&#39;ve gone off on a weird tangent that has no substance, and so I can do nothing but disagree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There may be some truth to that, but I don&#39;t agree entirely.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been an avid user of reddit and 4chan for about 7-8 years now (I&#39;ve had several accounts). </p>

<p>I can say that I see a trend on both websites, but I hardly ever go to /pol/ or /b/ anymore because it&#39;s overwhelming. There are so many shills, that shills are shilling themselves. </p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s to confuse us so much that we don&#39;t know up from down, so we throw in the towel and give up. </p>

<p>It gets so unnerving and irritating. There are obvious subs that are always going to have the same rhetoric, so I choose to stay away from those. r/worldnews and r/politics is completely overrun with complete intolerance of any view that seems conservative. It seems the only post that get upvoted the most has to do with Trump. I&#39;m not saying that I agree or disagree with him, what I am saying, is that it&#39;s some type of obvious agenda. It seems like it can be any subject about Trump, and it&#39;s to the front page.</p>

<p>The same could be said for youtube and facebook.</p>

<p>I wish I had answers, but I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Personally, I just try to keep an open mind and realize that the majority of any information we receive is second hand. So I take things with a grain of salt. I do my research, then I try to form an opinion.</p>

<p>Maybe some have that goal, but I suspect it&#39;s mostly just because there are so many people trying to play the game that it becomes a big mess.</p>

<p>Something similar happens with casual conspiracy research. Someone does some research and finds some facts, then infers some possibilities from those facts and publishes those inferences. Other people pick them up and treat them as facts, mix them with other facts and inferences and make some more inferences, without weighting any of it (Bayesian style maybe), and the result is a model that reflects the creativity of the community more than reality.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed flurries of downvotes on any comment that&#39;s against the DNC, democratic platform, or Hillary. They don&#39;t even have to be &#39;conservative&#39; talking points, such as pointing out that both 2016 candidates are oligarchs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had just woken up.</p>

<p>I disagree because all the problems on the internet are down to people taking this shit way too seriously. Why do they take it seriously? Because they have placed their real lives onto something that is not real. This is virtual reality. When people start to lose their shit because they read words on a screen, you know that that person is in dire straights mentally.</p>

<p>However, if the internet returned to the days of anonymity and homo/cocksucker jokes and where Nazis were of the grammar variety, people would see the internet for what it is; a place for people to come and chat shit, take the piss and have a laugh. It is not serious. </p>

<p>That way, those in power can&#39;t do shit because their words fall into the abyss that is the millionth gay joke of the day. Eventually the average joe moves onto the next fad and the internet returns to the hands of the hobbyist. </p>

<p>Pretty much the same thing would happen with the console world if wasn&#39;t all paid subscriptions and online currency.</p>

<p>Do you actually believe that? That&#39;s severely out of touch if you treat everything online as make believe. The internet and the websites it hosts are as real as print newspapers, and the very platform in which we&#39;re commenting, influences <strong>real</strong> people&#39;s opinions on <strong>real</strong> news articles, and <strong>real</strong> information, from the <strong>real world</strong>.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I see this &quot;our enemy is simultaneously all powerful and pathetically weak&quot; mindset a lot on r/conspiracy unfortunately</p>

<p>The worst is when people think a subreddit (be it r/conspiracy or a r/greatawakening type sub) is on the verge of exposing the crimes of the elite rulers of the world.</p>

<p>They believe that there is a clandestine organisation composed of the elite that essentially rules the world and yet they are not only threatened by a subreddit and not only are they unable to get this subreddit shut down, they can&#39;t even manage to fully downvote all the posts on that subreddit.</p>

<p>So they believe their enemy is powerful enough to practically rule the world but paradoxically weak enough to be defeated by a subreddit.</p>

<p>Everything OP describes is true.  That being said posts like this are extremely intellectually dishonest and only serve to create further division because they imply subversion and brigading only occur from one side.  The reality is both sides and everything in between are guilty of subversion and brigading.  These tactics extend WELL beyond politics as well.  Corporations, entertainers, artists, science, medicine, musicians etc all use Reddit to further their agenda.  </p>

<p>Bottom Line</p>

<p>Reddit is a major front in the war for your mind and everyone all on sides are competing to capture the flag. </p>

<p>Stay Vigilant</p>

<p>T_D, JIDF, Cambridge all have a major influence here as well.  Please don&#39;t kid yourself. Who has a larger presence is a day by day thing and depends on how important the narrative or distraction needs to be.</p>

<p>I go in with the assumption everyone is a shill but understand that even shills could have valid points and can make arguments based on sound logic, and reason.</p>

<p>Its always best to DYOR and most importantly challenge your believes and bias.  For example. If I believe something and someone brings something to the table to strengthen my believe I try to always assume it is a lie and then verify their claims independently.  If i assume its true I may not investigate further and if I do I end up only finding what I want to find.</p>

<p>Infowars. Fox news. Look at the fucking ads there. Conservatives and liberals are both vulnerable to and affected by advertising, ya dingus.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/01/22/clothing-company-ceo-says-his-company-markets-to-fox-news-viewers-because-theyre-fking-idiots">https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/01/22/clothing-company-ceo-says-his-company-markets-to-fox-news-viewers-because-theyre-fking-idiots</a></p>

<p>Also, this. The blaze is a conservative outlet fyi so this should be an article you can trust. From the horse&#39;s mouth, this advertiser says fox news viewers are easier to sell stupid bullshit. Just like Alex Jones who sells his bullshit nutritional supplements to guess who, conservatives!</p>

<p>I could make points about progressives buying stupid shit from ads too but you already know about that. Just saying I&#39;m not trying to play sides here, just pointing out how completely fucking stupid it is to act like one side here is any better than the other. Progressives and conservatives are not monolithic groups. There are bad actors on both sides, and intelligent good people on both sides. Blanket statements like the one you made do nothing to help the discussion.</p>

<p>With that said I completely agree that ads are a toxic scourge on our Earth, and I&#39;d like to see them relegated to very specific places (cable TV which is ad-funded, internet sites that are ad funded, for example are ok, but any paid service should not have ads &amp; fuck billboards). </p>

Because right now it sounds like you&#39;re claiming that the Democratic side of the political spectrum is &quot;much, much more valuable&quot; because it&#39;s simply a larger group.

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite. D and R are roughly the same in number. To get advertising revenue you have to crunch annual reports and Nielsen ratings. I did this a lot in 2010 when Fox started to dominate the ratings and I wondered why the bigger networks were all going the other way. Fox had 10x the numbers of MSNBC and they were advertising for barrick gold and survival seeds while MSNBC was getting Unilever and PepsiCo. Turns out that MSNBC was pulling much higher ad revenues, and CNN was turning left despite losing ratings, so the industry must have figured this out. Even on Fox, Shep is their bid to compete for the high-spending gay male market. </p>

<p>I don’t work in marketing analytics anymore, so I probably won’t be crunching the numbers for you. Maybe. </p>

<p>Empirically, We never had good enough data to be certain, but you can roughly order the value like this:
- gay men
- married women
- single women
- single men
- married men</p>

<p>This is straight from consumer spending reports. You can find them all over. You won’t find much on political divisions because that’s hard to get directly, although Facebook  in 2010 was a goldmine for learning latent factors that correlate with spending. Everybody knew this, and adjusted their market appeal to maximize profits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t assume you know what other people are talking about when you obviously don&#39;t. It makes you look ignorant.</p>

<p>What I consider to be evidence of brigading emphatically is <em>not</em> people &quot;disagreeing with me&quot;. People disagree with me all the time, big whoop. If I couldn&#39;t take people disagreeing with me, I&#39;d stay off the fucking internet.</p>

<p>Evidence of brigading is when voting trends take noticeably abrupt turns (i.e., comments that were being upvoted are rapidly downvoted and vice versa), often at the same time as the post is linked from one or more other subreddits or off-site. Sometimes, mods will sticky a post that seems to be receiving this kind of outside attention, and this increased visibility to subreddit regulars causes a <em>second</em> reversal of the upvote/downvote tendencies of comments.</p>

<p>This happens all the time on reddit, across all different ideological lines. For example, I used to spend a lot of time on feminist subreddits, and it would be really fucking obvious when something there had been posted on some MRA sub, bringing in mass downvotes for relatively standard feminist comments and upvotes for MRA garbage. Insert any two competing viewpoints and you can find examples of the same. Do you really think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is immune, or are you just into invalidating the lived experiences of other people before you even bother to ask about the details? Asshole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again with the sweeping assumptions that make you such an asshole. You might want to work on that, for your own sake.</p>

<p>I for one do not feel like that in all social situations, or even many. Only those for which there is actual evidence of it. Thankfully none in my personal life for a long time. </p>

<p>When there is actual evidence of it and someone asserts otherwise, that is a manipulation tactic commonly known as gaslighting, typical of narcissists and sociopaths. I&#39;ve been a victim of it in one intimate relationship in the past, but most of my relationships have been/are healthy, without abuses like that. One bad experience will teach a person what to look out for, though. And taught me the confidence to resist assholes like my ex who try to make me doubt my own observations of fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh there are <em>plenty</em> of past examples I could dig up if I wanted to spend hours on this, although you&#39;d need archived copies of a given brigaded thread as it developed to really see it, since as I described, it&#39;s about <em>significant, notable changes in voting tendencies as a thread develops</em> (and, on a more subjective level, a push toward views that conflict with the general community consensus of the subreddit in question) that&#39;s the big tip-off, rather than the final version of the thread alone. It&#39;s quite an onerous task to document if you aren&#39;t just watching it happen in real time. If you actually seemed interested in such evidence, it might be worth the effort on my part, but since you just asserted your own version without even asking before, undermining the observations of the many redditors who have watched brigading as it occurred, I doubt it&#39;d be worth the hours of effort. If you&#39;re questioning your initial assumptions now, that&#39;s terrific, though. Maybe you can do some observation for yourself and notice what most long-time reddit users are already well aware of. </p>

<p>There are loads of documented instances of brigading, though, if you&#39;d really like to see what it looks like. It happens across different ideologies, although people tend to notice it more when it&#39;s opposed to their views. For one example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4t5oxg/rthe_donald_clearly_brigades_a_rworldnews_post/">here&#39;s an instance</a> where an <a href="/r/EnoughTrumpSpam">/r/EnoughTrumpSpam</a> user documented brigading in their sub by Trump supporters. The same patterns can be seen in other instances regardless of the ideology of the brigaders and brigadees.</p>

<p>Other subjects that get brigades. Mandela effect. Glitch in the matrix. Nasa. Flat earth. Why ?  No idea but simply them being there back fires IMO as the more inquisitive of us wonder why.  Means there’s more than meets the eye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if there is an interest in any subject a person will generally have an opinion to agree with. So 9/11 there must be a stance to agree with. Such as the government was right and the buildings came down by planes. Nd there would be a reason to agree with that. Even if it was the government wouldn’t lie what would happen if they got caught ? Or god forbid a true believer that our authorities don’t lie to us and give us the whole truth (wouldn’t that be a nice thought) </p>

<p>Surely you’d see that in their answers. A debate generally means the other person has a point. Yet we see well rehearsed repeated phrases.  “The explanation is very simple really”. “There’s too many people involved someone would say something” “you don’t understand basic science” (that’s my favourite). </p>

<p>Yet a free flowing disagreement doesn’t employ tried and tested de railment tactics that we see repeated. In fact it’s a pleasure to talk to someone with an interest in disagreeing. The fact is most people, like me, when they don’t agree just move on and let others chat about it. If i don’t agree with some things on here. I don’t feel the need to tell people I dont agree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they don’t make an argument. Although occasionally there are pre fabricated answers. 9/11 buildings is a good example. Despite some well respected and well recognised people stating that scientifically those buildings could not have come down like they did, we see a massive response complete with diagrams and god knows what to drown out the other person. Now I’m talking as an observer here I have some views on those buildings but I’ve seen perfectly reasonable and scientific arguments simply get drowned out by shills. </p>

<p>Another good example is simply asking open ended questions and let the other person waffle away. He who asks more questions wins and often looks like they are in control. It’s a good and effective technique employed in the sales environment mostly. You see this when a user poses questions, and in return you get a question whilst avoiding any answers to questions posed. </p>

<p>This isn’t how people naturally talk to each other. What does that mean to you ? Why do you see it that way ? How do you feel about that ? I mean if you ask someone what are the implications of x being that way ? You could be reading a novel in the answer. </p>

<p>And science ? It’s as well as employing god said. Science is no more trusted here than the word of the bloke you met down the pub. Scientific papers can in effect come up with any answer given the right set of data. We’ve seen that admitted to by scientists here. Science proves x pill works better than anything tested (not mentioning sugar and cow poo were the only things tested) science predicts that global warming will effect earths sea levels (yeah and Doris my medium predicts I’d win the lottery). </p>

<p>Science shows how a melted beam can bring down a building (not mentioning the beam didn’t melt) science shows how an aeroplane could turn in circles (could being the operative word). It’s no more science than politics half the time. And even when we do see raw data science we find out raw data has been fiddled with (east anglia university) and for every scientific theory there seems to be an opposing theory. Eventually it’s my god is bigger than your god, and back to square one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. But just seems like inordinate amount of people who disagree with a given rhetoric seem to pop over from gaming to disagree. Surely if one has an interest in a subject, one would debate or seek questions, rather than come up with immediate explanations for the disagreement. </p>

<p>And seemingly well informed disagreements. Where as someone so well informed in say politics. Or moon landings. Or 9/11 would show some sort of history of disagreement or a given stance. Yet one minute they are talking about how to best shoot someone on COD and the next they seem to be an expert in building demolition or rocket thrusters. </p>

<p>Maybe it’s time to think of another way to keep these accounts looking real rather than being lazy, that’s all I’m saying. Maybe some are real. But it’s kind of washed out by those that aren’t. </p>

In fact I was quite naive when I got here at first. I thought my main subject would be of no interest to shills or propaganda. But soon I found out my sub was about the worst for it.  It’s only experience not pre judgement.  Had I chosen politics or debate on Israel I would have fully expected shills. </p>

<p>OP is doing more to discredit him/herself than anyone else could by posting those &quot;<strong>tactic: bullshit bullshit bullshit</strong>&quot; replies, and they&#39;re acting like they don&#39;t even realize that. Maybe they don&#39;t! Who knows, it&#39;s a huge clusterfuck.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been called a shill recently just for disagreeing and  reported for brigading.</p>

<p>It&#39;s flat out nonsense. These people pushing the anti-globalist, far right rhetoric feel comfortable in only that safest of space. people diagreeing with your wacky logic and super thin evidence are not all paid shills. Some people just don&#39;t carry the same inherent bias as you and look at your theory skeptically. This is okay. No need to put up trash posts like this, unless you have some evidence, of course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes both ways though. I wasn’t implying you were a shill, but your anti anti-globalist rant came out of left field without really dissecting anything OP said. It appeared as if you felt personally attacked and reacted accordingly. I agree that the left/right wing paradigm has infested this sub horribly (thank fuck there’s other growing conspiracy subs). Your broad stroke of categorizing everyone who is anti-globalist as possessing whacky logic and thin evidence seems the opposite of open minded. I’m not trying to attack you, just feeling out where you’re coming from. I want you to elaborate on why you <em>dont</em> think that the administration of Reddit has been bought out or why you don’t think that TMOR is slightly nefarious and inorganic. 
Also, conspiracy theory culture is - by its very nature - one where evidence <em>is</em> thin, because if it wasn’t...then it wouldn’t be so much of a theory in the first place. There’s few pieces of the puzzle and people do their best (at least non politically motivated, actual truth seekers) to figure out what that big picture is. </p>

<p>At the same time I believe in many conspiracies, particularly in politics and business, that hurt individual rights of people.</p>

<p>Is the anti-globalism thingy happening because of the stark realization that when lifting up the masses who are disadvantaged around the world, those with built in advantages due to geography or heritage may have to give more than they would prefer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the biggest legit knock on globalism is that it increases competition pressure on people on the low end of the economy. if you are a factory worker in america and now have to compete with factory workers in china, it is bad for you</p>

<p>Nice straw-man.  No one is claiming otherwise. </p>

<p>The issue is mod and admin-endorsed manipulation and deception: The whole point of reddit is to connect with various types of content, for which we rely on, and participate in, a type of crowd-sourced labor.  When that is being manipulated to produce inorganic results, it is not possible to solve the problem by simply reading everything critically.  That suggestion misses the point entirely.   </p>

<p>Did you even read the OP?   The truth that the user was referring to was not the veracity of the articles, but rather making it evident that manipulation is at play. At least the sort by new method addresses the issue of brigading to some degree.  The whole point of reddit is to <em>not</em> have to simply read everything on the internet to find the kind of content for which you are looking.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a reminder to everyone.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a left is better than the right, or vice versa.
This is about thought control and manipulation.
Yes, leftist groups do shill online. So do right groups.
So do corporations, so do media platforms.</p>

<p>The point of this post is to draw awareness to the issue. </p>

<p>its obvious to me that the point of these threads is &#39;dont trust anyone you disagree with&#39;. i think the obvious intelligent thing to do is to run your ideas into disagreeing ideas to see what holds up to scrutiny. if you live in an echochamber or think that anyone who disagrees is a shill, your ideas will become weak and atrophy and wont hold up when you run into something undeniable</p>

<p>That&#39;s me clarifying my stance, trying to tell you that I don&#39;t believe any party would have passed on the opportunity.  Also me telling you that it happened in every country that could do it, regardless of government.

<p>What does Trump have to do with being in the thumbnail when it was Hillary who got &quot;hacked&quot;? The narrative there is certainly not of Trump conspiring with Russia to &quot;hack&quot; DNC emails. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how CNN realises that it&#39;s difficult to hack electronic voting machines (remotely) but it&#39;s easy for Russia to hack DNC servers. So easy, that Trump just paid Putin to do it.</p>

<p>Why even mention Seth Rich? He was obviously not pissed about DNC rigging Bernie&#39;s nomination and certainly didn&#39;t transferred emails onto an USB drive and leaked it to Wikileaks. It&#39;s not like forensics showed that email transfer  speeds were not possible to be on USB 2.0 level, if they were sent to Russia or any other substantial foreign location</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s funny is probably 10 years ago ( even even a little less) people like Alex Jones and topics like globalization were mainly brought about by people with more left leaning politics..
While Republicans /conservatives whatever would call anyone who believed in conspiracy theories and anyone who viewed sites like info wars &quot;nut jobs&quot;..
Never forget.
The same people and issues that are being championed by Trump supporters rn were nut jobs when 9/11 was an inside job was attached to it.</p>

<p>But these are the same issues and some of the same fringe media personalities..</p>

<p>Even back then I didn&#39;t like Alex Jones and even more so now I down right despise him.</p>

<p>But the fact still remains.. That post 9/11 and the years that followed.. People that now talk about globalism and worship Alex Jones were calling conspiracies theorists (including Jones) all the mental health associated slurs you can think of</p>

<p>Fact is anything neo or extreme.. Is bad.. Doesn&#39;t matter what it is..  For thst matter tho if you refer to yourself as any synonym relative to the two dominant political factions in America.. Take your tired ass back to sleep.
If you fall for divisive trap issues period.. Take your ass back to sleep.
There is enough misinformation out there as is.
People wanna act like the mainstream media just now started lying about shit... Take your ass back to sleep.. You are a pawn being played. You only decided to open your eyes when they had something for you to look at..</p>

<p>While on the subject of &quot;brigading&quot; also.. Trump would not have been elected so easily without the &quot;salt right&quot; and the white supremacist brigading of 4chan.. The same thing that made anonymous and occupy a thing made the alt right and Trump a thing
And those fucking idiots are so brainwashed.. Not just them the majority for that matter... That they actually think Trump is a republican.. That he is for the elite because he stepped out of wwe and reality TV and into the white house..</p>

<p>You motherfuckers are being deceived..
Trump has built an empire by ripping off and conning the same people he manipulated into voting for him.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe people can be so fucking dumb and celebrate someone turning this country into a mockery that no one even respects anymore much less fears..
Used to get accused of secretly policing and trying to dominate the world..
These days we are known as another weak country that has other countries deciding its election.</p>

<p>So either wake the fuck up or go back to sleep.
All this same shit was going on years ago when you were insulting the people that were fighting against it..
Sorry.. Don&#39;t mean to he a broken record.. This shit just makes me fucking disgusted and furious</p>

I do see much shitposting, but for you to react to it by calling those posts a petrochemical feces country music concert.... means that those posts have achieved their goal, pissing a left leaner off. As far as commenting on the stae 9f conspiracy and t_d, they are brigaded by the same people, and we know who and what they are, one for consistently pissing them off with meme magic, and the other for coming too close to uncovering truths. I dont believe at all that either side of the political aisle is for the everyday man, but i also think that those on t_d are certainly not your enemies and shouldnt be disparaged as such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the year was 2008ish, gripped by all the whack G.W.B. and the neocons of his ilk were up to, and a place like T_D existed, given my age, my view of the world at that time, I am basically certain I&#39;d be in there with you folks.</p>

<p>Am I left leaning? Sometimes it seems so. Other times, I&#39;m actually more of a far-far-far-far right wing authoritarian.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate the folks of T_D, don&#39;t get me wrong. It&#39;s what T_D style forums do to discussion, what they inevitably do to the mind that worries me.</p>

<p>I have a two T_D friends in the real world, one is a successful Chad with a great job, great friends, beautiful gf. He is allowed to like T_D, because he doesn&#39;t take it too seriously.</p>

<p>My other T_D friend? All he talks about is Q, what women owe him (the saddest most fucked up Facebook stuff I see), and, as of late, he has begun to end every conversation before it begins by saying that his language is different from our language, and truth cannot be explained, it can only be known...</p>

<p>So, yeah, his brain is on the quick path to mush, and every public Facebook opinion of his is honestly, like, the most shocking thing a real world person could say. Very incel. Very worrying.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate you guys, nor have I given up on my friend, I just hate the real-world effects of forums that do not allow for rational dissenting views.</p>

<p>Which, haha, might be the reason that drives people to the sub in the first place.</p>

<p>As I tell my friend who loves &quot;Q&quot;, my friend... The information war happening right now... whether or not you realize it, whether or not I realize it, myself, we are up to our eyeballs in truths that look like falsehoods and falsehoods and heroes that look like facts and villains, lies and saviours, respectively; and all, everything, pretty much indistinguishable.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not found the good, there, myself; that said, if you can find some good for you in T_D, do take it... mmm, but remember, too much of anything, even too much water will fuck you up.</p>

<p>Protect your mind. Given the time, especially from places that seem safe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling at this point.</p>

<p>Godspeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It basically comes down to who you perceive &quot;the man&quot; to be. If you are anti-establishment you are more likely to support the outsider opposition party. Trump won largely because people were disillusioned with 8 years of Obama. Obama won because people were disillusioned with 8 years of Bush. </p>

<p>The pendulum swings very predictably from one party back to the other. In a two party system it&#39;s very easy to control political discourse in a very controllable predictable way, eventhough on face it appears chaotic. There will always be those that want to consider themselves to be anti-establishment, and its usually the rebellious younger crowd, the types more likely to post in conspiracy subs. Those people still support trump because the true power structure is still perceived to be the elitist left because 8 years of Obama is still fresh in peoples minds. Obama won because the neocons were considered to be the true power structure at the time because 8 years of bush was still fresh in people&#39;s minds. </p>

<p>The drain the swamp rhetoric of Trump is no different from the hope and change rhetoric of Obama. They all do the same shit and support the same objectives. People just dont have very long memories or attention spans. Obama tricked us with a promise of change and the prospect of an outsider who would change the system. The same is true for Trump.</p>

<p>Over time people will see through Trump&#39;s false promises and become disillusioned with him just as they did with Obama and Bush before him. It just takes some time. The anti-establishment crowd will swing from being the alt-right back to the left again. Many of the the people who are now alt right were previously anti-establishment left leaning libertarians.</p>

<p>It just depends on what the &quot;in&quot; (or out) crowd is perceived to be. </p>

<p>Trump is still considered by naive people to be a maverick rogue outsider. Just like an internet meme, people are projecting values  they want in a leader onto him that he never expressed himself and he just vaguely signals and plays along. He never mentioned exposing sex cults but that doesnt stop roseanne or Alex Jones from claiming he is doing that.</p>

<p>People who are intelectually honest will eventually realize, &quot;hey wait a minute, this guy isnt really running the country any different than Obama did.&quot; Just like around 2013 people realized &quot;hey obama promised all this hope and change and hes had 5 years, but he&#39;s just running the country a lot like Bush did.&quot;</p>

<p>There will always be the entrenched die hards who claim a party for life, but there are a lot less of those and elections are decided by swing voters who are fickle and have short attention spans and short memories.</p>

<p>People on conspiracy subs are more likely to be anti-establishment. They want to be contrarians. If they are smart and objective thinkers, they will see there is zero real difference between the 2 parties at all. Corporate globalist interests and advancing the military industrial complex reign supreme under both. It&#39;s just a matter of perception. Eventually people will realize they are only serving as political pawns and promoting the popular unpopular ideas of the moment (if that makes sense).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I enjoy <a href="/r/TOMR">/r/TOMR</a>. For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve been following this sub for a while, and the political direction has changed a lot since the primaries when HRC was elected as the dem candidate. i feel like this sub has been brigaded by anti-globalists who think all conspiracies come from the left. there used to be a large contingent (there&#39;s still a small one) of people who came up with interesting conspiracies based on corporate interests -- which can obviously be pinned on right or left wing leaning politicians as supporters (depending on the particular case or policy).</p>

<p>TOMR is (mostly) just pointing out stupid posts that show hypocrisy or ignorance. the brigading of downvotes is unethical and they aren&#39;t supposed to do that. so, i agree that it&#39;s something that needs to be controlled and recognized. however, nobody is &quot;behind&quot; TOMR from some &quot;ShareBlue&quot; or other left leaning globalist org. it&#39;s just centrist-to-left leaning trolls making fun of uninformed right wing opinions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, the &quot;Globalist Agenda&quot;, to me, is obvious: the goals are clear, and the tactics self-evident. My question (which I have yet to find a divisive answer to), is &quot;Who tf is running the show?&quot; I think to myself: it wouldnt be in the best interest of any HUMAN to sabotage the economy, and the human technological progress, because THEY, themselves, are human, ie &quot;in the same boat&quot;, meaning &quot;their standard of living can only be in the same ballpark as the world as a whole&quot; (but then again, they could just be so hellbent on power and control, they dont think of the negative consequences of seeking it...). There&#39;s also the &quot;peculiar&quot; rise of computer technology, while other industries, like &quot;energy&quot; are still WAY behind. I&#39;ve heard speculation that computer tech may be back engineered alien tech. </p>

<p>TLDR: I think there might be aliens/extraterrestrials subverting human progress...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see much light at the end of the tunnel: SO many are oblivious, few are &quot;semi-woke&quot;, the &quot;surveillance state&quot; has been being built up around us, for decades now, the economy, and the technological progress that comes with it, has been sabotaged... Whoever is running the show seems to be winning, by a LONG SHOT. We&#39;re down 87-120, with 2:00 minutes left to go in the 4th quarter: only dreamers think they have a chance. But, then again, this &quot;agenda&quot; moves in secrecy, and if the light is shown upon it, maybe it CAN be &quot;evaporated&quot; (for lack of a better word)... The systems are being built, the wealth is consolidated, the conversations are diverted, so many are led to live meaningless lifestyles, the human progress has been sabotaged... What hope is left?</p>

<p>I think that this isn&#39;t really possible to answer because it isn&#39;t any individual level.  The way I think of it is more of a Big Leagues situation where the powerful classes fight each other viciously within the framework of having many mutual interests.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say your concern is legitimate, then I will be legitimate in my response; the other responses here which label your post as being another call for the sub to move to the right of the political spectrum, likely right into the_donald territory, these people are exercising the very skepticism which will help protect them not simply from the cult of personality, from the blind pull populist leaders (under ideal conditions), but, so too will this help them maneuver such places as this subreddit you have shared.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are homes for your ideas, your worldview.  </p>

<p>Of course, if there isn&#39;t, then, it&#39;s reddit, make your own subreddit. Find like minds. Meetup for bicycle rides and stuff. Pizza. Lazer quest? Like, come on. You&#39;ll be golden.</p>

<p>I believe it&#39;s dangerous, (ok, so why is it dangerous?) because it effectively blends countries. Countries are no longer sovereign, and that causes issues when different countries with different economic success/failure profiles are suddenly blended together. Plus, it creates an environment where - because the borders are gone - the better economic performing countries end up bailing out or subsidizing the lower performing countries, but have no basis of responsibility to do so, other than being guilted into it.</p>

<p>Economics aside, it really creates more problems than it solves, EXCEPT if you&#39;re one of the really big money guys, like Soros. You end up creating so much havoc that it takes a <strong>really  big</strong> government machine to run it, and guess who benefits from <strong>really big</strong> government structures?

<p>disclose how this sub has been subverted and why</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want insight to the agenda, then that source of information would not be much more reliable than rumors. As most actors in this likely simply do it for the money. The brigading shills do it for an hourly wage or even a per vote and per comment commission. The people that are actually tied to reddit are probably given a bonus or donation (bribes) to look the other way and/or help facilitate the subversion. So if you want some real insight, find out who is supplying the money.</p>

<p>A theory I saw a while ago was that a lot of the shills are not just doing it because they are losers that want some money but they are doing it because they are covering their own asses. After the election, <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/326201-dnc-asking-entire-staff-to-resign-report">the DNC asked their entire staff to resign</a>. Some said this was to hinder any investigations such as into pedosta or clinton or schultz. Some said it could also be so they could do their new job as a reddit shill. I don&#39;t know what the law says about holding a job in the DNC while simultaneously contributing to a political disinformation and propaganda campaign on public forums, but maybe the resignation was what allowed it to be legal? Or maybe they simply needed some complicit employees who have something to lose (if they fail or rat they get jail or Seth Rich&#39;d).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/worldnews took a wicked turn when mueller went after Israel for doing what Russia did. I find it absolutely insane that r/politics allows it, although it is a democratic sub and Israel attacked them, its still crazy. The worldnews mods broke their own rules and started IP checking and blanket banning as anyone who uses my Wi-Fi and comments in that sub gets banned. A few of my friends who write for publications are very upset with me now. Oops. The mod who banned me is in an IP range of an Israeli muniviple server in beer sheva a place where black cube and other Israeli private Intel companies are based. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thoughts on Russiagate? i have to laugh listening to these drones prattle on about how crazy it is that no one is buying their &quot;totally authentic Russia conspiracy&quot; because Trump towers in Moscow and Hillary Clinton emails and Twitter bots and shit.  ok call that collusion or whatever if you want, the problem is it doesn&#39;t even <strong><em>begin</em></strong> to pale in comparison to the sheer infilitration of the Ziomob in to US politics.  America was co opted long, long, long ago.  fuck their entire foreign policy is pretty much dictated by a foreign lobby, but my god, Trump met with a Russian.  like i say, perhaps there are some shady dealings there, but you&#39;re only worried about foreign subversion now? despite AIPAC? the ADL? the Israeli war on terror that America has been fighting? and on and on and on.  these people are fucking idiots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is part of the ziomob. Russia Israel are just as married as America Israel. Trump has done everything Israel wants and has admitted with Bibi working together with Saudi UAE to help Trump. Since they are allies, its not treason. Clinton and trump are left testicle right testicle in the corporate dick fucking everyone. Trump is no outsider. He in fact is more deep state than people realize. Obama moved America&#39;s foreign policy to work around israel so they hacked and attacked him and the democrats not under zions control. You need to get over thinking their is some radical group saving us from the establishment because thats not the case. Trump is the older establishment retaking the progressive drive America was taking to be more centrist. We are a corporatocracy and trump wears his suit/ uniform shuffling their power mechanism just as much as Clinton. You don&#39;t become a billionaire without fucking people over. Trump bloomberg Giuliani Soros all worked together under bill clinton yo rewrite the community reinvestment act to rob grandmas.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s been happening forever. I was on a message board for a TV show, not sure exactly how long ago but over 10 years for sure, could be 15.</p>

<p>Somehow the conversation on the board turned a bit political and I made a couple of comments, might have been about 9-11 or something. Immediately a couple of users start relentlessly attacking me, then a new account logs into the chat that was my user name but like one character off and starts spouting a bunch of racist and sexist shit. The accounts attacking me jump on this, saying it’s me posting all this and in minutes the entire board is after me until I logged off. </p>

<p>It all felt so coordinated, like these accounts were monitoring the board in case anyone started sharing any controversial perspectives. Once I learned, years later, about disinformation agents in social media, that incident suddenly made a lot more sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea and posts like this essentially lumping it into globalists. Far more complex than just <em>nationalists</em> and <em>globalists</em>. This would be why TMOR makes fun of posters like yourself. You play right into the alleged subversion tactics.</p>

<p>By just saying what you just did you only add to the idea that this is a biased sub. Those agencies sure have a hand in it, but it stretches father than that. There are many powerful actors on the global stage. Its a rudderless ship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>bogus, fraudulent, inauthentic, phony, compromised, deceptive- so many appropriate words you could have used and you chose &quot;non-organic,&quot; to describe TMOR...</p>

<p><a href="/u/tedsmitts">/u/tedsmitts</a> I see what you were talking about.</p>

<p>Back to the subject though...</p>

<p>Um... To be honest. I can&#39;t help but wonder- why are so many people giving certain topics so much attention and continuing such a steady(and very particular) narrative in this sub.</p>

<p>A good 80% of topics that are featured/created in this subreddit I couldn&#39;t give less of a shit about, and trust me, I&#39;ve been sitting on the bowl for a while now. Um... Google, Facebook, mass surveillance, something about child trafficking and American politics. That&#39;s literally 95% of the content, and while the child exploitation topics should catch my attention, at this point- I don&#39;t give a shit most of the time. Child exploitation and corrupt politics are old as time. Like I can crack open my Bible and find those topics.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather read about FEMA camps, Aliens, History, Atlantis. Give me the weird, give me the strange- give me something to be shocked about. I want something creative where I actually read. I don&#39;t need one-hundred thousand posts to tell me that politicians are corrupt- most &quot;fake news&quot; outlets literally imply it themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It basically comes down to who you perceive &quot;the man&quot; to be. If you are anti-establishment you are more likely to support the outsider opposition party. Trump won largely because people were disillusioned with 8 years of Obama. Obama won because people were disillusioned with 8 years of Bush. </p>

<p>The pendulum swings very predictably from one party back to the other. In a two party system it&#39;s very easy to control political discourse in a very controllable predictable way, eventhough on face it appears chaotic. There will always be those that want to consider themselves to be anti-establishment, and its usually the rebellious younger crowd, the types more likely to post in conspiracy subs. Those people still support trump because the true power structure is still perceived to be the elitist left because 8 years of Obama is still fresh in peoples minds. Obama won because the neocons were considered to be the true power structure at the time because 8 years of bush was still fresh in people&#39;s minds. </p>

<p>The drain the swamp rhetoric of Trump is no different from the hope and change rhetoric of Obama. They all do the same shit and support the same objectives. People just dont have very long memories or attention spans. Obama tricked us with a promise of change and the prospect of an outsider who would change the system. The same is true for Trump.</p>

<p>Over time people will see through Trump&#39;s false promises and become disillusioned with him just as they did with Obama and Bush before him. It just takes some time. The anti-establishment crowd will swing from being the alt-right back to the left again. Many of the the people who are now alt right were previously anti-establishment left leaning libertarians.</p>

<p>It just depends on what the &quot;in&quot; (or out) crowd is perceived to be. </p>

<p>Trump is still considered by naive people to be a maverick rogue outsider. Just like an internet meme, people are projecting values  they want in a leader onto him that he never expressed himself and he just vaguely signals and plays along. He never mentioned exposing sex cults but that doesnt stop roseanne or Alex Jones from claiming he is doing that.</p>

<p>People who are intelectually honest will eventually realize, &quot;hey wait a minute, this guy isnt really running the country any different than Obama did.&quot; Just like around 2013 people realized &quot;hey obama promised all this hope and change and hes had 5 years, but he&#39;s just running the country a lot like Bush did.&quot;</p>

<p>There will always be the entrenched die hards who claim a party for life, but there are a lot less of those and elections are decided by swing voters who are fickle and have short attention spans and short memories.</p>

<p>People on conspiracy subs are more likely to be anti-establishment. They want to be contrarians. If they are smart and objective thinkers, they will see there is zero real difference between the 2 parties at all. Corporate globalist interests and advancing the military industrial complex reign supreme under both. It&#39;s just a matter of perception. Eventually people will realize they are only serving as political pawns and promoting the popular unpopular ideas of the moment (if that makes sense).</p>

You need to get over thinking their is some radical group saving us from the establishment because thats not the case. Trump is the older establishment retaking the progressive drive America was taking to be more centrist. We are a corporatocracy and trump wears his suit/ uniform shuffling their power mechanism just as much as Clinton. You don&#39;t become a billionaire without fucking people over. Trump bloomberg Giuliani Soros all worked together under bill clinton yo rewrite the community reinvestment act to rob grandmas.. </p>

<p>Search duqu 2.0. Jcpoa. Israel. Obama Netanyahu. Israel hired Russia to help Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes both ways though. I wasn’t implying you were a shill, but your anti anti-globalist rant came out of left field without really dissecting anything OP said. It appeared as if you felt personally attacked and reacted accordingly. I agree that the left/right wing paradigm has infested this sub horribly (thank fuck there’s other growing conspiracy subs). Your broad stroke of categorizing everyone who is anti-globalist as possessing whacky logic and thin evidence seems the opposite of open minded. I’m not trying to attack you, just feeling out where you’re coming from. I want you to elaborate on why you <em>dont</em> think that the administration of Reddit has been bought out or why you don’t think that TMOR is slightly nefarious and inorganic. 
Also, conspiracy theory culture is - by its very nature - one where evidence <em>is</em> thin, because if it wasn’t...then it wouldn’t be so much of a theory in the first place. There’s few pieces of the puzzle and people do their best (at least non politically motivated, actual truth seekers) to figure out what that big picture is. </p>
