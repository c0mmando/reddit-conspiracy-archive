       I started in my teens trying to get to the bottom of everything. I thought that was my job as a critical thinker, to find the mechanisms by which unjust rulers exert their control over the masses. What is it that allows the elite to control us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Money. Through capitalism, greed is encouraged. Profit over people, etc. This leads to the evil cabals, the secret meetings to maintain power. Money is the tool, the driving factor, the real corruptor.
      </p>
      <p>
       That to me says that capitalism is in itself the biggest conspiracy of all. By definition, every corporation is a conspiracy to extract money by any means necessary. And when corporations seek to influence the power structures and do so successfully, they cement their own power over the people. They destroy democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is it that anytime someone brings up an alternative to capitalism on this subreddit or in any conspiracy forum, it's ridiculed or downvoted to oblivion? Why are so many conspiracy theorists so in favor of money?
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory: many conspiracy theorists are really just secretly pissed off that they aren't part of the conspiracy. They're temporarily embarrassed millionaires who want in on the game.

       Ahh ok. I think there's a trade off between allowing the government to know how much you're worth, and be taxed on that worth, or to have the system entirely deregulated. In a perfect world, the government would protect us from being taken advantage of by business entities, but this is anything but a perfect world. I think as a model, capitalism offers the greatest opportunity for individual freedoms and for increasing the variety of available goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's a catch all solution in a world driven by scarcity, and supply and demand. I also think that a lot of the 'capitalists sentiment you face is likely based out of a distrust of the government and a desire to not be taxed. I could be wrong though

       The problem with modern political philosophy is that people seem to have forgotten entirely all the arguments and works of this original generation of libertarians and anarchists, and in doing so push support for something they saw as greatly flawed (as well as existing contingent on state authority)- which is the
       <em>
        unrestricted
       </em>
       ownership of capital. They recognized the problems introduced to society when one can own property without any limitation. It leads to capital accumulation and an unjust balance of power which inevitably distorts both our economic system as well as our political structure. It also inevitably leads to the quashing of the very "free market" that so many anarcho-capitalists
       <em>
        claim
       </em>
       to desire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why "you can own property, but limited to what you yourself can use" is such a crazy fucking compromise, but an-caps seem unwilling to really examine their philosophy. You're not truly free, in their view, unless you are free to be a King over other men.

       I know. It is frustrating. "They" have been able to do a very good job at teaching people that it is necessary to be in debt for your housing and consume and endless pit of non-durable goods made in a foreign country by slave labor "to be living the life". If 90% of your toil isn't going to a fancy house (paying the bank,) or fancy vacations (paying the bank,) or a fancy car (paying the bank,) or schools, clothes, ad infinitum, you aren't doing your part, apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pulling back from consumerism, bartering for property, ski passes, a boat- in exchange for vegtables, house cleaning, snow removal- nearly makes you an anarchist in this society.

       You realize other economic structures still have wealth, and people still compete over that wealth, right? The decentralized nature of capitalism appeals to conspiracy theorists because it makes it a lot harder for bad actors to control all of the wealth. If you ask me that just means we have a lot of different bad actors in competition, but even that is a step up from economies like the soviet union or communist china where one person or group (party leadership) just controls everything.

       The ultimate goal of any Marxist system is to eventually transition away from any form of government and to eliminate competitive markets and scarcity. See: Star Trek.
      </p>

       You're definitely right that the Soviet Union failed miserably at this and became something like state capitalism.

       I think, looking at Marxism with a conspiracy theorist's lens, it's pretty clear that nobody in power who suggests Marxism ever shares that end goal. Marxism is a lie we allow ourselves to be told and the only end result is dictatorship.

       historical and dialectical materialism is honestly some of the worst philosophy I've ever read. Ironically right in the same ballpark as liberal/capitalist "philosophers" with someone like Francis Fukuyama or Ayn Rand being a good example.

       That's because it was designed for that very reason, by TPTB. Marx didn't even write the Communist Manifesto, Clinton Roosevelt did, for the bankers and elite, and Marx put his name on it to make it seem "grass roots". He then went on to marry into Royalty. Furthermore, he was a relative of a Rothschild. Marxism/Communism is designed to get the people to voluntarily (at first) give up their life, liberty, and private property over to the State.

       I think the problem is human nature and consolidation of power. Communism calls for a "Vanguard Party" to take control in the name of the People, eliminate other political competition, and then own the means of production in the name of the People, eventually whittling away into a decentralized communist utopia of worker co-ops.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is human nature and the consolidation of power within the Party. Corruption, greed, and lust for power will find a home in any single party state, especially when that Party now technically owns all the means of production.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people should care less about a Vanguard Party and more about passing laws to enable the founding and transitioning of more worker co-ops and stock buy backs (of the workers), so that you don't need the Party to own anything. The People will gradually own everything collectively, without a new Stalin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not this alternative approach is possible is yet to be seen.

       Which is why we need to avoid the pitfalls of both. A Vanguard Party is almost certainly a bad idea, as is unfettered capitalism. First we need to seize one of the main Parties, then use it to pass the desperately needed social reforms like publicly funded Healthcare, College/Trade education, infrastructure projects, and a transition to a Green economy. Once we lay this foundation we will have at least blunted the worst offenses of Capitalism and made the economic gains more equitably distributed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you can move on to worker co-ops (passing legislation at the same time as the other reforms), and start encouraging people to come together and buy their businesses, as well as start their own democratic businesses. Capitalism doesn't need to go away completely, and it will be impossible to do so until one reaches post scarcity. Only with machines that can produce everything at next to no cost, owned by the People, are created can we begin to not worry so much about supply and demand, or even money itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This requires a lot of grassroots organizing, and several massive mountains to be climbed. It's not impossible but it is a daunting task and one our generation must take on or see this country collapse and unfettered capitalism with it.

       The problem is that you're suggesting reformism when capitalist democracy prevents significant reformation from occurring, because the capitalists control our education, our media, and our legislatures.

       This is an interesting idea and one of the reasons I so heavily advocate for libertarian socialism. By organizing the working class into strong unions and using these unions as political vehicles, we can potentially affect change. This is similar to, but not quite the same as, anarcho-syndicalism. I think this might be the best shot we have at forcing change and reform through democratic, rather than revolutionary, means. But then again our capitalist owned legislatures (with assistance with media spin) has neutered unions in so many states, and in many industries it's nearly impossible to unionize...

       I'm not sure what you mean unless you're saying that they are equally unviable. Anarcho-syndicalism worked well enough in Catalonia, until they were crushed by Franco. But if you are saying that they are not viable options, I sort of agree and sort of don't. I think that a push for anarcho-syndicalism could be massively effective
       <strong>
        <em>
         if

       it were possible to educate everyone and get everybody on the same page to make that push, but that seems to be impossible given that I frequently encounter people who refuse to even entertain the notion that libertarian socialism
       <em>
        exists

       Oh no, I was driving while writing that and probably too vague. I absolutely support anarcho-syndicalism. If you haven't seen it, check out The Take by Naomi Klein.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Marxism-Leninism and its derived forms do this, "communism" is literally simply a theoretical state of society (characterized by being classless, moneyless, and stateless) thought to follow from full implementation of socialism. The disagreement among socialists (i.e. Red vs Black, Statists versus Anarchists) is in how to achieve that implementation. People get confused because of "Communist China" or "The Communist Party," but they are only so named because this communist state is the theoretical end goal of their ideology. But that ideology isn't "communism," it's Marxism-Leninism/Maoism/etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the reasoning behind the Vanguard Party is based in what I said in my other comment- Lenin and his followers believed it was necessary to have a core group of professional revolutionaries in order for the revolution to occur at all. Otherwise, there is no central organization to resist outside attempts at subversion and infiltration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you in that I believe it is necessary to stay focused on democratic organization from the get-go, otherwise the risk of an authoritarian system developing is too high, but at the same time Lenin isn't exactly wrong in his arguments. I wish I could think of a more feasible path forward, but the syndicalism I mentioned to you below is the best idea I've had so far. The problem is that any decentralized, democratic method will by necessity have to be open and transparent, but being open and transparent is essentially opening up your playbook for your political enemies. And the capitalist class does not wish to yield its authority.

       This is how I felt most of my life. Now, I think TPTB use Marxism to further consolidate their power. In the end, there will probably always be government. Through Marxism, they could create an all-powerful one world government and effectively make slaves out of all of us.

       Marxism is 100% against centralized power. Socialism is a transitionary period where a government exists -- the vanguard as mentioned above. Unfortunately, external pressures (capitalist empires, fascist takeovers) have never let anything close to true communism take over.

       The thing is, many people (myself included) think that anything close to true communism would never take over even
       <strong>
        without
       </strong>
       external pressures. It would allways stays in an eternal socialist dictatorship. The way to reach the communist utopy just doesn't sound realistic enough, and anyone used to see everything from a conspiracy point of view would never trust the socialist method.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said in another comment that "power is corrupting", yet marxism wants to reach that utopy by power. That alone is more than enough to make people from the conspiracy world skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I don't think that being against communism makes people capitalist by default. To give you an example, in the conspiracy scene there are many people that believes we can reach an utopy in wich money and power would dissapear and real freedom and equality would born, with technology  to make robots that would produce resources to sustain life and sustain themselves.

       Revolution in itself is authoritarian by nature. It's imposing the will of one group upon another. But if the end goal of one group is to establish prosperity for the many, rather than for the few, that authority can be seen under a more positive light.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, leftist infighting is pretty strong over the issue of Vanguardism. Was Lenin wrong to establish a small group of people to hold power to spearhead an eventual total revolution? Perhaps. But it led to a period of unprecedented prosperity and growth for his people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if conspiracy theorists are so skeptical of power... maybe they'd be the right people to LEAD the revolution?

It's really marvelous how well they were able to industrialize (too bad brainlets love to diminish this achievement with "lol gulags" because the U.S. totally doesn't use prison labor (not to mention the gulags weren't exactly vital for industrialization, but anyway)).
      </p>

       People love to go "Holodomor!" too, but if you actually look at quality of life it was a constant upward trend. Constant GDP growth
       <strong>
        <em>
         even in years of global recession
        </em>
       </strong>
       (it's almost like boom-bust cycles are a feature of capitalism). And then when the USSR collapsed, quality of life went down sharply. Tuberculosis rates started to rise, infant mortality rates, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, anyway, I didn't mean to comment here to defend the Soviet Union because I personally am not a fan of Marxism-Leninism or any of their derived ideologies. I just wanted to point out that they didn't exactly fail miserably (and likely would have been more successful if the Cold War hadn't locked them into an arms race with the U.S.). I also wanted to point out that
       <strong>
        <em>
         Marxist-Leninist derived socialism is not all that exists
        </em>
       </strong>
       . There are several forms of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">
        libertarian socialism
       </a>
       that I believe have useful ideas to build a better future.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">
        Anarcho-syndicalism
       </a>
       is an example of one such ideology. To tl;dr it for you, it's essentially where the workers themselves own the means of production directly (or through their trade unions) rather than collectivism under a state. It was with these sorts of people that George Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War, and it was their influence that led him to a lifelong disdain of authoritarian socialism (although he was a devout socialist, not something most people seem to know given that people commonly believe- incorrectly- that 1984 was written "against socialism").

       I'm a supporter of what the Soviet Union was attempting, but don't blindly support everything they did. Almost everything after Stalin was a disaster. 
I just try not to come off as 100% tankie when trying to help break others out of their programming. It makes them put up an immediate "AMERICA #1" defense.

       Lollllll capitalism doesn't decentralize shit, it concentrates wealth and power into the hands of the few.

       If you want something that actually has decentralization of power as its goal, you should be looking at

       .

      <p>
       Here's an essay on
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990117030925/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html">
        State Socialism and Anarchism
       </a>
       that is very informative. Note, he's really wrong about Marxism, but if people here will actually read it (I seriously wonder if anyone has ever read it any of the times I've posted, people tend to just immediately mash downvote) they'll find that they'll agree with everything he says about it. It's just on and on about how Marxists want to take your toothbrush or whatever. Anyway, when he gets to the part where he describes the anarchists' philosophy, what I found interesting is that it's 99% the same as modern right-libertarians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference, really, between what he says of Warren and Proudhon and their views and stuff I see posted here all day every day, is that modern libertarianism supports the unabridged right to capital ownership with no restrictions, and these original libertarians did not. I wonder why that is the case? Could it have anything to do with oligarchs like the Kochs bankrolling the Tea Party and other libertarian (anarcho-capitalist) organizations?
      </p>
      <p>
       But, anyway, I digress. I recommend everyone read that essay. All the "End the Fed!" types might notice themselves nodding in agreement when he gets to the part about the "money monopoly."

       Well, I hope that you find that you do not truly hate socialism, but rather the authoritarianism with which it has been associated.

       Truly defined "socialism" and "communism" are not what you think they are, and I'm not saying this to be mean. They've been associated with horrid atrocities, and thus the names have been completely and utterly tarnished, when in reality they are interesting ideas to entertain regardless of their actual tenability to real societies.

       "By any means necessary" is not a true definition because some companies do not do this, just like many animals don't kill "just because" they can. Capitalism is akin to nature in that, yes, humans do have to kill (other organisms) in order to eat and stay alive, but it's "what" you consume them that makes the biggest difference.

       I think asking for capitalism to remain honest and fair is completely delusional. While Nordic countries may have figured out ways to keep it balanced through heavy regulation, they're merely one right wing swing away from turning into corporate tax havens with massive inequality. Capitalism inevitably breaks down under its own excesses, which leads to "socialist"-style policymaking. That's the stage we've been in since the 1930s, but it's only been exacerbated since the Nixon era

Definitely not near always tactful, or clean, as people want that kind of discussion 5o be, but when we spend years telling people not to discuss religion or politics to keep your friends, it blows up when it does happen.

       I would argue that the reaction to this post, the downvoting of anything remotely leftist, the disproportionate upvoting on the posts disagreeing with leftist viewpoints, and the posts every day asking, "Since when have we become r/The_Donald?" and "Since when have we become white supremacists?" are solid indications that this subreddit has a very clear political stance developing. The hard right.

       You mean the one's that are upvoted to the front page of this sub? You may have had a better argument a few years ago when Obama was in office, but this place has actually gotten significantly more "liberal" and, in general, more politically divided over the past year. This sub used to condemn both sides of the political spectrum because, as any true critical thinker knows, they are two sides of the same corrupt coin.

       Free Market Capitalism is the most liberating economic system. It is a system where humans truly own the fruits of their labor. It's merely, you have something I want, and I have something you want, and we voluntarily transact. You profit, I profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem(s) come in, when the government gets involved and tries to centrally plan/regulate it, via currency, laws, and regulations.  This leads to the bigger business destroying it's competition via lobbying of said regulations and laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been brainwashed into thinking we actually have Capitalism. We don't and haven't had it for a very, very long time.

       The government? Even in an anarchist economy people will prefer rules, whether written or unwritten, because organization is the antidote to chaos. However, I think we can agree that the larger the government the more arcane the rules, and the more sluggish the business will be. On whichever scale, who knows the rules best, profits most. And we do actually have capitalism, only a Frankenstein monster-sized one.

       you're getting it twisted.  under capitalism, the capitalists own the fruits of the workers' labor.  workers do not own their tools nor what they produce.   of all they produce, workers only get what their masters deem acceptable.   having to work for someone else's personal benefit or else face starvation isn't a voluntary agreement.  trading or markets is not unique to capitalism and a free market is abstract nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you don't think we currently have capitalism, what would you call the current system where a bunch of capitalists control the government, own the vast majority of wealth and live off the workers' labor and plundered resources?

       "To the average person, it sounds crazy to suggest that a network of super-wealthy capitalists is secretly conspiring to gain control of the world. But it sounds even crazier to accuse these same super-wealthy capitalists of using their tremendous wealth and power to popularize a system of government (Communism) that would, in theory anyway, lead to the destruction of all their wealth and power...
      </p>
      <p>
       the power structure that he exposed isn’t loyal to Communism, or Socialism, or Fascism, or capitalism. The Network is happy to exploit the rhetoric of any movement or ideology, prop up any dictator or tyrant, and support any economic or political model, provided it serves their one overarching aim. That aim, to bring “all the habitable portions of the world under their control,” is as old as the lust for power itself. The death and suffering that their policies have already caused in pursuit of this aim are incalculable."

       There should be no billionaires. Nobody should control us. That's why many on the left believe in "constant revolution," the idea that we need to be always vigilant against someone assuming power and creating corrupt hierarchies. Yes, it's tumultuous and inherently violent, but so is a power structure.

       I think it is way more nuanced than that. CT's don't like consolidation of power. CT's generally like "free markets", but they understand that big business colludes to consolidate power in that framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that reason, CT's like a flavor of capitalism that:
1. Treats corporations critically, and skeptically... but fairly. Corporations are NOT people.
2. Isolate money and politics into two separate domains. Major election reform REQUIRED.
3. Forces corporations to pay the REAL costs of their business, including environmental protection and infrastructure usage.

       Money interests have successfully legalized bribery in this country since the 1970s. And to me, that's exactly what successful, unfettered capitalism looks like. People saying we haven't ever had capitalism before don't realize that the state has, through regulation, been trying desperately to quell it's uncontrollable growth because the state also benefits from the capitalist system and once had smart people working to maintain an illusion of stability. Now neoliberalism is the dominant paradigm and it's a fiery game of Hungry Hungry Hippos

       I think it is not capitalism, per se, but in-fact the independent individual who makes their own decisions, caters for their own requirements and believes that capitalism is the best system to allow that level of freedom. Some people want nanny government to run their lives, others don't. One of those types of people think for themselves and work hard, the other doesn't.

       I think the answer to your question is historical and cultural in nature.  Historical in the sense, that 'a conspiracy mindset' was responsible for many movements that shaped the religious and cultural landscape. Think about the anti-Catholic conspiricism dominating protestant and evangelical  sects.  In addition to this you have decades of very successful anti-communist propaganda which was de-facto dominated by mainstream conspiracy theories through McCarthist and Bircher society type stuff.   The notions of communist infiltration of US institutions with a goal of establishing a 'Stalinesque' type system dominated, not just the fringes of political science, but was mainstream education.   Couple this with the fact that anti-communism was the biggest project for why the CIA was in existence, and the result will be that a large segment of the public, and the representative sample of the 'conspiracy community', will still share pro-capitalism and anti-communist views.

       The term libertarianism originally meant, and still commonly refers to anti-state socialism. In the United States it has to be clarified as anarcho-syndicalism or libertarian socialism because of the bastardization of the original term by the "Don't Tread on Me" crowd. 
Anarchy is not the abolishment of groups and organization, it means the abolition of a state, of authority, of control. The anarchist motto is "No Gods, No Masters." But cooperation is paramount.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anarchists organizing is not contradictory. We can organize as a people against a state, against "two strong guys exerting control". People are not as passive as US libertarians like to think. We can eliminate hierarchies, and there are countless examples of societies that have successfully done so, until profit motives and external forces (like in Spain, as someone mentioned earlier) come in and shut them down through extreme force.

       I meant libertarianism as in the philosophical model of ethics (TBH not even sure which one is “Big L” and “Little L” at this point), not a hodge-podge political ideology, but I favor a political ideology based on the philosophical model.  The “Don’t thread on me” crowd has the fundamentals correct overall, if not the specifics.
       <em>
        Do as you will do long as it does not infringe upon others’ right to do so.

      <p>
       I must ask, do you not see the error in your defense of anarchy “No Gods, No Masters”!?  You may see anarchy on the macro scale, but anytime a powerful person or group exerts control upon another, that is
       <em>
        the state
       </em>
       on a micro scale.  To create anarchy isn’t anything but a
       <em>
        tabla rasa
       </em>
       for the evolution of another state.

       Capitalism is the most compatible with liberty. All capitalism is is the state allowing you private property and free/voluntary trade. In capitalism, you have the right to be left alone. When people criticise capitalism, they are usually criticising crony capitalism or corporatism. The US needs more capitalism, we have fallen far away from it.

       If liberty means an individual's ability to exploit the living shit out of everyone around him for his own gain that he can then spin to look good for everyone thanks to good PR, then yes, capitalism is good for liberty.
Equality and fairness, on the other hand, are nowhere to be found in unfettered capitalism.

       They absolutely are, and they still exploit their workers and act shady like capitalists everywhere else. They just have stronger regulatory controls in place.

       Well I'm with you that unfettered capitalism is bad and that some regulation does need to exist- mainly to ensure a free and fair and competitive market. It's really about competition, that's what progresses the human race technologically and economically.

        I think that quote is more about the sad realization people come to that if they don't start exploiting the system, they'll be exploited. It shouldn't be championed by conservatives, it should be embarrassing. Basically, "You must kill your soul to succeed under capitalism."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's an interesting take on things. I disagree though. I think most of the libertarian constitutionalist conservative types here are more about "live and let live", moreso than trying to get in on the exploitation.

       I agree that competition has been incredibly useful for developing new technologies. But I don't know if the profit motive is necessarily the only element that drives competition. Look at any scientific field, where people are constantly driven to make new discoveries. Look at the scientists who have refused to profit off of their discoveries so as to help more people in the long run. Hell, Cuba developed new techniques in medicine while under socialist control, and none of those researchers were doing it because they wanted to become millionaires. Human beings are explorers, and we love creating and discovering. Financial gain is a very strong incentive, but not the only one.
      </p>
      <p>
       My other counter-argument would be that capitalism was a useful tool, one we are steadily outgrowing as we see its flaws piling up. As soon as we have the capacity to create advanced AIs or programs whose sole functions are to create new technologies that help everyone, why do we as organisms need to be competing with one another anymore? Our time alive is sorely limited -- shouldn't it be spent seeking health and fulfillment rather than
       <em>
        winning
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       As to your point that under socialism and communism, competition dies -- you may be right. If you're at all into science fiction, I recommend reading the work of Iain M. Banks. He's definitely a socialist writer, but many of the huge philosophical themes in his book revolve around the question of, "Okay, now what?"
In Consider Phlebas, an alien empire wants to destroy the communist society known as The Culture -- not because they want their resources or to demonstrate their power, but to make a point: that the decadent society they've created where no one suffers, everyone lives until they wish to die, etc., means no one creates anymore. It's an evolutionary dead end.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to me, right now, in capitalism, I think a highly advanced society where I never have to worry about dying from cancer or living without shelter but being at an evolutionary dead end sounds pretty okay to me.

       Sorry, but have you ever tried to improve anyone's standard of living? The people on top definitely receive unfair advantage in any kind of system that humans have ever attempted, mainly for the same reason that people who seek power over others, like politicians, are assailed and psychopaths.  The kind of people that have mental problems which drive them to ceaselessly accumulate power or wealth are the ones who accumulate power or wealth.  In a capitalistic society they can be anywhere.  In a communistic society they're all in government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people are content to have a home and food and some frivolities, they aren't going to put in the effort that the mentally ill do.  Of all the normals, a huge portion are incapable of doing much for themselves at all.  They are basically children, without the minimal drive, motivation, or intelligence needed to provide what could be considered a pleasant existence for their families.  They just can't make it in modern society without a benevolent employer or a nanny state.  Distribution of resources should definitely be more fair, but it's always going to be unequal because people are unequal.  I wish everyone could have equal opportunities, but I also hate the amount of control necessary for greater socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty happy in the Philippines.  Government is not so intrusive but there is free and cheap basic healthcare and some minimal safety net for the very poor.  Obviously things could be 1000x better, but that's applicable nearly everywhere.

       In a capitalist society, the people driven by a mad desire to hoard wealth and power write the rules of that society, and if they aren't in high government positions, they're very likely paying people in those positions to act according to their will.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a communist society, there is no state. There is not a president, no congress. There's no hierarchy for you to move up by backstabbing or luck. You do not compete for wealth and power because there is no
       <em>
        incentive
       </em>
       to gain wealth or power. There is no private property, so you don't fight over land and resources. And if you try to seize land, resources, or power, you will be punished for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said, "In a communistic society [the psychopaths] are all in government." How could you know this? Where could you possibly have learned this? Where are the historical examples? It's an assumption -- and one that betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of what a communistic society actually is. Sure, we have cases like Cambodia, where the leader started out promising to his people that he wanted communism, but quickly was outed as a fraud by people within his own party. He was a power hungry psychopath who committed genocide. But this is a single case -- you can't claim that everyone in the government was just like him.

       Marxism-Leninism, working ideally, would make sure nobody was ever able to assert dominance over anyone else. The working ideally part is difficult, but as long as people are spreading toxic misinformation about what it wishes to achieve, it'll never reach that ideal anyway.

      <p>
       And to your point about people that are basically without motivation or intelligence: capitalism makes these people suffer. They don't have that deep longing for wealth or power or success. Some people are comfortable with just living, learning, and being happy. Capitalism has deemed these people lazy, people who deserve their fates.

       I think the confusion results from the fact that you're thinking of a theoretical "authentic communist" society, which is impossible for humans to implement, because they are human.  That's why I wrote "communistic" and "capitalistic", because the actual societies that have existed just vaguely take inspiration from capitalist or communist or socialist or other ideas.

       They suffer under pretty much all governments, because they are at the mercy of others.  The bible describes them as sheep, shorn and tossed about, beset by ravenous wolves.  Pretty accurate, I think.  The statue of liberty calls them the poor, huddled masses.  Then you think that communism can hand everything over to them, and benevolent people will govern over them in a fair and even-handed way, and no one will fleece the sheep.  Why would you think that's possible, when you have the entirety of human history to describe human behavior to you?

       Yes!  To me, that is what a normal, healthy human being should be like. If you read my comment, I think that people who are driven to accumulate massive amounts of wealth and power are mentally defective.

      <p>
       IMHO, it seems, based on history, that it's more possible to achieve a simple, pleasant existence if private property is allowed.  The amount of government control required for advanced socialism is just too intrusive.  In any government, there are going to be q fair amount of psychopaths in positions of power.  There is nothing in communism or socialism or capitalism which prevents a typical ruling class from ascending.

       To me, understanding capitalism as the ultimate problem is the last piece of the puzzle. Everything fits together so nicely. I don't need Satanic cults or reptilian shapeshifters or the breakaway society to explain away everything: it's just capitalist greed (with maybe some cult stuff mixed in there for funsies, and they could very likely be reptilian shapeshifters or agents of the breakaway society).
      </p>
      <p>
       And once you know the core of the problem, you can start working on a solution. If you aren't in favor of abolishing capitalism, you're helping to perpetuate the evils of the world we live in, and contributing (if indirectly) to the conspiracies you hate and the loathsome people who perpetrate them.

       Maybe just capitalist in a general sense.  Typically conspiracy theorists would be distrustful of government or other authorities, and in general capitalist nations have offered more freedom and ability to criticize and to follow your own path with less interference.  I know several conspiracy minded people with absolutely no interest in becoming wealthy, and several millionaires who are conspiracy minded because of the obvious ubiquity of conspiracies.  How can you avoid conspiracies when that's basically how the world operates?  Where on earth do you see governments and corporations operating in a completely transparent manner?  All these wars and bizarre terror attacks scrappy election choices and insane drug prices and drug epidemics, etc can often be the result of obvious conspiracies.  Honestly, the only reason
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to be conspiracy minded is because you want to ignore the myriad problems of the world around you.

       I agree with you. In practice, capitalism works because the employee accepts less pay for the value that is being provided. The employer keeps the difference and the employee has just given up free time and labor. Scale this upward and include the fact that the government is also taking money from everyone taking money from each other...and we have America.

       It's not about money, it's about commerce; communal mercy. True commerce requires mercy, do not cut down your competition. Real capitalism requires trust, the worst places to do commerce are usually the ones where there is little trust in governments, corporations or each other.

       Perhaps they're brainwashed and thus too afraid of commies and socialists take over.
On the other hand half of the conspiracies here would become obsolete if capitalism would not exist.

       I also noticed that a big Portion seems to crumble in fear when the word social programs is mentioned, fearing it is a socialist Invention, instead as seeing it just as social, well the opposite of anti-social.

       Social behaviour also isn't an invention of the socialists, it's just proven to be the better and smarter way to handle social interactions within a society. :)

       A big part of the whole mind fuck is labeling things and attaching emotional responses and singular connections to the labels. I say capitalism, you think America, freedom, being rich and happy. I say communism and you think Russia and being poor and sad. If I said we should all share and help each other, or I said we should just base society of money and whoever has money gets to make the decisions you would get totally different reactions than capitalism or communism. Lots of mindfucks have been instituted across these lines to get people to go along with the bullsht.

       In a capitalist society, the people driven by a mad desire to hoard wealth and power write the rules of that society, and if they aren't in high government positions, they're very likely paying people in those positions to act according to their will.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a communist society, there is no state. There is not a president, no congress. There's no hierarchy for you to move up by backstabbing or luck. You do not compete for wealth and power because there is no
       <em>
        incentive
       </em>
       to gain wealth or power. There is no private property, so you don't fight over land and resources. And if you try to seize land, resources, or power, you will be punished for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said, "In a communistic society [the psychopaths] are all in government." How could you know this? Where could you possibly have learned this? Where are the historical examples?
