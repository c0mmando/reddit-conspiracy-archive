       There's a serious problem right now and I think the American people need to do something about it. Let me get this straight. The FBI is wiretapping ncaa coaches to find out if they are paying students to enroll, but they don't have the resources to follow up on a tip for a walking red flag of a kid who is able to carry out a school shooting? Is this what our tax dollars pay for? It's time to vote all of these guys out. Maybe a few million people withhold their federal taxes for a few weeks? How about a public "shut down"? Seems to be fine for congress. Bet we'd have some answers and no more mistakes like this. If I'm incompetent at my job I get fired. Stop talking about fucking Russia and gender pronouns and start talking about the real issues.

       I was (am) under the impression that the FBI was one of the lesser corrupt intelligence agencies in the U.S. The CIA, CDC, FDA, etc. are all fucked beyond repair. But I thought that the FBI wasn't as bad. I could be wrong.

       Don't forget about the FCC, the ATF, the DEA, and the NSA. To say one is less corrupt than the other opens yourself to some interesting debates. Yet if you look at any one of these agencies it is clear that they don't have the interest in protecting the people but rather protecting the interest of the companies that keep them on their payrolls. We have been bought and sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe that we have been in a covert civil war amoust different groups in the intelligence communities and that the different groups within the CIA and FBI could be trying to infiltrate each other to set up\ attack these varying groups that are trying to take control.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example what if the people dropping the ball on these shooters at the FBI are planted there as double agents to intentionally fuck things up so that the DOJ will strip power away from an opposing side.

       While I don't discount this, I don't think it merits 14 months of 24 hour cnn coverage with all the real problems going on in the country/world. What ever happened to truth and pride in journalism. Looking at you cnn nbc abc CBS fox etc. this corporate sponsored media/gov is literally shoving shit in our face and laughing and it's so blatantly obvious, yet no one talks about it or does anything about it. It's time for the politicians to face consequences and publicly be caught holding the bag. What are they going to tell their corporate bosses when they finally get caught fucking up the gov.

       Only a person ignorant of history would not understand how important it is. Putin has played the USA like a fool. Using tactics that have been tryed and true for years to undermine democracy. The fact that a large number of USA citizens have fallen for it has shown what happens when you divest in public education. Most people who claim the Russia thing is no big also claim to believe in freedom. Do the tiniest bit of research on Putin's Russia and you will find out why it is a conflict of interest and a BIG DEAL.

       And the country is more divided than ever. Left hates right and demonized them constantly and the Right is getting more ideological as well in understandable reaction to this constant vilification.  And Libertarians like me were ostracized and vilified by both when in reality both sides right and left have more in common with Libertarians than they do with the so called leaders of their parties.

       First off, Collusion has yet to proven or charged. But men have pleaded guilty to helping Russia tamper with our election. A incredibly corrupt President was put in place leading to profiting of his office. This President has direct ties to criminals connected to Putin. The Nunes memo is a joke that the far right has eaten up like sugar. Meanwhile the super rich got massive tax cut. The world is laughing at us because we have turned into a banana republic by Putin and did not see it coming. Similar tactics were used be Putin in European countries and were roundly rejected. But here we bought hook line and sinker. And now sanctions dropped against Russia and Putin threatens nuclear war and his puppet is silent.

       Downvotes might be because you're oversimplifying the situation. If we stop paying taxes, the IRS would have no revenue. When there's no revenue, they wouldn't just stop paying all of the government's employees, they'd pull funds from less necessary programs and borrow money to make sure that the right people kept getting paid. A public strike can have positive effects, but it wouldn't work in the direct way you're suggesting it would.

       This is dumb and beneath anyone actually needing to respond.  What's important for others is that the FBI does get political but ultimately those are career, good people that care about America.  Why? because at that level, the public sector is waaaay more lucrative.

       Maybe I wasn't clear. With all of the famine genocide slavery and war crimes going on in the world, Russia is not a real issue. If cnn took the money the spent covering Russia for the last year and spent it on food they could feed the world for years. Just like Donald Trump's could prob do the same if he didn't travel as much. It's all a bunch of bullshit bro. This red vs blue shit is the reality TV show set up so you don't pay attention to what's really going on. I thought everyone knew this already.

       I honestly think they knew this kid was a ticking time bomb. They let it go too many times for them not to know. Sheriff is big friends with Debby W. Sholtz and department is big into under reporting crimes to get more federal funding. However, allowing this kid to go psycho lets them push the gun control narrative harder than ever and it helps when you have the next generation of cnn talking heads groomed as students. Hell you even have a Republican President saying some pretty worrying things when it comes to gun control.

       There was also talk about schools and local police forces working together and burying shit under the rug, so as to make it seem the school districts are much safer than they actually are.  I can’t recall what articles or discussions I read about it because it was during the flurry of media activity following the shooting, but I swear I read people talking about it.  I wish I could be more specific though.

       That really isn't a fair comparison. The FBI were unable to make a move against the NCAA coaches
       <em>
        until
       </em>
       they engaged in the crime. They had proof of a crime and we're able to act upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would they have done the same with a school shooter? Especially if he acted alone. He would not be making plans online for the FBI to reference, so they would have to put him under 24hr manned surveillance just to be able to respond the instant he starts to break the law. People reporting him to the police/FBI is great and all, but they would need more than reports to take action beyond surveillance.

       He made social media posts with his face and did all kinds of shit that should have gone into the background check system and prevented him from getting guns under existing laws or at least gotten him investigated because he was making threats to shoot people in his REAL FULL NAME.

       A public strike is a fun idea, but I'm not sure it'd be possible to organize that kind of movement without getting shut down. And if we did it, it wouldn't have the direct result of the government suddenly becoming democratic. The result would likely be a hard crack down on that kind of dissidence. We'd all be locked up and enslaved for the crime of tax evasion, and if we manage to fill up their prisons with political prisoners, they'll use the profits from our slave labor to build even more for-profit prisons.

       Hopefully any sort of crack down would result in more people joining the movement. We the people have the power and it's time to take control back. This government is no longer representative of the people. Shit it's in their fucking title. "State representative" means their actions should be dictated by the people who voted them in. At least with a movement like this, more people might be on board because they will be getting money out of it

       I've been on board with a shutdown/withholding taxes for years now, it's the only language these tools understand.

       I'm curious who would downvoted here. I think it's a general consensus that the FBI is dropping the ball in many ways.

       You mentioned it in your post and then casually dismissed it, so why wouldn’t it be a part of the conversation here?

       This is dumb and beneath anyone actually needing to respond.  What's important for others is that the FBI does get political but ultimately those are career, good people that care about America.  Why? because at that level, the public sector is waaaay more lucrative.
