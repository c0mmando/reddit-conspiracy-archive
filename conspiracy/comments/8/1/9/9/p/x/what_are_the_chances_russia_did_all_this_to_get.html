       Say they used multiple methods of attack to see which would be caught and how. The nature of the attack makes it to where the population would certainly want as much public as possible. Not even mentioning if they have a mole or 2 somewhere collecting the secret info as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: "all this" meaning hacking and the psyops. I was thinking that it was too easy that we found it was them. I mean even come said they way they did it was like they wanted to be caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm thinking no way they use this massive hacking effort just one time on us and just for politics. Maybe they could use it for our power grid. But surely we have measures in place or something or maybe we'd know while it's happening and prevent it. If he could find a way to find out what we knew about there operations, they could patch the holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, just a thought. I have no objective other than to be like "see, I was right!" If that day ever comes.

       The decision to gain access to and release the emails from private citizens in order to damage a political opponent isn't just something taken lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one end the government is accusing Russian hackers of taking the emails with evidence through their classified information.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the other is trying to say Seth Rich did it because he was a panda and there's a twitter account called pandas4bernie or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that along with real citizens, they would pay people to help drum up the hysteria. Posing as Bernie or Trump supporters and do nothing but attack Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this was done to purposely not get her elected because the other side was a lot more favorable to them. If it failed they would have to deal with Clinton, if they succeed they got the guy who has praised Putin on T.V. but still have to deal with our congress.

       Russians shilled for Trump while simultaneous snitching on him to the intelligence community. Choose a side, American. Either you're with Trump or you're with the intelligence community. Let the cognitive dissonance take hold of you until your decide to give up on politics.

       Maybe the sensationalist in me wants it to not be the case. I mean the strategy they had with the 13 ppl here and all that, the multiple cut outs and side businesses seaking the same objective, that's some pretty great lengths just to get caught and be done with it. and only political stuff? Seems like a waste. Like we're only seeing half of what they were doing.

       I doubt the public has been exposed to 10% of what was going on. The
       <em>
        establishment
       </em>
       (Republican and Democrat are just prole terms) is horrified that the public will find out the 2016 election was stolen outright. The Electoral College margin is 77,000 votes out of ~170 million. And no one investigated this obvious mathematical curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the actual role of Putin in the election may not have been as slap-dash as heretofore indicated. While Putin is ultimately a poser like Trump, Putin gets his results through force and money. The US voter will never be told just how weak the US system is to outside interference. Currently Democratic Party votes are ultimately meaningless unless those votes are strategic and overwhelming.
