    <div class="md"><p>The moving upwards thing comes from the Flat earth society which is a disinformation group, it&#39;s not actually a commonly held belief among FEers in my experience. Gravity is typically seen as fake and density and buoyancy are the reasons for floating or falling. Look up the strength of gravity on earth compared to electromagnetism, or even gravity versus any other fundamental force and it&#39;s super weak and only relevant on huge astronomical scales and not relevant to terra firma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravity makes little sense as is. The complexity of its theoretical existence is unprovable at the moment and the scientific community picks and chooses when the scientific method applies to accepting theories / beliefs. The only actual proof I&#39;ve seen is that they say they detect gravity waves from millions of light years away, which is a joke ( and even those claims have been refuted ). Gravity is not only the explanation of something falling, but something that is needed to work in magical ways to make an entire belief system exist.</p>

<p>No real FE&#39;r thinks that the Earth is moving.  That was introduced by the FE society, which is a controlled opposition group that was created to make the entire movement seem like a joke.  They give some good info and then inject absurdities (like the earth moving upwards) into the theory to make it lose credibility.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Work from the axiom the earth is flat and there is a firmament and it all makes sense. Just like if you work from the earth being a ball it tends to make sense as well, that&#39;s why most people think it&#39;s a ball, confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance are powerful psychological effects. I am a flat earther but I used to think the earth was an oblate spheroid pear thing like most people before I started to research. Modeling observations and data can lead to multiple workable models, science and math are not the concrete perfect explanations followers of the new religion scientist that has gotten so popular. Here is a video that provides a good explanation for how the firmament creates the phenomenon of southern celestial observations ( <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PZmlUHKm1cY">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PZmlUHKm1cY</a> ). Open your mind people, flat earth is legit. </p>

Meanwhile, you are giving NASA 50 million/per day to produce CGI lies and moon landing hoaxes, yet, that&#39;s totally fine with everyone. Jeez, man...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a couple for you. Let us see if your ball survives. Explain how everyone on the globe, from different latitudes (upside down, sideways, and straight up relative to location) can see the same geographic celestial equator, while rotating, spinning in 3+ directions. Explain how our atmosphere meets the &#39;vacuum of space&#39; while remaining intact. Explain- does the earth rotate dependent or independent of the atmosphere? If dependent, then how do you explain an airplane flying 500mph east-west trying to land on a north-south strip? If independent, then why can&#39;t an airplane simply hover while the earth beneath it rotates to get to its destination? How much longer would it take to fly west? or How would weather systems work in the latter scenario? I could go on... </p>

<p>You guys think your big daddy, occultist, sun worshipping scientists have it all figured out since 500 years ago, right?? Okay. Good luck with that. Let us know how it works out for ya.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to understand.  Just look at the pictures and the perfect theoretical math.  Sure, you can bounce signals off of something very solid in the upper altitudes but you can also fly solid things through this same deflector - no problem.  Space-time is a fabric.  Sure it does not bunch up or produce space-time waves as things explode and move, but brilliant (sic) Albert says it is there so it must be true.  All you have to do is believe. /s</p>

<p>Oh boy, here we go.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Viewing angles. Take any star and you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s parallax is REALLY freaking small. Considering the human eye has a angular resolution of about 1 arcminute, you aren&#39;t going to notice shit. Especially over a distance of only 12,000km max (since you argued over differences in latitude). </p>

<p>Now before you say something along the lines of &quot;oh you&#39;re using distances from NASA&quot;. Here&#39;s my retort. Why is there a Celestial Equator TO BEGIN WITH? If that dome rotates around Polaris, why does it suddenly go straight halfway from the center? The turning of the stars should get less and less intense, but never straight. The fact, why after going straight, do the stars suddenly begin to pull in again? None of this makes sense on a flat earth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain how our atmosphere meets the &#39;vacuum of space&#39; while remaining intact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pressure. Vacuums only &quot;suck&quot; because the air particles are trying to fill the empty space. Pressure is caused by the collisions of air particles. More particles in a certain space, means more pressure. Earth&#39;s atmosphere becomes less and less dense as you go higher and higher. Get high enough, and there&#39;s barely any particles. No particles, no collisions. No collisions, no pressure. No pressure, no reason for the particles to fill the empty space. Gravity does the rest by constantly pulling the air back down so it doesn&#39;t fly out into space. Even if you suddenly removed gravity, the atmosphere wouldn&#39;t suddenly rush away in an instant. It would diffuse out over a long period of time. </p>

<p>How accurate were those predictions? Were they able to predict them for all locations on the planet?</p>

<p>I guess we can work out whether basic Sun rises/sets make any sense on a flat earth.</p>

<p>Every single flat earther that I&#39;ve come across claims that the Sun is close. If the Sun is supposed to be close in the flat earth &quot;model&quot;, why doesn&#39;t it change in angular <strong>size</strong> or angular <strong>speed</strong> over the course of a day when viewed through a solar filter?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4</a></p>

<p>This only gets worse when you take into account the equinox Sun rises and Sun sets. On those days, the Sun will rise due east and set due west regardless of your latitude.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/lKipXJf">http://imgur.com/lKipXJf</a></p>

<p>An experiment has already been performed on the equinox with over 20+ participants. The results support the globe earth and matched predictions for the model, while it made no sense on a flat earth whatsoever. Unless you believe that there are multiple magical Suns at the same time. Flat Earth is broken to the point that Sun angles are all that&#39;s needed to debunk it.</p>

<ul>
<li>CMBR Dipole Anisotropy.</li>
<li>Yearly variations in the CMBR.</li>
<li>Yearly variations in the doppler shift of every star. </li>
</ul>

<p>To account for just these 3 things, every single star in the observable universe needs to perform a synchronized 365 day orbit with a diameter of ~300 million km (weird how those numbers work out). </p>

<p>Another option is that they all, for some reason, get hotter and then colder at the same rate, by the same amount, all synced up, every 365 days. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really? Come on now. Give me your theory on how they measure distance of stars and list the tools they use that make these measurements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How NASA does it? Many ways. How you can do it? Easy. </p>

<p>First we need to find the distance to the Sun. 
* Get two observers and position them at different points on Earth (preferably a few thousand km for more accurate measurements). 
* Find the right ascension of Mars from each of their locations. 
* Have both individuals make their observations at the same time. 
* Get the angular diameter of Mars. </p>

<p>From the observations you work out...
* The angle of Mars from the two observers. 
* The vector between the two observers and it&#39;s length.
* A vector from observer 1 to Mars.
* The angle between the vector of &quot;observer 1 to Mars&quot; to observer two. </p>

<p>Then...
* Use the Law of Cosines to calculate the distance of Mars from observer 2.
* Calculate the distance to the Sun using Kepler&#39;s third law. </p>

<p>Now using the distance to the Sun...
* Make 2 separate observations of a single star separated by 182.5 days (use solar days, not sidereal). 
* Calculate difference in viewing angle.
* Calculate distance from the chosen star to the Sun knowing that the difference in distance between observation 1 and 2 was twice that of the distance to the Sun. </p>

<p>Obviously there are limits, but you&#39;ll be able to measure the parallax of quite a few stars.  </p>

<p>For gods sake, the first parallax observation was made back in 1836 with this thing. </p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/EB1911_-_Heliometer_-_Fig._11.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/EB1911_-_Heliometer_-_Fig._11.jpg</a></p>

<p>Are you telling me you can&#39;t beat 1836 tech?</p>

<p>So basically what YOU need is...
* A decent commercial telescope.
* Two people at different locations (each with a telescope).
* Math.</p>

It doesn&#39;t say the hypothesis is absolute truth. Therefore we continue to change our understanding as we study more. I continued studying but these science jerking assholes thought they knew everything and then stopped taking in new information. It&#39;s like they&#39;re sitting on a pile of dog shit, claiming they have all the dog shit in the world and if you showed them a dog turd, they would deny it for the reason that it couldn&#39;t possibly be dog shit because they have all the dog shit there is to have and thus they would already have had it. So you just rub it in their face and move on haha that would be the Alan Watts take on all this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re asserting that all these facets aren&#39;t explained by the model, but like the other commenter said...there are different models and they have different explanations for some of those concepts. Just because we can&#39;t agree on the answers at the moment, doesn&#39;t make the globe theory correct for having offered explanations.</p>
