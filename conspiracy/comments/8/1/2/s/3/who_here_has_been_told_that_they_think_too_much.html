<p>i&#39;ve been told this so much that i have had serious questions as to my own intelligence <em>and</em> my sanity...i&#39;ve wondered if maybe i am retarded, perhaps even subtly so...</p>

<p>the funny thing is that sometimes, <em>sometimes</em>, i allow myself to be convinced that i do just this, that i think too much...and it always bites me in the ass...<strong><em>always</em></strong>...</p>

<p>like another&#39;s statement here, i do not think i am all that smart...and i <em>know</em> that many i have interacted with are <em>significantly</em> more intelligent...they do not/cannot, however, &quot;see&quot; the things that i see, do not recognize the <em>conspiracy</em> (for example)...</p>

<p>i reached a point, not too long ago, where i no longer required outside validation of that fashion...my life has become much more tenable since...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may order &quot;Ringworld&quot; tonight.  I&#39;ve only read the second book.  So cool, so creative, almost never taking the expected step with the narrative. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a kick waiting for the next amazing concept, fleshed out to the needed extent in very few pages.</p>

<p>Heinlein stands above all, but Niven&#39;s images stick in the mind, little markers of inspiration shot through with humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my rationale, there are two types of conspiracy theorists, those who can comprehend the big picture and realize what is happening, and those that can not comprehend it all and use bits and pieces of the big picture to rant like mad men. </p>

<p>There are many in the middle whose intellects range from not having a clue to fully being able to understand but usually those people have personality faults that preclude them from ever understanding or even wanting to recognize what is happening. Those people can usually not discern the two types of conspiracy theorists and lump anything they cannot understand into the conspiracy nuts category.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Parents, teachers, employers, friends, neighbors...I hear it all the time.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a pattern among these people, and it&#39;s not hard to see once you look right at it.  It&#39;s like finding a quarter in the lawn on a sunny day:  once you see it, you can always find it again.</p>

<p>These &quot;you think too much&quot; people almost always have two things in common:  they declare themselves as Republicans (not conservatives, oddly enough) and they watch a <em>lot</em> of television.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t stant TV, and haven&#39;t watched it regularly in over 20 years.  I&#39;ll get sucked into a TV series every now and then (BSG currently, but before that, Babylon 5), but for the most part, it drives me nuts.</p>

<p>I love to read.  I read everything I can get my hands on.  News reports and politically-related documents have their own patterns.  The big one is &quot;follow the money&quot;, and when you start doing that, you see what a mess everything is and how many lies are told.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another pattern:  the misuse of language.  The practice (now an art) of labelling something or someone for the sole purpose of discrediting it for as many people as possible.</p>

<p>It started with &quot;Commies&quot; and moved on to hippies, liberals, tree-huggers, tin-foil hats, nutjobs...on and on and on.</p>

<p>And yet people still fall for it.  It boggles the mind.</p>

<p>I&#39;m at a point in my life where I honestly don&#39;t know what the fuck to do about it.  It sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spending are large amount of time thinking is in no way related to espousing conspiracy theories which have little to no supporting evidence.</p>

<p>If there was solid evidence to support the theories espoused by the conspiracy theorists, then far more people would take interest. I have yet to see <em>any</em> conspiracy theory supported by more than supposition, hearsay. accusations with little to no supporting evidence.</p>

<p>This, members of the conspiracy community, is why you come across as paranoid lunatics.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  Nor is it related to an increased IQ.  It simply is &#39;thinking&#39;.  Often when people say that &#39;you think too much&#39;, or &#39;you read too much&#39; is a euphemism for you&#39;re a socially withdrawn weirdo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are far too many that think they think, you seem to fall into this category.</p>

<p>While youre intelligent, youre not wise. There is a difference. One can be perfectly articulate, logical and intelligent yet lack a true wisdom - which is an awareness of the sum of ones intelligence and how to apply it.</p>

<p>There are far too many people that want everything handed to them - thought out already.</p>

<p>There is a difference between thinking and actually producing thought. Production of thought occurs when threads of thought intersect and new revelations and realizations take place.</p>

<p>One should be more discerning in their observations, thus their input will be more informed;</p>
