<p>This is incorrect.  Reason and logic are nothing compared to and without wisdom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One wonders why you feel the need to immediately and unsolicitedly respond with an attempt at a put down.  It is indicative of insecurity and a lack of maturity on your part - something made all the more glaring by the fact that the statement you made here is actually in no way correct in and of itself.</p>

<p>One need not the specific knowledge any one particular individual had in order to understand and make adequate use of anything they might have stated.</p>

<p>That said, I will define wisdom for you since the comment you made has made it abundantly clear that you in fact do not posses it:</p>

<p>Among other things, wisdom is the ability to take one’s reasoning and logical abilities and actually use them effectively in the service of helping you evolve physically, psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually.</p>

<p>Logic and reason in and of themselves do not do that.  They simply give one the ability to number crunch and have a certain level of intellectual capacity; it tells you that “A” does “B” - not whether you should go through with doing “A” or not or whether you should take another course of action that would benefit you and others in a more effective manner; what the pros and cons are of the choices before you.</p>

<p>Intellectual capacity can be used for good or for bad; for positive or for the demise of oneself and all those around you.  History if replete with individuals who were very intelligent - had ample amounts of logic and reason - but were exceedingly devolved in the way of advanced evolutionary development, and they consequently used their intelligence to cause all sorts of untold harm upon themselves, upon others, and upon the planet.</p>

<p>Wisdom is ultimately what helps you know how to actually <em>use</em> the intelligence you have.  It is generally qualitative in its scope, while logic and reason can be looked upon as quantitative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the only reason the Federation from Star Trek exists how it does in that fictional universe is because of replication technology. replicators eliminated the need for material acclimation, greed, and the monetary system.</p>

<p>until humanity figures out replication technology, and TPTB don&#39;t squash it &amp; cover it up, it will be very difficult to create such a uptopian society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watching us. Letting us evolve and grow so we can join them one day. Would you wanna hang out with a destructive fearful creature? Its similar to wolves, even now in the wild wolves will come up to humans and are curious, but they are skiddish, fearful, and that can lead to them attacking or becoming aggressive. Kinda like humans would be with aliens if you think about it. And like humans, some I have no doubt are evil, and some are righteous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we&#39;ve only been spitting out any signals from this planet for a little over a hundred something years, so say spacefaring aliens (for some completely illogical reason) still use any sort of radio equipment,  or developed the technology at all. the ONLY way they&#39;d know we&#39;re here, with that in mind, would be if they were within 100~ lightyears ( receiving fucking fireside talks rn if theyre CLOSE) now when you realize theres dick for stars within a hundred light years. then calculate the absolutely astronomical odds of intelligent life developing there, then guage the likelihood that any of that life could be considered &quot;advanced&quot; and subtract the percentage of them that destroy themselves before that, youd have the incredibly low odds that such a species EXISTS, then you need to find some humanity romanticizing reason theyd bother with us IF they were there AND knew we existed. all that aside, well scary aliens represent our most primal fear, the dark. the unknown. its really that simple</p>
