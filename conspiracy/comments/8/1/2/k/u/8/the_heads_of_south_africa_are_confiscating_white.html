    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

<p>I spent most of the day reading up on it.</p>

<p>This happened already in Zimbabwe and was a total disaster. No farmers &gt; no crops &gt; no food and no jobs. So much so that they reversed the decision.</p>

<p>Seizing land is also against the UN&#39;s rules, so this would make them eligible to be refugees. The US could take them since they speak English and already have the education/job experience, combined with hard vetting, they would fit in well here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You beat me to it. </p>

<p>I was going to say this happened in zimbabwe and was a white genocide, but because it&#39;s white people something something slave trade something something colonies something something, the UN did nothing.</p>

<p>The whites kept zimbabwe running, then the blacks kicked them out, ruined everything, forced both blacks and whites into starvation through incompetence and then had the cheek to blame the whites for not helping all the black farmers.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what people say about the white race and their history, the fact is the whites, since greeks/romans, have pushed human evolution more than any other race, with the exception of the ancient chinese.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sorry if this sounds like a white power rant, it&#39;s not, but i am one of the very few people i have ever met that sees race as equally as i do. We all have strengths and weaknesses and, just like a good RPG, you build a team on your strengths but are always well aware of your weaknesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, in essence the government in South Africa is basically using the methods of the United States as far as owning actual land? (Not the property in said land)</p>

<p>Or am I reading it wrong? Truly, I&#39;m not sure so any explanation would be great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>American here,</p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain in the depths of my knowledge:</p>

<p>the situation is dire. By law, the communist ethno-nationalist government only allows percentile participation in occupations based on percentage of race.</p>

<p>This discriminates a lot of groups, not only &#39;whites&#39;.</p>

<p>The whites own and inherited the land via colonization and war, and civilization. </p>

<p>They are only legally entitled to 5% of that occupation though.</p>

<p>Therefore, the communist government has been trying to have individuals siezed the land through arguing linage to it. These are bantu people arguing they were there before boars. . . </p>

<p>They were given two options though.</p>

<p>Take money equal to the land value, or own the land.</p>

<p>only 3% decided to take the land.</p>

<p>This left hte government in more debt, in which 7.5 TIMES MORE people receive welfare than the majority white tax payer can afford.</p>

<p>So, the government is going broke with this policy.</p>

<p>This is why, you can see military scanners on these farm murderers, captured in security camera. It&#39;s a military operation by the communist government. </p>

<p>Further, this new seize the land which is against the UN, is the new effort in limiting whites to that 5% participation. </p>

<p>How I know so much/ So invested:</p>

<p>Met a girl in PTSD therapy, who I deeply felt for, who was invaded and rapped by these mobs.  Caused me to invest a lot of time into understanding Africa and the conditions of south Africa in particular.</p>

<p>AS FOR WHY IT&#39;S NOT TALKED ABOUT:</p>

<p>This is a question for Carrol quiggly and Anthony Sutton.  </p>

<p>Why did the Rhodsian dynasty get dropped by the anglo-american cause?</p>

<p>Literally, books of time needed to explain why the anglo-american west and Europe as a whole were driven to disregard and even destroy south Africa; they did not have a good reputation for their own actions, at a time. </p>
