       I never thought it would come to this in this country. People were afraid of hate from Trump and the conservatives and massive racism if he got elected, but what we are seeing is the same exact thing at an extreme level from liberals.
Don't be surprised if you see conservatives get blacklisted the same way they are in Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have seen it in Hollywood:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have seen it at google: Can't find the article now, but read it a few days ago that they are going through what conservative employees did to find any reason to fire them.

       Sure, but the liberals are going to the extreme. Antifa will kill you just because you are a conservative.

       Liberals also have more power and can ruin your life and the country at the same time.

       Depends where you live. In some places they are like California. We have a liberal government and the state is a complete disaster. We have tons of drugs, tons of gangs, tons of crimes, tons of homeless, some of the worst roads in the country, the highest taxes, etc...

       Yes, Liberalism is a mental disorder, and they love projecting their hate and vitriol on others. Insufferable people, they are, and people are fed up with their bullshit which causes them to get even more butt hurt and radicalized. Not good.

       You don't see how you're spreading hate? "Liberalism is a mental disorder". I don't agree with Trump supporters but I understand they're my fellow countrymen and they have different views from me. I don't hate on them unless they're being intentionally dishonest.

       Saying someone has a mental disorder is hateful, especially when there is evidence to back it up? Shit, I guess we should throw out all of psychology, because of hurt fee-fees and perceived "hate". Dude, I'm not saying to lock them up or some shit, I'm saying the have legit mental issues they should work on.

       If you think the government actually cares about you, you deserve free money/schooling, there are more than two genders, and a male can be a female, then... yes, you have a mental disorder, and should seek help. Just saying...

       I'd like to see all this psychology to back up your assertions. I'm sure you have plenty. Right?

       The government is supposed to be a "government of the people, by the people and for the people." ~The great "Republican" Abraham Lincoln.

       Why do you give a shit what other people want to do their bodies if it effects no one but them? Who gives a shit if someone's transgender? Or gay? I don't give two shits because it affects me in absolutely no way. I just believe people have the right to be happy as long as they aren't hurting anyone else. I believe that part may be in the Declaration of Independence. "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"
      </p>

       That also brings me to my argument for socialized healthcare. #Life. That's really my only argument I think it stands on its own as an "unalienable right".

        The true PTB, are immortals. They use humans to do their bidding on this plane, though. I think you need to re-think, research, and re-prioritize. They aren't going anywhere, and will cause another Great Deluge. The Cosmos are on our side, though...

       There are very old souls and very young souls. TPTB, are among the very old souls, with access to hidden knowledge. If you think that is crazy, then I highly suggest you research actual history. Some things to look into would be: Thoth, Hermes Trismegistus, and Pythagoras.
