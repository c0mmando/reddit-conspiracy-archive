People were afraid of hate from Trump and the conservatives and massive racism if he got elected, but what we are seeing is the same exact thing at an extreme level from liberals.
Don&#39;t be surprised if you see conservatives get blacklisted the same way they are in Hollywood. </p>

<p>We have seen it in Hollywood: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/09/27/tim-allen-thinks-conservative-politics-might-be-why-last-man-standing-got-canceled/?utm_term=.ce1c441aeaa3">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/09/27/tim-allen-thinks-conservative-politics-might-be-why-last-man-standing-got-canceled/?utm_term=.ce1c441aeaa3</a></p>

<p>We have seen it at google: Can&#39;t find the article now, but read it a few days ago that they are going through what conservative employees did to find any reason to fire them.</p>

<p>Its also happened in the UK: <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/uk-blacklist-workers-job-033/">https://www.rt.com/news/uk-blacklist-workers-job-033/</a>  and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/27/on-the-blacklist-building-firms-secret-information-on-workers">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/27/on-the-blacklist-building-firms-secret-information-on-workers</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about the government blacklisting you, I&#39;m talking about businesses and others doing it. Places of employment and other places, not the government.</p>

<p>Depends where you live. In some places they are like California. We have a liberal government and the state is a complete disaster. We have tons of drugs, tons of gangs, tons of crimes, tons of homeless, some of the worst roads in the country, the highest taxes, etc...</p>

<p>Why do you give a shit what other people want to do their bodies if it effects no one but them? Who gives a shit if someone&#39;s transgender? Or gay? I don&#39;t give two shits because it affects me in absolutely no way. I just believe people have the right to be happy as long as they aren&#39;t hurting anyone else. I believe that part may be in the Declaration of Independence. &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot; </p>
