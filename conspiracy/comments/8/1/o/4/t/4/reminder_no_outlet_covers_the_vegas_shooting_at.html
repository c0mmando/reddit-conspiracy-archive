    <div class="md"><p>You ever see a Vegas magic show?  They keep you looking at one thing while they move the tiger out of the cage.  So, keep looking for that footage.   Keep looking at it really hard -- that is exactly what they need to fool you.  (Hint:  The footage is a distraction that they are using to keep the focus off anything that really matters.  The reason they don&#39;t release it is to keep people focused on the footage.  By the time the footage is released, the real issues are gone.  It is just sad that so many &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; fall for this trick.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weren&#39;t the courts only given 30 days to release the camera footage they have from the shooting? That date must be fast approaching, I linked to an article in another post on this thread that mentioned they released more information on search warrants a few days ago, seems like they&#39;re dragging their feet with all the other information they were ordered to hand over. In other related news: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but i stood on the corner across from luxor at the gas station on the strip. There is a junction power box right on that corner, it was covered in streaky blood, there was drops randomly on the street. this was three days after everything took place and was as close as possible as we could get. The entire area was taped off and we walked all around it, no other signs of anything. This is a first hand account of what I saw. I do believe people died. I do believe many people were shot. I do not believe anything the media is telling us or the narrative pushed by the FBI. I do believe there is more than 1 shooter. I do believe that paddock is a fall guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree they are important issues but what is the objective of the las vegas shooting? Or the jfk assassination? Nothing will happen. The more pressing issues im tqlking about are the clear violations that are occuring at the peak of our government. Democrats and republicans alike. The clear push for our government to become (i personally already think it is) an oligarchy. The kock brothers have been and will keep pouring billions of dollars of dark money into our elections. Thise are the issues we should be talking about. The one media organization, correct me if im wrong, sinclair broqdcasting? Owning the majority of media companies. There are issues occuring right now. I mean it sounds shitty to say the jfk assassination doesnt matter, but the truth is there are issues that we can change. You can&#39;t change the past</p>

<p>Sort by &quot;Deaths.&quot;  See the top is listed as, &quot;Democrats resisted the joining of Opelousas African Americans into the political party and went on a hunt for African Americans, killing at least 200-300 African Americans and 30-50 Democrats.[27]&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder why they don&#39;t talk about that one? In any case, you see that CNN added the word &quot;modern&quot; which, I guess means that it doesn&#39;t apply to the &quot;old&quot; days in which blacks were massacred by the hundreds.  </p>

<p>The OP did not use the word &quot;modern&quot; and instead said all of US history.  In that context, it is not even close to the numerous mass slaughters that occurred in America&#39;s past.  It is disingenuous to discount things from the 1860&#39;s when you make a statement about history.  </p>

<p>Black population of Ocoee, a town near Orlando, was nearly obliterated during the 1920 election season.[7]</p>

<p>Same link as above.  You seem to discounts mass shooting when the victims are black and highlight them when the victims are white.  Is there a reason for this?  </p>

<p>In any case, if you don&#39;t want to include these, just change it from &quot;The largest mass shooting in US history&quot; to &quot;The largest mass shooting of white people in the US in the last 100 years.&quot;  One is fake news and the other is accurate.  You disagree? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but i stood on the corner across from luxor at the gas station on the strip. There is a junction power box right on that corner, it was covered in streaky blood, there was drops randomly on the street. this was three days after everything took place and was as close as possible as we could get. The entire area was taped off and we walked all around it, no other signs of anything. This is a first hand account of what I saw. I do believe people died. I do believe many people were shot. I do not believe anything the media is telling us or the narrative pushed by the FBI. I do believe there is more than 1 shooter. I do believe that paddock is a fall guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. Here&#39;s where my type of conspiracy theory comes into play: </p>

<p>I think that most agencies, for obvious reasons want to downplay their own faults, lack of preparedness, and misuse of tax money, etc. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t set up hundreds of people to die simply to take away their guns (which did not happen), nor did they want to see this happen. </p>

<p>They are unable to insure our security and it is economically disastrous to admit it. So they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Evil? Mostly. But not in the way that many here think. </p>
