       Please consider the Steem blockchain.  It is a decentralized ecosystem.  You see content you like?  You can upvote it.  The more steem you hold, more your upvote is worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has free, 3 second transactions.
It currently has more transactions per day than Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Monero COMBINED.  And all of these transactions are only using up 0.1% of its network's bandwidth.

       I keep hearing about duckduckgo, but I haven't done enough research on it to form a valid conclusion.  Another search engine I've heard about it is called

       It's still being built.

      <p>
       It has it's own currency and is built on the blockchain.  Still need to do more research on it to have a better grasp of it.

       I signed up for steemit awhile back, never have logged in since though. You have to actually purchase "steam" in order to vote, correct?

       Firstly, I would recommend reading their FAQ.  It is very helpful.
You can convert your steem into Steem power.  The more steem power you have, the larger your voting power is.  You don't have to purchase steem.  You can earn steem simply by posting threads or comments.  If people value your posts, you get upvoted and earn steem coins.  You can use those steem coins to "power" up.  Or you can exchange those coins into Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum.

       I read it a long time ago when I signed up (it was because of an offer they were advertising for at the time) and I had no clue how it worked lol. My memory has faded since then haha but thanks ! That actually sounds familiar, about gaining more steem by posting

       I know this is kind of an unrelated question, but it's something I've been really curious about over the last few months: why does each country have their own "internet"? Meaning, why does only U.S. websites/media come up when someone from the U.S. searches something? Same with Australia, Canada, China, etc.....why isn't it just 1 wide web where the most popular of content shows up in order on searches? This, to me is one of the biggest contributors to censorship online....... It segregates each countries "news".....if your not online in that country, your not going to get anything about breaking news and things like that from other countries..... Basically, leaving the rest of the world in the dark.

       It mostly does what I would expect from google drive - docs, sheets, even importing my calendar. Interface isn't too bad either. The android app could use some work though. Writer works on Android, sheets can be seen but not edited, calendar apparently needs their mail client to start on android too. I wish there was something better, but still not big corportation like google drive or Microaoft onenote/onedrive/office with sync capabilities.

       I started looking into Steemit the other day. At first I was excited -
 wow, a new and interesting platform. Then I read the actual content. It's a giant pay to win circlejerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       As well, if you did want to censor and propagandize people all you would need to do is pay for your opinions to mean more than others. How is that any better than what we have already?

       There are people out there who look out for the "good" of the system and flag posts.  Steemit isn't the only part of the ecosystem for the steem blockchain.  There's d.tube, dlive, dmania, dsound and plenty of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most interesting thing will be once they release their "smart media tokens" which will allow any content producing website to use the steem blockchain.  That protocol is coming very soon and I suggest you reading the "SMT whitepaper" for steem.

       So basically to create an equivalent version of a "youtube channel" you sign up on steemit.com and when you get approved you can log into your d.tube account and start uploading. By uploading and sharing content you earn coins and the more people like your content the more weight/power you have in the community because you have shown that you are sharing content that the community gives worth to.

       If someone wants to ensure their content is at the top, all you gotta do is pay for an account with high “steem”. It’s like karma. Except karma doesn’t have an affect on anything.

       Don’t think this is a good way to run a platform because
       <strong>
        people will see upvoting and downvoting more as a competition
       </strong>
       and want their posts high, which can also lead to more spam posts.

       Platforms like reddit, steemit, Wikipedia, etc are great for certain things. They're great for finding information in which the consensus is true. They're terrible for finding esoteric information that also happens to be true. Basically it's mob rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of those platforms are ever going to be satisfying to a conspiracy theorist, because most people believe conspiracies are untrue. That makes conspiracy theories less valuable than the consensus, and eventually they get buried. Basically they perpetuate and reinforce the public consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare that to an old fashioned encyclopedia, written and edited by experts. Or reading a book written by someone more knowledgeable than the average person. You might find accurate information that most people weren't aware of, so it's educational and progressive. It advances understanding. These platforms inherently reject information that's contrary to public opinion.

       Well my point is that the nature of social media and the internet are specifically designed so that you don't find unpopular or contrary opinions. That's the model of Google. The results are based on whatever everyone else deems to be true. Even without deliberate, overt censorship, the Google algorithm is designed to filter out those opinions. So are platforms like reddit and steemit. Let's say you go post an opinion on reddit that's absolutely true, but that most people disagree with or don't believe. It gets downvoted, while the opinion that everyone already agrees with gets upvoted. It's mental stagnation.

       The beauty of it is you can find people to follow.  If you think they post interesting content, upvote their stuff and follow them.  The next time they make a post, their post will show up in your feed; along with all the other people that you find interesting.  There are a lot of insightful people I've found on that platform.  Steemit is a blog, so it's pretty simple really; follow people you find interesting.  Filter the posts by appropriate "tags" which are akin to subreddits here.  I like to filter by "new" so I see the fresh stuff.

       That's a good point and that's one way around the mass consensus. Just like your Google profile will figure out you're a conspiracy theorist and start delivering results that other conspiracy theorists deem good results.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you still run into the same problem: it creates a bubble. Now let's say you've found the r/conspiracy subreddit, or a similar social circle on steemit or even a web forum. You still have the same problem. Let's say somebody introduces a new, controversial, contrary opinion that most of the conspiracy theorists disagree with. It gets downvoted and disappears. It defends itself from change and automatically puts down challenging, new information. It's like a debate in which the opposing side is automatically quelled. Every social media platform creates this kind of bubble for you, protecting you from opposing ideas.

       It's for spam purposes.  They don't want hundred of thousands of people signing up at once spamming the place.  Also for account verification.

       Let's just act like Reddit, Google, Amazon or whatever else you use is not collating your data.   A phone number they're using to verify that you're a real person makes you paranoid?  I hate to break it to you, maybe you shouldn't be using ANYTHING if you're that paranoid.  What are they going to do with your phone number, prank call you?  If it bothers you do that much use a burner or a google voice #.

       Dunno why you're so on the offence about it. It doesn't affect you, but trust me...

        When a product/service is free, then the

        is the product
       </strong>
       ... Facebook and Google and Apple all said "nah, we aren't collating your data" - Look at the facebook app in recent history to find out how much bullshit that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't try and tell me that reddit is only free because it is... Why do you think it's free...?! Christ, think for one second before going on a rampage about how "whatever else you use is not collating your data". That. Is. Unfounded. Retarded. Bullshit.

       Have you made money by posting on Reddit &amp; Facebook?  I've made money by posting on Steem.  See the difference there?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're collecting my phone number, so be it... It's not bothering me when I'm making money by simply posting..

       It's good that you're "paranoid", but I would advise you to research this platform more in-depth.  It's literally helping impoverished people in places like Africa, Venezuela etc; it's giving them opportunities they never had the MONETIZE would they encounter in life.  If you don't see that as a game-changer then I really don't know what else to say.  It continues to get more and more popular because people are fed up that websites like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Youtube are making money off them while the users are getting NOTHING in return.

       Firstly, I would recommend reading their FAQ.  It is very helpful.
You can convert your steem into Steem power.  The more steem power you have, the larger your voting power is.  You don't have to purchase steem.  You can earn steem simply by posting threads or comments.  If people value your posts, you get upvoted and earn steem coins.  You can use those steem coins to "power" up.  Or you can exchange those coins into Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum.
