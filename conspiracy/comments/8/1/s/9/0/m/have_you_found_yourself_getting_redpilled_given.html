    <div class="md"><p>Political Correctness is a conservative talking point phrase to stop the idea that we should speak respectfully, specifically in our institutions, not use dismissive racist, sexist, religious bigotry to advance ideas and achieve objectives.  </p>

<p>Political Correctness was used to demand the right to use words like nigger, whore, spic, etc.</p>

<p>The reason conservatism depends upon hate language to prosper is because hate and division and separation allow them to gain and maintain power. Not to mention those on the bottom. Humiliating and verbal abusing the poor and any designated minority to hate and discriminate against, flourishes best with daily constant humiliation that of course includes, speech to undermine and demean individuals and entire groups.  that is also necessary for a conservative economics, poor masses, being abused by the wealthy and powerful </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you’re saying and I have similar feelings, in a way. I’m a twenty-four year old gay man. In early “young adulthood,” of course I considered myself a liberal. Now I don’t identify because both sides are radicalized and falling victim to group-think, becoming vehicles for TPTB to push their agendas and sew discord.</p>

<p>People take politics way too seriously. I know what I believe is right and don’t expect anyone to agree with me. Healthy discussion/debate? I’m all for it, but no one really wants that these days. They just unknowingly fulfill their roles as mouthpieces, blindly accepting what reinforces their manipulated worldview and being generally annoying, standoffish, and intolerant of varying opinions. Ew, I hate it.</p>

<p>Also, I agree with a previous comment. This isn’t liberalism, it’s totalitarianism on both sides. Both liberal and conservative are really just buzzwords that have been turned into blanket terms for “the other” based on how you identify. It purposefully eliminates the middle ground, which is where any actually intelligent/sane critical-thinker sits.</p>

<p>When I first started coming to this sub, I happened upon a comment from a user that said they steer clear of people who identify with groups because they’re usually misled, uninformed... Crazy... Lol. It stuck with me because it really is the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if you are using the old traditional definition of liberal, or the conservative think tank created liberal. </p>

<p>One is real, one is a created talking point lie to use for political attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When shouting down meaningful conversation about social issues and policies gave way to shouting matches and destruction of property started being considered a quality to be admired, it began to make me feel like free speech was under attack. Berkeley riots were a turning point for me and I&#39;m seeing the same formula playing out just about everywhere.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re someone who feels like all speech should be defended because of how you interprate the 1st amendment, then you&#39;re a Nazi sympathizer. If you&#39;re someone who opposes certain restrictions on guns and choose to support the NRA because of how you interprate the 2nd amendment, you&#39;re a heartless monster that wants to see minorities and children continue to be killed by psychopaths. If you want border control and immigration reforms, you&#39;re a racist.</p>

<p>The growing perception is that there can no longer be a middle; that there can no longer be measured debate on today&#39;s most important issues because it doesn&#39;t get the results certain groups are demanding <em>soon enough</em>. </p>

<p>Instead of allowing the system we&#39;ve had since the dawn of our country to run it&#39;s process, it&#39;s all about press-gangs now. If you aren&#39;t part of the solution you&#39;re part of the problem. You&#39;re either an ally or an enemy and every tactic is valid so long as the government isn&#39;t the entity applying the pressure. People will post flyers with your personal information all over town, doxx you on social media, call your job and pressure them to disassociate themselves with you, and harass your friends and family both publically and privately. Obviously &#39;shaming&#39; has been something that has occurred forever, but social media has made it far more than simply a force to be reckoned with - it&#39;s become a weapon if mass-destruction, with populist bandwagons that are simultaneously attractive to join, if only to avoid being dragged under it&#39;s wheels.</p>

<p>There has been a major shift toward tribalism in this country. I think that anyone who denies this being willfully naive. The more we slide toward mob rule, the harder it will be to see what is actually going on in American&#39;s minds when the cost for speaking your mind may be the loss of everything you hold dear. You might still dissenting opinions come out at the ballot box, but I predict that sooner or later public voting logs will be leaked in some manner that exposes the general public&#39;s voting habits and then we&#39;ll <em>really</em> be fucked. </p>
