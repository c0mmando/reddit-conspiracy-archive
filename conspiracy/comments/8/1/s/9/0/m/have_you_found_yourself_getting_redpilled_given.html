       Two years ago, I would've described myself as a liberal. After doing some in-depth reading and research (something the left doesn't do much), I almost completely changed my position. I don't know whether this is a reaction to radical leftism which is sweeping the globe or whether I'm truly leaning towards conservative values...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's probably a mixture of the two.

       You need to withdraw yourself from identifying your political orientation with an ideology. It's rather conformists, and will often help dictate your view on matters you're yet to decide on.

       View every matter seperately - and find out where you stand instead.

       Agreed. It's hard to steer clear from ideologies. I think many people have resorted to ideologies as a way to combat another ideology. I think we're in a very critical moment in History. How do you win an idea war with very aggressive, close-minded people if you don't adopt the same methods?

       I also did not read many books until recently. I love finding histories published 1900-1950s and reading how most people were quite decent and kind-hearted...rather than EVERYONE WAS RACIS!!!! or Machiavellian, or unsophisticated and brutish

       Maybe it has to do with this old saying:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If You Are Not a Liberal at 25, You Have No Heart. If You Are Not a Conservative at 35 You Have No Brain
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe!? IDK, but I'm a mix of both, so It's hard for me to gauge.  I think I'm still against the same concepts from when I was young but for different reasons now.

       We'll start with political correctness. This wasn't relevant until maybe five years ago. Everywhere I go, there is leftist agenda. Can't even use snapchat without seeing leftist political agenda. I don't see alternative viewpoints. Youtube videos getting demonitized left and right too.

       No, dear. My principles have become more right-leaning. Freedom of speech, power to the people, free market, limited government, etc. And this change was prompted by seeing that censorship and cultural Marxism have become pervasive issues.

       Both right and left are for freedom of speech. Yeah the left is gonna get mad when somebody says something racially insensitive or demeaning to gay people or women. But the the right freaked the fuck out when our football players knelt during the anthem. I seem to remember conservatives freaking out over some shit Obama's pastor said too. So that kinda goes both ways.

       You still might be Democrat without being liberal. I have a niece that, because of labels and ideologies and all that, I call a JFK Democrat.

       As if political correctness is isolated to the left. How much time on the right has been wasted with people complaining about being offended by "the we on Christma."  At least the left doesn't try to strip people's rights away because their offended.  The right can't handle two dudes getting married and having sex so they want to deny them the right to marry. Seems pretty stupid to me.

       Political Correctness is a conservative talking point phrase to stop the idea that we should speak respectfully, specifically in our institutions, not use dismissive racist, sexist, religious bigotry to advance ideas and achieve objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political Correctness was used to demand the right to use words like nigger, whore, spic, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason conservatism depends upon hate language to prosper is because hate and division and separation allow them to gain and maintain power. Not to mention those on the bottom. Humiliating and verbal abusing the poor and any designated minority to hate and discriminate against, flourishes best with daily constant humiliation that of course includes, speech to undermine and demean individuals and entire groups.  that is also necessary for a conservative economics, poor masses, being abused by the wealthy and powerful

       The left/right dichotomy as a team to cheer for will always be the same until we decide as citizens to be better informed about the people we trust with our future.  Until we recognize broadly that the game is, has, and will continue to be rigged by the monied powers that be for their benefit and make the conscious and uncomfortable choice to blow up the established oligarchy/plutocracy that has been founded in the years since WWII, than yes, our political atmosphere is just a devicive distraction for the masses.  The real work of hollowing out the rights and solidifying monopolies of every plebeian, regardless of who you voted for, continues on unhampered.

       I've had the same realization.  The things that I didn't really question as a liberal,  just went along with because it seemed like the "right" thing to do. It's crazy how when issues are stuffed down your throat and forced upon you,  you suddenly break or if the spell and see things for how they really are.  Agendas are real and are set upon us daily.

       I understand what you’re saying and I have similar feelings, in a way. I’m a twenty-four year old gay man. In early “young adulthood,” of course I considered myself a liberal. Now I don’t identify because both sides are radicalized and falling victim to group-think, becoming vehicles for TPTB to push their agendas and sew discord.
      </p>
      <p>
       People take politics way too seriously. I know what I believe is right and don’t expect anyone to agree with me. Healthy discussion/debate? I’m all for it, but no one really wants that these days. They just unknowingly fulfill their roles as mouthpieces, blindly accepting what reinforces their manipulated worldview and being generally annoying, standoffish, and intolerant of varying opinions. Ew, I hate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I agree with a previous comment. This isn’t liberalism, it’s totalitarianism on both sides. Both liberal and conservative are really just buzzwords that have been turned into blanket terms for “the other” based on how you identify. It purposefully eliminates the middle ground, which is where any actually intelligent/sane critical-thinker sits.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first started coming to this sub, I happened upon a comment from a user that said they steer clear of people who identify with groups because they’re usually misled, uninformed... Crazy... Lol. It stuck with me because it really is the truth.

       When shouting down meaningful conversation about social issues and policies gave way to shouting matches and destruction of property started being considered a quality to be admired, it began to make me feel like free speech was under attack. Berkeley riots were a turning point for me and I'm seeing the same formula playing out just about everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're someone who feels like all speech should be defended because of how you interprate the 1st amendment, then you're a Nazi sympathizer. If you're someone who opposes certain restrictions on guns and choose to support the NRA because of how you interprate the 2nd amendment, you're a heartless monster that wants to see minorities and children continue to be killed by psychopaths. If you want border control and immigration reforms, you're a racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The growing perception is that there can no longer be a middle; that there can no longer be measured debate on today's most important issues because it doesn't get the results certain groups are demanding

       Instead of allowing the system we've had since the dawn of our country to run it's process, it's all about press-gangs now. If you aren't part of the solution you're part of the problem. You're either an ally or an enemy and every tactic is valid so long as the government isn't the entity applying the pressure. People will post flyers with your personal information all over town, doxx you on social media, call your job and pressure them to disassociate themselves with you, and harass your friends and family both publically and privately. Obviously 'shaming' has been something that has occurred forever, but social media has made it far more than simply a force to be reckoned with - it's become a weapon if mass-destruction, with populist bandwagons that are simultaneously attractive to join, if only to avoid being dragged under it's wheels.
      </p>

       There has been a major shift toward tribalism in this country. I think that anyone who denies this being willfully naive. The more we slide toward mob rule, the harder it will be to see what is actually going on in American's minds when the cost for speaking your mind may be the loss of everything you hold dear. You might still dissenting opinions come out at the ballot box, but I predict that sooner or later public voting logs will be leaked in some manner that exposes the general public's voting habits and then we'll
