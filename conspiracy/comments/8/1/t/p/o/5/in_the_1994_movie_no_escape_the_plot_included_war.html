    <div class="md"><p>i was looking into something else the other day and watched a video talking about gaddafis massive plan to bring water to the desert. and was surprised how i had never heard of it before.   seems to me TPTB have had to get rid of him for decades now.   which explains why here in the uk he was trashed as being a terrorist since i was a kid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Libya didn&#39;t just come outta nowhere. There were problems for decades, and the US wanted to fuck shit up there long before we finally went in and destroyed it. It&#39;s not like they were waiting for the time predicted by a shit movie though. </p>

<p>The real conspiracy here is the propaganda released in 1994 that was meant to see Libya as an enemy. But even that goes further back than that. I know Back to the Future uses Libya as the country of origin for the terrorists that Doc promised to build a bomb for. Hollywood has done this kind of propaganda for decades, subtly encouraging fear/hated of the other in preparation for warfare, not to mention overt praise and support for American military might. For example, consider the 2012 remake of Red Dawn. In the original fion, Russia was the enemy, but in 2012, they wanted us thinking of China as the enemy and they changed the movie to reflect that. But just 6 years after that movie came out, now they want us scared of Russia again. It&#39;s all bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points.  Correction the remake used North Korea as the invading force (changed from China). Which is pretty laughable on its own.</p>
