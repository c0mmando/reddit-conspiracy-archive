<p>&quot;Guess the frogs weren&#39;t gay after all&quot;  </p>

<p>My reply-I do not support the jones in anyway, an usually try to stay away from the gay frog thing. But <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100301151927.htm">this</a> may be where he got it from. An being the sensationalist he is, had to make it bigger than it is to sell more snake oil. </p>

<p>I checked back on that one to see how it was received. Not in my post history. Check the comments it is there. Maybe it is me. So i deleted that one and re posted it as a stand alone comment instead of replying to someone. Not in my comment history. I feel like both my comments were deleted so no one could read them. I may be wrong, but here are more links that while not gay. Chemicals can change the dna of a species apparently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s true, then why is Youtube censoring his videos? I&#39;ve seen a lot of people claiming that Youtube/Google are deep state projects and similar claims.

<p>Could it be that Jones is just on the nutty side? There is no need to invoke a conspiracy about gatekeeping, especially when it conflicts with the claims that Youtube is deep state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compartmentalization ensures that the folks at GoogTube don&#39;t know that AJ is a state agent. Heck, most Google employees don&#39;t know our recognize their company&#39;s role in the deep state. </p>

<p>As far as Infowars goes, all press is good press. Their purpose is to distract and divide which is exactly what this does. If we wait a while, we&#39;ll see if the censoring even lasts. Since they&#39;re Cointelpro, the new YT content rules might even make it easier for them to skip certain topics and control the narrative on others. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, there are plenty of videos where you can see AJ deliberately scuttle events that he agrees with, hear him talk about his CIA family, and see his suspiciously massive studio and operation. You can read more online about his family CIA connections, the people he works with, and other various suspicious activities. The very fact that he&#39;s alive and successful given the stuff he talks about shows that he&#39;s in cahoots with the government. I used to think he was controlled opposition but after some investigation, it&#39;s clear he&#39;s pretty of secret government disinfo operations. </p>

<p>The point is we all have known certain frogs change sex, since the 1990s, because that movie made a lot of us aware.  Changing sex does not equal gay.  They&#39;re not going in for sex reassignment surgery.  Nature is taking its course and changing them.</p>

I grew up in a rural area, plenty of strained, glyphosate, etc.  My sister did a study which showed very high correlation between the enormous cancer rates there and nitrogen in groundwater from decades of fetilizer use.   Something as simple and innocuous as nitrogen becomes a problem when it&#39;s used on an industrial scale.</p>

<p>Not to mention a lot of talk about heavy metals like cadmium being disposed of in liquid fertilizer.  Supposedly cattle had symptoms from eating contaminated corn, not sure if that is passed on to humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people to this day are surprised that there was a grain of truth to Jones&#39; sensationalist segment about gay frogs. I think some people are shocked because they assumed that it went viral because they thought Jones completely pulled the claim out of his ass. </p>

<p>The pesticide Atrazine doesn&#39;t &quot;make frogs gay,&quot; but it changes male frogs into females (still genetically male) who then mate with other males. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The herbicide atrazine, one of the world&#39;s most widely used pesticides, wreaks havoc with the sex lives of adult male frogs, emasculating three-quarters of them and turning one in 10 into females, according to a new study. These changes occur at atrazine levels below what the EPA considers safe for drinking water. The changes skew sex ratios in the frog population and could be a major cause of amphibian decline worldwide. </p>

<p>An atrazine-induced female frog (a genetic male) is shown (bottom) copulating with an unexposed male sibling. This union produced viable eggs and larvae that survived to metamorphosis and adulthood. Yet, because both animals were genetic males, the offspring were all males.</p>

<p>The 75 percent that are chemically castrated are essentially &quot;dead&quot; because of their inability to reproduce in the wild, reports UC Berkeley&#39;s Tyrone B. Hayes, professor of integrative biology.</p>

<p>&quot;These male frogs are missing testosterone and all the things that testosterone controls, including sperm. So their fertility is as low as 10 percent in some cases, and that is only if we isolate those animals and pair them with females,&quot; he said. &quot;In an environment where they are competing with unexposed animals, they have zero chance of reproducing.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because you have to comb through all his sensationalist bullshit, lame product pitches, obnoxious yelling and incoherent rants to find the truth in what he&#39;s saying. Conspiracy theorists have a hard enough time getting people to take them seriously. He turns serious topics into a circus so he deserves all the scrutiny he gets. It&#39;s honestly a shame because he talks about some really important shit. I&#39;ve always said he needs a side kick like all the talk show hosts have. Somebody to keep him on track when he&#39;s spinning out of control. If only we could have got him and Joe Rogan (old JR) together on a show years ago. That could have been something special. Their podcast with Eddie Bravo was great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not corporate bought, but rather a government agent. Video quality aside, you can watch him deliberately scuttle events that he agrees with, hear him talk about his CIA family, and see his suspiciously massive studio and operation. You can read more online about his family CIA connections, the people he works with, and other various suspicious activities. The very fact that he&#39;s alive and successful given the stuff he talks about shows that he&#39;s in cahoots with the government. I used to think he was controlled opposition but after some investigation, it&#39;s clear he&#39;s pretty of our fascist secret government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the thought has crossed my mind as well. Do you ever watch him and just get overly frustrated? Like it takes him 10 minutes to get his point across when it would have just taken 2 minutes if he formed a coherent sentence and gave us the information like a normal human. After all these years, nobody has offered him guidance or advice to help him appear more credible and less annoying? To a certain extent it <em>must</em> be intentional which begs the question: why? Either he&#39;s really milking the cooky tinfoil hat guy persona because he thinks that&#39;s what gets him views, or theres some other strategy involved.

<p>it is an actual thing that is happening and should worry people</p>

<p>sadly alex jones may have some truth but he muddies whatever clean water he may have well..ironically with his water filter, pills, and other things...because SOME of those DON&#39;T work, and well, you lose credibility, and when you don&#39;t go back and edit your statements or release a new statement saying you were wrong for something in the past, i mean yeah he&#39;s been right a lot, but he needs to approach his audience from a different approach than the fear mongering tactics we usually see on CNN, especially during war time</p>

<p>i personally believe he&#39;s been contacted before by the powers that be, and that&#39;s when he ramped it up to kooky level 11, to throw it off as he&#39;s just a &quot;showsman&quot; , he even did the same with his divorce/lawsuit thing, his lawyer tried to make it seem like he was a acting a &quot;character&quot; alex jones<br/>

<p>I agree with this. He is a beginners cnn, I found him many years ago while looking into 9/11 An at first I thought yeah, then after a few days on his site seeing the articles an comment sections something did not feel right. I got the honeytrap feeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atrazine is just the tip of the iceberg, there are many more. A female has developed  the biological brain patterns to find a male &#39;attractive&#39; because of the hormone balance and vice versa for a male. Guess what happens when they are interfered with?</p>
